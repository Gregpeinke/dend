There are so many of these and still developers make more. So what makes Killing Floor stand out?\n First, the setting. All levels are in England, and the voice acting is in a London accent which really helps bring that over, with the added bonus of it being hilarious! This could probably change in DLC but I have yet to play with any of that.\n Second, the music. All the background music really helps to get the blood pumping and it fits in with the game really well to create the atmosphere. It sounds sort of like Korn but the original music was actually composed by zYnthetic and Dirge.\nI think Killing Floor is great for fans of Resident Evil or Team Fortress 2 because it is a FPS with zombies. The class selection is called Perks; such as Firebug - similar to Pyro in TF2. I really like how you can level up the perks just by buying and using the weapons suitable for them - for example with Field Medic you level up by healing other players.\nThe maps work by you facing zombie hordes in waves, and at the end of each wave the trader appears for you to buy items with the money you collect in-game, and at the very end of the waves you face the boss: The Patriarch.\nThe most important part of the Killing Floor is that a successful team will be more likely to prevail - without working together then basically you die a lot.\nOverall, I think it is a fantastic game!","timestamp_created":1406137834,"timestamp_updated":1406137834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11378869","author":{"steamid":"76561198004044400","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7022,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6828,"last_played":1428821901},"language":"russian","review":"LOUDS OF MONEY YOU BLOODY WANKER","timestamp_created":1406137201,"timestamp_updated":1406137201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486088395118713379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11377737","author":{"steamid":"76561198059525827","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1122,"last_played":1551951546},"language":"french","review":"Killing Floor est l'un des meilleurs jeux survival horror, pour moi.

This game is a must-have if you prefer collaboration more than competition, and here is my wall of text explaining why. \n\n\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nFirst off, this game controls well. Everything does what you'd expect it to do, which seems a bit obvious, but it's an important foundation for a game to have. Plus, it has a quick-switch function (like Counter Strike), which is always good to have. There are some strange button mappings, such as caps lock being for voice chat, and \\ for dropping your weapon (though these are all fully customizable). The inventory system seems a bit weird as well - you have 5 or so slots for different weapon types (think Half-Life), but what each weapon is categorized seems a bit arbitrary - for example, why is the single-shot M79 in a different slot than the six-shot M32? I mean, it's not game-breaking and a player will get used to it of course, but it can make certain loadouts a pain to use (I often play as Medic with two mediguns and the ZED MKII, which are all mapped to the same inventory slot, which ultimately makes the entire system kind of pointless).\n\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nI think that this is one of the most important parts of any game, and it's something that Tripwire Interactive have done very well. Killing Floor has a large variety of play styles, starting with 7 different classes (\"Perks\") to choose from. Each class has its own unique way of disposing of mutant scum - for example, although Scrakes can be taken down by just about any class (given enough time), the task should be left up to single-target, high-damage classes like the Berserker and Sharpshooter, both of which possess unique abilities that allow them to fit that role perfectly (such as Berserkers being able to stun-lock Scrakes, making them unable to attack the player while they rip it to shreds). The classes level up with time, too, and each advancement grants the player perks that basically make them better at what they do. So, the more you play a class and learn about what role they fill, you'll be rewarded with a greater ability to fill it - a relationship that I think works extremely well to make progression enjoyable and exciting. \nAnd this is only the perks. \n\nI haven't even talked about the weapons yet. \nBasically, there are a lot of them. But unlike a lot of other FPSs out there, every weapon serves a specific purpose, and is meant to accommodate a particular play style. For example, a Sharpshooter (whose entire strategy hinges on the fact that they do a ton of damage with headshots) has a Crossbow, several pistols, the M14EBR (a semi-auto, scopeless rifle), and the M99 (an extremely powerful anti-material rifle) at his/her disposal. The crossbow is really the only one that allows for long-range sniping and can instakill a Scrake at certain difficulty levels, but is hindered by slow-moving projectiles and a single-round capacity. The M14 is a close-range weapon that swaps long-range accuracy with fast, reasonably powerful fire, and includes a laser sight to further solidify its CQC role. The M99 is one of the most powerful weapons in the game, but has enormous recoil, single-round capacity (it doesn't come with a magazine, so each round is loaded into the chamber directly, which I just find really clever - if there's one thing Tripwire knows, it's guns), and takes up a huge amount of inventory space. It's basically designed to be used against the boss at the end of each game, the Patriarch. The pistols range from the powerful but clunky Handcannon to the weaker MK23 with its accurate, glowing night sights. And this is just one class - there are 6 others, some with even more variety than this. \n\nI do want to go ahead and mention that there are a few glitches present in the game (which probably won't get patched out, considering that KF2 is on the horizon). These aren't anything game-breaking, just annoying things like not being able to buy things with exact cash, or medigun darts not always healing. \n\n\n\n[h1]Music and Visuals[/h1]\nWell, it's a game made on the Unreal Engine, so you know it's gonna look pretty good. The important question to ask is if the sounds follow suit?\nThankfully, they do. The soundtrack is Metal, Industral, and DnB, which is another way of saying that it's kickass. The sound design is high quality, with realistic environment sounds and gunshots that feel powerful and rewarding. Also, every gun makes a distinct sound, which admittedly isn't particularly realistic but is something that I think gives a particular character to each weapon. Also, the voice work is very British and very entertaining. \n\n\n\n[h1]The Bottom Line[/h1] \nThis game is fun. I love this game. But there's only so much that you can glean from a review - If this game sounds remotely like something that you'd be interested in, I recommend picking it up and trying it for yourself. It goes on sale quite often, so you should be able to pick it up for $5 pretty easily. The online community is pretty chill, so feel free to jump in whenever. Don't be intimidated by the amount of depth that this game has - you can play through the Beginner and Normal difficulty modes easily enough without knowing anything about your class. \n\n9/10\nGreat game, but I can't give it a perfect 10, considering some of the annoying bugs that are still present.","timestamp_created":1406131547,"timestamp_updated":1406131583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11376665","author":{"steamid":"76561198118757220","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":313,"last_played":1482608748},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень крутая, даже когда играешь без друзей все очень интересно.

Some people find it sort of repetitive but I find that to be some of its appeal. Something very satisfiying about laying waste to wave after wave of undead/mutants. Casual or hardcore it has something for you. Jump in and out of games as you wish and blow stuff up and mow down enemies. Or if your into developing a class or leveling up you can really get into all the dynamics the game has to offer. Such as some classes can only see cloaked enemies or some classes handle large groups of enemies better than others or even classes that can bring down the big ones with only a few shots. Also relying on others is key, I find just being good at a game by myself can be fun but its even harder to work as a team and feels that much better when you manage a win and share that experience. Killing floor also has a unique sense of humor and often has special events around different times of the year, Xmas, Halloween, Summer etc. So if you want something to sink your teeth into but you find yourself to busy to really invest time into a game this one is for you at the same time if you put 40+ hours a week into games you will also find KF very rewarding.","timestamp_created":1405887353,"timestamp_updated":1413603271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11336968","author":{"steamid":"76561198083927820","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":3591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2412,"last_played":1486944870},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo é ótimo, jogar sozinho é chatinho, mais quando é com amigos, não da vontade de parar, bastante mapas, quando enjoa você pode baixar mods, as DLC's são ótimas e não tenho mais nada a declarar.

This game is special. Special in eating your time like any other game. \nHow to play:\n1.Shoot \n2.Buy guns\nRepeat till you die or win a game.\n\nNow honestly i dont have that many hours played on this game, but i can tell something about it. There are around 50 weapons in the game available: Starting with knife ending on few types of grenade launchers (Katana also included !). All of the weapons have their good and bad sides, but mostly their purpose is simple= blow the fuck out of monsters. \nIn Killing Floor you can choose one from few available perks and get special bonuses connected with them. You can also level them up to increase those bonuses(Yeah it will take some time).\nYou can be:\nSharpshooter- a guy killing efectively single targets,\nCommando -running around with assault rifles with special vision on invisible targets\nSupport Specialist- ever tried a shotgun in close corridor ? you should\nBerserker- Swinging your machette/fireaxe/chainsaw whatever, just causing havok\nFirebug- Flamethrower is fun. It really is. \nDemolitions- my personal favourite. Ever wanted to get yourself a BIG gun ? Well, you found your perk.\nMedic- harder armor, submachine guns and ability to heal teammates with special grenades effectively. \n\nSomething about monsters:\nClots- every single one worth 7 dollars. Thats all i can say about that meat. Nothing special.\nGorefeasts- Pain in the ass, especialy when in group that surround you in matter of seconds.\nCrawlers- not the strongest, to be honest really weak. But you will hate them for jumping around.\nSirens- Well and you thought your girlfriend can scream loud ? Better check out the Siren. But keep your distance.\nHusks- its like muscular version of Clot. Did i mention a rocket launcher on his arm ?\nScrake- ,,yes, that is a chainsaw he is carrying''.\nFleshpound- I wish you not having fist fight with this guy. Or 3 of them.\nAnd finally our beloved Patriach- rocket launcher, mini gun, REALLY HARD punch that most of the times kills you instantly, if you are lucky it just shreds your armor and leaves you with 1 hp, and invisibility while healing. Thats what i call a boss.\n\nI strongly recommend playing solo all objective games before going into real killing floor. And dont even try beginner, you will not learn anything that way. Leave normal for low people, you want to be good at this game, right ? Play every game on HARD difficulty, thats how you learn to blow shit up.\n\nAlso there are some DLC packs for the game. Skins, skins for guns and one thing i dont like. Special weapons. That shouldnt work that way. Overall game is good, but i would delete that. \n\n9/10\n","timestamp_created":1405880076,"timestamp_updated":1405880076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540069699287414551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11335733","author":{"steamid":"76561198144764072","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3,"last_played":1439658154},"language":"english","review":"fun game","timestamp_created":1405878732,"timestamp_updated":1405878732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11334549","author":{"steamid":"76561198040463440","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":14290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8344,"last_played":1633644402},"language":"brazilian","review":"Poor performance on ubuntu 14.04, Catalyst 14.4 driver.","timestamp_created":1405873135,"timestamp_updated":1405873135,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11334022","author":{"steamid":"76561198089870440","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8271,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3863,"last_played":1601325006},"language":"german","review":"Ein richtig geiles spiel wenn ihr liebt zombies abzuballern und mit freunden zu zocken :)","timestamp_created":1405870593,"timestamp_updated":1405870593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11333906","author":{"steamid":"76561198136544767","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1428766954},"language":"russian","review":"Killing Floor (полное название Killing Floor: Co-Op Survival Horror) — компьютерная игра, кооперативный шутер от первого лица в жанре survival horror[3][4], разработанный компанией Tripwire Interactive и выпущенный 14 мая 2009 года под Microsoft Windows.

Polecam tę grę, którą można dostać dosłownie za parę złotych, a można się przy niej lepiej bawić niż przy produktach AAA :)","timestamp_created":1405840622,"timestamp_updated":1405840622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11328632","author":{"steamid":"76561197966433404","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1723,"last_played":1501325713},"language":"english","review":"Splended Game Knocks Your Socks Off, What Can I Say Huh, The Game Kicks Some Ass, Now Go Back And Sit Down","timestamp_created":1405837189,"timestamp_updated":1405837189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11328557","author":{"steamid":"76561197972468693","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1962,"last_played":1626010006},"language":"english","review":"Too..\n\nMany..\n\nDLCs...","timestamp_created":1405836654,"timestamp_updated":1405836654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11328510","author":{"steamid":"76561198094106987","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":18,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1405835918},"language":"russian","review":"МЯСНАЯ ЛАВКА!!!!Поиграв с друзьями я смог настрелять дичи на целый год!Игра командная (пробовал одиночку),если хотите тупо оторваться с друзьями- она для вас!!!","timestamp_created":1405836399,"timestamp_updated":1405836399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11328322","author":{"steamid":"76561198040940571","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2227,"last_played":1500190694},"language":"english","review":"I recommend the game easily, theres just one problem - the realod mechanic tends to be the reason you die.

If I had to compares other games to it, it would be a combonation of Nazi CoD Zombies and Resident Evil. A FPS horror survival, this game feals good to even the newest of players.\n\nLearning Curve:\nNew players will pick up this game looking for a FPS or survival horror, but they will get an interesting experinece that will most likely bring them back for more. When first starting up, players may be overwhelmed with the sheer amount of content; however, that will only last about 15 minutes. After that time, players will gain the ability to actually play the game with some logic. Although new players may be playing, to become good you must invest to gain the skill required to advance through the higher levels. New players at the very beginning are sometimes treated poorly, and they will probably hold a team down until they level a class.\n\nGameplay/Graphics:\nThe game feels great for most FPS and survival players, the elements of the game are simple enough for a player to grab a gun and have a fun time shooting off mutant heads. The varied guns, maps, and startegies feel very satisfying to use and play. If something is too strong or too weak, the developers quickly fix it (rarely occurs, main changes include models). Now from there, the graphics are relatively easy to run, i have an average setup for a gamer and it runs perfectly fine, but if someone with low settings decides to run KF they run the risk of performance issues. The actually models are very good from a distance, but some of them up close are pixelated (some are fixed with IG settings).\n\nStory:\nA relatively simple story is all that is apparent on the surface of Killing Floor. A company that experiments with genetic mutations loses subjects and infections run rampant over the world, mainly England. This story is very basic and is somewhat lacking in great detail, but people may try to complicate this story with stories and analysis. I have not had much experience in the story, but to me (I may be wrong on this) the story is rather lacking and needs more sustanence.\n\nConclusion:\nKilling Floor is a solid game that combines strong gameplay with good graphics and a lacking story. Although it has its flaws, (pointed out earlier) KF focuses on strong gameplay elements to give a satisfying gameplay experience. Overall, KF, I believe, deserves a good: 8.25/10.","timestamp_created":1405824395,"timestamp_updated":1405824395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11326306","author":{"steamid":"76561198134820892","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1213,"last_played":1414643852},"language":"english","review":"Great Game!
