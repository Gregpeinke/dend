My character, having recently pulled himself up to a lighthouse after a plane crash into the ocean, finds a bathysphere, where a recording welcomes him to Rapture, presenting a magnificent, detailed cityscape at the bottom of the ocean. The awe provided by seeing something so expertly presented or crafted, for me, was like hearing a song I instantly knew would become a favorite or trying a food I instantly realized I would remember the taste of. It was a moment where, as soon as it was over, I realized would later bring nostalgia, and my entire experience would be painted by this one moment.\n\nMy first couple of hours of Bioshock Infinite did not give me this feeling. It had beautiful moments, sure. Walking through the water-filled church as a choir sang \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\" filled me with a sort of reverence rare in video games, but nothing struck me as a moment I would instantly remember at the mere mention of the game.\n\nAnd then I met Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth has never seen the world outside her tower, guarded by a frightening beast, like a fairy tale princess. Elizabeth is talented at art and codebreaking and lockpicking (as a 19 year-old girl constantly attempting to escape a tower might be) and is well-read in history, physics, geography, the works. Elizabeth loves music. Elizabeth wants to see Paris. Sheltered from the world her entire life, Elizabeth sees only opportunity outside the windows of her tower.\n\nAnd then one day, she's out, and not ten minutes later she's on a beach (yes, a beach for a city in the sky, and yes, it's as unreal and beautiful as that sounds), and she's dancing to music, and she's talking to people, and \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" begins playing on the boardwalk's carnival organ. I spent a good portion of time walking about and down the small beach enjoying what, for one girl, must be the most exciting, joyful moment of her life. The moment came rushing in. \n\nThat's all I wanted to say. Seriously, just play this game. I'm feeling nostalgic enough I might play a bit myself.","timestamp_created":1379013156,"timestamp_updated":1451948171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2386314","author":{"steamid":"76561198006636652","num_games_owned":2208,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":1127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1127,"last_played":1377704459},"language":"english","review":"Sexy game.

Though there are very few pointers in terms of advanced combat (other than \"point here shoot here\"), once you realise there are more to vigors than meets the eye, every firefight feels immensly satisfying.\n\nThe graphics are stunning and the environments are beautiful, and the distinct steampunk-y feel never goes away, and yet is never overdone - the designers have created a world that is both highly fictional, and yet believable - the only aspect that detracts from the design is some of the character animation, which, on occasion, can seem a little robotic.\n\nLastly, if you've heard anything about the plot before you start, the game is instantly ruined - it's an experience from start to end that is constantly throwing new surprises at you, and while both the plot and the gameplay will keep you engrossed, any mention of any spoiler will take away from that.

Unfortunately for me, rarely comes the chance when I get to sample this fine Riesling. For when I am fortunate enough to come across a bottle, I make sure to savor the complexities and flavors of every sip, taking care not to squander a single moment of my brief time in heaven. When playing Bioshock Infinite, I implore you to not squander a single moment of your time spent in Columbia. Savor every moment and take the time to appreciate the intricacies and the details of the world around you. Very rarely does a game of this caliber come along bearing such a high degree of uniqueness. Ken Levine and his team over at Irrational have succeeded in creating nothing short of a masterpiece. From the genuinely fun combat, to wandering Columbia’s streets and unveiling the city’s dystopian nature, Bioshock Infinite is a game that delivers on all fronts. By paying close attention to the details, you will be left with an immensely satisfying story that will leave the game stuck in your head long after the credits have rolled.","timestamp_created":1377200103,"timestamp_updated":1377200103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":78,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.648481130599975586","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4098223","author":{"steamid":"76561198032021010","num_games_owned":1296,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":845,"last_played":1387081125},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely fantastic!!!
