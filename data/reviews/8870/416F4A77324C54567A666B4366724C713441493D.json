I loved the ending.\n\nIt's different than the previous 2 instalments. You're no longer in a closed dark space, the world is brighter and more open. You don't carry around medkits anymore, there's no manual saving (auto save mechanics), you can only carry 2 weapons at the same time (you can easily find a new one pretty much anywhere).

The gameworld is littered with useless stuff (hot dogs, pop corn, ammo for weapons you don't carry), but sometimes, important items like permanent health boosts are stuffed away in seemingly meaningless locations (behind/under furniture, so we have to spend time searching easter eggs, really?  Crouching behind every bench, closet and desk kinda takes the pace out of a shootout).\n\nImagine John Wick being in a high speed car chase.\nThe only catch is, he's got to stop and go inside every house he passes, for some arbitrary purpose.\n\nThis loot mechanism wouldn't be so much of a problem if the game were an open world survival-like shooter, like Fallout, which is more or less based upon finding better loot all the time.\nHowever, the gameplay is entirely linear, which means no going back to past areas, so if you've run past important permanent boosts, that's bad luck. \n\nThe result is you just end up searching countless toilets, hot dog carts, office drawers, etc.\nThat's a shame, because the action, when there actually IS action, is pretty good.\nThere's just too much nothingness in between.\nAs it is, I find the game to be a trash can searching simulator with some good shooting as a side game.\n\nThey also put in some chapters with hardly ANY shooting.\nJust some walking/searching and dialogue.\nTo build depth, immersion, and story, I suppose.\nThe problem, however, is that the searching, the dialogues, etc are shallow, not immersive and unrewarding.\n\nThe final problem I'm having with this game:\nWhere the original BioShock took place in a deserted game world, with hardly any sane survivors left, BioShock Infinite takes place in a fully populated society.\nHowever, there's zero interaction between player and environment, which feels very, very odd.\nYou wanna grab someone's snack from under their noses for a quick HP-boost? Sure, no problem...\nEither include NPC's and make them add to immersion (like in FallOut), or leave them out entirely, like in the earlier BioShock games. \nThis game makes you feel like you're a thoroughly autistic maniac who just found a gun in a trash can on a square full of other thoroughly autistic robots.","timestamp_created":1621973883,"timestamp_updated":1621975689,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569415509700775146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92586206","author":{"steamid":"76561198086108555","num_games_owned":413,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":3012,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2054,"last_played":1625551606},"language":"schinese","review":"伊丽莎白就像是奥黛丽赫本","timestamp_created":1621970031,"timestamp_updated":1621970031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92586076","author":{"steamid":"76561198997031380","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1639332692},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom\nttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt","timestamp_created":1621969866,"timestamp_updated":1621969866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92584169","author":{"steamid":"76561199151055368","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1002,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1643865114},"language":"english","review":"I have enjoyed this game quite a bit with the driven story and the amazing artworks throughout.

not sure how other people are saying this game is good & the story is brilliant. The story is garbage & makes no sense at all. Now, before I get piled on for saying this, make no mistake, I understood the story line. It just didn't make any sense & is riddled with plot holes. It doesn't fit in with either Bioshock games, but they tried to make it fit in, unsuccessfully. The game itself was boring & the only reason I put so many hours into it was for the achievements.\n\nThere was a couple of good things about this game: Songbird was pretty cool, the graphics are amazing & the voice acting was pretty good. That's pretty much about it. Elizabeth was annoying & just like any other NPC made to follow you around, just constantly got in the way which was infuriating. No 'New Game +' just like Bioshock 2 which annoyed the hell out of me in both games, so you can't upgrade everything that wasn't fully upgraded in the first play through, in the second play through. Guns were under powered, even if you upgraded them fully and you can only hold 2 at any one time. Vox weapons were not even worth bothering with as they all sucked. Plasmids, or Vigors as they're called in this, were mostly boring. Murder of Crows (this games version of the bee Plasmid), Devils Kiss (the fire Plasmid) & Shock Jockey (electric Plasmid) were the only ones even worth using. You can only have 2 'active' Vigors going at any one given time, you can change them to any of the other Vigors, but like i said, only 2 'active'. Level design was terrible and is extremely linear.\n\nI didn't mind the City in the Clouds DLC as it was probably the best part of the entire game, and it's basically just a challenge wave DLC. Burial at Sea part 1 & 2 were just terrible and just made the story worse, which is saying something.\n\nI would only recommend buying this game if it's part of the Bioshock Collection pack and only when said pack is on sale. Otherwise, don't bother. It's a prequel and doesn't fit in with the story of Bioshock 1 or 2, barely even has the feel of a Bioshock game.","timestamp_created":1621943558,"timestamp_updated":1621990935,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486209720373153687","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92566178","author":{"steamid":"76561198842690521","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":846,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":846,"last_played":1581688566},"language":"koreana","review":"갠춘갠춘","timestamp_created":1621942318,"timestamp_updated":1621942318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92565225","author":{"steamid":"76561198301294315","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1758,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1758,"last_played":1621940119},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏历史中里程碑式的作品","timestamp_created":1621940519,"timestamp_updated":1621940519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92563153","author":{"steamid":"76561198996114074","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123,"last_played":1621921114},"language":"schinese","review":"什么叫第九艺术啊","timestamp_created":1621936461,"timestamp_updated":1621936461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92562423","author":{"steamid":"76561198420125409","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":962,"last_played":1621934995},"language":"schinese","review":"为最好的辅助伊丽莎白献上好评","timestamp_created":1621935042,"timestamp_updated":1621935042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92561985","author":{"steamid":"76561198881574448","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1361,"last_played":1627068635},"language":"english","review":"It's one of those games you wish forget it all and start it again.

Первые две части Bioshock мне на 100% зашли. Фишка первых частей была в самом Восторге(хотя в Колумбии из нового это айро-трассы и красивый вид на облака и всё на этом) атмосфера, флора и фауна  подводного города где одновременно тебе страшно зайти куда либо боясь что из темного угла выскочит какой нибудь мутант-паук и ты можешь наложить в штаны и после можно просто повернуть голову и посмотреть на прекрасный подводный мир. А потом после Восторга нас вообще выбрасывают в воздушный город. Я вообще почти не нашел интересного для себя, это оказался просто город с красивыми видами на облака и небо. У нас есть главный герой Девид Букер пожалуй самый не интересный герой в всей серии, (мне больше всего нравиться Отец или Альфа из 2 части) он сам по себе скучный. Я сейчас вам несколькими словами опишу почти все диалоги гг : Элизабед, стой, поговорить, справимся, неважно. И все он реально комбинируя эти слова так и говорит целую игру, это нонсенс. Пожалуй из всех персонажей мне понравилась только Элизабед. Говорить про нее не буду всем ясно почему(она топ). Про сюжет я скажу кратко он тут на 50\\50. Пол игры ты собираешься сбежать с Элизабед с Колумбии но потом пол игры все таки питаетесь попасть к злодею. И сюжет начинает блистать красками где-то после половины прохождения. Концовка странная но не в плохом смысле. Ну в целом игра хорошая: красивый мир, декорации, тот же вид на небо, стрельба, Элизабед и ее некоторые части. Она просто баба огонь если нужно хилку кинет, патроны, плазмиды. Женился б на ней. Ну а, если подсуммировать всё выше сказанное то игра хорошая  но с рядом минусов. Да это еще и куча того что разрабы вырезали из прошлых частей, просто жаль. Есть еще много чего что я не сказал ибо не хочу затягивать. Надеюсь я чем-то помог и спасибо за внимание.\nВот вам Шрэка под конец чтоб скучно не было.\n⡴⠑⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⣀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣀⡀\n⠸⡇⠀⠿⡀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡴⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣦⡀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠑⢄⣠⠾⠁⣀⣄⡈⠙⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣆\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡀⠁⠀⠀⠈⠙⠛⠂⠈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⡿⢿⣆\n⠀⠀⠀⢀⡾⣁⣀⠀⠴⠂⠙⣗⡀⠀⢻⣿⣿⠭⢤⣴⣦⣤⣹⠀⠀⠀⢀⢴⣶⣆\n⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣷⣮⣽⣾⣿⣥⣴⣿⣿⡿⢂⠔⢚⡿⢿⣿⣦⣴⣾⠸⣼⡿\n⠀⢀⡞⠁⠙⠻⠿⠟⠉⠀⠛⢹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣌⢤⣼⣿⣾⣿⡟⠉\n⠀⣾⣷⣶⠇⠀⠀⣤⣄⣀⡀⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇\n⠀⠉⠈⠉⠀⠀⢦⡈⢻⣿⣿⣿⣶⣶⣶⣶⣤⣽⡹⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠲⣽⡻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣜⣿⣿⣿⡇\n⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣷⣶⣮⣭⣽⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠃","timestamp_created":1621888950,"timestamp_updated":1621889247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92538476","author":{"steamid":"76561198128248705","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":909,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":859,"last_played":1622334305},"language":"spanish","review":"Así es, soy simp de Elizabeth, 10/10 juegazo","timestamp_created":1621886520,"timestamp_updated":1621886520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92537766","author":{"steamid":"76561198049099217","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2028,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1974,"last_played":1654368011},"language":"english","review":"Superb game.
