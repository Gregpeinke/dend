Pero lo mejor de todo sin lugar a dudas es que Portal 2 cuenta con un propio editor de niveles y un WORKSHOP en donde podremos encontrar los niveles creados por la comunidad, superando el medio millón de creaciones.\n\nLa verdad me ha gustado bastante incluso el final, aunque siendo sincero (SPOILER DE LA HISTORIA) [spoiler]me hubiera gustado más que GLaDOS hubiera sido nuestra mayor enemiga en vez de Weathly[/spoiler].\n\n[h1]9/10[/h1] Un must-buy obligatorio.

This isn't really a bad thing since I like many others enjoyed the original. Even then Portal 1 was, for the most part, a self-contained game.\n\nPortal 2 sought to expand upon the Portal universe. As you played on, you discovered more about the history and people of Aperture Science such as it's founder, the ever loveable Cave Johnson who really stole the show with how much he really wanted Aperture to succeed. Slowly you learned that what you saw in Portal 1 was only just the tip of the insanity iceberg that is Aperture.\n\nYou start innocently enough with your portal gun, making jumps and gaining momentum. As you progress however, you get introduced to new mechanics in order to complete puzzles. The length of this game is exponentially longer than the previous game and it adds a whole new dimension to the fun; co-op. Yes sir, there is nothing quite like messing with your friend by making a tractor beam move back and forth ultimately leading you to drop him into a bottomless pit for laughs. Portal 2's co-op was probably some of the most fun I had in a game ever. If you're creative enough, you can even make your own test chambers.\n\nBe sure to pick this up when you get the chance.

Para fãs de jogos puzzle eu considero este jogo um \"Must have\".\n\nObs.: Jogando Coop com um amigo em certos momentos choravámos de tanto rir!!!\n\n[h1]Pontos Negativos[/h1]\nMesmo com a melhora nos gráficos do jogo a personagem principal continuou com gráficos estranhos. As legendas não aparecem 100% das vezes então é necessário deixar as vozes um pouco mais altas para ser possível entender o que os narradores falam. Acredite em mim, você vai querer ouvir tudo o que eles falam.","timestamp_created":1467478571,"timestamp_updated":1467478571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24021291","author":{"steamid":"76561198144247257","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1467479415},"language":"turkish","review":"Joystick ile nasıl oynayabilirim","timestamp_created":1467477844,"timestamp_updated":1467477844,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24020956","author":{"steamid":"76561198209672843","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1874,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":441,"last_played":1541196882},"language":"german","review":"mir gefällt das es sehr viele Rätsel gibt und dabei auch eine gute story hat","timestamp_created":1467477100,"timestamp_updated":1467477100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24020284","author":{"steamid":"76561198210868760","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":360,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":360,"last_played":1448955829},"language":"russian","review":"4OTKO Voche N0rM","timestamp_created":1467475624,"timestamp_updated":1467475624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24019633","author":{"steamid":"76561198048329900","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":979,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":837,"last_played":1471271718},"language":"turkish","review":"harika bir oyun herkese tavsiye ediyorum","timestamp_created":1467474156,"timestamp_updated":1467474156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24019398","author":{"steamid":"76561198078796640","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1236,"last_played":1585338409},"language":"english","review":"Great game.

(c) - Уитли [/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=711368981\n\n[h1]PORTAL 2 [/h1]\n\nБез сомнений портал 2 - одна из лучших игр Valve (Half Life круче :P)\nВ отличии от первой части обзовелась нормальным сюжетом. Ну как нормальным... Шикарным!\nЯ эту игру перепроходил 4 раза до того как купить. Разберем по порядку.\n\n[h1] В общем [/h1]\nPortal 2 - это головоломка где у игрока есть портальная пушка с возможностью поставить 2 портала. Суть всегда в том что бы проходить различные головоломки. Не очень понятно почему в рамках игры это назвали тестами которые проходят на благо науки,  ну да ладно.\n\n[h1] Сюжет [/h1]\nВроде как прямое продолжение первой части, но я не сильно понимаю как ГГ оказалась в камере консервации.\nВ общем мы очнулись - все ломается, мы встречаем круглого робота,[spoiler] включаем ГЛаДОС (Потому что робот тупой)[/spoiler] и так далее. Несколько сюжетных поворотов, раскрытие личности ГЛаДОС. Очень интересно и иногда мурашки по коже.\n\n[h1] Графика [/h1]\nДвижок Source как всегда выдает крутую картинку. Дизайнеры явно постарались над антуражем, который меняется на протяжении игры.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=710613974\n[h1] Озвучка [/h1]\nЯ играл в английскую и русскую версию.\nВ английской у Уитли голос какого-то бухого 40-ка летнего мужика, в русской попроще. GLaDOS лучше звучит в английской, хотя тут как сказать... В русской она больше на человека похожа, а в оригинале слышно что робот.\nПро большее не скажу так как не проходил, а только поиграл в англ. версии.\nНо русская озвучка все таки шикарна. Наверное лучшая из тех, что я видел. Нет, серьезно, я не помню более эмациональной и крутой озвучки. Тут только Bioshock Infinite стоит рядом.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nВ общем и целом PORTAL 2 однозначно рекомендуется к покупке тем, у кого есть мозг.\n10/10 :D","timestamp_created":1467473223,"timestamp_updated":1467473623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24018786","author":{"steamid":"76561198195687438","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":42,"last_played":1534533503},"language":"english","review":"not the best puzzle game , some puzzle i got stuck and have to restart the whole game and it was not fun but most of it are fine","timestamp_created":1467472309,"timestamp_updated":1467472309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24018724","author":{"steamid":"76561198067097270","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":766,"last_played":1470930993},"language":"english","review":"Buy it, and i urge you to complete it ...so much time i put in it before i bought it on Steam, would recommend to anybody to try","timestamp_created":1467472190,"timestamp_updated":1467472190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24018658","author":{"steamid":"76561198281997253","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":7959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3634,"last_played":1639633129},"language":"english","review":"i like most of the puzzles in this game because they are hard at some points and then easyish at some other points.
