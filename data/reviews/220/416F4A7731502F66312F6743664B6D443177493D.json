I've only played for it a bit, but the lighting improvements, animations, and how the game looks visually is very impressive! There's guides on how to install the mod via YouTube. Once installed correctly, you'll get three separate games in your Steam Libray. Half Life 2 MMOD, HL2 EP1 MMOD, and HL2 EP2 MMOD. Not only that, but the story is very fun and relatable many times imo. Plus, if you own the Half Life Series, and Garry's Mod, you can play with the Half Life campaign within Garry's Mod and have double the fun!","timestamp_created":1618011336,"timestamp_updated":1618011336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90033216","author":{"steamid":"76561198185270915","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":563,"playtime_at_review":794,"last_played":1660080452},"language":"english","review":"Amazing","timestamp_created":1618010718,"timestamp_updated":1618010718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90032633","author":{"steamid":"76561198210224823","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":337,"playtime_at_review":667,"last_played":1660582938},"language":"english","review":"it sure is\n","timestamp_created":1618009791,"timestamp_updated":1618009791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90029758","author":{"steamid":"76561198420118541","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":962,"last_played":1596338261},"language":"english","review":"one of the greatest games ever made, changed the industry just as much as if not more than half life 1 with its physics system and how it elaborated on the unique storytelling methods of hl1 with real characters and emotional plot beats","timestamp_created":1618005416,"timestamp_updated":1618005416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90029465","author":{"steamid":"76561199066013111","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2985,"last_played":1644763650},"language":"swedish","review":"mycket bra goda grodor","timestamp_created":1618005052,"timestamp_updated":1618005052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90028435","author":{"steamid":"76561198304416390","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1626735711},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor jogo de todos os tempos !!","timestamp_created":1618003726,"timestamp_updated":1618003726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90026671","author":{"steamid":"76561198202999986","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":726,"last_played":1586692362},"language":"turkish","review":"Bir efsanenin yine efsane denebilecek kadar iyi olan devam oyunu.

It was even a little nostalgic because even though this is my first play through I have seen the assets in this game all my life in custom CSGO and TF2 maps. I will say that in my opinion it is a great game with a very interesting story, however I think I prefer Half-Life (original) to this one, but that might change after I play the next two \"episodes\" of Half-Life 2. Obviously it is better than Half-Life Blue Shift, and I think I liked it on the same level as Half-Life Opposing Force.  The big difference is the direction the story has gone in. \n\nWithout giving away any major spoilers its a very interesting adventure in a dystopian world where the Combine an alien empire has conquered earth. They definitely had to go in a new direction with the series after Half-Life and its multiple expansions all set at Black-Mesa. After its nuked in Opposing Force they could take the series somewhere else and this is the best most creative way I think they could have chosen to do it. \n\nWhen it comes to game-play the combat is good but what really makes this game is the physics and the Gravity Gun! This is genius, I wish more games today did interesting things with physics like this game did. After playing this you would think the game industry has stopped evolving because of how cool these mechanics are from an over sixteen year old game.  \n\nWithout giving too much more away, I would definitely recommend this game to people, and the story is easy to get into even if you haven't played the original Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1618000132,"timestamp_updated":1618097251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90024861","author":{"steamid":"76561199034060196","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":2181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1858,"last_played":1654793942},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2 current review\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n-7,5/10\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n-8,5/10\n\n---{ Audio }---\n-7,5/10\n\n---{ Audience }---\n -Teens\n\n---{ Story }---\n-9/10\n\n---{ Price }---\n-Worth the price\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n-Minor bugs\n\n---{Longevity}---\n-8,5/10\n\n---{ ?

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1617994127,"timestamp_updated":1617994127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.445113122463226318","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90018256","author":{"steamid":"76561199005672887","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":1591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1403,"last_played":1619420586},"language":"russian","review":"allahyu abkra","timestamp_created":1617991588,"timestamp_updated":1617991588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530881345272064209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90013452","author":{"steamid":"76561198254132249","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259,"last_played":1631336297},"language":"brazilian","review":"\"⠀⠀⠀⠀\"\n      -𝐺𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑜𝑛 𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑛","timestamp_created":1617985918,"timestamp_updated":1617985918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90013250","author":{"steamid":"76561199032638780","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":62,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1619336477},"language":"schinese","review":"    买1的时候无意间看见的，一直没玩，放在库里有半年了，就准备玩一下。我感觉V社的老游戏我感觉风格都差不多，但这款游戏属实惊艳到我了，有人认为玩游戏是浪费时间的，但我绝不认同。每一款游戏背后的研发团队都付出了无数心血，在1998年，这样的画面，拿到今天也令人为之感叹。\n    谈谈游戏，当我打开游戏的时候，一口气玩了40分钟，说实话，40分钟其实也不长，但这款游戏无论是剧情还是画面表现，无疑都是非常出色的 （除了虫子太吓人了）， 我们没有理由给这个游戏差评。为什么？没有为什么！这不比骗钱的部分3A大作强吗？有的人可能会说了：“你给我做一个3A试试？”你我都是普通的游戏玩家，可以对游戏进行 合理的 评价，但请不要对游戏，对好游戏进行无厘头的攻击和辱骂。 因为，游戏，是一门艺术......\n     #（以上仅为个人观点哦 ^_^ ）","timestamp_created":1617985666,"timestamp_updated":1617985666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.64920419454574585","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90010622","author":{"steamid":"76561198303672964","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":693,"last_played":1628960849},"language":"polish","review":"Tak.","timestamp_created":1617982699,"timestamp_updated":1617982699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90007606","author":{"steamid":"76561199002931762","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1347,"last_played":1650587512},"language":"thai","review":"ชอบมากครับ เกมเมื่อ10ปีที่แล้ว ให้ความรู้สึกเหมือนเล่นเกมไม่กี่ปีเลยครับ ผมเป็นคนที่คอมไม่แรงด้วย แต่ปรับภาพกลางๆลื่นมาก","timestamp_created":1617979315,"timestamp_updated":1617979315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90006282","author":{"steamid":"76561198132288268","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":963,"last_played":1616545017},"language":"spanish","review":"Mira wacho, te la dejo simple:\nEste es el mejor shooter que alguna vez se ha hecho.

game saved my life.\n\nI am 29.\n\nMy ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1617933771,"timestamp_updated":1617933771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":208,"votes_funny":48,"weighted_vote_score":"0.675049781799316406","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89976269","author":{"steamid":"76561198275986742","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":952,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":887,"last_played":1656617024},"language":"english","review":"I love drowning because my flashlight was on!","timestamp_created":1617928492,"timestamp_updated":1617928492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89974724","author":{"steamid":"76561199149895850","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":6333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":462,"last_played":1643234056},"language":"brazilian","review":"Este game é simplesmente magnifico.

것이다.","timestamp_created":1617872701,"timestamp_updated":1617872701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89930464","author":{"steamid":"76561198148220015","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":3356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1823,"last_played":1647361874},"language":"english","review":"fun
