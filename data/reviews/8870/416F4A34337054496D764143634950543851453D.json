У игры отличный сюжет и истории персонажей вместе с задумкой автора в целом интересны. Однако есть огромное НО:это миссии и это бои. Чем мне не понравились миссии? Ну, в целом, они достаточно интересны, до тех пор, пока в игре не появляются совершенно однообразные и неинтересные миссии, которые требуют пройтись по одному и тому же месту 50 раз(миссия с оружейником была весьма скучной долгое время) или не заставляет искать шифровальную книгу, чтобы открыть очередной тайник, в котором не будет абсолютно ничего нового или интересного. Что же касается боевой системы, посудите сами. Сами система неплоха, мне лично нравится механика с трассами и крюком, \"боевые соли\", но совершенно не нравятся враги. Вместо интересных боссов игроку предстоит сражаться с одними и теми же бестолковыми солдатами, к которым, по настроению, добавляют порой более сильного юнита(патриота, поджигателя, механика), которые тоже не особо разнообразят бои.Нет, я не говорю это к тому, что враги должны быть все разными, но они берут количеством, а никак не качеством. А подобные \"боссы\" как призрак матери Элизабет лишь отбивают желание проходить эту замечательную игру повторно, так как всё, на что они способы - создать себе парочку личных армий и заставить игрока беситься от того факта, что пули летят буквально отовсюду. В итоге, в игру стоит сыграть ради сюжета, но никак не ради интересных боёв, потому что все они утомительно-монотонно-однообразны. Ещё минус - отсутствие возможности сохранять игру вручную.\nP.s.Игра с самой грустной  и логически единственно-возможной концовкой, которую я когда либо видал:(\n\nИтак, решил не делать отдельным модулем обзоры на дополнения, они будут здесь же. Пройдено первое сюжетное дополнение к этой игре - и скажу лишь то, что именно так должны делаться дополнения, а не три вещи за соточку рублей. Не буду сильно углубляться, но это дополнение прекрасно вписывается в общую картину. Правда, есть непонятные моменты - откуда в городе \"Восторг\" Механические патриоты и многие другие наработки из Колумбии, но зная добросовестность и продуманность разработчиков, уверен, что ответ должен лежать во второй части - и если это действительно так, то их детальной точностью можно будет только восхищаться.\n\nВторое сюжетное DLC - самое хардкорное и сложное в плане восприятия, а концовка его окраплена кровью.

From the soundtrack, to the environments, to the overall tone and atmosphere and voice acting, this is truly a monumental game. Grappling with the themes of zealotry in religious cults and the zeitgeist of the early 20th century, Bioshock Infinite has a world rich with lore and a wider connection to its series many other games simply fail to represent. \n\nHowever, not all is peaceful in Columbia, and like the era of time this game represents there are faults in the way things work. Some physics mechanics and design elements feel brushed over and, for a lack of a better word, clunky. More specifically, elements of combat mechanics sometimes feel either odd or have kinks to them that have to be considered heavily when choosing whether you wish to play this game. On a contrasting note regarding combat, the selection of weaponry is wide. All guns can be modified so it's entirely possible to complete the game with that pistol you took from one of the police officers corpse when you first began. \n\nIn my personal numerous plays through the story I've found myself using the pistol and the hand cannon frequently and exclusively. \n\nFurther on the point of world building, the DLC, burial at sea EPs 1 & 2 must be considered. They follow an alternate timeline where the world is more part in similar to Bioshock 1 and 2. EP 1 takes on a more traditional combat style and was thoroughly enjoyable. EP 2 didn't gel with me as much due to the massive change in gameplay towards a more stealth based approach, however I can see it being enjoyable to a lot of players.  \n\nOverall, Bioshock infinite is a marvellous game with fantastic elements in the story and worldspace department, however that focus on world building felt as though it overtook some important areas of game design. 8/10.","timestamp_created":1581503655,"timestamp_updated":1581503655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63379087","author":{"steamid":"76561198850266680","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1609,"last_played":1596899855},"language":"schinese","review":"晕3d慎入","timestamp_created":1581500391,"timestamp_updated":1581500391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63376013","author":{"steamid":"76561198428093285","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":548,"last_played":1616922053},"language":"schinese","review":"   什么是第九艺术？这就是第九艺术","timestamp_created":1581495455,"timestamp_updated":1581495455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63375082","author":{"steamid":"76561198047009195","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1581666140},"language":"schinese","review":"非常好玩，通关2遍了···","timestamp_created":1581493620,"timestamp_updated":1581493620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63374710","author":{"steamid":"76561198283689218","num_games_owned":322,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":792,"last_played":1581491231},"language":"schinese","review":"Will the circle be unbroken\nBy and by,by and by?\nIs a better home awating\nIn the past,in the past?","timestamp_created":1581492906,"timestamp_updated":1581492906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63373444","author":{"steamid":"76561198096217636","num_games_owned":771,"num_reviews":92,"playtime_forever":1297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":930,"last_played":1600989293},"language":"english","review":"Good","timestamp_created":1581490501,"timestamp_updated":1581490501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63372485","author":{"steamid":"76561198810148517","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3091,"last_played":1642371854},"language":"english","review":"this isn't my favorite in the franchise but that's mainly because it's not under the sea. it's still beautiful, it still incorporates the first 2 into it and it's god a solid storyline that had me slackjawed at the finish. love love love!!","timestamp_created":1581488626,"timestamp_updated":1581488626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63372301","author":{"steamid":"76561198088684299","num_games_owned":553,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1473002682},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏的剧情其实没那么难以理解，相较于电影或者电视来说剧情反倒是比较平庸的，都是一些用烂的桥段（反乌托邦+时空穿越）。但是不可否认的是优秀的美术风格和顶级的人设（说的就是伊丽莎白！）加上优秀的剧情，让这款游戏成为当之无愧的第九艺术。另外其实这游戏的可玩性也很高，只不过被上述几点夺去了存在感，左手法术右手枪械的设定确实很有趣。","timestamp_created":1581488255,"timestamp_updated":1581488255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63371099","author":{"steamid":"76561197960954819","num_games_owned":1024,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":480,"last_played":1585196868},"language":"english","review":"Haven't played a good FPS that has a good storyline in ages!
