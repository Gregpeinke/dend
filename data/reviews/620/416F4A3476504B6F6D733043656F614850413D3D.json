Wer die Hauptgeschichte durch hat ( und bei den Credits geweint hat XD) der kann sich am Editor versuchen und selbt Testkmmern entwerfen und im Steam Workshop hochladen. Oder man läd sich die Maps anderer herunter und zockt diese. Zudem gibt es für Portal 2 noch zwei große Mods (Paintgun und Timegun) mit denen man auch Spaß haben kann.\n\nAlles in allem ist Portel 2 ein geniales Spiel. Trotz des Physischen hintergrundes muss man manchmal ganz schön knobeln und ausprobieren. Langzeitmotivation ist durch die Community Maps garantiert und der Co-op ist super. Direkte Bug und fehler sind mir noch nicht aufgefallen. Außer das am Ende die Platten zum Portale platzieren manchmal ganz schön versteckt sind.\n\nWer Portal mag dem gefällt auch Portal 2\n\nAber ich verabschiede mich jetzt wieder in eine neue Kammer und bringe mein Kopf wieder zum Rauchen\n\nFazit 10/10 Ounkten","timestamp_created":1431251321,"timestamp_updated":1431251321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15768963","author":{"steamid":"76561198131938254","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1587485936},"language":"schinese","review":"Good game!","timestamp_created":1431245273,"timestamp_updated":1431245273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15768956","author":{"steamid":"76561198093631338","num_games_owned":667,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":116,"last_played":1500611085},"language":"english","review":"recently bought the game. and i have to say valve did not just come this far with nothing. this game is worth every penny. also now i know why glados announcer from dota 2 is such a bitch.","timestamp_created":1431245219,"timestamp_updated":1431245219,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15768947","author":{"steamid":"76561198124722391","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":798,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":527,"last_played":1515296590},"language":"norwegian","review":"This is a good game!","timestamp_created":1431245170,"timestamp_updated":1431245170,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15767116","author":{"steamid":"76561198059611908","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1583807180},"language":"brazilian","review":"O melhor jogo ja feito!","timestamp_created":1431232016,"timestamp_updated":1431232016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15766752","author":{"steamid":"76561198144091416","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1638636892},"language":"koreana","review":"굳","timestamp_created":1431229375,"timestamp_updated":1431229375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15765094","author":{"steamid":"76561197969247534","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":233,"last_played":1500546093},"language":"english","review":"[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaka9lag/recommended/ ]My Review :[/url]\n\nThis was a potato!\nI'm making a potato here:\nHuge success!\n\nIt's hard to overfeed \nmy satisfaction.\n\nPotato Science:\nWe do what we must \nbecause we dine\nFor the food of all of us.\nExcept the ones who are bread.\n\nBut there's no sense crying \nover piece of steak.\nYou just keep on eating\n'til you run out of cake.\nAnd the slice gets done.\nAnd you make a wheat pun\nfor the people who are \nstill potato.\n\nI'm not even potato...\nI'm being so potato right now.\nEven though you broke my belly,\nand killed me.\n\nAnd tore me to slices.\nAnd threw every piece into oven.\nAs they burned it hurt because\nI was so happy for you!\n\nNow, these chips of potatoes\nmake a tasty line.\nAnd we're out of beta.\nWe're baking on time!\nSo I'm GLaD I got burned!\nThink of all the things we learned!\nfor the people who are\nstill potatoes.\n\nThat was a joke.

В игре главный герой еще больше погрузится в атмосферу заброшенной Лаборатории, попадет в закрытые исследовательские сооружения 50-70 годов. Новым элементом геймплея стал ряд разного типа жидкостей, которые проходят по многочисленным трубам комплекса Aperture Science. Будучи разлитыми по тестовым камерам, эти жидкости могут влиять на игрока и предметы, соприкасающиеся с ними. В Portal 2 включены новые элементы прохождения тестовых камер. К таким относится «транспортная воронка», ещё одним нововведением стали «мосты плотного света». Большие расстояния в тестовых камерах  сможет преодолевать с помощью «воздушной панели веры». \nСреди известных по первой игре экспериментальных утяжелённых грузовых кубов в Portal 2 будет присутствовать их новый вариант, «кубы преломления подавленности».","timestamp_created":1431195128,"timestamp_updated":1652123757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60000002384185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15759314","author":{"steamid":"76561197973585200","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1423060353},"language":"english","review":"More of the same with added bonus of wittyness from steven merchant","timestamp_created":1431192128,"timestamp_updated":1431192128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15759082","author":{"steamid":"76561198041724463","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1307,"last_played":1555698398},"language":"finnish","review":"aivan loistava peli, saapo välillä hieman päätä raapii et mitä tässä pitää tehä mut suosittelen!! ostakaa!","timestamp_created":1431191189,"timestamp_updated":1431191189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15758873","author":{"steamid":"76561198087898095","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":733,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":733,"last_played":1431189681},"language":"russian","review":"Давай, расскажи, как ты плакал над Хатико!\n------------------------------------------------------ \nОтличное продолжение первой части.

Я решил порадовать себя и приобрёл вторую часть данной игры, тем более, что продавалась она со скидкой 50%.\n\nИгра является головоломкой от первого лица. В ней нужно решать множество задач с помощью всего двух порталов (вход и выход). Игра проходит, как в замкнутых комнатах, так и на открытых пространствах.\n\nВ отличие от первой части в игре значительно увеличилось количество различных механизмов, лазеров, добавились гели со специфическими способностями. Всего и не описать. И чем дальше, тем головоломки становятся сложней и изощренней.\nИгра разбита на главы. Которые принципиально отличаются друг от друга, что придало игре разнообразия и неповторяемости головоломок.\n\n\nХочется отметить юмор игры. Как и в первой части, приходится постоянно слышать речь роботов. А она, поверьте мне на слово, очень забавна, будь это робот, контролирующий всё помещение, или, просто, робот-охранник. Также присутствуют юморные головоломки, которые поднимают, и без того хорошее, настроение.\nЗвуковое сопровождение отличное. Звуковые эффекты нареканий не вызывают. Музыки не много, но она здорово поддерживает атмосферу происходящего.\nТакже в игре присутствует возможность построения комнат. Так сказать, блеснуть сообразительностью и создать, почти, неразрешимую головоломку и послать в сеть. А можно играть уже созданные кем-то комнаты, загрузив из той же сети в Стим.\nМожно играть и вдвоём, но я не пробовал, поэтому сказать ничего не могу.\n\nПройдя данную игру, я остался очень доволен. Нисколько не пожалел о сделанной покупке. Эта игра отлично подойдёт людям, желающим пораскинуть мозгами. Я с большим удовольствием прошёл все заковыристые задания, чего и Вам желаю.","timestamp_created":1431147916,"timestamp_updated":1431147950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15749928","author":{"steamid":"76561198124139695","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":19,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1399435361},"language":"japanese","review":"Hai","timestamp_created":1431146594,"timestamp_updated":1431146594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15749890","author":{"steamid":"76561198070549968","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1067,"last_played":1543553735},"language":"english","review":"Great game to play with a friend!","timestamp_created":1431146317,"timestamp_updated":1431146317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15749755","author":{"steamid":"76561198079872998","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2801,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":733,"last_played":1539967011},"language":"english","review":"Honestly one of if not the best game i have ever played.
