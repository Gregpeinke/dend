First Person Puzzle), разработанная Valve Corporation. \n\nИгра была выпущена для ПК и Xbox 360 в пакет-сборнике \"The Orange Box\" (оранжевый ящик) 10 октября 2007 года. \n// Его я собственно и купил.\n\nНа заметку: \nПредшественницей Portal является игра Narbacular Drop, которая разрабатывалась группой студентов из Института технологий DigiPen (англ. DigiPen Institute of Technology).\n\nВ основе Portal лежит модифицированная версия движка Source, использованного ранее в игре Half-Life 2 и её сиквелах. Технологически Portal относится к Orange Box-играм, поскольку входит в набор The Orange Box, все игры которого построены на единой версии движка Source. Игра поддерживает динамическое построение теней, самозатеняющиеся объекты, систему частиц и кинематографическую физику.\n\nО игре: \n   События Portal разворачиваются во вселенной Half-Life, в Лаборатории исследования природы порталов - компьютеризированном центре корпорации Aperture Science. \nИгрок выступает в роли девушки по имени Челл, которая проходит испытания внутри Лаборатории.\n\n// Однако:\n{ Внимательные зрители могли заметить, что в трейлере к Portal главный герой выглядит как мужчина в оранжевой робе, в     то время как Valve говорила о девушке в роли главного героя. Это можно объяснить тем, что в Valve, не желая раньше времени раскрывать детали сюжета, при записи ролика решили подменить модель девушки какой-нибудь другой, например,     неиспользуемой мужской. }\nИгровой процесс основан на решении головоломок при помощи \"ручного портального устройства Aperture Science\", позволяющего создавать на плоских поверхностях порталы - два связанных стабильных разрыва пространства, через которые можно мгновенно перемещаться в пространстве самому или переносить предметы.\n\n//  Так же, в пространственных порталах, действует закон \"сохранения энергии\":  \nТело, проходящее через порталы, сохраняет свою кинетическую энергию: величина и направление вектора скорости тела относительно плоскости порталов не изменяются. \nА вот что говорит по этому поводу GLaDOS ( суперкомпьютер, обладающий искусственным интеллектом и маниакальной любовью к тортам) : \n{ Говоря языком дилетанта - что быстро влетает, то быстро и вылетает. }\n\nТеперь немного о ''Порталах'': \nПорталы ограничены плоскими поверхностями определенного материала (например, на твердой металлической поверхности порталы создавать нельзя). В одно и то же время могут быть открыты только 2 портала, различающиеся по цвету - голубой и оранжевый. \n\nНа заметку : в устройство создания порталов также встроен упрощённый вид манипулятора энергетического поля нулевого уровня из Half-Life 2, который позволяет поднимать предметы и перемещать их в пространстве в непосредственной близости от себя.\n\nПеред тем как анонсировать продолжение игры, 3 марта 2010 года Valve обновила концовку Portal, в которой к лежащему на земле игроку подходит робот — распорядитель вечеринки — и оттаскивает его обратно в Лабораторию. Это появление распорядителя ранее было частью вырезанного из игры пасхального яйца. Первоначально, после того как персонаж игрока спасался от огня в конце последнего теста и совершал побег, робот-распорядитель должен был, всё время прячась, следовать за ним и ждать, когда же игрок ляжет на пол в «позе ожидания распорядителя вечеринки».\n\n// Так же в игре есть артефакты, например:\n\nВ игре можно найти компьютерные клавиатуры, на которых выделены цветом несколько клавиш. Из выделенных букв можно собрать имя Адриан Шепард (англ. Adrian Shephard): так звали главного героя Half-Life: Opposing Force.\n\nТакже, предыдущие беглецы оставляли на стенах Лаборатории изменённые отрывки из стихотворений о смерти, посвящённые Кубу-компаньону. В частности, встречается сатира, основанная на стихотворении «Раз к Смерти я не шла…» (англ. Because I could not stop for Death…) американской поэтессы Эмили Дикинсон.\n\nВывод: Portal был признан одной из лучших игр сборника The Orange Box и часто получал более высокие оценки рецензентов, чем Half-Life 2: Episode Two или Team Fortress 2. Журналистами была отмечена уникальная игровая механика, а также чёрный юмор. Некоторые критики не одобрили чрезмерно пустые помещения игры и её небольшую продолжительность. Несмотря на это, игра получила множество наград по итогам 2007 года.\n\nМоя оценка: 8 из 10.","timestamp_created":1425981417,"timestamp_updated":1425981453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14816646","author":{"steamid":"76561198035775963","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3408,"last_played":1632463270},"language":"english","review":"Portal is an experience,\none that should not be missed.\nIts short and sweet, with an amazing environment, theme, and mechanics to top it all off.\nBesides, there will be cake.","timestamp_created":1425953869,"timestamp_updated":1425953869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14815652","author":{"steamid":"76561198060117811","num_games_owned":398,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":161,"last_played":1470049232},"language":"norwegian","review":"This game was incredible piece something both I and the boy of 5 years thought was incredibly fun.

Нужно решать головоломки в трехмерном пространстве, находясь в шкуре человека, который заперт в комнате или в целом комплексе комнат, от первого лица.

Находясь в геометрически правильных комнатах из бетона, покрашенного в белую краску, оранжевый костюм главного персонажа создает не много неприятное ощюшение, что ты сильно выделяешься и тебя не должно быть в этом месте, а стекла, искревленные так, что за ними ничего не видно, порой создает ощюшение, что за тобой кто-то наблюдает (простите за повтор). Радует, что кое-где можно покинуть испытательные камеры и увидеть закулисье, состоящее из труб, поршней, каридоров, и кучи всяких механизмов.\nСаунтрек: \n   Прекрасен. Музыка шикарна. этот механический голос с помехами тоже сделан качественно. МИНУС только в русской озвучке! Отвратительная озвучка! Даже кое где путается пол главного героя!

Почти в каждой фразе есть долька сарказма, черного юмора или просто забаного ляпа.\nОстальное:\n   Имеются посхалки и их достаточно, что безусловно плюс. Бонусные карты для тех кому надоело проходить одно и тоже а игра нравится. Включают в себя усложненые уровни, те же уровни, но с допольнительными задачами (например пройти за минимум времени) и добавление своих уровней созданных в Hammer. Достижения - первое на что я обращаю внимание.\nВЫВОД: \n   Игра, безусловно, лудшая из тех, что я играл, не смотря на то , что это только игра-эксперемент. Показывает, талантлевость Valve, которые даже маленькую работу сделают гениально\nрекомендую играть, но опять же с английским языком.\nОЦЕНКА: 9/10 (из-за некоторых багов)","timestamp_created":1425770248,"timestamp_updated":1425770248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14783713","author":{"steamid":"76561198021222815","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":119,"last_played":1501435952},"language":"english","review":"The only bad thing about this game is the fact that it has an ending","timestamp_created":1425768135,"timestamp_updated":1425768135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14780554","author":{"steamid":"76561198056264254","num_games_owned":761,"num_reviews":137,"playtime_forever":292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":166,"last_played":1653345898},"language":"english","review":"Alright.

En el jugamos como Chell, una mujer sujeto de pruebas que tiene que escapar de los laboratorios abandonados de Aperture Science, mientras la inteligencia artificial que controla el complejo, GLaDOS, nos intenta detener mediante puzles que deberemos resolver utilizando una pistola capaz de abrir portales conectados entre si. Esta es la primera parte de la famosa saga de Valve Portal, que aunque solo consta de dos juegos, se ha echo mundialmente famosa por la dificultad de sus puzles, su lore o historia de fondo (situada en el mismo universo de Half Life), pero sobretodo por el carisma de sus personajes, que aunque en un principio parecen sencillos y planos, no tardan en despertar en nosotros simpatia o odio. El juego no es especialmente largo, mas bien lo contrario. Lo complete en poco mas de dos horas, jugandolo una segunda vez con los comentarios de los desarrolladores, no es un juego muy rejugable, pero hay algunos puzles extra al completarlo que lo alargan un poco mas. Mucho antes habia jugado a Portal 2 en PlayStation 3, cuya duracion, dificultad de puzles y historia han sido ampliados, ademas incluye un divertido modo multijugador cooperativo con el que pase un buen rato con amigos. Portal es una saga obligatoria para todo el que aprecie los juegos de puzles, asi que os recomendaria jugar a los dos, empezando por este, no os llevara mucho rato y os dejara con un buen sabor de boca, os lo garantizo.","timestamp_created":1425554353,"timestamp_updated":1425554491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14740432","author":{"steamid":"76561198076261587","num_games_owned":271,"num_reviews":127,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":621,"last_played":1445112050},"language":"english","review":"Short, but fun, and the atmosphere is really creepy.

Before I played Portal, I have heard about it, however I never considered giving it a try. However, I am a curious gamer and a very story-orientated individual, so I gave it a try after gifted to me.\n\nAnd oh my God, the experience I had from playing Portal. If you are sensitive to spoilers, I suggest you skip this review as of reading this text. Anyway, as I played this game, the more I got into it. Hearing GLaDOS's voice greet me in the stasis chamber gave me some odd sort of feeling inside me. Mixed emotions. Kind of like the chills. Waking up to the environment that I was in, it gave the perfect sense of knowing something was not right, but at the same time doing what you are assigned to do. From the moment I had picked up the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, I had a strong feeling that this was going to be a good game. \n\nNo violence, no drama, no pressured detail (at first), just utilizing portals as a rab lat for this company known as Aperture Science. The tests are fun to solve, and the difficulty increases as you progress. Eventually, you will need to know the technuiques that GLaDOS teaches you in the future. \n\nThe steady pace of completing this game kept on making me expect test after test, and when it got to the point where GLaDOS said that this was the last test, the schock on my face should have been photographed and kept in a museum. You had not idea how hard I was rushing to complete that particular test chamber. Chamber 19. The craving I had for cake was beyond a normal measure. And then, as I was waiting at the floating sliding platform, Valve's eerie music had started slowly escalating into a nightmaric melody. \n\nAnd my heart was racing as I was being slowly transported into the flames. It was then when I was exposed to the ghastly  interior of the Aperture Science research facility. You could hear now nervous GLaDOS was getting in her voice as you were nearing her lair. The excitement rushed in me as I was passing though each hidden passage, and this is when I realized \"I love this game.\" I have never played anything this passionate in subliminal level design and a story, which wasn't even that detailed. \n\nAnd the feeling I had when I had finally got to see GLaDOS's construct. The ending leaves you with so many questions, even some questions that you may have asked yourself during the actual game. And I have to admit, GLaDOS singing almost left me at the verge of tears.  I don't care what other game Valve makes, no matter how extraordinary. Even Half-Life 2. This game will ALWAYS have that special place within my heart. What would I rate this game? A 10/10.","timestamp_created":1425342253,"timestamp_updated":1425342253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14730909","author":{"steamid":"76561198181046158","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":81,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1427409667},"language":"english","review":"One word for you: amazing","timestamp_created":1425338957,"timestamp_updated":1425338957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14730487","author":{"steamid":"76561198115817619","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1636044702},"language":"english","review":"Very quick, fun with friends, plenty of extra stuff.","timestamp_created":1425336273,"timestamp_updated":1425336273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14729900","author":{"steamid":"76561198077796889","num_games_owned":943,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1425239828},"language":"english","review":"The Greatest Puzzle game ever made","timestamp_created":1425332885,"timestamp_updated":1425332885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14727702","author":{"steamid":"76561198075028090","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":668,"last_played":1419692340},"language":"english","review":"Hoopy The Hoop will  be forever remembered..

I have 17 hours of gameplay and I am still stuck in the Least Time Challenges (call me a noob xP). Some people say that it is bad because the story have 2 hours and it's not worth the full price. But there is much more in Portal than the Story mode. To beat 100% of the game, you need to put all of the radios in a certain place, disconect lots of cameras from the wall and, after that, beat the advanced test chambers and the challenges. And let's not forget the game's secret lore. You can find 5 Rattman Dens in this game, with lots of strange drawings that reveal secret parts of the game.\nI'll say it again, it's one of the best puzzle games I've already played.
