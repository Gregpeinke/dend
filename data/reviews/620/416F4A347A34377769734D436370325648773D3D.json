It's simple controls and puzzle-based gameplay was something I hadn't seen in a first-person-shooter. Replacing enemies with lateral thinking, weapons with a portal gun, and all the anatagonists with a hyper-intelligent.\nPortal 2, however, doesn't just leave off where Portal ended. It takes where Portal ended and blows it up like the deathstar. I mean, it's one of those rare sequals that just leaves the original in the dust. \n\nWaking up years after the first ends; the facility is in major disarray and GlaDOS is awake and still on a mission to kill you; for science! Rather than just a few puzzle rooms; this game has an entire facility. You finally get the unimaginable scope of how big the center was. And just when you think the game is over and you've defeated GlaDOS; well, the game is just getting started. \n\nIt's a game that redefined gaming; how you can take a bunch of really cool concepts and build not just a game out of it; but an entire world. Everyone's raved about this game, and for good reason; it's *THAT* good. It's also relatively family friendly; a rarity in todays gaming world. There's no real blood; you don't shoot anything  but Portals; and the only time you die is when computerized turrets shoot you. Replace the violence for complex puzzles, add a big old glob of humor and you get Portal 2.\n\nBuy it; play it. If you don't like it, then you're not a human.","timestamp_created":1387729729,"timestamp_updated":1387729729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8200181","author":{"steamid":"76561198053332764","num_games_owned":347,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":575,"last_played":1575163394},"language":"english","review":"The game is near impossible at times yet is easy once you figure it out.

This is by far one of the best tutorials I have ever seen, as it manages to add this stage somewhat into the story. You head back to bed and are woken up again after what the computer states as \"9-9-9-9-9-9-9... years\", to find someone knocking on the door. You open it and find a small robot sphere named Wheatley, and this is where the real journey begins.\n\nMultiplayer (or co-operative) campaign\nYou play as one of two robots, Atlas or P-body; with your partner playing as the other. It is set after the singleplayer campaign, and challenges you to think in an entirely different way. It features the same testing elements, but completely new test chambers. Unfortunately, when playing co-op on Mac or PC, you require a friend who also has bought Portal 2 to play this mode (unless you have a controller, but split-screen on a computer monitor is awful).
