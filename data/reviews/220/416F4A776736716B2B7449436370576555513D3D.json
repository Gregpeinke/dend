There isn’t much detail compared to more recent games, textures are blurry, and there are problems with lighting and shadows. All of that is true, but it really isn’t fair to criticize the game for that…it was made in 2004, and it looks like it was, but that doesn’t take away from how fun it is to play. And besides, if you’re really concerned about the graphics, you can always download one of the free community mods ([url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/290930/]Half-Life 2: Update[/url] for example) which make it look prettier.\n\nOn to my thoughts on the gameplay. I think the reason Half-Life 2 was (and still is) so successful is because the gameplay constantly evolves as you progress forward. As soon as you become comfortable, you’re presented with something which changes how you can approach each situation. After playing the beginning – which feels like a fairly standard shooter – you’re given the airboat and giant arenas to play around with. After a while of that, they give you a machine gun on the airboat, changing up how you use it. Then you’re given the gravity gun, and immediately thrust into Ravenholm, a haunting and creepy environment filled with saw blades, barrels, and other things you can throw at enemies. Then comes the dune buggy and ant-lions, and some of my favorite sections of the game. Traveling down Highway 17, dodging ant-lions as you ferret out combine strongholds on the coast, showcases some of the best that Half-Life 2 has to offer.\n\nBut the game isn’t done throwing new things at you. After fighting the ant-lions, you’re given a tool which makes them your allies, and you use them to assault Nova Prospekt, a claustrophobic prison where you’re given access to automated turrets and have to stand your ground against waves of Combine soldiers. Once you’ve escaped Nova Prospekt, you’re thrown into a full-blown rebellion and given command of a squad of resistance fighters. And then finally, at the end of the game, all of your weapons are taken away except for a super-powered gravity gun, and you get to experience what it’s like to throw men around like rag dolls as you rampage through the citadel.\n\nNot all of these are executed perfectly – the squad command sections in particular hilariously showcase the shortcomings of the AI, with companions constantly getting in your way, running out to die from snipers or grenades, and generally acting like morons. Some of the pacing, particularly at the beginning of the game as you run through sewer after sewer and later as you crawl through Nova Prospekt, is tedious and repetitive. But it’s worth playing through those sections to see what comes next, because there’s always something new around the corner.\n\nHalf-Life 2 still does a far better job than most recent games in shifting the game’s paradigm constantly, and that evolving gameplay makes it successful – and fun to play over a decade later. If it’s been a while since you played it, it’s worth it to revisit it. If you’ve never played it before, it won’t wow you with its looks, but you’ll experience a classic with some of the best gameplay around – and widely considered one of the best games ever made.\n\nView the full review [url=http://www.thesewall.com/?p=656]here[/url].","timestamp_created":1456158558,"timestamp_updated":1456158558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637267708778381348","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21385109","author":{"steamid":"76561198153516991","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1076,"last_played":1590397906},"language":"russian","review":"Легендарная игра,актуальная до сих пор.Гордон делает дела.(2016).Всё ещё делает дела(2017)","timestamp_created":1456145483,"timestamp_updated":1511450364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21384598","author":{"steamid":"76561198133808577","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":661,"last_played":1434831218},"language":"russian","review":"халфа , халВа , без разницы , главное что она есть 11/10","timestamp_created":1456143116,"timestamp_updated":1456143116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21382952","author":{"steamid":"76561198259178423","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":175,"last_played":1640516379},"language":"russian","review":"Игра хорошая но у меня пропала русская озвучка помогите.","timestamp_created":1456135490,"timestamp_updated":1456135490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21380954","author":{"steamid":"76561198130547883","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":56,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1604108497},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2 is a true classic and has revolutionized the fps genre by combining great gameplay mechanics with a great storyline as well as amazing character design.","timestamp_created":1456123933,"timestamp_updated":1456123933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21380487","author":{"steamid":"76561198262840923","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1609811068},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1456121177,"timestamp_updated":1456121177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21379845","author":{"steamid":"76561198102268162","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":474,"last_played":1616540583},"language":"english","review":"This time you can't forget about Freeman.

Who is the Gman? Where are these places? What is he talking about? before you have time to ponder these questions, a loud horn interrupts you, as you are thrown straight into the game. you take a short monorail ride into City 17, and the game exhibits its art direction very well in this first section taking place in City 17. After events transpire, you are thrown into the action yet again, this time by yourself and only a crowbar to defend yourself. this is where the game introduces its combat system, and let me take this moment to say that this is one of the reasons i love this game. instead of showing you annoying tooltips that pop onto the screen, obscuring your vision, the game instead has you learn from experience how to use weapons. this game has a very old school feel to its combat system, and i really cant stress enough how good the combat feels and how precise it can be at times. over time, the story has you travelling to many different, beautiful looking locations (for a game from 2004, the graphical fidelity stands up surpisingly well, and at times looks better than many games being released nowadays) battling more intimidating foes as you go on. this can create some truly amazing moments in the story, such as when you battle a helicopter using an airboat with a machine gun mounted on the top of it. the sound design is good too, the music is never annoying, and the gun sounds never get on your nerves after hearing them thousands of times. in wanting to not spoil the game for those who have not played it, let me say that there are some truly emotional moments in the game, as well as some clever twists and turns placed here and there.\n\nlet me end this review off with saying that, if you have not played Half-Life 2 yet, please do yourself a huge favor and purchase this game. you will not regret your decision one bit. it has truly changed the way i view games.","timestamp_created":1456090525,"timestamp_updated":1456090525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525179862976074219","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21373653","author":{"steamid":"76561198174489037","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":40819,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6378,"last_played":1643040249},"language":"russian","review":"Спасти мир\nПокататься на багги и водном катамаране, побыть в роли муравьиной матки, поуправлять огромным подъемным краном, пострелять из разных стволов, побаловаться с грави-пушкой, поиграть в мяч с огромным металлическим псом, убить десяток страйдеров и... в итоге спасти мир...\n\nНостальгия\nВторая часть культовой серии Half-life, изменившая наше представление о том, какими прыжками может прогрессировать гейм-индустрия.

This game has puzzle elements, driving elements, stealth elements, and horror elements in addition to the great FPS theme and the great story. At one point, I had to go on catwalks under a bridge to get to the other side, only to have to fight to the end and disable the shield blocking my way across the top of the bridge with my car, but then to have to fight a gunship and go all the way back to my car and then drive over the bridge. In many games, that would have felt boring but in this game it felt fun and immersive, probably because of the weight on my character's shoulders to succeed. I didn't want to fail, because I knew the reward would be a new weapon or the satisfaction of saving the Resistance.\n\n The town of Ravenholm was genuinely freaky, and whenever I heard the gutter shake I shuddered. The airboat and buggy (car) levels are genuinely fun and bring an extra level of fun and immersiveness. By far my favorite part was commanding antlions in the prison of Nova Prospekt. I got so much satisfaction out of leading my antlions to victory against the detachments of Combine soldiers. The turret battles in Entanglement add to the feeling of being a commander, and the squad mechanics in Anticitizen One only reinforce that feeling.\n\n I have played through only 10 of the levels (Anticitizen One) and played 25 hours as of the posting of this review, but it feels like me and Gordon have been comrades for a lot longer than that. This game is hard, but doesn't make you retry something 20 times, because you get it right the 4th or 5th time. Each level takes about 1 hr with a walkthrough (http://www.visualwalkthroughs.com/halflife2/halflife2walkthrough.htm) and 1.5 to 2 hrs without one, but Route Kanal, Water Hazard, We Don't Go To Ravenholm, Anticitizen One, and Follow Freeman may take longer (2.5 to 3 hrs at the longest), making Half-Life 2 a medium length game.\n\n The graphics are good (not that amazing in comparison to games like Shadow of Mordor) but hold up ok today, and they are pretty realistic (if you aren't that picky about HD graphics or extremely detailed sprites). The gameplay is pretty immersive, and the controls and handling are pretty good. The story and character development are extremely good, especially for a FPS, which are usually about gameplay, and usually don't focus on story or graphics. The world in Half-Life 2 felt alive, and I felt the character's emotions and understood their feelings. The world felt like it was real, and Anticitizen One made me sad inside, how City 17 was plunged into a conflict with zombies, fire, and destroyed property everywhere, and the Resistance had to fight to be free and live in peace.\n\n This game will make you feel emotional. The OK graphics, great gameplay, amazing story, immersive world, and the diversity of themes that allow anyone to enjoy multiple game types (driving, FPS, parkour, puzzle) and can introduce anyone to new game types brought me to a final rating of 9.5/10. The game is dated a little, but it still holds up well (The Xbox 360 and PS3 versions in The Orange Box were also amazing). Anyone who wants to call themselves a gamer should play Half-Life 2.","timestamp_created":1456022202,"timestamp_updated":1464436425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21354243","author":{"steamid":"76561198264525033","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":106,"last_played":1607345711},"language":"schinese","review":"神作

I must admit, through the first half of the game, I was becoming bored. It just seemed as though I was doing the same thing all the time. However, one thing I did pick up was the puzzles. There were some puzzles that got me confused during the first half of the game, and I find that to be a very creative thing to add in to this kind of game. It has a sci-fi element, and when puzzles and sci-fi are put together, it really does create an amazing experience. \n\nDuring the second half of the game, I found I was starting to enjoy the game more. I'd began to rush through the game due to it's massive story line. By rushing, I mean I sprinted and jumped and just full-out went in shooting enemies and picking up those health kits ASAP. It really was a big help and I died a lot less - believe it or not. \n\nNew enemies were introduced in the second half and I found it really cool about 3/4 into the game where something special about one of the enemies had came up. I won't say any more due to the fact that I don't want to give spoilers. \n\nAt the end of the game, I felt amazed. The last level really was something, and it was totally worth the wait, as I had been told by a couple of people that have played the game before me. Everything they said was true. The last level really is worth the countless hours of gameplay to get there, and the main enemy behind all of the... chaos... was amazing.\n\nThe ending made me a little bit confused - but I think that was supposed to happen. You can find out for yourself when you play the game. ;)\n\nDuring the game, there are a lot of conversations that you have to stand and listen to (or ignore) before you can continue the level. This was very fraustrating for me, and you may fidn it fraustrating as well. A couple of friends have told me that it was also very fraustrating for them, too.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game really was a big step towards the new games that are produced now. All of it's creativity seems to have been expanded into lots of AAA games out there right now and improved. I'd rate this game 7/10 due to it being a little bit long-winded - but trust me, it's totally worth it. Also I deducted another point due to the un-skippable conversations that you have to go through.\n\nAlso, there is a free update for the graphics. I have not used it for my gameplay experience, but you, personally, might like some better graphics. So go on the Steam Store and get \"Half-Life 2: Update\" for free once you have bought the main game. :)","timestamp_created":1455818137,"timestamp_updated":1455819237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512820541858673096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21297056","author":{"steamid":"76561198125331335","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":3218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":2128,"last_played":1659796698},"language":"english","review":"this game is a must play if you like TF2, portal 2, left 4 dead and other source game. this is because the source engine was desinged for this game.\nthe games mechanics are so good and the story is excellent.\nthe only downside is for how long some of the levels are (for a first time playthough they can take over an hour)\nthis game scores 9/10","timestamp_created":1455807124,"timestamp_updated":1455807124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21296036","author":{"steamid":"76561198204470563","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":544,"last_played":1532366924},"language":"russian","review":"nice game recoming and play(nice english)\n","timestamp_created":1455803968,"timestamp_updated":1455803968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21295442","author":{"steamid":"76561198101207887","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2979,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2632,"last_played":1576257155},"language":"french","review":"best game ever","timestamp_created":1455802110,"timestamp_updated":1455802110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg6qk+tICcpWeUQ=="}
