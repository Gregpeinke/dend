Она спрашивает, почему бы и нет?»[/h1]\n\nТяжелая жизнь у нашей главной героини. После победы над [b]G.L.a.D.O.S,[/b] Челл получает не долгожданную свободу, а кровать в «камере релаксации» с добровольно-принудительным предложением стазиса. Бывшая испытуемая засыпает на многие сотни лет, и просыпается в далеком будущем. В дверь её камеры стучится наш новый компаньон – модуль на монорельсе по имени Уитли. Комплекс на грани полного коллапса, и он решается на побег, заодно захватив нас в качестве помощника в этом нелегком деле.\n\nПосле небольшой экскурсии по развалинам исследовательского центра, мы возвращаемся в главную камеру [b]G.L.a.D.O.S.[/b], дабы найти спасательную капсулу. Увы и ах, методом научного тыка находится только способ воскресить злобную машину. Недовольная нашим поведением в прошлом, «Королева Комплекса» отправляет нас прогнать еще пару кружков по камерам с испытаниями, во благо матушки-науки.\n\n[b]Сюжет[/b] стал масштабнее, интереснее и гораздо живее. Потрясающие диалоги персонажей, множество неожиданных поворотов и несколько раскрытых секретов старой корпорации ждут вас в вашем опасном путешествии по останкам комплекса Aperture Science.\n\n[b]Механика игры[/b] со времен оригинала не претерпела сильных изменений. Появились энергетические мосты, туннели-воронки, способные переносить игрока и предметы, лазеры, а так же разнообразные гели. О последних поподробнее. Всего их три типа – первый позволяет отталкиваться от себя и высоко прыгать, второй значительно увеличивает вашу скорость передвижения и третий, позволяющий ставить порталы там, где он пролит.\n\n[b]Музыкальное сопровождение[/b] все так же ласкает слух своим потрясающим звучанием. Стиль электроники просто идеально подходит под ритм игры.\n\nНо и это еще не все. В игре появился режим [b]кооперативного прохождения[/b], в котором нам отведена роль двух роботов-испытуемых, которым уготована та же судьба, что и [b]Челл[/b] – проходить камеры испытаний [b]G.L.a.D.O.S.[/b]\n\nИ еще один приятный бонус от [b]Valve[/b] – в одном из бесплатных DLC была добавлена поддержка Мастерской Steam, а это значит, что теперь можно скачивать разнообразные камеры, сделанные сообществом, находясь прямо в игре.\n\nЭто безусловный [b]шедевр[/b] от мастеров своего дела, продолжение превзошедшее оригинал. Если вам хоть немного, но понравился первый [b]Portal[/b], то во вторую часть вы просто обязаны сыграть.\n\n[b]Оценка игре по 10-ти бальной шкале: 10/10[/b]","timestamp_created":1419177671,"timestamp_updated":1433927356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.455841511487960815","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13501254","author":{"steamid":"76561198089284926","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":790,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":534,"last_played":1466986374},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy entretenido, adoro el cambio e personalidad que tuvo glados haciendola uno de mis personajes favoritos, ademas el modo multijugador da muchisimo mas juego\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1419177600,"timestamp_updated":1419177600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13501246","author":{"steamid":"76561198113964621","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":1475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":883,"last_played":1499282511},"language":"czech","review":"Skvělá logická hra s kapkou humoru :)\nTa kapka je trochu větší :D","timestamp_created":1419177573,"timestamp_updated":1419177573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13500787","author":{"steamid":"76561198122274674","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1638,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":593,"last_played":1615307952},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego fantástico.

Тут в место сурового мужика мы играем за девушку Челл и надо разгадывать головоломки имея на руках только портальную пушку и то, что нам подготовили на следующем уровне и из всего это надо сделать так, чтобы двери выхода открылись. Хоть по сути это линейное прохождение головоломок, сюжет тут весьма интригующий и с неожиданными поворотами, от котороых у меня, если чесно, отвисла челюсть. Особо порадовало \"тёплое пробуждение\" и потом твою комнатушку в который мы спали, если я правильно расслышал ближайшие лет 50 после первого портала и разносят в щепки. \n\nО персонажах.Тут их всего 3, Уитли, Гладос и Диктатор. Хоть тут всего 2 активных персонажа и один пассивный (и то Диктор просто запись голоса), но каждый со своими отличительыми чертами характера. Уитли, без умолку болтающий по поводу и без, но весьма вежливый, что удивительно. Также Гладос со своими причудами и любительницей небольшого чёрного юмора и сакрастических шуточек ипопытками в ходе тестов ненароком вас убить. Но, после того как Уитли (АДСКИЙ СПОЙЛЕР) вы явно пересмотрите свои взгляды касательно этих двух роботов, если играете в первый раз. Ещё в паре задач присутствует элемент аркады, когда надо играть наперегонки со временем, в то время когда оно безжалостновочно тикает не в твою пользу. \n\nКак я уже писал выше, головоломки тут способны запутать, но если глаз намётан, а с логикой вы лучшие друзья то эта игра не составит для вас труда. По мере продвижения по сюжету они будут разумеется будут становится всё сложней и смертельно опасней будут задачки.

Also, the controls are very basic.\n\n+The music played can change your mood in an instant. Some of it can be very creepy and adds a lot of suspense to the game.\n\n+The graphics are beautiful and really enhance the quality of the game.\n\n+The puzzles are challenging and require thought and attention to detail, though there were a couple puzzles that I actually had to look up how to solve because of their difficulty. \n\n+The storyline of the game is very immersive and really keeps you on your toes, especially after a couple of plot twists. \n\n+The characters are funny and lovable, and though there aren't many, you get to know each and every one. (My personal favorite is Rick the Adventure Sphere, you'll meet him at the end...he's hilarious)\n\n+The level creator/editor is easy to use, very innovative, and is open to everyone. Also, once you've created a chamber you can submit it to the public for others to try.\n\n+Building on my last point, you can play test chambers built by others and there are always new ones being submitted, causing the game to continually have new, playable content added.\n\n+The co-op is easy to find and use, even for beginners. There is no complicated server set up or anything of that sort. \n\n+There is a challenge mode available for those of you willing to try. I haven't attempted it yet, so I cannot give you my opinion on it.\n\n\n+The ending of the game is easily one of the best endings in game history.\n\nCons:\n-When choosing a chapter to start at (after you finish the game), there is no insight to what goes on in that chapter or where you start at. This is especially difficult when you are trying to replay a certain point.\n\n-When you are loading a save, you don't really know where you were/start at. It just says the chapter # and name and the date/time you saved. I have so many different saves, so this confused me quite a bit. \n\nOverall rating: 9.5/10, exceptional\nNote:The plot can be kind of difficult to grasp at first if you didn't play the first game, but I feel you get enough of a backround to understand what is going on. I would recommend playing the first game before beginning this one, unlike me.","timestamp_created":1419107963,"timestamp_updated":1432414822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13480932","author":{"steamid":"76561198153227879","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":12155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":398,"playtime_at_review":4996,"last_played":1660143237},"language":"english","review":"very fun play it","timestamp_created":1419107560,"timestamp_updated":1419107560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13480643","author":{"steamid":"76561198088109003","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1422489565},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom jogo","timestamp_created":1419106721,"timestamp_updated":1419106721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13480113","author":{"steamid":"76561198111827528","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6338,"last_played":1587821253},"language":"english","review":"If you like to think you will enjoy in this game hundreds of hours-the community keep posting custom made puzzels every day so every day you can give your mind a little challenge.GRAB THIS GAME","timestamp_created":1419105252,"timestamp_updated":1419105252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13479733","author":{"steamid":"76561198108924483","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1581555654},"language":"spanish","review":"[h1]Trobo que el joc és molt complet.[/h1] Amb una campanya llarga i una mecànica al Workshop que dóna molt de si.
