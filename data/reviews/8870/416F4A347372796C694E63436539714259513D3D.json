You need to read the review section for one the best FPS of this century? Ok. Fine. Maybe you are reading this because you want to know the bad things, so here are some of the flaws of the game. \n\nFirst of all, the guns aren't as unique as in the other BioShock games. In the first games whe you upgraded your gun it looked slightly diferent, adding some wires that indicated where the upgrade went. But in this game when you upgrade the guns they look exactly the same. Also now you are limited to carry only 2 guns instead of 9.\n\nSecond, there's only one ending, which means that whatever you choose in the game does not care at the end, because it'll be exactly the same.\n\nThird, if you have played any of the other games you may have felt a little bit afraid because of the environment: underwater, alone, most of the time in the dark, and even there was some jumpscares like when you encounter the first Houdini Splicer in the first BioShock (THAT WAS AWESOME!). But here everything is so colorful that you can't feel fear anymore... sort of.\n\nAt this point you may be asking: why the flying hell is this guy recomending the game then? Well that's because in this game the pro's are much more than the cons, and even the cons are skipable: the guns may look the same always but there a nice variety on them. You may miss the crossbow or the chemical thrower but still you have the volley gun and the Burston (my personal favourites). Yes, maybe there aren't multiple endings but the story here y so mindblowing that I think what we have is more than enough, it'll be weeks until you stop thinking about it. And the environment is diferent, but is great because it completely goes with the tone of the game: you're in the goddamn flying city! why would you want it to be dark? And even in this environment you can feel afraid because you feel small in such a huge city (A FLYING CITY!).\n\nSeriously, is a great game, is a must buy, just pick it up before the Aspyr offer goes away. it's genuinely a 9/10.","timestamp_created":1473981236,"timestamp_updated":1473981236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25517887","author":{"steamid":"76561198285947075","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1654,"last_played":1482290658},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game 1000/10","timestamp_created":1473976267,"timestamp_updated":1473976267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25517589","author":{"steamid":"76561198081675837","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1062,"last_played":1527357814},"language":"spanish","review":"OBRA MAESTRA.

После концовки я просто сидел, слушал музыку, понимал что идут титры и тупо смотрел в одну точку, пытаясь больше понять сижет и, можно сказать, обсмаковать его, это чувство не передать, игра тысячелетия, без сомнений. 10/10, просто 10/10","timestamp_created":1473777965,"timestamp_updated":1473777965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25494495","author":{"steamid":"76561198120372159","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":583,"last_played":1588756346},"language":"spanish","review":"Es una pedazo pieza de arte, una obra maestra totalmente recomendable y súper entretenido.(Y no solo este todos los bioshocks).","timestamp_created":1473775827,"timestamp_updated":1473775827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5026053786277771","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25494257","author":{"steamid":"76561197993567902","num_games_owned":505,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":947,"last_played":1524643703},"language":"french","review":"Pour moi le meilleur FPS solo de ces dernières années.","timestamp_created":1473774897,"timestamp_updated":1473774897,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502373933792114258","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25493600","author":{"steamid":"76561198042073089","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":959,"last_played":1447349433},"language":"brazilian","review":"Conclusão primorosa de um clássico moderno, um jogo que ficara eternizado, com sua historia e narrativa envolventes, que nos leva a um futuro distópico nunca antes imaginado, vale todo tempo e dinheiro investido.","timestamp_created":1473772002,"timestamp_updated":1473772002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25492949","author":{"steamid":"76561197977507266","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1915,"last_played":1475056732},"language":"tchinese","review":"精彩的遊戲體驗與獨特的世界架構。\n\nMasterpiece","timestamp_created":1473768997,"timestamp_updated":1574780684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25492399","author":{"steamid":"76561198070952206","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3223,"last_played":1658943401},"language":"russian","review":"Пожалуй, лучшая игра этого тысячелетия!

Эта игра заставит вас подумать (так как игроку не сразу выдается вся информация, и приходится собирать все по крупицам как пазл), переживать эмоции персонажей, а так же задумать о смысле своей жизни и поступках которые ты совершил или не совершил, и о последствиях своих действий. \n\nОбязательна к прохождению!!! \n\nИз плюсов: \n+ чудесная графика \n+ шикарное музыкальное сопровождение \n+ сюжет \n+ атмосфера \n+ хорошо подобранные слова и моменты заставляющие игрока переживать эмоции персонажей \n\nИз минусов: \n- отсутствие русской озвучки, весомая чать реплик происходит во время сражений, и встает выбор либо читать субтитры либо отстреливать противника \n- огрехи с оптимизацией, иногда карта подгружается прямо во время сражений, или просто ходьбы \n\n10\\10","timestamp_created":1473560491,"timestamp_updated":1473560662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25454250","author":{"steamid":"76561198068689037","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":699,"last_played":1591744994},"language":"brazilian","review":"SENSACIONAL","timestamp_created":1473558837,"timestamp_updated":1473558837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25451323","author":{"steamid":"76561198168728803","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":100,"playtime_forever":280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":280,"last_played":1473205362},"language":"english","review":"It's not scary like Bioshock 1 and 2 and has a different story, different setting, and is just a way different type of game but still has the Bioshock feel.","timestamp_created":1473543910,"timestamp_updated":1473543910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507042229175567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25449701","author":{"steamid":"76561198129584161","num_games_owned":769,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":858,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":858,"last_played":1472069522},"language":"english","review":"My brain, it's hurts!","timestamp_created":1473537683,"timestamp_updated":1473537683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25448416","author":{"steamid":"76561198041216494","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":631,"last_played":1473640801},"language":"english","review":"It gud","timestamp_created":1473532919,"timestamp_updated":1473532919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25444720","author":{"steamid":"76561198082787365","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":965,"last_played":1474492279},"language":"english","review":"Good Visuals","timestamp_created":1473520214,"timestamp_updated":1473520214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25443650","author":{"steamid":"76561198002274027","num_games_owned":373,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1952,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1281,"last_played":1641129062},"language":"polish","review":"Absolutnie godna polecenia -
