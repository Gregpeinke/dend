Para aqueles jogadores mais \"hardcore\" que como eu que quer descobrir e fazer tudo que o jogo tem a disposição vai se deparar com 15 horas de gameplay, nesse tempo você vai ficar fascinado em explorar cada centímetro dos mapas para sentir aquele prazer único de encontrar os easter egg que vão aos poucos revelando os mistérios da história, depois de descobrir tudo que há para ser visto ainda haverá longas horas de desafios onde os ranks globais irão fazer você buscar diminuir cada segundo na conclusão de uma fase. Conclusão: o jogo passa uma atmosfera encantadora além de ser muito desafiante, o tempo de jogo para a platina é em torno de 15 horas porém os desafios são entretenimento infinito (ou até você ver seu nome entre os primeiros).
