Me quedo con Bill, Francis, Louis y Zoey en vez de Nick, Ellis, Coach y Rochelle porque son personajes más notorios y geniales. Sin embargo, L4D 2 lo supera en variedad de armas y tiene más zombies especiales. Cabe mencionar que el L4D2 contiene el L4D con todas sus misiones y personajes pero con algunos cambios como la inclusión de las nuevas armas del L4D2 y a mi parecer esta mucho más facil en el L4D2.

Destina parte de tu adrenalina en liquidar zombies. Obviamente, comparado con su sucesor, es bastante básico. Tiene menos infectados especiales (tank, hunter, witch, smoker y boomer), muy pocos modelos de zombie ya que se repiten demasiado, pocas armas, deben haber aproximadamente 10. Tiene buena música, buena calidad de sonido, gráficos e interfaz. La IA de los bots es bastante inútil o estúpida, haciendote un poco más difícil el juego en modos individuales. El mapeo del juego es espectacular, los mapas supervivencia son muy buenos (estan hechos para sobrevivir unos muy pocos minutos mas a comparación del L4D2). Recomiendo este juego para los amantes de los zombies, los fans de la saga y para quien quiera comprar un juego que provea mucho a un precio muy barato.\nUn detalle extra que tiene es cuando juegas solo, la pausa en el modo supervivencia, cosa que su sucesor no tiene.\nPD: el 2 trae el 1 en si, pero solo los personajes en sus respectivos mapas, y estos últimos para el supervivencia. Utilizan todas las armas del 2.","timestamp_created":1487349931,"timestamp_updated":1586706217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.424519985914230347","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29981445","author":{"steamid":"76561198324496049","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":10963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":396,"last_played":1576354079},"language":"english","review":"awesome game","timestamp_created":1487328377,"timestamp_updated":1487328377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503197789192199707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29980323","author":{"steamid":"76561198335310300","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":89,"playtime_forever":505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":505,"last_played":1590235710},"language":"russian","review":".","timestamp_created":1487323742,"timestamp_updated":1631994333,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29978263","author":{"steamid":"76561198337704084","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1485,"last_played":1498049685},"language":"russian","review":"Друг познается в беде!

When playing multiplayer the ability to achieve your goal is dependent on how well you can work with each other. While some people take charge and try to organize the group immediately, others are good at following instructions. There are those who don't like to take orders, or just aren't good at working as a team. How well you work together usually dictates the outcome of the game. Having clocked over four hundred hours on this game, I've played with all kind of people and have made some awesome friends while doing it. It is, in my humble opinion, the best zombie game ever created. The only part of it I've ever had difficulty with is playing vs as a zombie. It's a little difficult to get use to the mechanics of the zombies, but once practiced you get use to it. Some quick advice if you're going to be playing mulit player. Remember line of sight is a real thing, use crouch to avoid getting shot by your teammates if you're going to be in front. Before I play with others after a long stint I usually practice for a bit on single player to get use to the game and maps again. ;) Stay cool, and don't forget to buy the game. Also gnomes are evil, don't save the gnome. lol","timestamp_created":1487188630,"timestamp_updated":1487188630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn7PWodoCfZ2fcg=="}
