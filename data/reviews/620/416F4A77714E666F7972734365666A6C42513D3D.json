It is a FANTASTIC game that improves upon EVERY aspect of the original Portal! It has a surprisingly engaging story, great characters who you actually care about, expertly written humor, great acting, and challenging gameplay that can be frustrating at times, but fun and stimulating! \n\nThis game is also rich in content! You get a great single player campaign, a co-op mode that allows for great communication even without voice chat, and on top of that there is a built in level creator that allows for limitless content! If you haven't bought Portal 2 by now do yourself a favor and BUY IT! It is on sale quite frequently and is worth whatever price is listed honestly!\n\nSo go BUY IT!
