The subtleties made this game. How in the beginning when the lutece's are talking, and Robert tells her that he DOESN'T row. He doesn't mean that booker is physically incapable or rowing, he means there is no conceivable universe in which Booker rows the boat AND achieves his destiny. Such a great line.","timestamp_created":1585946911,"timestamp_updated":1585946911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66530818","author":{"steamid":"76561198117443083","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1062,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":635,"last_played":1586147036},"language":"english","review":"this is a good game by itself, doesnt really feel like a bioshock game to me as i played through the game. a lot of the charm from the first two game kind of disappeared in this game","timestamp_created":1585946894,"timestamp_updated":1585946894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66530649","author":{"steamid":"76561198422341476","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1586480554},"language":"brazilian","review":"bom jogo","timestamp_created":1585946718,"timestamp_updated":1585946718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66530513","author":{"steamid":"76561198185226605","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":710,"last_played":1585946486},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun harika bir hikayeye sahip tavsiye ederim.","timestamp_created":1585946569,"timestamp_updated":1585946569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66528462","author":{"steamid":"76561198263024930","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":1786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1783,"last_played":1591898588},"language":"english","review":"Incredible game, from start to finish.","timestamp_created":1585944546,"timestamp_updated":1592672997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66523704","author":{"steamid":"76561197970390340","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":422,"last_played":1585939654},"language":"english","review":"I don´t know... maybe i totally dont get this game. To me it seems lackluster and unwilling to tell a story (which i don´t get at all). The gunplay is no fun, the enemys are impossible to locate unless they shoot at you and these tears make it hard to navigate through the levels. The scale of everything is kind of wrong (the enviroment seems to be to big). \n\nHad it in my library after a sale and played it for two hours some years ago. now during the covid \"lockdown\" i gave it a new try and i am kind of just working it off. \n\nNot for me i guess :D","timestamp_created":1585939939,"timestamp_updated":1585939939,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66522151","author":{"steamid":"76561199009041453","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1586096724},"language":"english","review":"love the story and gameplay i think everyone does","timestamp_created":1585938494,"timestamp_updated":1585938494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo57ToPECd8Lh/QE="}
