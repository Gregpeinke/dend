And, yeah, there's less variety of weapons than in previous Half-Life games, but that's to be expected, since you're only playing as a Black Mesa security guard this time, not Freeman or a military guy. The ending is a bit abrupt too.\n\nBut who cares really, everything that made Half-Life great is here too - the tight, contiguous level design (the Duty Calls level is really clever, as is Power Struggle), the oh-so-satisfyingly gory blasts from grenades, the nice little tie-ins to previous games - for example you start in the same position as Freeman saw you in the first game banging on a door to be let in, and the G-Man makes another mysterious appearance. There are some cute touches like family pictures on Calhoun's locker to give some context, and makes it feel as if the whole thing's worth fighting for.

In it, you play as Barney Calhoun, a security guard who works at Black Mesa, the same facility in the main game. Several times through-out the game, you'll spot Gordan Freeman, which is a really neat touch. It really interwoves with the actual game's story. \n\nThe same type of story events play out just in different areas of the story. For example, the resonance cascade from the beginning of HL plays out with you on an elevator instead of in the test chamber. If you just chose to play this game without playing HL1, you'll be just as clueless as your hapless security guard. \n\nCompared to Opposing Force and the main game, this game is VERY short, and not as exciting as the other two. Unlike Opposing Force, this game doesn't add any new weapons. All of the weapons you get in this game are just from the main game. Nothing new.

Не курит, не пьет, примерный семьянин, ранее в Half-Life замечен не был. Впрочем, вру, — был. Помните, в самом начале игры Гордон проезжает мимо отчаянно колотящего рукой в дверь охранника? Так вот это и есть наш Барни. Обернись он тогда, и в проплывающем мимо вагоне увидел бы рыжего мужика в очках с невероятно толстой оправой...\nВ тот момент, когда Фримен прецизионным пинком толкнул злополучный кристалл в излучатель, устроив инцидент \"Лямбда\", Калхуна угораздило застрять в лифте вместе с парой яйцеголовых белохалатников. Через пару секунд лифт, следуя неписаным законам голливудщины, упал, и не в меру болтливые ученые окончательно заткнулись, оставив Барни в обществе плотоядной жовто-блакитной собачатины. Впрочем, я снова ошибаюсь. Там их было трое: псина, охранник и... его табельный пистолет.\nBlue Shift может с уверенностью претендовать на сомнительной чести лавры \"микро-Half-Life\": здесь есть абсолютно все, что публике нравилось в предыдущих сериях, разве что дозы стали гомеопатическими. Немножко скриптовых сценок — вот парочка зомбированных ученых буквально разрывает коллегу Барни надвое (кушать всем хочется!), не в меру наглые спецназовцы играючи швыряют охранников в колодец (за что поплатятся, если мазать не будете), а мордастые крокодило-чемоданы, смакуя, разжевывают бесхозные трупы. Чуть-чуть головоломок — хоть и одноклеточных, но не лишенных определенного изящества. К примеру, Барни придется соорудить импровизированный мостик, столкнув в бассейн полые бочки и заполнив его кислотой, — весьма оригинально! Наконец, сюжетные повороты, местами до скрежета зубовного напоминающие Half-Life, абсолютно идентичный оригинальному набор оружия и слегка подсокращенный зоопарк, напрочь лишенный следов т.н. \"боссов\". Как итог — аддон проходится за 3,5-4 часа на среднем уровне сложности. Зато тут есть камео вездесущего мужика-с-чемоданчиком. Впрочем, о наличии последнего вы уже и сами наверняка догадались.\nЧетыре часа ничем не омраченной радости — слишком мало для продукта стоимостью 30 долл. США, поэтому, стремясь повысить пресловутый \"product value\", Sierra дописала на диск с Blue Shift своего рода \"бонус\". Во-первых, это Gearbox'овский, опять же, Opposing Force, во-вторых, свежайший H-L-патч, и, в-третьих... а вот это уже интересно, друзья. Последним бонусом оказался High Definition Pack, который, будучи установленным на любую из трех частей игры, заменяет старые модели персонажей на те, что использовались в Dreamcast-версии. У охранников и ученых тут же хорошеют лица, появляются бэджи на лацканах и свободно болтающиеся (роскошная деталь!) галстуки... Монстры просто пышут высоким количеством полигонов — складки на сине-желтых спинках безголовых собачек плавно колышутся в такт их прыжкам, крокодилица истерически мотает обросшей алыми щупальцами мордой, демонстрируя предсмертный шпагат, а новый вид пораженных headcrab'ами людей вполне способен вызвать отторжение завтрака у самых нестойких. Вот вам и веская, с точки зрения Sierra, причина заново пройти Half-Life. Разумеется, для тех, кто игру не видел, комбинация \"Half-Life+Blue Shift\" получает рейтинг \"однозначный must play\". \n","timestamp_created":1499288835,"timestamp_updated":1499288835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33275864","author":{"steamid":"76561198094716594","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1499179734},"language":"english","review":"Oddly enough for a short play through that lasts almost 3 hours in length at a casual pace plus a few deaths, it's the least bothersome of the three games from the same era of half life canon during the events of black mesa.\n\nPlay as security officer Barney Calhoun as you head through the events before and after the the dimensional rift and the immediate aftermath of killing many alien creatures, both sentient and animal in order to escape.\n\nYou still got to swim through muck, being shot at, being attacked and beaten, and all the other lovely things that comes to someone involved in black mesa.","timestamp_created":1499262787,"timestamp_updated":1499262787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484475642442703247","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33269633","author":{"steamid":"76561198187800046","num_games_owned":367,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1628857831},"language":"schinese","review":"win10频繁闪退。","timestamp_created":1499251310,"timestamp_updated":1499251310,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48826107382774353","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33258234","author":{"steamid":"76561198313372701","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":367,"last_played":1499197770},"language":"schinese","review":"Great detail, neat plot, interesting side missions.

That's about how long it took me, and that's considering I got stuck in a few puzzles where I just couldn't figure what the f*ck I was supposed to do, one of them due to the awful scientist AI that refused to trigger a scripted event until I gave up and tried again the next day. Besides all of that, a lot of segments can be quite boring and uneventful. The ending fight sequence for example is really underwhelming, and there are many sections of the game where you have to stand around while an NPC talks, like Black Mesa East in HL2.\n\nOne thing that I really liked about Blue Shift was its version of Xen. It greatly expanded upon the original, which was pretty garbage. It actually feels like a real place with thought put behind it now, and it was probably the most interesting part of the entire expansion.\n\nStill, it's probably the weakest Half-Life game overall, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. I guess I do recommend it if you've finished HL1 and just want more of the same, although a bit of a watered down version of it. Also, I'd probably advise to play Blue Shift before Opposing Force, since I feel like a lot of my disappointment came from the fact that OF is just a much better experience.

O jogo foi desenvolvido pela Gearbox Software com a Valve e publicada pela Sierra Entertainment em 12 de junho de 2001. Blue Shift é a segunda expansão de Half-Life, pretendido ser parte de uma versão de Dreamcast do jogo original. Apesar desta versão ter sido cancelada, a versão para PC continuou em desenvolvimento como um produto separado. Foi lançado no Steam em 24 de agosto de 2005.\n\nNele, o jogador assume o controle de um segurança da Black Mesa, Barney Calhoun. Os inimigos são os mesmos de Half-Life, porém a expansão conta com algumas armas diferentes. O jogo também tem uma duração menor que o original. Barney passa por diversos pontos que interligam Half-Life e suas expansões, como o momento em que Gordon pula em um portal para entrar no planeta Xen, ou as diversas misteriosas aparições de G-Man. Juntamente com Blue-Shift.\n\nÒtimo game sensasional!!!","timestamp_created":1499050557,"timestamp_updated":1499050557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33151439","author":{"steamid":"76561198115906683","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":330,"last_played":1511534124},"language":"english","review":"Another wonderful expansion","timestamp_created":1499027425,"timestamp_updated":1503794859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33150996","author":{"steamid":"76561198080406252","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":329,"last_played":1485722645},"language":"english","review":"Just like Half-Life (1)","timestamp_created":1499026872,"timestamp_updated":1499026872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33126087","author":{"steamid":"76561198178615649","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":94,"playtime_forever":277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1590341918},"language":"russian","review":"История Барни из вселенной Half-Life","timestamp_created":1498993390,"timestamp_updated":1498993390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33116513","author":{"steamid":"76561198282953211","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1566065639},"language":"english","review":"This game has sent me on a long emotional journey, I had just done through a particularly bad breakup and I needed something with which to base my life around.  Then like a becon of hope I found Half Life, I quickly played through half life two and its episodes.  Then Blue Shift came, sending me deeper into the depths of despair, I wanted to quit playing, but then a met a person online, this was to be my undoing.  Advertising themselves as Gabe, this girl ( I later learned the true gender), urged me to continue in hopes i wouldn't join the thousands begging for half life three.  Having nothing like half life to base my life around my world crumbled.  Withen two years I was serving time for petty crime, and my cat had left me for a younger owner.  I knew what needed to be done, I would bury Blue Shift forever.  So I went to Steam (after my sentence expired) and wrote this review.  May this be a warning to you all, Blue Shift may look innocent but it is a life destroyer.","timestamp_created":1498974815,"timestamp_updated":1498974815,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.413228452205657959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33112680","author":{"steamid":"76561197992327417","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":240,"last_played":1498965530},"language":"english","review":"Great game.
