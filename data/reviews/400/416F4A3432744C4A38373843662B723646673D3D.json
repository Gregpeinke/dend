It is a combination of first person camera view with an almost pure puzzle solving game style which is an awesome combination in my opinion. \nThe events of Portal take place within the Half Life universe. During the game, you take control of Chell, who wakes up inside the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. You are informed by GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) that you will be participating in the testing of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. As you progress through the testing chamber, it becomes more readily apparent that all is not as it originally seemed.\nThe portal gun adds a whole new dimension to puzzle solving. All throughout the game, you are presented with situations that will seem near impossible to overcome. After some thought, it becomes clear how you can use the portal gun to solve the puzzle. As the game progresses,  the complexity of the puzzles increases and you often have to think two or three moves ahead in order to progress further.\nAfter you complete the game, two new modes, Challenge and Advanced, are unlocked. The Challenge mode forces players to solve the same puzzles again, but this time, with time or movement limits restricting them. Advanced mode simply ups the difficulty of puzzles by adding new obstacles and hazards.\nPortal is extremely short. It will take only a few hours to complete the whole game but the minimal time you will spend with the game, is well-worth the money.\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 9/10\nGameplay 9/10\nAtmosphere 9/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation\n\nAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA","timestamp_created":1373978998,"timestamp_updated":1489171234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":57,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.738851070404052734","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5722483","author":{"steamid":"76561198054694666","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":475,"last_played":1500122334},"language":"english","review":"Awesome","timestamp_created":1373976553,"timestamp_updated":1373976553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6018735","author":{"steamid":"76561198057339581","num_games_owned":416,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":37,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1379154782},"language":"german","review":"Ein sehr gjtes Spiel.
