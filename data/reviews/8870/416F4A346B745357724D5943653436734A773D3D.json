Doch Elitzabeth ist endlich mal eine gelungene Begleiterin. kann nicht sterben und kann auf sich selbst aufpassen.

My head is a mumbled-bumble of thoughts and plot points right now, for I only just finished it an hour ago, but perhaps this is the best time to review it... \n\nThere is so much to love about this game. Visually it's stunningly gorgeous - the city, the people, the skies, the beautiful color palette... it's all just a wonder to behold (I was actually stunned at how beautiful it all looked on arriving to Columbia). The sound is brilliant and is tied into so many key events that it's hard not to notice just how well it was done. However, as with all my reviews, I'll choose just one facet of the game to point out with the aim of swaying someone who is on the fence about getting this game and that facet is the story.\n\nThe story itself revolves around Booker, Elizabeth, Zachery and a number of other side characters namely the Lutece's who together bring about a rollercoaster of a story. Without giving too much away, just know that it is a rare game that manages to both confuse and astound a player at the same time. It wasn't until after the fantastic final scene and after the credits had rolled that I began to actually understand what it was that was at the heart of the story. Immediately after the credits finished I jumped online to gather my thoughts and to read others. I then pulled my wife aside and explained the story to her; an act that always allows me to piece the together story for myself at the same time. All I can say is it's a terrific display of the power of change that resides in all of us... change that is open to us each day and at each moment of each day. Change which ultimately allows us to mold ourselves and thus who we will become. Through pain, shame, regret, remorse, redemption, joy, happiness and love is this outlined in the game.\n\nIn the end, 9.5/10 in my book.","timestamp_created":1402124543,"timestamp_updated":1402124543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10377130","author":{"steamid":"76561198032625395","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":527,"last_played":1402066477},"language":"koreana","review":"지금 이걸 보고 있는데 아직 안해봤다?\n당장 구매를 눌러 멍청아!","timestamp_created":1402123158,"timestamp_updated":1402123158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10376835","author":{"steamid":"76561198029402170","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":892,"last_played":1430649540},"language":"english","review":"Loved it","timestamp_created":1402121017,"timestamp_updated":1402121017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10376542","author":{"steamid":"76561198049994279","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":2358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2221,"last_played":1450033543},"language":"english","review":"Good game.

To begin, you take on the role of ex-Pinkerton Guard, Booker Dewitt.  You must repay your gambling debts by retrieving a girl named Elizabeth from the city in the sky, Colombia.  The plot goes on and continues to blow my mind - at times there are a few things that don't add up, but don't detract from the experience. These parts are few and far in between.  Overall Voice-Acting is great, AI is pretty damn good, and Elizabeth is a very handy tool - know how to use her as you play! The world feels alive and slowly dies - rightfully so!\n\nGameplay 8/10\nI'll be honest, as much as I love the title, it is still an FPS at heart and it binds you to play with two main weapons and wield an extra Vigor (Ability) in your other hand.  The gameplay is very true to the original FPS ideals (i.e. No regenerative health).  There are plenty upgrades available for both Vigors and Weapons alike. There is a pretty wide variety of enemy types (at least like 7-8). Overall, could be better, nothing really crazy about mechanics - yet again Elizabeth is a very crucial part to your gameplay and understanding how to manage resources when she is unavailable to you as a player fighting off hordes of enemies. \n\nGraphics 10/10 \nThis game does NOT go for a realistic look and looks stunning doing so! I am able to run it on Ultra at around 30-45 frames on an Nvidia GeForce 750M. It looks beautiful and lens flares look stunning.  Overall, the stunning visuals enhance the beauty of this game and doesn't take an amazing GPU to run it (WARNING: LOOK AT THE MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS BEFORE PURCHASING AND MAKE SURE YOUR SPECS MEET THEM).\n\nDLC 10/10 \nThe DLC for this game includes another 6-9 hour campaign called Burial at Sea. This is a wrap-up to the entire Bioshock Franchise and there is a neat \"Last time on Bioshock\" feature in case you happened not to play the prequel. There is another mode called Clash in the Clouds which is a survival/ horde mode DLC which is pretty fun and has blue ribbons for completing challenges (Amazing for any Perfectionist or Achievement Hunter). Along with this, you get the opportunity to unlock new maps and artwork of the game. \n\nOverall 9/10 \nThis was the best game I've played in a while; in terms of story. It's mechanics are fairly simple. You are rewarded for scrounging every corner of Colombia with some sort of collectible, audio-log, or upgrade to your health or vigor usage. The setting, story, gameplay, and unforgettable characters made this game an amazing experience and made it a true gaming experience. I highly recommend this game as the Steam Summer Sale is right around the corner! So pick this and the season pass up for what the base game traditionally costs!\n","timestamp_created":1402108446,"timestamp_updated":1402108446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10374960","author":{"steamid":"76561198094916249","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":748,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":549,"last_played":1585183057},"language":"english","review":"Very fun with amazing story line.","timestamp_created":1402105315,"timestamp_updated":1402105315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10374900","author":{"steamid":"76561197979046612","num_games_owned":393,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":2503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2503,"last_played":1399895143},"language":"english","review":"This brought the series even further into Rapture & a fresh new look into Columbia.

Но в эту игру нужно уметь играть, не проходить фастом, а слушать все голософоны, прохожих; смотреть кинетоскопы, вникнуть в жизнь этого города и понять, как все здесь устроено, чем дышат эти люди, оттого интереснее. Концовка очень неожиданная и непонятна тем, кто не вникал в сюжет. \nМилая девушка Элизабет будет периодически снабжать вас всем необходимым для боя, а если вы погибнете - оживит (если только вы не на сложном уровне игры). Также будет умилять вас своим красивым личиком так, что папка скриншотов пополнится.\nОчень красиво все нарисовано, я ходила и восхищалась пейзажами прекрасного города в облаках - Колумбии.\nНо и для любителей пострелять есть несколько видов особых врагов, неплохой ассортимент оружия и энергетиков. Особенно нравилось убивать ударом с аэротрассы и выкидывать врагов, с помощью энергетика, далеко за пределы Колумбии.\nА что относительно дополнений Burial at Sea. Честно, ожидала большего. Поневоле сравниваешь с самой игрой.

Jetzt verstehe ich das\" reagieren.\n\nWer sich jedoch wie bei Teil 1 und 2 hier nun ein Gameplay-lastiges Spiel erhofft, der wird bitter enttäuscht werden.\nViele Bioshock-Spieler loben das Gameplay der ersten beiden Teile - doch wenn man mal ehrlich ist, war das Gameplay einfach sehr frustrierend und grottenschlecht.\nBioshock 1 & 2 waren mit Spielmechaniken fast schon überladen, die entweder keinen wirklichen Mehrwert besaßen, oder schlicht und einfach frustrierend waren.\nMan hat mit Bioshock Infinite einen sehr guten Weg eingeschlagen und Elemente wie stetige - teils unfaire Miniboss-Kämpfe gegen Big Daddys und Big Sisters entfernt, genauso wie Little Sisters und die ADAM-Mechanik.\nAuch wenn man in Infinite nur noch 2 Waffen tragen kann, ist es kein Weltuntergang, genauso wie nur 2 Kräfte (obwohl man alle weiterhin zur Verfügung hat und auswählen kann).\n\nAbschließend kann man sagen, dass Bioshock Infinite eine Spielerfahrung ist, die jeder mal gemacht haben soll.\nBioshock Infinite bietet nicht nur eine beachtliche Grafik, bei der selbst heutige AAA-Titel zu kämpfen haben, sondern glänzt auch mit einem nahezu perfekten Storytelling und sehr starken Charaketere.\nEs ist eines der wenigen Spieletitel, welches mich auch 4 Jahre nach Release und mehr als 100 Spielstunden immer noch beschäftigt und Laune macht, wie am ersten Tag.\nFür Gameplay affine Spieler mag der Minimalismus zwar etwas zu langweilig erscheinen, jedoch geht es bei diesem Spiel eher um die Story an sich und nicht über (belanglose) Spielmechaniken.","timestamp_created":1401981983,"timestamp_updated":1504565136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566644787788391113","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10356129","author":{"steamid":"76561198062839698","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1068,"last_played":1452751075},"language":"english","review":"Ken Levine and his team have tried to excellent the whole game is imbued Intriguing the plot with unexpected twists and beautiful scenery","timestamp_created":1401976436,"timestamp_updated":1401976436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10355703","author":{"steamid":"76561198035525920","num_games_owned":485,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1680,"last_played":1412412380},"language":"turkish","review":"Bu oynu oynamadan önce Quantum mekaniklerini öğrenmenizi tavsiye ederim.Pardon oyun mu dedim \"sanat eseri\" diyecektim :)","timestamp_created":1401973843,"timestamp_updated":1401973843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10354659","author":{"steamid":"76561198000132879","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1130,"last_played":1456045685},"language":"english","review":"Any game in which you can heal gunshot wounds by eating stuff you find in the trash in my opinion gets a 10/10.","timestamp_created":1401966806,"timestamp_updated":1401966806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10354360","author":{"steamid":"76561198000578939","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":879,"last_played":1436525516},"language":"tchinese","review":"生化奇兵:無限之城，個人認為算是劇情取向FPS中的神作之一\n\n畫面各種光影細節在UE3之下也表現得非常出色，\n享受高畫質之餘也不會覺得傷眼\n畫面風格也很有自己的特色，\n有點卡通風，就像TF那樣\n\n本作戰鬥採用槍枝＋魔法的方式\n槍枝的射擊感非常棒，\n散彈狙擊手銃等高傷害武器打擊的瞬間，\n配上遊戲中的音效，爽快感不是其他遊戲體驗到的　　　　\n近戰的打擊感更是一流，\n不論是處決還是直接攻擊，\n音效動作物理效果都非常到位\n\n魔法的部分也很多樣化\n除了有直接攻擊的之外，\n各種輔助，防禦魔法更是齊全\n只是有幾項魔法我不曾用過就是了XD\n（在此就不破太多梗了）\n\n劇情表現蠻特別的，與以往的射擊遊戲差很多\n至於劇情如何表現就請自己去體驗一下了，\n被大家捧為神作是絕對不會失望的～\n\n劇情基本上也沒有銜接上的問題，\n跟一二代沒有太大的關聯，不過海葬DLC似乎就跟一代有關了\n\n評分9/10\n\n最後。。。伊莉莎白的...讚！","timestamp_created":1401964306,"timestamp_updated":1401964306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630449175834655762","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10353478","author":{"steamid":"76561198037249036","num_games_owned":318,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1136,"last_played":1608994197},"language":"french","review":"Beaux graphismes, univers respecté, gameplay et personnages intéressant ;\npar contre les DLC sont un peu 'hors contexte'...\nTrès bon jeu !","timestamp_created":1401956608,"timestamp_updated":1401956608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10352978","author":{"steamid":"76561198046710719","num_games_owned":1157,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":1077,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":889,"last_played":1513470599},"language":"english","review":"I'm writing this for perspective consumers. It might be important to know that, while I've completed all the Bioshock games, I'm not necessarily on the bandwagon of Bioshock praisers.\n\nYou've probably heard all kinds of great things about this game. I think though that it stands out for a few reasons.\n- The art work is great and consists of a color palette that ISN'T derived from the great variety of shades fecal matter can produce. Though it is still demanding graphically, it relies more on its sense of theme than on shaders, reflections and all that other good stuff people think makes a \"pretty\" game.\n- It has a story that, while some what derivative of modern mind f*uck movies, works well.\n\nGameplay wise, it's okay. It's got everything a Bioshock game has, with a few additions. Those additions include having your partner get you items and using \"skyhooks\" which are kind of like the perches in the Arkham games. The problem is that even on hard the intensity doesn't turn up until half way through the game, so you don't really need the skyhooks in combat at that point. Once the game decides to start handing you your ass, you'll wonder why you die so much, then it occurs to you to actually use the skyhooks to fly around the area and it starts getting awesome. When you're at that point in the game, you sort of just have stream of consciousness decision making, which I do think is rather meritous in a video game. \n\nNow for the other stuff that annoyed me to no end.\n***** - This game has ONLY auto save. You have to hit a checkpoint or move on to the next level in order to be able to save. Not cool because those checkpoints are few and far between.\n- It seems that the idea of difficulty didn't work out well for this game. Enemies were bullet sponges and sometimes I'd respawn next to some rather ridiculous bastards on hard.\n\nThis game was good. If AAA titles could hold this as a bar to surpass, that'd be cool.

That is saying allot.\n\nI spent and/or wasted years of my life on MMO's like WoW, Rift, The Secret World and Dark Age of Camelot.  I played Counterstrike for two years or so straight.  Loved it.  Half Life, Unreal, Doom-I've played em all.\n\nI took a chance on 30 or so bucks being wasted and bought this on Steam. I had read some of the positives and negative comments and decided to try it for myself after seeing this ranked very high by players on some random site. I've seen reviews which took the most positive aspects of the game and somehow twisted them into being the worst aspects of the game. (Here's hoping links work- http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/06/the-failure-of-bioshock-infinite-writing-games-like-movies/ ) This twisting of the positive is why Im writing this.\n\nAs with most things, there is a hint of truth even in the lies.  This game IS like watching a movie.  When you watch a movie like say.. \"Bad Boys,\" you watch the movie, enjoy the story and action, then it ends.  You may or may not think it was worth the ticket price, but either way, its just a movie ticket.  Now imagine your not watching Bad Boys.  Rather your IN Bad Boys.  Your Will Smith and your co-star Martin Lawrence is a NPC that you actually CARE ABOUT because a software developer spent months doing the impossible.\n\nActually caring about a NPC and caring about the story is the MAGIC of Bioshock Infinate.  You want a FPS?  There are TONS of them out there.  You want a MMO?  There are tons of those.   \n\nBut this is the first game that is made like a movie where you are a part of it and the on screen NPC is like a sentient co-star.  Make no mistake about it.  This game is made by Elizabeth.  You may have read that name in regards to this game before.  This NPC defines this games perfection. \n\nWithout Elizabeth you would be a Gordon Freeman 'esq character in a so-so game that is neither good nor bad.  It would just be another shooter.\n\n\nWill it have replay value?  Maybe not.  Thats not the point.  If you buy this-prepare to be entertained.  Prepare to wish for a sequel.  Prepare to be awed by the technical prowess it must  have taken to put YOU in a movie.  \n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone.","timestamp_created":1401902371,"timestamp_updated":1401921503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10345812","author":{"steamid":"76561198021957777","num_games_owned":461,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":645,"last_played":1380043538},"language":"polish","review":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjY_6o6dkSE","timestamp_created":1401898920,"timestamp_updated":1401898920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550982236862182617","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10345522","author":{"steamid":"76561198040049135","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":2494,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":741,"last_played":1620776663},"language":"english","review":"Excellent Game.

The story is captivating no doubt, but it isn't as well developed as the story in Bioshock 1. There are a few instances in Infinite that don't make sense, or feel like a wasted opportunity.\n\nWhile the game play mechanics have been cleaned up and polished, they aren't without faults. The sky hooks were particularly dissappointing (IMHO) as the trailers made me believe that the sky hooks would be an exilerating and free flowing experience. Instead they feel gimmicky and confine you like an on-rail shooter. There is a two weapon system which only allows you to hold onto two weapons at a time where as Bioshock 1 allowed you hold all your weapons at the same time. The most common way to get new weapons is to find them off fallen enemies. However, you can only access different weapons when you find them. Which means if you find a gun you really like, but decide to experiement with other weapons, you have to find that favorite gun again. Because you're never sure when you'll see that weapon again, it adds a cost to experiementation. \n\nHOWEVER. Overall the game was well made and the main characters are very charming. Inifnite does retain the eeriness that I've come to expect from the Bioshock series and the enemy designs are creative and interesting. While the story is not the strongest of the trilogy, it is still of high quality. Game play is much simpler and more enjoyable, even if you're limited in your choices. Inifnite still offers an enjoyable gaming experience with a relatively deep story line. I would give it an 8/10 and encourage others to play it.","timestamp_created":1401760169,"timestamp_updated":1401760169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10328650","author":{"steamid":"76561197983662248","num_games_owned":861,"num_reviews":116,"playtime_forever":473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":469,"last_played":1407862554},"language":"english","review":"Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: I was never really into Bioshock 1's gameplay, strangely enough. It just never felt like there was any reason why I should give half an arse worth of effort, as enemies that seemed (to me) like they had too much health could be defeated by my UT2k4 strategy of \"kinda-zerg-rush-but-not-really.\" Because of this, I didn't find myself enjoying Bioshock 1's gameplay all that much. Maybe it was the fact that I played it on console; maybe it's the fact that I had wanted to play the thing for three years, but never had a console/PC that could play it; I don't know. Bioshock Infinite hasn't changed much with regards to the \"you can respawn as much as you want\" mechanic, but something feels... different. Better. I've been thinking for a while about it, but I just can't figure out what that thing is.\n\nAs implied in the previous paragraph, the basic mechanic of gunplay/mutations hasn't changed all that much. Gunplay feels great and launching a murder of crows at enemies can lead to some pretty dang funny events happening. The big change now is Elizabeth, who essentially acts as another scavenger as well as being able to introduce various tactical elements into areas, such as hooks, turrets, ammo/medkit depots, etc. She can make life a lot easier, since it's not just you having to search through [i]every stinkin' container in the area[/i] for an emergency medkit. The game still manages to maintain a good level of challenge, though, and I never really found myself running out of ammo (since I often forget to use Vigors 'cuz I'm dumb); a problem I had in Bioshock 1.\n\nEnemies are pretty smart, and the AI seems to have the capacity for group dynamics, to an extent at least. There were a few scenarios where it felt like one enemy was trying to distract me while another tries to flank me. A neat addition would be if Elizabeth warned you about a flanker, but that's not too big of a deal. Bosses are... kinda there and kinda not. There's a trend I've noticed and even a certain publisher stating that video gamers nowadays don't want boss fights in video games. I'm still taken aback by this supposed mentality. It is kinda disappointing that there is no legitimate boss in this game, but there are at least enemies worthy of the title miniboss.\n\nI didn't really have any problems with this game design wise; at least for what was presented. While I would've liked a final boss as opposed to the enemy onslaught at the end, I still walked away from it feeling like I had played a pretty fun game. There is the inclusion of 1999 Mode, but after reading some of the changes, it seems like the kind of difficulty scaling that I don't like at all. Nevertheless, I can definitely recommend this game for just the gameplay, although that's most certainly not all that this game has to offer. 9/10.\n\nStory: Even though the gameplay never really kept me involved in Bioshock 1, the story most certainly did. Ken Levine is a pretty dang good writer, and he [b]REALLY[/b] shows it here. All of the characters are great, there's pretty heavy topics and symbolism all throughout the story, and the ending... oh, the ending just takes it up to 11. Now that Irrational's done, this really does feel like a swan song for the company, and the lyrics for that song could not have been written better. I've read about some people calling what happens in the ending, but even then, it's presented so stonking well that I couldn't give this game any less than a perfect 10/10 for the story. Man, it's hard not talking about it in depth for the review, but remain spoiler-free I shall.\n\nGraphics: The Bioshock games have always looked good, and Bioshock 1 still looks pretty good to this day. Infinite blows Bioshock 1 clean out of the water, though, and that's not for just the technical aspects. People who have read my reviews know that I'm a sucker for giant, vast architecture. The entire city of Columbia rubs that sweet spot, with one of the most impressive sights (in my opinion) in the game being the mock-up of Mount Rushmore with Comstock's head being at the forefront (also feeding in to the SYMBOLISM!!!!!1). The game most certainly never gets boring to look at. Regarding the technical aspects of the graphics, the game ran pretty consistently at 60FPS all Ultra settings at 1080p on my GTX 760, although framerate tended to drop to about 40FPS when I was around doors, oddly enough. This may just be a thing with my card; it may be drivers; I dunno. It doesn't take away from the experience, but it is noticeable. It ran decently temperature wise, with the highest temperature on my card reaching 65degC. My house is pretty dusty, though, so it may just need a cleaning. Nevertheless, this game isn't too much of a computer smasher, and it just looks fantastic, especially when you turn everything to max and are blinded by THE BEAUTIFUL AMBIENT OCCLUSION HNGNGNGNGNGNGNGNGNG \n5/5\n\nMusic: The soundtrack is predominately composed of timely 20's/30's music and orchestration. While the orchestra pieces may not be anything you'd listen to in your spare time, they certainly work in game. My only minor issue with the music is the musical sting that ends every combat scenario. I just felt like it would add more tension if they didn't do that every time all the enemies were dead in the area, so that you'd take it much more carefully. Nevertheless, this is a very minor complaint. The \"old-timey\" music may be your thing; I thought it was quite alright, but again, it's nothing I'd listen to on my own. It doesn't really need to be, but that can certainly be a point in an OST's favor. Voiceacting is great in this game, with some symbolism being within the voice clips themselves. Booker's VA is the standout in my opinion, running the whole gamut of emotions before the game ends. Everybody else is just great as well. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are 9/10/5/5; cumulative score of 9.7/10. I knew this game would be good, but I didn't expect it to be THIS good. No, seriously, if you were in the same lukewarm boat as me with regards to Bioshock 1's gameplay, this game will pull you right in. The story will keep you going if all else fails. I can see why Yahtzee said this was his game of the year for 2013. It really is that good.","timestamp_created":1401748539,"timestamp_updated":1401748539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10328240","author":{"steamid":"76561197979065748","num_games_owned":452,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":694,"last_played":1401675717},"language":"english","review":"Bom jogo, batalhas legais vc consegue usar skills e combinacoes de skill bem melhor q no Bioshock original... historia legal ate um certo ponto ...\n\nRealmente acho q seria um jogo perfeito se a historia fosse melhor","timestamp_created":1401745284,"timestamp_updated":1401745284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10327971","author":{"steamid":"76561198053977808","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1728,"last_played":1379610563},"language":"italian","review":"semplicemente fantastico!!!","timestamp_created":1401743369,"timestamp_updated":1401743369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10327602","author":{"steamid":"76561198008055427","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1580690554},"language":"english","review":"[b]Phenomenal[/b]","timestamp_created":1401740956,"timestamp_updated":1564198576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10327029","author":{"steamid":"76561198125323938","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1264,"last_played":1424424787},"language":"russian","review":"Кончил, пока играл.
