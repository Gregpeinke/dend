I'm going to explain the story briefly.\n\nYou are Booker DeWitt, an agent who has a job to do. You are tasked to find Elizabeth in the city in the sky, Columbia, in the year 1912.\n\nThe ending was really hard-hitting for me, and liked the way it called off the game. Once you complete the game, you unlock 1999 mode, which makes the game significantly more hard.\n\nAll in all, Bioshock Infinite is a wonderful experience that you should see for yourself.

I wouldn't classify this game as horror but there are a few jumpscare moments that keep me alert, which I enjoy.\n\nCons:\n-Combat system could use some work. The indicators for hurting an enemy are really vague with only a barely visible health bar and faint blood. The most annoying part is that the combat system encourages you to swap weapons of the enemies you've killed often, because your bullet damage and ammo capacity is quite lacking even with upgrades. However a lot of the guns are quite awful and don't feel good shooting in the game's enviornment of enemies shooting at  all angles. \n\nI bought this game while it was on sale (I don't remember how much, maybe $10-15 USD) and having never played a previous bioshock game. For others looking to buy this game but are concerned that they won't be able to enjoy it without playing the previous two games, I would say that this game is very enjoyable without playing the previous two. It was relatively short (finished the main story in about 8 hours) which I don't mind but I know some people do. If it's on sale, I'd easily reccomend it unless you're not into first person shooters or plot driven games like this.

Mam nadzieję, że twórcy wymyślą jeszcze również coś wspaniałego jak Bioshok Infinite.","timestamp_created":1505649328,"timestamp_updated":1505649328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35020887","author":{"steamid":"76561198070974775","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":574,"last_played":1504348834},"language":"english","review":"The story wasnt all that compelling  to be honest, the only good thing about it was the girl but as for the gameplay thats a different story, it was sooo dem good that i beat the game in 2 days \n9/10 worth every $","timestamp_created":1505647219,"timestamp_updated":1505647219,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35018972","author":{"steamid":"76561198262308414","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":871,"last_played":1604172711},"language":"koreana","review":"이런 액션게임은 보통 재미를 못 붙였는데 스토리와 엘리자베스덕에 빠져버림..\n결국 엔딩까지 보고 한편의 영화를 본듯한 느낌을 받았음\n1편 2편은 어두침침해서 하기 힘들었지만 여주 한명 있어서 엔딩까지 볼수가 있었다.","timestamp_created":1505641194,"timestamp_updated":1505641194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35018464","author":{"steamid":"76561198200171482","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1126,"last_played":1544044334},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego con una historia bastante profunda pero a la vez intrigante que una vez que lo instales y lo pruebes, no dejaras de jugarlo hasta acabarlo xD\nAunque algunas veces se hace muy repetitivo el sistema de jugabilidad de investigar cada cosa es muy bueno \n9/10","timestamp_created":1505639596,"timestamp_updated":1505639596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35017243","author":{"steamid":"76561198126026847","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":606,"last_played":1480948537},"language":"schinese","review":"多想看见伊丽莎白的笑容。","timestamp_created":1505635465,"timestamp_updated":1505635465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35015149","author":{"steamid":"76561198318006242","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":478,"last_played":1577034852},"language":"schinese","review":"玩是挺好玩的。。。但是一直在打。。还打不过。。。。好心累。。。、","timestamp_created":1505627686,"timestamp_updated":1505627686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530201315879821777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35014281","author":{"steamid":"76561198035838998","num_games_owned":6630,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1756,"last_played":1505618625},"language":"english","review":"Haven't tried the DLC, but this is a great game.

Good character design, the world is beautifully crafted as well. Plotline is understandable but the execution may get a bit wonky towards the end, I wish they had done more to polish the writing. While it loses the dark and grim atmosphere the other Bioshock titles had it retains the thrill that's true to every title of the series. \n\nGreat soundtrack, good voice acting, clean gameplay.

Overall the game felt anemic, like funding was suddenly reduced and the team had to sew up what they had, but aside from that,\n\n\n-equiptment gear sometimes doesn't really make sense (a pair of boots that make you aim better down the sights and worse when from the hip)\n\n-there are a lot of non-violent NPCs around but you can't really talk to any of them\n\n-the autosave format made wanting to take a break a real hassled marathon\n\n-the skyline system is sometimes bothersomely restrictive due to plot, and sometimes glitchy (on the rail toward the Hall of Heroes I got stuck somehow between carts)\n\n-invisible walls are not well masked\n\n-I only played the game twice, but the choices available only made a single difference in the game, and that was that the couple from the fair gave me some gear.  it was super disappointing that the end seemed exactly the same.  But again, I only played the game twice and did all the opposite choices.  Ultimately it felt like the game's whole point was 'it doesn't matter what you do' at which point I just got annoyed since it felt like Elizabethe was just tricking Booker to kill himself when it shouldn't even matter because even if you make a bajillion Bookers choose to an hero instead of sell you to his alternate self or whatever there will still be an infinite number of Bookers that do so why don't you two just move on like Booker kept suggesting and just fly to Paris and get on with you lives?\n\n-exploration of all available space did not seem rewarding enough\n\n-vigours not as beleiveable a superpower set as the plasmids\n\n-wall corners and boxes snag the player way too easily\n\n-the '2 opposing and equally unjust factions' plotline of the previous two games could have benefitted from more subversion\n\n-it's kind of lazy-seeming that there are vigour bottles that are actually just salt bottles\n\n-although i sympathised with the scene where Elizabethe sings to that kid, it felt really one-note\n\n-with Columbia going it alone I'd like to have heard a comment or seen something to explain where Columbia gets all its food aside from Fink's 'Comstock has to peddle his wares for the Earthly ores'.  But I do suppose how Rapture got its food isn't worried about either.\n\n-it would have been nice if weapon upgrades had some modelling representation, but that too would be a little jarring when most of your weapons come from the dead, rather than a store.\n\n\n+I did like however that Elizabethe's navigation was pretty intuitive\n+and also that a couple of times the synchronisation of characters' lines was quite good\n+the limit on the number and permanence of traps settable in an area was high enough to not seem restrictive at all\n+I liked the detail that some clocks' minute hands were actually articulated along with the second hand\n+Elizabethe's salt health and ammo tosses were a fair compromise for involuntary save points.  It did make the game feel a little too 'arcadey' at times but I'd be dog meat without the tosses at certain points.","timestamp_created":1505609870,"timestamp_updated":1505609899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35010143","author":{"steamid":"76561198209854245","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":994,"last_played":1571333589},"language":"english","review":"10/10 THIS GAME IS FUCKING AWESOME\n\n\n1000000/10 BEST GAME","timestamp_created":1505606883,"timestamp_updated":1506469442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35008984","author":{"steamid":"76561198157391219","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":801,"last_played":1552602153},"language":"russian","review":"Если вы читаете этот обзор, то скорее всего я уже мертв.
