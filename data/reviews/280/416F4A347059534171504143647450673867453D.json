That said, it's very difficult to overstate the cultural importance of Half Life, and if you're looking to revisit the original game -- or possess a desire to find out what started this whole Half

It's just the good ol' [b]Half-Life[/b]. Now on [b]Half-Life 2[/b] engine. The original [b]Half-Life[/b] used [b]GoldSrc[/b] engine. Which was pretty much a modified version of [b]Quake[/b] engine. Believe it, or not. Now the game has the full power of [b]HL2[/b] behind it and, naturally, it looks better. Way better. Way, [i]way[/i] better. Back in [b]2004[/b], it was a way to get that “wow!” effect from the first time you started the original [b]Half-Life[/b] all over again. Cool-looking weapons, awesome light effects, etc, etc, etc. In other words, visually, this version looks awesome. Sounds great too. I mean, poor audio quality in the original game is a [i]huge[/i] problem when you're playing it in some good headphones. This version? Even though it comes with the same exact awful acting, the quality is [i]way[/i] better.\n\nUnfortunately, you shouldn't expect this version to feel like the original. Even though yes, it's pretty much the same exact thing, thanks to the new engine it feels heavily different. And, unfortunately, changes here are not for the best. What we have here is a very lazy release that nobody even cared to test much. They just took the original, put it on [b]Source[/b] engine and [i]expected[/i] it to work. Since the original [b]Half-Life[/b] was far from being the most polished games out there, you can easily imagine the result here. All those rough parts became even more rough and tons of the new bugs have appeared. And not only the regular ones, but also the graphical ones. For example,when you'll take the crowbar for the first time, there's a big chance that you'll stop seeing your weapons. Those will be there, those will work, but you won't see them. Together with your own hands. Also, the entire conveyor part during the [b]Residue Processing[/b] chapter was completely broken in my case and it was close to impossible to see a thing. So... yeah... lazy, lazy, [i]lazy[/i] job.\n\nAnd at the point I write this review, it ultimately makes this version obsolete. It's far from feeling close to the original, while if you want the improved [b]Half-Life[/b] experience today, you buy [b]Black Mesa[/b]. You want some nostalgia – you buy the [b]Steam[/b] version of the original, or (even better) go for the [b]CD[/b] version. Because the one from [b]Steam[/b] comes with some minor changes that may ruin the nostalgia a bit for some people. And, of course, like I've already said, if you want the updated and improved [b]Half-Life[/b], you buy [b]Black Mesa[/b]. [b]Half-Life Source[/b]? There's pretty much no need for it anymore. Back in [b]2004[/b], it was nice to see the good ol' [b]Half-Life[/b] with better visuals and sound. Nowadays? There's just no need for it. Especially thanks to how lazy and bugged it is.","timestamp_created":1583820290,"timestamp_updated":1583820290,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.684603571891784668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64791599","author":{"steamid":"76561198197700931","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":902,"last_played":1583809744},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good but it has wack ass bugs","timestamp_created":1583809823,"timestamp_updated":1583809823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64790705","author":{"steamid":"76561197993268374","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":415,"last_played":1583884057},"language":"koreana","review":"아무래도 오리지날 게임 발매가 98년이고, 그것을 리메이크한 작이다 보니, 당시에는 혁신적인 갓겜이였어도 요즘 게임에 익숙한 유저에게는 추천하기 미묘하다. 스토리나 레벨디자인 등은 현대 게임에 맞붙어도 된다고 생각한다. \n 하지만 불친절한 인터페이스로 목표지점이 어디인지 잘 모르겠고, 열려있는 길만 따라가면 되니 한쪽벽만 따라서 가면 어찌 길이 나온다지만, 익숙하지 않으면 헤메고 공략을 찾게된다.\n 플레이어블 캐릭터이 이동 모션이 떠다니는 듯하고 가벼운 편의 모션을 채용해서 3D멀미가 쉅게 발생한다.\n  특히 레벨디자인이 퍼즐같이 되어있어서 세심한 컨트롤이 필요할 때가 있는데, 익숙하지 않으면 세이브 로드를 반복하게 된다. \n 한국어 더빙판의 경우 장비를 정지합니다~와 같은 무성의한 건지 웃기려고 한건지 알 수 없는 더빙을 듣을 수 있다.\n 일부 맵에서 그래픽이 깨지는 버그가 존재합니다. 게임 진행에는 문제가 없다고 생각함.\n 종합적으로는 명작으로써 게임계의 한획을 그었던 작임을 생각하면 게임개발자나 하드코어 게이머에게는 추천하나, 일반 유저에게는 블랙메사같은 신작을 플레이하길 권합니다.","timestamp_created":1583808276,"timestamp_updated":1583808276,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64789681","author":{"steamid":"76561198260350560","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":935,"last_played":1582349901},"language":"english","review":"A great game 4/5\nThis game is probably one of the most solid gameplay experiences I've had in a long time.

Honestly I found this game to be such a joy to find my way through without any guides or walkthroughs. Some parts are a little less intuitive than others. I found myself getting stuck only once throughout my entire play through. I absolutely love this game. My main complaint and the reason this isn't a 100% solid recommendation for me was my experience with the final boss. I found myself not being able to beat the boss because it was bugged. After figuring out that something wasn't right I looked up others experiences with this port. I'm not entirely sure if this is only a port issue but I haven't seen the same issues I was having emulated in the original Half Life. It really took me out of the game. The final boss would just keep teleporting me back to a useless room where nothing was happening. It took me almost 2 hours to beat him after having to pause the game a million times. Other than this final issues I found myself really enjoying everything about it.
