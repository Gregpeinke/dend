thus concludes the tale of Half-Life 2 [i]...at least until that cliffhanger that hit me like a machine gun continues some day.[/i]\n\nI definitely enjoyed this one more than [i]Episode One.[/i] This one was certainly a lot more interesting and this time actually factored in some new mechanics, and each of them were mostly fun to use! Aside from that, the gameplay hasn't changed much, and it's still well-executed! The story itself was also the most engaging I'd say it's ever been! It felt a lot deeper than anything before, and I still find myself liking all the characters. While I still think the original [i]Half-Life 2[/i] was all in all the most interesting game in general, Episode Two was a mostly fitting way to end off my playthrough of the trilogy.\n\nBesides, does it matter how I rank these games? This trilogy is likely meant to be judged as one package. It uses the same assets for a reason after all.

Half-Life 2: Episode Two [/h1]\n2/5 first person shooter from 2007.\n\nas dr Gordon Freeman was the last person to leave City 17 with Alyx Vance when the Citadel suddenly exploded in a storm of unknown proportions. In Episode Two, you'll battle Combine troops as you make your way through the White Forest to deliver vital information stolen from the Citadel to fellow Resistance scientists. (valve)\n\nThe second in a planned trilogy of shorter episodic games that continue the Half-Life 2 story. Episode Two is a standalone expansion, Half-Life 2 is not required to play. But I strongly recommend it to you. A continuous story is told. Beginning with HL1 and since HL2 always directly connected.\n\nThe trilogy only became two official standalone expansions, the third is not available on Steam. At my count above there is a short intro and two fan projects\ncontain.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is very shooter-heavy with bosses and shooting sequences that slow down the fun of the game. I played the game until the finale (about 3 hours), but I didn't get any further, it was on normal and that was at least too difficult for me.\nSo my tip is to play it easy, then you won't have as many opponents in the difficult areas. Unfortunately, it also simplifies the rest of the game. Which is then too easy. But then you can play it again with a higher level of difficulty, you'll see that it's definitely more fun.\n\nOn your escape you will encounter, in some cases, fierce resistance. Above all, you will have a lot of fun looking for the right way to get ahead. Especially towards the end you have to plan your approach to avoid being shot down. You can see it well in the videos from HundelungeVR. Below is a link to YT. As before, there is someone who probably doesn't want her to escape. As you will quickly notice, the military is massively deployed against you.\n\nGreat graphics at the time and still great today.\nI personally like the game very much, with the limitations mentioned above. It's tricky, varied and on the normal level you also have some difficult passages.\nI currently accompanied HundelungeVR life to the end. He is a shooter gamer and only occasionally had a problem progressing. As mentioned above, there are some difficult passages, but recommended for almost every gamer.\n\nHere you get the full Half Life program. Various HL games are already online and there are more to come.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2zGfp1auA43vXUG266M1Hg\n\nMy group and my archive with over 5,300 reviews here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/hoi4deu\n\n👑 Powered by HoI 4 Deu Curators group in German / English 👑⠀⠀⠀[list][*][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30388691/] Follow Main group [/url][*] [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40282064/] Follow Second group [/url][/list]\nand discover more reviews from me\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2846338915\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2846339574\n\n[h1] Half-Life 2: Episode Two [/h1]\n2/5 Egoshooter von 2007.\n\nAls Dr. Gordon Freeman haben Sie zuletzt gemeinsam mit Alyx Vance City 17 verlassen, als die Zitadelle in einem Sturm unbekannten Ausmaßes plötzlich explodierte. In Episode Zwei kämpfen Sie auf Ihrem Weg durch den White Forest gegen Combine-Truppen, um anderen Wissenschaftlern der Widerstandsbewegung wichtige Informationen weiterzugeben, die aus der Zitadelle gestohlen wurden. (Valve)\n\nDer zweite Teil in einer geplanten Trilogie kürzerer episodischer Spiele, die die Geschichte von Half-Life 2 fortsetzen. Episode Two ist eine Standalone-Erweiterung, Half-Life 2 zum Spielen wird nicht benötigt. Ich Empfehle es euch aber ausdrücklich. Es wird eine durchgehende Geschichte erzählt. Beginnend mit HL1 und seit HL2 immer im direckten Anschluss.\n\nAus der Trilogie wurden nur zwei offizielle eigenständige Erweiterungen, die dritte gibt es nicht auf Steam. Bei meiner obrigen Zählung sind noch ein kurzes Intro und zwei Fanprojekte enthalten.\n\nDas Game ist leider sehr Shooterlastig mit Bossgegnern und Ballersequenzen die den Spielspaß bremsen. Ich habe das Game damals bis zum Finale gespielt (etwa 3 Stunden), bin aber nicht weiter gekommen, hatte es auf normal und das war mir zumindest schon zu schwer.\nAlso mein Tipp spielt es auf leicht dann habt ihr an den schweren Stellen nicht so viele Gegner. Dummerweise vereinfacht es auch den Rest des Spieles. Was dann zu leicht ist. Aber ihr könnt es dann ja nochmal Spielen mit höherer Schwierigkeit, ihr werdet sehen das macht eindeutig mehr Spass.\n\nIhr werdet auf eurer Flucht, auf zum Teil, heftigen Widerstand stoßen. Viel Spass werdet ihr vor allem damit haben den richtigen Weg zu suchen, um weiter zu kommen. Besonders zum Ende hin müßt ihr euer Vorgehen Planen um nicht zusammengeschossen zu werden. Könnt ihr gut sehen in den Videos von HundelungeVR. Weiter unten ist ein Link zu YT. Wie schon zuvor gibt es da jemanden der wohl nicht will das ihr entkommt. Wie ihr schnell merken werdet wird massiv Militär eingesetzt gegen euch.\n\nSeinerzeit eine grandiose Grafik und auch heute noch sehr gut.\nMir persönlich gefällt das Game sehr gut, mit den oben genannten Einschränkungen. Es ist knifflig, abwechslungsreich und auf Stufe normal habt ihr auch einige schwierige Passagen.\nIch habe aktuell HundelungeVR life begleitet bis zum Schluss. Er ist Shootergamer und hatte nur gelegentlich mal ein Problem weiter zu kommen. Wie schon oben erwähnt gibt es einige schwierige Passagen, dennoch Empfohlen für fast jeden Gamer.\n\nHier bekommt ihr das volle Half Life Programm. Diverse HL Spiele sind schon Online und es kommen noch welche hinzu. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2zGfp1auA43vXUG266M1Hg\n\nMeine Gruppe und mein Archiv mit über 5.300 Reviews
