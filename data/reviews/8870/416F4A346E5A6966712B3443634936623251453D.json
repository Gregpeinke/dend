This was similar to my experience in Bioshock 1, and is why I didn't finish the first game or even install Bioshock 2.\n\nOften times, in a game with a linear story, that has a straightforward weapon and \"magic\" system, the objectives will progress in order to completion. 1 to 2 to 3 to 4. This is not an open world RPG, it is an FPS with a story. Simple and clean.\n\nIn Bioshock Infinite, there is an extreme lack of satisfaction, as many times when an objective is almost met, something will come up and divert attention entirely. This isn't to say that there is a new objective, but there are sub-objectives that must be accomplished before completing the initial objective, and this isnt discovered until the apparent moment of completion of the original objective. (Presented with 1 to 2 to 3 to 4, and told before each one is *almost* completed that there is an A, B, C, and D) \n\nIf it were instead presented as additional objectives to be completed after the original objective is completed, that would be something else entirely. That would feel exhausting, but satisfying. (Presented as 1 to 2 to 3 to 4, and on the completion of 4, an A, B, C, and D are revealed.) \n\nThe entire time I felt like I was being teased by some kind of fetishist and I did not enjoy it. I had heard the story was great, but it wasn't good enough to make me enjoy playing the game.

Game should have been called \"companion simulator\". \nThere is litterally no tight situations even on hard mode because whenever you get into a tight spot your companion is gonna give you what is needed. Why do i even have an ammo counter and a healthbar when depletion just means i get an animation from the companion and then am sorted out again? \nAlso it makes you go through animations for receiving ammo in the middle of a firefight.\nWhy would they even place loot around the gameworld when my companion keeps feeding me recources anyways? \n\nIt's not absolutely trerrible but also not worthy a recommendation.

This a pretty looking shooter with tunnel-levels made for babies.\n\nPick up Dishonored or Prey instead of this one.","timestamp_created":1573501072,"timestamp_updated":1573533940,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.443975895643234253","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57006471","author":{"steamid":"76561198152607394","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1478,"last_played":1606055985},"language":"czech","review":"Narozdíl od mnoha jiných mě tohle prostě chytlo a bavilo na každym kroku. jen doporučuju","timestamp_created":1573500452,"timestamp_updated":1573500452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57001318","author":{"steamid":"76561198272242191","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1570837932},"language":"turkish","review":"Sıkıcı","timestamp_created":1573494946,"timestamp_updated":1573494946,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.437978535890579224","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57000891","author":{"steamid":"76561198286619069","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":423,"last_played":1573830585},"language":"english","review":"it was fun to play. it may not have the little sisters or big daddys but it did have a good story","timestamp_created":1573494500,"timestamp_updated":1573494500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56998640","author":{"steamid":"76561198971174545","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":574,"last_played":1573562051},"language":"schinese","review":"神作，不解释","timestamp_created":1573491969,"timestamp_updated":1573491969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56997379","author":{"steamid":"76561198833732825","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":569,"last_played":1573986891},"language":"schinese","review":"我永远喜欢伊丽莎白！！！","timestamp_created":1573490528,"timestamp_updated":1573490528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56995767","author":{"steamid":"76561198009118160","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2648,"last_played":1573556424},"language":"russian","review":"Один из лучших экшенов, с неординарным сюжетом","timestamp_created":1573488850,"timestamp_updated":1573488850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56995588","author":{"steamid":"76561198807631812","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":896,"last_played":1573488625},"language":"russian","review":"Нармас","timestamp_created":1573488638,"timestamp_updated":1573488638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56995162","author":{"steamid":"76561198135290748","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1298,"last_played":1573483494},"language":"english","review":"I don't like paying for games but I bought this one because I feel like I need to pay money to the creators for creating such a wonderfu game. lPlayed Bioshock Infinite before from a friend but bought and played it now because it so darn good. Much more than the first person shooter gameplay, what I really liked about this is the storyline. I liked how you would slowly unravel the secrets/story  and piece together everything. The story is really well thought of and would give you something to think about even after you have finished the game. \n\nElizabeth is the best character ever. It's like having someone there with you in the game who not just stands there but also helps you out in the situation. Hands down to the producers for creating a video game character  to whom you will create an emotional bond with. I can only imagine the amount of time and effort they poured into making this character. I also love her song \"Will the Circle be Unbroken\". I am sure you will love her too. \n\nGameplay is great. Good amount of weapons and upgrades for it. Vigors are also a great addition to customizing your gameplay by not only shooting and shooting. Aesthetics and sceneries are super well designed and beautiful, in columbia, rapture and the lighthouses, basically everywhere.\n\nBurial at Sea DLC is a great addition to the game as it wraps the whole story up. This one is a bit harder for me than the main game as it requires more stealth and strategy. But nonetheless, still a great DLC.\n\nI highly recommend this game. You'll definitely get your money's worth if you buy this game. You'll also get a lot of feels from Elizabeth if you ask me. 15/10!","timestamp_created":1573488166,"timestamp_updated":1573488166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56992545","author":{"steamid":"76561198413338826","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1556373372},"language":"schinese","review":"good","timestamp_created":1573485377,"timestamp_updated":1573485377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56991096","author":{"steamid":"76561198396292933","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":353,"last_played":1574711025},"language":"russian","review":"Игра сама за себя говорит.
