Citizen Kane of gaems! Many phrases uttered by people who have never read a book. \n\nOkay, sorry. Bioshock Infinite has many commendable traits that make it easy to see what others like about it, such as some gloriously cinematic moments, stunningly beautiful level design, and impactful use of sound and music. There's also a lot that I just can't see any value in, such as the incredibly sloppy story, inconsistent characters, braindead gameplay mechanics, and a really baffling dissonance between story and design. It's a shame, because Columbia's one fantastic setting, but it'll never measure up to Rapture simply because Andrew Ryan was so much more coherent and compelling a villain than the one-note cackling madman who is Comstock. Ken Levine's usually gripping philosophical questions are replaced by a whole lot of preaching and attempts at complexity that are undercut by a few clueless storytelling decisions (you won't see any cruelty inflicted on the poor underclass here, but you'll see resistance leaders commit some truly gruesome acts of violence...woops).\n\nIt doesn't help that the combat isn't any more intelligent. Bioshock had some significant gameplay flaws, such as its tedious hacking minigame, but replacing hacking with a temporary mind control vigor isn't a very good solution considering you can't kill controlled turrets until they turn back into enemies. For a game that seems to star a character seeking to redeem his own violent past, having him commit graphically violent acts on the way to that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and that contradiction isn't really addressed in a meaningful way. It makes Max Payne's story seem like a work of art, and that was much better game about killing hordes of enemies. Make no mistake, for a game of such lofty ambitions, this is just as stupid as Duke Nukem 3D, and less self aware. \n\nIt's a shame considering what a fan I am of the first Bioshock and System Shock 2. Levine's done a lot to bring attention to the storytelling potential of games for folks who don't necessarily define themselves as gamers, so to see him and Irrational stumble so significantly in the quest to make something amazing is unexpected. It's certainly an interesting product, but unless you're a fan of interesting failures or gorgeous game aesthetics it's worth passing by.","timestamp_created":1433130658,"timestamp_updated":1433130658,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462440311908721924","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16109923","author":{"steamid":"76561198018556587","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3199,"last_played":1470800138},"language":"english","review":"great story and gameplay","timestamp_created":1433126999,"timestamp_updated":1433126999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16107015","author":{"steamid":"76561198015976890","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":663,"last_played":1424913164},"language":"english","review":"This is definitely one of the best games i have played in my opinion everyone ever should play this game","timestamp_created":1433110692,"timestamp_updated":1433110692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16106714","author":{"steamid":"76561198044100032","num_games_owned":464,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1586129405},"language":"english","review":"awesome story","timestamp_created":1433109340,"timestamp_updated":1433109340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16103521","author":{"steamid":"76561197969854476","num_games_owned":366,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1273,"last_played":1433092575},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is the third installment in the Bioshock series that takes you from the ocean depths in the city of Rapture, up into the sky.  The year is 1912 and you’ve been hired to find a girl that was taken away to this mysterious city.\n\nThe Good: The story, the music, weapon selection, the vigors (known as plasmids in previous games), the actors/voices, the level design and, doubly important in any action/shooter game, the engine on which the game runs; they are all fantastic!  If you’re familiar with the previous 2 games there is a lot of good stuff that comes back.  Sniffing out extra loot in nooks and crannies, finding voice recordings that tell deeper parts of the story, upgrading weapons and vigors and, of course, a mind bending story with some “OMGNOWAY!” type plot twists that bring you to a big, stunning conclusion at the end.  The game was a delight to play as a shooter too, the guns felt crisp/responsive and the battle fields were well made.  Additionally, the Sky Hook lets you fly around the larger battlefields on rails above terrain.  Whether you’re here for the action or the story, you’ll get what you came for.\n\nThe Bad:  The difficulty needed some smoothing out in my opinion.  There are 4 modes (easy, medium, hard & “1999 mode”) and the last mode is only unlocked after you beat the game.  I almost never play a game twice these days so I doubt I’ll even play this game on super hard.  “Hard mode” was also pretty easy until the last 5% of the game and then it got frustrating.  When you die it takes some money from you but just brings you back to life so the really hard fights … you can just zerg rush and that’s lame.  I took to manually restarting the harder fights I died in just to try and do them all in one shot.  Also, the story for this game (as mentioned above) is fantastic but the game does not tell all of it unless you find all (or at least 8 of the most important) voice recordings.  I like how they give a bunch more details but the ending of the game kind’a pissed me off until I went back and read just 2 of the 6 voice recordings I missed (there are 80 in the game). They were super crucial and completely changed my understanding of the end.\n\nThe Funny:  To reduce the amount of “baby sitting” you have to do, any character following you will just show up with you after certain check points.  It does make you do a double take when you are often the first person through a door and you meet everyone that was behind you in the room as you enter.  Also, this game does what so many other game with loot do, you can simply pick up items as you go with little to no consequence.  I walked into many people’s houses and just took money off tables and ate all the food and left … they didn’t seem to mind!\n\nThe Summary:  I give Bioshock Infinite a 9 out of 10.  It’s a great triple A title that really used it’s huge resource pool well.  Everyone involved has really made a game here and this is what a big title should be, not just a game but an experience!  Oh, and if you want to know what ACTUALLY happened at the end, do this: beat the game then look up all of the Voxophones and read them in chronological order.  Then you may want to play the last 10 minutes of the game again.  After that you must sit through the (really friggin’ long!) credits.  Once you do all this (if you get it) you’ll see what actually happened to everyone … and smile. \n","timestamp_created":1433097256,"timestamp_updated":1433097256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16102803","author":{"steamid":"76561198072358572","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":484,"last_played":1432934623},"language":"russian","review":"Поначалу игра казалась скучной никакого экшена, но после спасения дочки игра приобрела новые краски просто супер покупайте не пожалеете.","timestamp_created":1433094970,"timestamp_updated":1433094970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16101266","author":{"steamid":"76561198127054175","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":862,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":753,"last_played":1514398260},"language":"russian","review":"Рекоменду ли я эту игру? \n\nБезусловна эту игру можно назвать шутером, а в положении шутера эта игра просто провальна:\n\nПлюсы (как шутера) :\n\n-Интересное оружие\n-Прикольная реализация магии\n-Немного необычные враги\n\nМинусы (как шутера) :\n\n-Враги приедаются\n-Игра (как шутер) слишком проста\n-\"Особые\" враги не так интересны\n\nНо, на мо взгляд игре бы лучше подошёл жанр графической новеллы.\n\nПлюсы (как новеллы) :\n\n-Визуальный стиль\n-Колоритные и интересные персонажи\n-Неплохо проработанный мир\n-Личная драмма героев\n-Безусловно прекрасный сюжет\n-И да (чуть не забыл) музыка, ОНА ШИКАРНА\n\nМинусы (как новеллы) :\n\n-Я не нашёл не одного минуса\n\nИ теперь главный камень предкнавения: рекомендую ли я эту игру?\n\nЕсли как шутер - то не особо\nЕсли как новеллу - то эта одна из лучших игр своего жанра\n\nИ да, вам решать, что для вас важнее: пострелушки-побегушки, или же сюжет и колоритные персонажи...","timestamp_created":1433089862,"timestamp_updated":1433089990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16100308","author":{"steamid":"76561198036228278","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1431180532},"language":"danish","review":"Beautiful game.","timestamp_created":1433086436,"timestamp_updated":1433086436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16099739","author":{"steamid":"76561198006779767","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1201,"last_played":1434359505},"language":"english","review":"Over 18 hours unending fun - that's what I can say after reaching to the end of this remarklable journey.

Personalmente mi aspettavo una cosa molto più simile ai primi due... Infatti sono rimasta abbastanza sconcertata le prime volte che ci giocavo, e mi ripetevo \"ma questo non è Bioshock. NON E' IL MIO BIOSHOCK\".\nPerò... Man mano che ci giochi smetti di pensare ai precedenti Bioshock e accetti quella nuova versione che è l'Infinite: i Plasmidi non ci sono più e al loro posto ci sono altri poteri, le armi sono diverse e puoi tenerne solo due alla volta, e c'è lo \"Sky-hook\" con cui ti puoi aggrappare a ganci in giro per il gioco o distruggere la faccia delle persone. Perchè non ci sono più i ricombinanti, ma ci sono persone normali.\nInoltre è quasi il contrario del primo Bioshock come ambientazione: mentre il primo era ambientato a Rapture, città sottomarina, qui ci si trova a Columbia, città sopra le nuvole.\n(Sinceramente, se non fosse stato per i DLC il gioco si sarebbe quasi potuto chiamare diversamente da Bioshock, ma poi si capirà tutto. Circa.)\nCome il primo Bioshock, l'Infinite ha una trama abbastanza complicata, e al posto delle sorelline c'è una sola ragazza. Inoltre affronta temi seri come il razzismo, la politica, la schiavitù e l'ignoranza delle persone. Inoltre il gioco riesce a far entrare i giocatori nei panni del protagonista e in quello che prova... E non è da tutti.\nCosa molto importante è la grafica: è ancora più spettacolare degli altri Bioshock. Mi sono addirittura ritrovata a fare screenshot ad alcuni paesaggi solo perchè erano belli da vedere... Quasi come una turista in una nuova città.\nHo insistito abbastanza sul confronto con gli altri Bioshock (più che altro il primo) perchè mi è capitato di parlare con persone che disprezzano l'Infinite, e alla mia domanda \"perchè non ti è piaciuto?\" hanno risposto con: \"Non è Bioshock\".\nQuindi, se lo prendete (e ve lo consiglio tantissimo) NON aspettatevi un continuo del primo o qualcosa di simile. E' diverso ma bellissimo, e poi se proprio volete trovarci qualcosa in comune si può:\n- sono entrambi ambientati in un'utopia che diventa distopia\n- la trama è bella come sempre\n- sono entrambi in prima persona e si possono usare armi e \"poteri\"\n- c'è una ragazza da proteggere come le Sorelline. Circa.\n- ci sono colpi di scena\n- ci sono nemici abbastanza forti da essere quasi paragonati ai Big Daddy\ne altre cose relative alla trama, ai personaggi e ai dialoghi che non dico.\nBe' per finire ve lo consiglio caldamente, e ancora di più consiglio i DLC... Che un po' addolciscono l'amaro che vi lascia il finale dell'Infinite.\nCi sarebbero un sacco di cose da dire, ma per non cadere negli spoiler finisco qui. Sappiate solo che Bioshock non si gioca, si vive (almeno, nel mio caso).\nSe lo prendete: buon divertimento!\n","timestamp_created":1433016727,"timestamp_updated":1433016727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521179497241973877","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16083006","author":{"steamid":"76561198003023871","num_games_owned":522,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":904,"last_played":1416448551},"language":"english","review":"Masterpiece 10/10","timestamp_created":1433011437,"timestamp_updated":1433011437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16079572","author":{"steamid":"76561198116883876","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1908,"last_played":1455064155},"language":"english","review":"super fun game i thing it is very long it has 8 missions with 5 in each one which adds to 40 fun missions very fun game it is well worth the price i got the season pas bundle which was well worth it i hope you get this game because it is very fun","timestamp_created":1433000159,"timestamp_updated":1433000159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16076062","author":{"steamid":"76561198148579873","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1527238245},"language":"spanish","review":"Ya me lo pase en play 3 , JUEGAZO 100 de 10","timestamp_created":1432987224,"timestamp_updated":1432987224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16073155","author":{"steamid":"76561198152343942","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1053,"last_played":1644827735},"language":"russian","review":"Многое было сказано до меня.\nКрутой сюжет.\nБоевка подвела.\n[h1] 9 Элизабет из 10 [/h1]","timestamp_created":1432974255,"timestamp_updated":1432974255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16073139","author":{"steamid":"76561198065365942","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":968,"last_played":1431866978},"language":"german","review":"Toller atmosphärischer Shooter mit sehr gut gelungener Story!","timestamp_created":1432974153,"timestamp_updated":1432974153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16072599","author":{"steamid":"76561198146933919","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":948,"last_played":1572229078},"language":"english","review":"This game was phenomenal, 10/10. \n- Graphics were breath taking\n- Storyline was beyond words\n- Characters were in depth\n- Combat was exciting\n- Soundtrack was beautiful\nThe only thing about it was the quickness of finishing the game, although, I think that was just my fault.\nDefinitely a great buy, highly suggested.","timestamp_created":1432971320,"timestamp_updated":1432971320,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16071753","author":{"steamid":"76561198039086092","num_games_owned":321,"num_reviews":303,"playtime_forever":343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1472991916},"language":"russian","review":"Ниче так!","timestamp_created":1432967195,"timestamp_updated":1491372402,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.445723205804824829","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16071341","author":{"steamid":"76561198041327937","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":11382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":847,"last_played":1476980722},"language":"english","review":"It was a boring game, pretty much same thing over and over for a story line that was week at best.

Então vamos lá: \n\nGráficos: Maravilhosamente estonteantes , mesmo o jogo tendo sido lançado à alguns anos, até hoje esse game é um exemplo de gráficos bem feitos, e não somente em termos de texturas, iluminação, etc, mas também e principalmente na parte artística, os designers da Irrational Games fizeram um trabalho maravilhoso com a cidade de Columbia, assim como tiveram feito com Rapture. A cidade é viva, colorida, estonteante, mind blown, apesar de sentir falta do clima macabro de Rapture, não tem como não se apaixonar por Columbia também.  Como se isso não bastasse ainda temos a linda e maravilhosa Elisabeth, na minha opinião uma das melhores personagens que te acompanham em games do gênero, da qual eu voltarei a falar mais nas partes da jogabilidade e enredo. \n\nSom: Como sempre, muito bem feito os efeitos sonoros do game. Músicas, pessoas falando, efeito de tiros, explosões, e etc. Tudo muito bem retratado, o que sem dúvida contribui muito para a imersão no game. Acho que as vozes se encaixam perfeitamente em cada personagem também.\n\nEnredo: Aqui... exatamente nesse ponto, foi aqui que esse jogo entrou para meu top 10.  A história se inicia de forma bem simples até, você sendo levado pelos \"gêmeos\" Lutece, enviado à Columbia, com o único objetivo de \"Nos traga a garota, e limpe sua dívida\". Entretanto as coisas começam a sofrer reviravoltas durante o gameplay, até chegar um ponto onde você está completamente confuso em relação ao que deve acreditar que está entendendo ou não. E então, no final BAM!  uma das maiores supresas, e Plot Twist que eu presenciei em minha vida como gamer, eu JAMAIS imaginaria que aquilo aconteceria, minha cabeça quase literalmente explode com a revelação no Final. Vale citar que o desenvolvimento dos personagens, Booker Dewitt e Elisabeth, são muito bem feitos, principalmente o da Elisabeth, é incrível como você percebe a mudança na atitude dela, na linguagem corporal, em suas palavras, e até mesmo no tom de voz, conforme ela vai sofrendo, e descobrindo seu passado, você passa a ficar mal por ela, a realmente querer defendê-la, e lutar por ela. E a medida que o jogo avança, Booker realmente começa a se importar com a garota, enquanto você a vê amadurecer forçadamente em meio aquilo tudo, é maravilhoso. É praticamente impossível reconhecer Elisabeth no final do jogo, se você à comparar com a primeira vez que a encontra, completamente inocente, sonhadora e quase infantil, com apenas o sonho de ser livre e ir à Paris . Outro personagem que vale citar aqui é Zachary Hale Comstock, apesar de ainda achá-lo inferior ao Frank Fontaine do Primeiro Bioshock, ele ainda sim é um belo de um vilão. Ah, e não poderia esquecer do Songbird, por mais que ele não seja exatamente um amigo no game, não tem como não gostar do \"Passarinho\". \n\nJogabilidade: Entre os três Bioshocks, esse é, na minha humilde opinião, o mais fácil de longe. Muita coisa mudou em relação à jogabilidade, bem como plasmids foram substituídos por Vigores, e Eve por Sal. Mas enfim, a jogabilidade é muito gostosa e fluída, entretanto mais pra perto do final do game, pode e provavelmente se tornará um pouco repetitiva, inclusive acho esse o único defeito desse game. Dessa vez, você pode carregar apenas duas armas por vez, mas isso não dificulta nada, pois como disse no geral o game é mais fácil mesmo. Senti muuuita falta do Big Daddy e seus gritos horripilantes, no entanto o Handyman também dá bastante trabalho, mas ele não é um Big Daddy e jamais será. Mas no geral eu gostei sim da jogabilidade, zerei em 12 horas de game vasculhando bem os cenários, sem pressa, super curtindo Columbia, e distribuindo Headshots com o Sniper Rifle, meu queridinho . Falando novamente da Elisabeth, ela não precisa de proteção, consegue abrir \"fendas\" no espaço tempo capazes de te ajudar em várias situações com armas, suprimentos, torretas, e etc, e ainda por cima te abastece com vigores, munição, dinheiro e até mesmo energia que ela encontra pelo cenário, fazendo dela uma ótima companion, não igual certas personagens (Ashley RE 4 manda abraços ). Aliás, acho que esse é um dos motivos pelo qual o game fica de certa forma fácil, pois ela me salvou muuuitas vezes da morte. Ah só pra fechar essa parte vale citar também que as batalhas no \"Trilhos aéreos\" são MARAVILHOSAS, baita sensação de liberdade do caramba que dá usar aquilo MEL DELS. \n\nConsiderações Finais: É difícil comparar esse Bioshock com o primeiro, pois guardo muito boas lembranças em relação à ambos, duas obras de arte, cada qual com seus prós e contras. Eu gosto mais de Rapture, porque acho mais bacana o clima claustrofóbico e tenso que ela gera no jogador, entretanto adoro Columbia também pela sua vivacidade e beleza. Em relação aos Plots, gosto de ambos, mas acho o do Infinite superior, pela sua complexidade, é algo tão magnífico, que eu não consigo pensar em nada menos do que um gênio para criar esse enredo cheio de detalhes e nuances, passei horas lendo sobre ele depois de terminá-lo apenas para tentar compreender alguns detalhes que passaram despercebidos. Enfim, \"fechou\" com chave de ouro a trilogia. Ainda preciso pegar as DLCs, Burial At Sea Parte 1 e 2, para fechar direitinho a estória, mas o geral é isso, uma obra de arte.  \n","timestamp_created":1432913440,"timestamp_updated":1432913440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16056227","author":{"steamid":"76561198038551862","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":7530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7530,"last_played":1641017035},"language":"english","review":"Good but Disappointing\n\nI am a huge fan of the Bioshock series, so when this game was announced I watched every single update, trailer, sneak peek, demo and leak. The beta game footage in the trailers was incredible, so i preordered the game and waited anxiously for the game to come out.\nbut, little did I know that most of the interesting mechanics and cool setpieces that I saw in the trailers had been stripped out of the game. not only that but [spoiler] the story starts to get really bad halfway through, when Booker and Elizabeth travel to a parallel universe, and the ending sucks, seriously it makes no sense, the games writer does NOT understand quantum physics [/spoiler] those problems with the story were probably caused by the numerous rewrites and redesigns that the game had.\nbut, beyond my disappointment, the gameplay we were left with is all right. it was good enough that i played it a couple times even before it got the DLC. the visuals are really good for the time it came out, and they hold up  well because of the stylized character designs.\nThe first DLC was Really good. it actually fixed most of the problems I had with the main games gameplay and some of the problems I had with the story. but the second DLC wasn't as good. it ruined a lot of the story improvements from the first DLC and it spoiled and retconed the first game in the series. still, it was cool seeing the characters from the first Bioshock in HD, but the way they disregard the lore from the second game in the DLCs was also really disappointing.\nI'd recommend you get the game only if its on sale, and only if you've already played the first game, because of the spoilers in the DLC.\n\nThis game was fun, but I still wish we had gotten the version shown in the early trailers, because that version looked like it would have been legendary.","timestamp_created":1432904142,"timestamp_updated":1658917834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16053156","author":{"steamid":"76561198056283316","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":8077,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":434,"last_played":1606038145},"language":"english","review":"I enjoyed the game play of the game and the story.
