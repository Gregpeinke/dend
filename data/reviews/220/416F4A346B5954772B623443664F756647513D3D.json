На сей раз тебе предстоит путешествовать по Европе, разбираясь в сложившемся мировом порядке. Многое произошло за время отсутствия Гордона: иммиграция обитателей Зена на Землю, прибытие следом инопланетной организации \"Альянс\", захват Альянсом всей планеты. Не приложив каких-либо усилий, ты становишься символом и надеждой Сопротивления Земли.\n\nГордон Фримен снова в деле! Настал час выполнить свои [i]служебные обязательства[/i].\n\n[h1]Темная энергия[/h1]\n\nНовая номерная часть серии выполнена на графическом движке Source, который в свое время предлагал потрясающий игровой опыт: отличная графика и анимация, взаимодействие с миром (кроме разрушения строений), реалистичная физика.\nЗвуковая атмосфера окружающей среды позволяет полностью погрузиться в происходящее, музыка динамичная и играет в подходящий момент.\n[b]Valve[/b] знатно порадовала поклонников своей новой игрой.\n\n[i]\"Подними эту банку\"[/i] - метрокоп вводит тебя в курс дела, как работает механика движка.\n\n[h1]Нарушитель номер один[/h1]\n\n[b]Half-Life 2[/b] является коридорным шутером. Тем не менее, игровой процесс изобилует решениями в части развлечений. Здесь тебе придется скрываться от преследования местных надзорных органов. Выдастся случай прокатиться и на аэроглиссере, и на багги, и к тому же пострелять с вооруженного транспорта. В некоторых главах сюжета ты будешь управлять муравьиными львами (новый вид пришельцев в игре) по принципу \"tower defence\", в других - повстанцами, как главнокомандующий группировки. Есть уровень, который погружает тебя в выживание-ужастик. Чем дальше двигаешься, тем сильнее разгорается восстание землян против Альянса и игра местами превращается в [b]Battlefield[/b]. Также присутствуют сражения с мини-боссами, головоломки для дальнейшего продвижения, защита точек.\n\n[i]Нет здесь разве что стелса.[/i]\n\n[h1]Проснитесь, вас снова ждут великие дела[/h1]\n\nНи одна современная игрушка не может похвастать таким набором \"режимов\" в одиночной игре. Поэтому и сейчас в HL2 интересно переигрывать.\n\nОднако стоит признать, что графика значительно уступает хитам нашего времени. Если учесть, что Valve издали [b]Half-Life 2: Update[/b] - никакого ремастера, римейка или перехода на движок Source 2 ждать от них [u]не стоит[/u].\nБлаго, что есть в сети энтузиасты, выпускающие графические модификации для игры. Внимание стоит обратить на [b]FakeFactory's Cinematic Mod[/b]. Данный мод значительно улучшает текстуры, а также наполняет \"коридоры\" уровней новыми объектами окружения. Еще мод может предложить свою физику оружия и уровень сложности - от чего настоятельно рекомендую отказаться. Родной движок Source не образует никакой синергии с этим модом в этом плане. NPC видят тебя в кустах - для них ты в голой \"родной\" местности. Отдачи от оружия для них нет, и выходят они с автоприцелом на тебя, основанного на сложности HL2. Терпение и палец на клавише быстрого сохранения - вот твои союзники.\n\n[i]Так что даже костюм Гордона со временем теряет свою изящность.[/i]\n\n[h1]Наши Покровители[/h1]\n\nБесспорно, [b]Half-Life 2[/b] навсегда останется культовой классикой, к которой каждый уважающий себя игрок обязательно попробует причаститься.\nВремя не подвластно над игрой, как и над Гордоном Фрименом.\n\n[i]9 из 10 интересных предложений получены насчет доктора Фримена.[/i]","timestamp_created":1372259755,"timestamp_updated":1589718980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3798564","author":{"steamid":"76561198027514694","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4141,"last_played":1586536041},"language":"english","review":"A shitty game where a shitty guy runs in a shitty city where the shitty police is trying to kill him.","timestamp_created":1372244876,"timestamp_updated":1372244876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1039630","author":{"steamid":"76561197985059118","num_games_owned":350,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1777,"last_played":1527457062},"language":"english","review":"You should be required to play this game before using Steam.","timestamp_created":1372229078,"timestamp_updated":1385759245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492424249649047852","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6400997","author":{"steamid":"76561198065492123","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2275,"last_played":1616533230},"language":"english","review":"Oh my god.

Though I knew this game had high praise, I had low expectations thinking this wouldn't hold up to the original (even with the obvious time difference). I was so surprised by this game. This surpasses the original Half-Life by miles. So much better storytelling, better gameplay, and physics. I recommend this game and its two episodes. Now I get all the hype for Half-Life 3. For anyone interested in this game who hasn't played Half-Life 1, DEFINITELY play the original first. You miss too much (in my opinion) if you don't play the original. Of course, if the game seems to dated, I recommend the Black Mesa mod for HL2. It utilizes the Source engine and changes a bit of the level design and character dialogue, but it still is a faithful adaption to HL1. However, it is still incomplete (the last few levels are missing), so if you want the whole game, you can wait for the rest of Black Mesa mod or get Half-Life 1.

Einfach Perfekt!\nGRAFIK.\nDie Grafik ist für das Jahr 2004 atemberaubend und schön detailliert. Das riesengroße Areal, das man während der Story durchquert lässt mich immer wieder staunen.\nSTORY:\nDie Geschichte hat einige interessante Wendepunkte. Man denkt das das Ende unmittelbar bevorsteht doch dann kommt trotzdem etwas dazwischen. Darunter leidet die Spannung aber nicht unbedingt. Was mir auch gefällt ist, dass es keine direkten Skriptsequenzen gibt die einem beim Spielen stören.\nSPIELZEIT:\nDie Spielzeit von 13-15 Stunden ist ideal für mich. Ich will keine elend lange Story von 40 Stunden und mehr. Darauf hätte ich einfach keine Lust.\nCHARAKTERE:\nDie Menschen haben wirkliche Emotionen, die auch nachvollziehbar sind. Die Gesichtszüge der Source Engine tragen dazu erheblich bei und sind für 2004 bemerkenswert. Das schafft heute nichtmal jedes Spiel.\nFAZIT:\nHalf-Life 2 hat eine faszinierende Geschichte, die mich auch etwas zum nachdenken angeregt hat. Der Preis von 8,99€ ist ein sehr guter Preis für so ein Stück Software. Ich würde auch das 4-fache bezahlen mit einem guten Gewissen.

No, the gameplay isn't perfect; it suffers the same feeling that half life 1 had, where headshots don't kill instantly, and in almost all combat situations you'll take damage,(which is countered by the balanced placement of health and shield pick-ups), but the story more than makes up for it. The depth that Valve managed to put into this game is nothing short of astounding. \n\nThe gameplay sequences are varied enough to never be boring, the characters are full of life (specially Gordon's voice acting, such a shame he died), and the world gritty and realistic (as far as Sci-fi alternate reality with gravity based weapons and teleporting assimilation armies can be). It also touches on so many themes (Ravenholm is genuinely terrifying, full of dark places and dead bodies, with eerie sounds and wails in the near background, whilst the citadel is futuristic and cold, a stark contrast to the dirty, noisy dystopian streets of city 17). Half-life 2 also has memorable enemies and encounters, with some noteable jump-scares and mini-bosses, placed perfectly when the current enemies verge on becoming boring, despite there only being a limited number of enemy archetypes. \n\nThe weapons are varied and balanced, and the pacing is exceptional: you never stay in one terrain long enough to get frustrated. On Hard, the game is challenging, but not infuriating, and although it is linear, there are many rewards from deviating from the action for a short while to explore. The Vehicle sections are just the right length to keep them from growing stale, and there are ample places to stop  and explore. There are a few puzzles, though they are mostly simple, but are still another welcome change. \n\nOverall this game is a masterpiece, and i say that everyone should play through it at least once. Well done Valve.","timestamp_created":1369945834,"timestamp_updated":1385469833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6041806","author":{"steamid":"76561198057812356","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1639424904},"language":"english","review":"gordon freeman returns in this heartstopping sequel to one of the best games of all time. take control of the man in the HEV suit once more to explore the secrets of city 17. one of my favourites.","timestamp_created":1369931295,"timestamp_updated":1369931295,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4650553","author":{"steamid":"76561198040349337","num_games_owned":836,"num_reviews":106,"playtime_forever":3923,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3833,"last_played":1378511902},"language":"english","review":"A follow-up that tries to do a lot of things and only manages to do well at some of them.","timestamp_created":1369890584,"timestamp_updated":1369890584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6618812","author":{"steamid":"76561198070636258","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":872,"last_played":1586006664},"language":"english","review":"Идеальная игра!
