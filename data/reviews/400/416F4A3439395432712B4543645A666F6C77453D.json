Сюжет игры берёт своё начало в камере отдыха, с прозрачными стенами за которыми мы видим белые стены, потолок, пол и окно, с матовым стеклом из которого должны наблюдать учёные. Механический женский голос говорит нам о правилах безопасности и приветствует нас в Лаборатории Исследования Природы Порталов. Из сказанного выше и названия игры вы могли понять, что продукт будет связан с порталами и да это так, вся игра завязана на порталах и на их применении для решения головоломок. В начале используем уже готовым порталам, а чуть позже мы получаем Портальную пушку и соответственно возможность генерировать порталы самостоятельно. Портальная пушка может сгенерировать два портала, синий и оранжевый, заходя в один мы выходим из другого и наоборот. И всю игру мы решаем различные головоломки используя порталы, окружение и различные предметы, которые предоставляет нам та или иная комната с испытанием. Соответственно, чем дальше мы проходим игру, тем сложнее становятся испытания и тем больше мы понимаем, что что-то тут не так... \nПо той причине, что игра в жанре головоломка, то в ней по определению должен быть адекватный гейм-дизайн и с этим у игры всё более чем в порядке, дизайн уровней великолепен, загадки проработаны и решаемы. \nТак же игра снабжена годным саундреком. И что ещё нужно нам для счастья и хорошего времяпрепровождения?\n\nЕсли вы каким-то образом пропустили эту замечательную игру 10 летней давности, то берите сразу со второй частью. Да и в целом я рекомендую продукт к ознакомлению, ибо Portal это пример хорошей игры и напоминание о тех временах, когда Valve делали игры, а не новые кейсы в CS:GO.  \n\n    \n","timestamp_created":1517774748,"timestamp_updated":1517774748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59375","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39851008","author":{"steamid":"76561198084079910","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":698,"last_played":1631426001},"language":"english","review":"Short but amazingly good!","timestamp_created":1517772643,"timestamp_updated":1517772643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39849996","author":{"steamid":"76561198451210103","num_games_owned":704,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":78,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1515861037},"language":"czech","review":"Skvelá hra na zabitie času najskôr len doplnok do orangeboxu.

Not recommended for people new to the Portal series.\n\nI know, it seems like the opposite of what someone would say. Hear me out:\n\nIt's all about first impressions.\n\nPortal 2 is an extremely successful successor to the first game overall. \nGraphics are highly improved, mechanics are smoother, controls are nearly the same as Portal's but somehow easier to learn. They even manage to throw in Co-op mode (with further smaller divisions, such as Co-op Story and Co-op Workshop) and new and tested ideas (backstory further strung out, introduction of propulsion and repulsion gels, etc.)\nIn essence, much more thought was put into this sequel.\n\nThe graphics aren't too hot (understandable). The puzzles are (in my opinion) more difficult, mainly due to what seems like poor control and a lack of complete understanding of exactly what Valve itself had created (also understandable). \nIt almost feels thrown out there to appease a fanbase, which never ends well. Not bad, but not...well...not too good either.\n\nIf I had a choice, I would have bought Portal 2 first had it been available at the time. In fact, I might not have even bothered with the original Portal.\n\nOf course, take my words with a grain of salt.

(8/10)\n\n==== AUDIO ====\nDie deutsche Vertonung ist sehr gut gelungen. Der Humor des englischen Originals wurde mit gleicher Qualität beibehalten. Die Musik ist nicht wirklich etwas besonderes. Sie ist OK fällt aber kaum besonders auf. (5/10)\n\n==== GAMEPLAY ====\nMacht einen riesen Spaß. Die Rätsel sind anfangs nicht schwer. Später kommen jedoch Rätsel wo man erstmal ein bisschen Nachdenken muss, da man einige Eigenschaften der Portale noch nicht kennt. Ich werde hierzu jedoch nichts spoilern. Die Rätsel zum Ende hin werden dann schon etwas schwieriger. Wenn man dann jedoch auf die Lösung kommt hat man so einen \"Wieso bin ich da nicht früher drauf gekommen!?\"-Moment. Über den Verlauf des Spiels werden auch immer weitere Elemente zu den Rätseln hinzugefügt, was für Abwechslung un immer komplexere Rätsel sorgt. (10/10)\n\n==== STEUERUNG ====\nDie Kamera bewegt sich etwas zu langsam. Bevor ihr also richtig loslegt solltet ihr also die Mausempfindlichkeit etwas hochstellen. Ansonsten ist die Steuerung sehr simpel. WASD zum Bewegen. E um Sachen aufzuheben. LMB und RMB zum Portale verschießen und ESC fürs Menü. Das ist die gesamte Steuerung. (9,9/10)\n\n==== STORY ====\nExtrem humorreich. Die Witze sind unerwartet und bringen einen tatsächlich zum Lachen. Der Spieler hat nicht eine einzige Zeile Dialog und der einzige andere Charakter ist \"GLaDOS\". GLaDOS ist sehr gut geschrieben und die Quelle des Humors. Leider ist das Spiel nach 1 - 2 Stunden aber auch schon wieder vorbei. Dann gibt es nur noch die etwas schwereren Karten und den Herausforderungsmodus womit man den Content noch auf ungefähr 5 Stunden erweitern konnte. Diese Zahl ist aber auch nur dann realistisch, wenn man keine Guides aus dem Internet nutzt um die Rätsel zu lösen. Es gibt in diesem Teil auch noch keine Workshopintegration mit der man den Wiederspielwert durch benutzergenerierten Content erhöhen könnte. (8/10)\n\n==== FAZIT ====\nEs ist definitiv ein Must-Have.
