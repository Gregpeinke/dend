Creepy-crawly spiders or shadowy forms moving just outside your field of view seemed too contrived and blunt to ever be frightening. Worst case scenario, they kill you. Oh no, not death, that thing we all have to face eventually anyway! Maybe bodily harm? Ideally I'd like to not be in pain, but skinning my knee doesn't exactly give me nightmares. What really gets to me is the sort of subtle, believable, and relatable psychological oppression nicely exemplified by Portal. \nTo start off, GLaDos has this way of seamlessly mixing truth with fiction so that you have no idea what is going on. Is the world really up there waiting for you? Are you underground? Are you really adopted? Who are you? What are we testing for?This is worsened by the fact that every test chamber looks the same and once you start portaling you can't tell which side of the room is really the floor and which is the ceiling: almost vertigo inducing disorientation. All the turrets seem to feel pain both physical and emotional and say \"Are you still there\", \"I don't hate you\", in a cooing voice as you kill them. GLaDos might feel pain too, the companion cube might love you? It's all unclear. The lines between human, zombie, and computer are always up for debate. All the while, Chell is slowly drained of her humanity. This blurry \"half life\" state (you see what they did there right?) is a guiding theme of the the Portal and aptly named Half-Life series. The Schodinger's cat motiff of portal (zombie cat dead and alive) is most poignant in Portal 2 when you hear the companion cube singing (are you going insane?) and it sounds like the mews of a cat a little. A cat trapped in between life and death mewing a cheerful song to pass the time. I don't know, maybe I'm being a bit melodramatic. But this is the only type of \"horror a la Valve\" that resonates with me.\n On every level from the visceral to the metaphysical this already struck a chord with me. None of the individual test chamber were too challenging, except for one of the advanced challenge chambers, but after marathoning through all the puzzles I could actually feel Chell's mental and physical exhaustion and really did just want to lay down in grass somewhere outside of Aperture and forget about science. By Portal 2, Valve had mastered the situation where you aren't quite sure whether to laugh a lot, or in fact be quite sad. The ending scene of Portal 2 was especially either heartwrenching or hillarious... I'm still not quite sure which (The Cara Mia turret opera), especially when translated from Italian to english. Of course this is not to say I didn't enjoy the game. In fact, Portal 2 is my second favorite game (I suppose Portal is 3rd), next to Half-Life. That I was made to feel Chell's psychological torment despite the fact that I was having the time of my life figuring out the portal mechanics is testament to the depth and care put into this game. \nNow for the part that most people associate with the game: the portal mechanics. Obviously I was quite enthralled by the quality of the Valve physics engine. Yes, momentum is conserved between portals, though I could have told you that without testing because the portal jumps are translationally invarient. I can also tell you that angular momentum and energy are conserved between portals because they preserved rotational symmetry and time symmetry respectively. Even charge and more exotic quantities would be conserved because of certain portal symmetries I observed. See what I'm saying, there's no point in me gushing over the physics engine because it's obvious that someone like me will enjoy themselves. I must say though, that Valve's use of the jump-then-press-crouch technique is one of the greatest physics engine innovations of all time. In the second advanced challenge chamber when I had to make Chell curl into a ball so her center of gravity was high enough to make the jump, I was quite impressed with the sophistication of the engine.\n\nIf you don't have time to read all that...it was good...play it.","timestamp_created":1408774712,"timestamp_updated":1408774712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482283473014831543","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11828886","author":{"steamid":"76561198139520562","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1409980684},"language":"english","review":"not as good as portal 2 but still is very fun and awesome","timestamp_created":1408774259,"timestamp_updated":1408774259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11828051","author":{"steamid":"76561198079476296","num_games_owned":689,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":298,"last_played":1558138234},"language":"english","review":"A good game, not as good as it's sequel, Portal 2.
