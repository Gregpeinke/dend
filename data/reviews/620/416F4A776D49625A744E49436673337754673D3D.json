Игроки, имевшие первые две игры на своей учетной записи Steam, могли подарить их своим друзьям. В данном посте, как вы уже догадались по названию, речь пойдет о Portal. Первая часть активно демонстрировала игрокам свои особенности. По традиции Valve игра оставляла только положительные эмоции, тем самым полюбилась игровым сообществом. Стоит отметить, что события Portal и Half-Life происходят в одной игровой вселенной, что породило множество различный обсуждения на фан-сайта обеих игр, герои, а также некоторые элементы игры стали популярным интернет-мемом. Основным элементом игрового процесса является переносное устройство создания порталов или же как его называют в народе - портальная пушка. Устройство позволяет игроку создать два портала. Одновременно можно открыть только два портала - голубой и оранжевый. Объект, проходящий через порталы, сохраняет свою кинетическую энергию. Вторая часть стала достойным продолжением. В отличии от первой, которая содержала файлы Half-Life, вторая же часть стала первой игрой от Valve, которая не использовала файлы другой игры, за исключением Half-Life и Half-Life 2. Новая часть представила незабываемую атмосферу, прекрасный игровой процесс, а также музыкальное сопровождение. Одним из главных нововведений стал режим совместного прохождения, где игрокам предстоит пройти ряд испытаний вместе, играя за двух роботов, Атласа и Пи-боди. Также нельзя не отметить карты сообщества, которые создавали игроки специально для игроков. Если появится желание создать свою карту, то для этого можно просто зайти редактор карт, создание карты не составит особого труда. Игра мне очень понравилась, особенно режим совместного прохождения, хочу напомнить, что Portal одна из моих любимых игр.","timestamp_created":1453554321,"timestamp_updated":1453554321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592290580272674561","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20699565","author":{"steamid":"76561198094570297","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":388,"last_played":1452302621},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever, all the charm and humour of the first game and the co-op is brilliant, a lot of fun and very satisfying.
