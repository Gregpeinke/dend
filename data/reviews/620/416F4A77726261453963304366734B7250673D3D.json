The writing is some of the most insulting dialog I've ever had the joy to sit through, laughing the whole way through. The detail and Easter eggs, which assist in telling you the story are scattered about, and add a fun exploration element that would have been completely non existent otherwise. The voice acting is perfect, the timing, the somewhat computeriness (it's a word now, deal with it), but still with so much emotional quality, admittedly mostly on the sarcastic variety, add to the interesting character far beyond the script alone. And finally the music, such an unusual mix, and songs that have become instant classics to which almost every gamer can now sing along to. All around everything I look for in an enjoyable, immersive, and captivating game play experience.\n\nI have played both portal 1 and 2, and if I have any complaints at all about 2, and it's a small one, it's that I miss having more choices on where to place portals like you had in 1. I mean, I understand the reasoning behind it, give a person too many portable surfaces and you open up the puzzle to the point that it may become quite easy to skip the intended path, losing part of the challenge of the game.  Still, this is the one thing that at times makes it hard for me to rate this game as better then the first, only because that element was something I found added to the fun of Portal in the first place. Being able to at times feel as though I had found my own solution to a puzzle, even if it was not how it was meant to be done. Also the simplicity of the first game added to the over all feel of a cold, sterile environment that really let the dialog and game mechanics take center stage.  \n\nThat said, I found Portal 2 to be an excellent squeal that took a game that started an add in extra, like a prize in a box of cereal, and developed it into it's on beautiful work of art. I find myself replaying it, not to see if I can beat it faster, or get all the achievements (but huh, there's a thought), but more to smile again and enjoy the witty banter and get that warm fuzzy feeling of nostalgia from it all over again.\n\nI haven't even tapped into the co op. To have such an awesome game as a single player probably would have in and of itself made portal 2 a successful sequel, but to add a completely separate, but included co op experience with all new levels, into the mix was more then I could have asked for. It allowed me to bring my dad into the game, which the single player had not managed on its own, and gave the community as a whole a canvas on which to build and share their own puzzles, thus allowing the fun to continue long after the end credits have rolled. \n\nSo what can I say about this game, quite a lot really, but seeing as how this is a review to presumably help that one person out there that hasn't quite decided if they should buy this game yet out, I'll simply say this. Buy it, you won't be sorry. It goes on sale enough these days that it's well worth the small amount you'd be spending to get such a full experience and fun story.","timestamp_created":1434171758,"timestamp_updated":1434171758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16346975","author":{"steamid":"76561198050289902","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":478,"last_played":1409105254},"language":"english","review":"One of the best Co-op games to play with a friend.
