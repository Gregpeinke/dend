You start in a beautiful city in the sky and you see it falling down during the playthrough.\n\nThird: the gameplay is pretty basic weaponwise, but the skyhook, the skylines and the vigors add some verry fun elements to it. So do the tears, elisabeth can bring into the world. And with elisabeth comes the two biggest reasons into play, that makes this game a masterpiece and a milestone in gaming history!\n\nFourth: Elisabeth! One of the, if not the best \"sidekick\" in a game ever!!\nShe is never in the way, she doesn't need to be protected, she provides ammo, healh salts during fights and finds money when not in a fight. She can open tears, moves the story forward and her body language / facial expressions are nearly perfect! And she interacts with her surrounding.\n\nFifth: the story! One of the most intelligent and complex ever done in a fps! Not easy to follow, if you don't listen to all the voxaphones in the game, don't listen to the dialogs or pay not much attention in general. But if you do (a second playthrough is recommendet to understand all the little details) everything makes sense, and the end will leave you with an open mouth and days and days you will think about the story and want to tell everyone you know, what you think about it!\n\nThe only negative things i could point out (and they are not really to mention, couse they don't affect the gameplay in a big way imo) are, that you can only carry two weapons, there are some minor grahic bugs and the npcs (beside elisabeth oc!) all look the same and only have one phrase to speak.\n\nIn the end, this is a masterpiece in storytelling, atmosphere and a milestone in gaming history! \nBuy it! Play it! Enjoy it!

That's definitely this story. I could go on and on about how fantastic this game is, but I think if you're on the edge of purchasing it, then definitely do so. It could honestly change your life. I know it has for me. \n\nIt seems a bit silly, as this is just a game to some, but I believe that games are a form of artwork, and with artwork, you can produce certain feelings and messages to give to the receivers. \n\nThis is my favorite game of all time, and it will always be forever now.

[/b]As all the franchise, but specifically in this game  it's amazing. [spoiler]you might have to play a second time to figure out what happened.[/spoiler].\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]There's no big improvement on the sort of guns. \n[*]Even though the AI is fair good, the game is super easy, like almost AAA game today :(.\n[/list]\n\nAmazing Characters, Amazing gameplay. Buy it either in full price or in off.\n\nScore: 8,7/10","timestamp_created":1507499078,"timestamp_updated":1513171640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35580912","author":{"steamid":"76561198076439002","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":737,"last_played":1417234932},"language":"english","review":"Like 2 years later and im still mad as fuck this game was straight trash","timestamp_created":1507489499,"timestamp_updated":1507489499,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.400774389505386353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35579083","author":{"steamid":"76561198124245103","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":3200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2226,"last_played":1641387581},"language":"schinese","review":"很棒的游戏，各种方面做的都非常优秀，但是射击手感稍微薄弱，总体来看9/10。\n虽然不建议一周目的时候过分专注于收集，但是游戏的很多背景剧情都在收集里，所以就很尴尬。。。","timestamp_created":1507484437,"timestamp_updated":1507484437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35578500","author":{"steamid":"76561198091361762","num_games_owned":587,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1004,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1507481256},"language":"turkish","review":"Bu oyun hakkında söylenecek tek şey MÜKEMMEL...","timestamp_created":1507482894,"timestamp_updated":1507482894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35575717","author":{"steamid":"76561198047026049","num_games_owned":399,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":530,"last_played":1411569136},"language":"english","review":"Infinite is definitely an interesting game that is worth the journey, but only because of the lustre established by its ending third and the plot-twists therein. Sadly, the story is heavily segregated from the gameplay - so you end up in the situation where your main character, someone remorseful about killing, spends most of the game committing manslaughter. \n\nSadly, the high-octane action gameplay within is also rather bland and at best functional. And once the afterglow of the story fades away, you realise you're left with a game with bad gameplay and an ultimately flawed storyline which serves as filler till the ending.","timestamp_created":1507476049,"timestamp_updated":1507476049,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534408390522003174","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35575151","author":{"steamid":"76561198313095855","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":454,"last_played":1522411763},"language":"polish","review":"Zarąbista gra!!!","timestamp_created":1507474704,"timestamp_updated":1507474704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6NCf/t4Cf9bahwE="}
