What do you mean you time traveled? Talk sense!?!\" This is getting old and abused; its not hard to understand that 'time travel' means traveling forward or backward in time (pretty literal name for it). One would hope for a Main Character that can muster more of a response, maybe something that asked for a better explaination, instead of a reply that seems like the NPC sentence just completely shut down all cognitive ability beyond \"I don't get it!\".

I'll admit that Infinite is the worst game of the series, the story itself while it starts out interesting dissolves into a lazy attempt at time travel and religion.

Despite all the negatives brought up, the sky-line system was particularly fun to mess with and columbia is a decent alternative to rapture. At the end Bioshock: Infinite feels like a rushed mess, even though there are positives they aren't enough to outweigh the negatives.

I played through a second time in 1999 mode to better understand the story. Just made me love the story even more. One of my all time favorite games.\n\nMy only complaint is that 1999 mode was way too easy. The main problem is that the clothing that makes you invulnerable when you jump off a skyline is waaaaaay too overpowered. Any level with a skyline was trivial once I got that. Sadly, that meant the final fighting level was no challenge whatsoever. The other problem is that there is so much salts around that I always had abundant vigors available when needed while also possessing all the vending machines. Emergency vigors plus a hand cannon with the right gear and the game becomes a bit too easy.\n\nThe Burial at Sea DLCs are also amazing.

Though admittedly the weapons in the Bioshock universe have always been so satisfying to use. Especially the Shotgun and Peppermill in both sound and visual. Handymen were some of the better enemies, but there's only a total of four in the single player. So a majority of the bouts are mostly citizens and commies. But keep in mind- the main reason why I recommend is the story itself. The game is loaded with more twists than a decent Shyamalan film. Starts out as a \"Princess is in another castle\" scenario, but immediately derails to a completely different plot. Then that plot gets scrapped for another and fucks you over at the end- in a good way, mind you. \n\nIt's one of those few games that actually makes you mentally retrace all sorts of tidbits you seen during your session, put them together, and create theories and discussions that have already been debunked via Youtube.

Porter un autre nom aurait je pense occulter les quelques commentaires de la génération gamer « jamais content ». \nEn effet durant cette première moitié on à du mal à retrouver nos repères par rapport au premier épisode. Fini l’ambiance oppressante et malsaine de rapture (que j’appréciait tout particulièrement) Nous ne sommes plus isolé au fond des océans mais bel et bien dans les airs. Soit un univers clairs, coloré et plein de vie ! Columbia est en fait l'opposé de Rapture. Là ou les ennemis de la cité sous-marine étaient défigurés et mutilés, les ennemis de la cité aérienne sont les autorités locales (dans un premier temps). L’individualité et l’argent sont les rois à rapture, mais c’est la communauté et la spiritualité qui domine a columbia. Bref comme je disais, deux univers complètement opposés et c'est je pense un choix bien volontaire des devs.\nLe scénario de cette première partie est bien (mais pas top !) suffisamment prenant pour qu’on avance mais guère surprenant pour le moment. Cependant la magie opère quand même. Les grandes forces des bioshock, bien avant l’histoire et le gameplay, ce sont la direction artistique et le background qui prime sur tout le reste (point de vue perso vous enflammez pas). L’univers du jeu  est à nouveau grandement réussi autant qu’il flatte la rétine (et là je parle pas de graphisme pur mais de design), la ville de columbia prend vie et on a envie d’avancer pour tout découvrir !\nChose qui n’a pas plus à tout le monde d’ailleurs, car contrairement à ses prédécesseurs bioshock infinite prend son temps pour poser le décors, et tout au long du jeux il y aura de nombreuses pauses propice « aux balades » et la naration. Ce que j’ai trouver jouissif pour ma part... mais qui peut faire rager justement des fans puristes de fps, désireux de juste avancer et tirer.\nLa deuxième partie du jeu s’emballe au niveau du scénario et là je retire tout ce que j’ai dit avant ! on est de retour dans un vrai Bioshock ! Les choses s’assombrissent au fur et à mesure de la progression et le scénario gagne en ampleur et en complexité pour débouché sur un final qui vous laissera sur le cul (prenez un doliprane émile...) Bref la patte de ken levine tout craché, qui je pense à des problèmes dans sa tête quand même !\nPlutôt que de faire un 3ème episode calqué sur ses ainés (comme le font bon nombre d’éditeurs…)Bioshock Infinite est une prise de risque, qui pour moi est une grande réussite, mais qui pourra aussi dérouté les fans du premier épisode. Je le conseille donc  non seulement aux fans de fps pur et dur qui veulent faire une pause tranquilou, mais aussi aux gens pas à l’aise avec les jeux de tirs qui aime les univers scénarisés, et des backgrounds solides.\n\nPoint positifs :\n-       Un pari risqué pour irrationalle games (echec ou reussite, prendre un risque de nos jours ça à le mérite d'être souligné)\n-\tBaffe graphique ( DA et les couleurs bordels !!!!)\n-\tUnivers riche et cohérents\n-       Toujours un perfect pour la bande son\n-\tScénario en mode diesel, on n’en sort pas déçu !\n-       Doublage VF surprenant....respect !\n-       Les armes rétro-futuriste (CLAAAAAASSiiiieuuuuseeeee)\n-       IA d'Elizabeth pas dégueux, on va dire qu'elle est une ébauche d'Ellie de Last of us.\n\nPoint négatifs :\n-\tGameplay similaire depuis le premier épisode, donc à la ramasse…\n-\tDifficulté au niveau des pâquerettes (jouer en difficile sinon vous allez vous faire chier !)\n-\tPerte de l’ambiance oppressante qu’on retrouve un peu trop tardivement\n\nMise a jour DLC Burial at sea (Sans spoil):\n\nVenant tout juste de les finir, que dire…si ce n’est qu’Irrationnal Games va beaucoup manquer à ses fans. \nJe ferai simple est rapide vu que j’ai déjà écrit un roman pour le jeu de base. Le premier épisode on retrouve Elisabeth (transformée en femme fatale pour l’occasion) et Booker qui semble être fidèle à lui-même. L’intérêt Principale de ce 1er épisode est bien évidement le fameux retour à Rapture, à une période vraiment intéressante vu qu’il s’agit de la nuit ou ont eu lieu les premiers débordements, soit le début de la fin pour la cité sous-marine.\nOn a donc l’occasion de visité une portion de la ville encore intacte et pleine de vie, qui nous donnera une idée de la vie à Rapture. Et là c’est la claque tant c’est beau à en pleurer ! Y’a pas à dire, le moteur d’infinite s’accorde à merveille avec l'ambiance de Rapture. \nJe ne parlerai pas de l’histoire en elle-même, même si ce premier épisode, avouons le un peu court ne sert au final qu’a mettre en place les évènements du 2ème. (Mais ça pique au portefeuille quand même)\n2ème épisode magistrale du début à la fin, démontre que certains Dlc sont indispensables à certaines licences. La particularité est qu’on incarne cette fois notre chère lizzy, ce qui amène un peu de changement dans le gameplay, sans pour autant le révolutionner non plus. Le final je n’en doute pas vous laissera sur le cul, et vous donnera envie de relancer le premier bioshock. Au passage, merci Ken Levine d'avoir fait chialé un grand gaillar comme moi ! (enfoiré ^^).\n\nConclusion : Bioshock Infinite est un chef d'oeuvre, et bien que j’ai vraiment adoré le jeu de base y’a pas à dire, revenir à Rapture dans les dlc et redécouvrir la ville sous un nouveau jour à été jubilatoire. Ces 2 épisodes marquent aussi le grand retour des chrosomes, et la folie qui les caractérisent. Quand au grand final, tout comme pour le jeu de base n’hésitez pas à trouver des explications à droite à gauche pour vous aider à tout appréhender, puis à bâtir votre propre vision des choses. La licence Bioshock m’a vraiment redonné gout aux FPS tant ils sont unique, et donc rare. Un bel exemple de jeux qui démontre que le FPS ce n’est pas qu’avancé est tiré…comprenne qui voudra. \n\nPoint positifs :\n-\tDirection Artistique (encore et toujours)\n-\tBackground\n-\tClaque graphique\n-\tRapture\n-\tElizabeth jouable\n-\tLa boucle est bouclée…\nPoints négatifs :\n-\tUn seul Dlc groupé aurait suffit (money, money, money)\n-\tIA totalement larguée","timestamp_created":1389288711,"timestamp_updated":1553771809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8634134","author":{"steamid":"76561198011923453","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":1102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":712,"last_played":1484491319},"language":"english","review":"Wow, this is a great story, but not a great game.

Then the enemies don't require 20000 shots to finish, which otherwise makes the game quite frustrating and tedious.

And you quickly realize that most of the guns are not really that useful, and you stick with the same. There is no real point or variety switching around. \n\nIt just feels like hard work in order to progress on harder levels, not more intense action.

Well, that's pretty subjective in this instance. What it all comes down to is what exactly you're looking for in a game. As far as actual gameplay goes, this is your standard FPS with a few bells and whistles thrown into the combat system to break up the monotony a bit, and even then you'll find a bell and/or whistle early on that you'll probably stick with for the rest of the game due to the fact that they're completely unbalanced. Other than that, it's a shooting gallery for the vast majority of the game. Ammo is nearly a non-factor and if you're experienced in FPS games at all, you'll likely find yourself running around in the open going for head shots just to add a bit of a challenge. So why does this game get such great reviews? Well, as soon as you get your first glimpse of Columbia (the floating city in which most of the game takes place), you start to realize how much effort and care was put into making it. To just say \"the graphics are good\" would be an injustice. Visually, this game is absolutely astonishing. The artistic direction they took is not only executed exceptionally well from a purely visual standpoint, but it also makes for an extremely immersive experience. Even the smallest details are stylized to add to the overall cohesiveness of the game. It's a bit hard to explain how well the art lends itself to the story without including any spoilers, so I'll keep it short. Suffice it to say that the story will keep you guessing, and you'll find yourself continuing to play just to see what happens next. It's a very well-written story and the ending will make you question reality itself. What about replay value? Well, there's not much, which is a little disappointing considering there's no online multiplayer capability. You might play the game through a second time, but that's about it. However, even though I played it through once and haven't touched it since, I still felt like I got my money's worth out of it even at full price.\n\nTo me, this game felt like it could have been a science fiction novel, which is simultaneously it's greatest achievement and biggest downfall. It was an interesting, well written story which took place in a beautifully crafted world that perfectly complimented the plot. It's almost like they worked so hard on those things that they forgot people had to play the game in between plot points. If you can appreciate a game that goes above and beyond to tell a story, then you should absolutely give this a shot. However, if you're looking for a challenging, action-packed FPS game, you may want to look elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1389257067,"timestamp_updated":1389257067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8629452","author":{"steamid":"76561198072715419","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":790,"last_played":1399784749},"language":"english","review":"Very good story to this game i recomend it to anyone seeking more than just a straight shooter","timestamp_created":1389252460,"timestamp_updated":1389252460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8629437","author":{"steamid":"76561198024894616","num_games_owned":365,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":1448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":989,"last_played":1404033744},"language":"english","review":"Great fun.

If ever I was challenged that video games are not art, I would point the nonbeliever to BioShock Infinite.","timestamp_created":1389246424,"timestamp_updated":1389246440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8628610","author":{"steamid":"76561198101291559","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3820,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2969,"last_played":1423562611},"language":"russian","review":"Что не говори но незаурядная игра!","timestamp_created":1389244672,"timestamp_updated":1389244672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8628471","author":{"steamid":"76561198114378640","num_games_owned":412,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":926,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":629,"last_played":1396983802},"language":"english","review":"can't even describe the atmosphere of this game, even after the second time beating it through.

Man kann sich gar nicht an der Land- bzw. in diesem Falle an der Luftschaft satt sehen. Man hat das Gefühl, die ganze Welt ist ständig in Bewegung. Weiter flasht die durch und durch rätselhafte Story zum Ende hin derart, dass man den gesamten Abspann über nur mit offenem Mund auf die Credits starrt und hofft, dass da noch etwas kommt. Nicht zuletzt trägt hier die fast perfekte deutsche Synchro zu diesem Ergebnis bei.\n\n[b]Negativ:[/b] Die immer wieder als offen suggerierte Spielwelt, entpuppt sich zum absolut linearen Handlungsstrang, in dem man nur selten nach links oder rechts ausweichen muss, und wenn doch, kommt man immer wieder an den Ort der Abzweigung zurück. Weiter verleitet das Spiel sehr stark dazu, als reiner Ego-Shooter angesehen und auch benutzt zu werden. Der Einsatz der sekundären Fähigkeiten, der 8 Kräfte, ist optional und wird zu wenig zwingend ins Spielgeschehen eingebunden.\n\n[b]Fazit:[/b] Trotz seiner markanten Schwächen zieht Bioshock Infinite den Spieler absolut in seinen Bann.

Never finished a second playthrough though, and frankly I don't feel compelled to go back to it at all. It's the same issue I had with the first Bioshock and doesn't surprise me. I also don't think it's a bad thing: I feel like I got my money's worth in one playthrough even though I bought the game full price.\n\nThe actual gameplay is just sort of...there. It's nothing that other games haven't done better and frankly the plasmid / tonic thing seemed entirely out of place in this gameworld. It made a certain amount of sense in Rapture but in Columbia it really doesn't.\n\nWhat I come to Bioshock for is the story. Yeah, it's a stretch at times but the payoff was worth the ride and in the end I was happy with the experience. I played through spoiler-free just like I did the first game and it was really quite enjoyable. Like any medium that relies heavily on a \"twist\", it wears thin over time however, and on my second playthrough I realized that without my desire to KNOW there was nothing driving me to continue playing. Of course I'm not an achievement hound so regardless of emotional investment your mileage may vary.\n\nTL;DR: Bioshock Infinite is a worthwhile thing that I enjoyed a great deal.

If you have played 1 and 2 then Infinite will feel very familiar to you.  As a summary, the player is afforded the ability to use 2 weapons, and a host of plasmas.  Overall, the graphics were stunning, the game play fluid and the story captivating.\n\nTo touch on a couple of these points:\n\nOriginally I was a little sceptical about the sky hooks and thought that I would find them bothersome to attempt to navigate around the city on.  I am pleased to report that their inclusion into the game was seamless and caused no difficulties to the player, nor to player control.  Camera angle was likewise unproblematic which was also a blessing.\n\nMy one complaint was in relation to the plasmas.  In Bioshock 1 and 2 the plasmas were of much more relevance than in Infinite.  Overall I felt that I could have played the entire game without them and the outcome would have been pretty much the same in terms of game play experience.  The only plasma I actually used was the Crow and this was purely to distract mobs.\n\nThe story left me feeling a little confused, and for a few days afterwards I sat thinking about it.  There is a massive twist at the end that some players have stated they thought was obvious.  I can honestly say that I didn’t see it coming and fail to see how others did.   The finale did feel like a finale but did leave me wanting more.  It was therefore a blessing that Buriel Under the Sea has recently released allowing the player to return to Rapture for a new experience.\n\nIn terms of Burial Under the Sea, it is short!  \n\nThe DLC is certainly not worth the asking price (£12), though I was lucky enough to get the Season Pass on the steam sale for £4, which will in the future include Episode 2.  £4 is pretty much what the length of this DLC is worth.  The DLC feels like it could have been a full length game but it quickly draws to its conclusion – i.e. in about 2 – 3 hours, tops.  Given what you already know about the conclusion of Infinite the conclusion of Sea is therefore very obvious.  I would therefore recommend that you do not play this DLC unless you have completed Infinite.\n\nMy one complaint with the DLC was that ammo appeared a constant rarity which meant that my primary weapon was the melee function.  I didn’t find this satisfactory.  Likewise there was only 1 big daddy battle, given the much hyped return of the big daddy, and given the rarity of ammo I basically had to conduct this battle as a fist fight - which was completely unfulfilling!","timestamp_created":1389227893,"timestamp_updated":1389228388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8625872","author":{"steamid":"76561197998386037","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1047,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1042,"last_played":1413577924},"language":"english","review":"Wow Wow Wow - never been so drawn in by a game.
