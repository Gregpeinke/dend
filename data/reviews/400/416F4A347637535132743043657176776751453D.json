is a smart and witty puzzle game that takes place in the Valve-verse, the fictional universe occupied by the two Portal games and the Half-Life series.\n\nIn Portal, the player takes on the role of Chell, a silent protagonist who must solve a selection of puzzles based around the Aperture Science Portal Device, a gun that can fire up to two portals at once, one blue, one orange. If Chell walks through one, she comes out the other, and layered over this simple mechanic are buttons, weighted cubes, turrets, and all sorts of other objects. Each room makes up a puzzle, with the aim of each one being to leave the room and enter the next one. The execution of this differs from test to test, however, resulting in the game never feeling repetitive or dull. The satisfaction that comes with solving these puzzles is always rewarding.\n\nPortal also uses a style of storytelling often praised in video games for separating the medium from other mediums of storytelling- environmental storytelling. Scattered throughout the Testing Facility are messages scrawled on walls, and even the occasional picture. This makes the story feel almost like another puzzle, further adding to the experience as the player must piece together exactly what's happening.\n\nApart from Chell, the only other true character to speak of is GLaDOS, an AI that leads you through the Testing Facility. For much of the game, GLaDOS is just a voice, and her dialogue is a joy to listen to, often funny, elevating GLaDos to one of gaming's best characters.\n\nThough shorter than most games, Portal is a charming and clever package that is more than the sum of its parts, and once completed, will leave you wanting more. Thankfully, Portal 2 offers just that...","timestamp_created":1502447571,"timestamp_updated":1502447571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530432403087615967","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34164287","author":{"steamid":"76561198064139415","num_games_owned":713,"num_reviews":349,"playtime_forever":178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":178,"last_played":1502444956},"language":"german","review":"Empfehlenswert: Ja (persönliche Wertung: 7/10)\n\nErrungenschaften: Ja (teilweise schwer zu bekommen)\n\nPositiv:\n- Durchdachte Rätsel\n- Innovatives Gameplay\n- Gute Grafik\n\nNegativ:\n- Der Kuchen ist ein Lüge\n- Stellenweise zu einfach\n\nFazit:\nEin sehr lustiges und intelligentes Spiel. Leider mit knapp 2 Stunden Spielzeit etwas kurz. Dafür bekommt man allerdings eine künstliche Intelligenz mit einem merkwürdigen Humor geboten. Die Rätsel sind nicht alzu schwer und man kommt wunderbar durch. Richtig viel Spaß hat man dann wenn man beide Portale öffnen kann. Das Spiel bietet sogar ein bisschen Action, was aber nicht gerade den Hauptanteil des Spieles ausmacht. Ich persönlich finde das auch sehr gut. Es muss nicht immer Geballer geben. Und die paar Türme die man da besiegen muss, sind sogar ganz nett. Sie sagen z.B. das sie mir nicht böse sind das ich sie kaputt gemacht habe. Einen netteren und höflicheren Gegner habe ich noch nicht gehabt. Die Umgebung ist sehr steril gehalten, mit Ausnahme der letzten Level.

Tak jak w przypadku innej produkcji Valve, Half-Life (obie serie rozgrywają się w tym samym uniwersum) właściwie nie uświadczymy cut-scenek, w przypadku Portala przez większość czasu słyszymy GLaDOS, \"mózg\" Aperture Science, która nie szczędzi graczowi zabawnych uwag.\n\nGłówną zabawką naszej bohaterki Chell jest urządzenie, które pozwala tworzyć portale, lewym przyciskiem myszy tworzymy niebieski portal, a prawym pomarańczowy. Poza nimi natrafimy m.in na działka, które próbują nas namierzyć i wyeliminować, pudła pozwalające zastawić przycisk, czy bariery, które nie pozwalają nam używać portalów po obu stronach jednocześnie.\n\nSama gra nie jest specjalnie trudna, jeśli chodzi o kampanię, to etapy nie sprawiły mi większych problemów, na ogół jeżeli nie umiałem rozwiązać zagadki, to oznaczało, że po prostu nie zauważyłem jakiejś ściany/sufitu, na którym można postawić portal, dzięki czemu mogłem przejść dalej. Gra sama w sobie jest bardzo krótka, mamy do przejścia 19 poziomów, ostatni był dość długi, natomiast reszta niespecjalnie. Po ukończeniu Portala możemy przejść go ponownie, próbując zlokalizować wszystkie odbiorniki i złapać nimi sygnał, posłuchać komentarzy twórców, czy zapoznać się ze specjalnymi etapami i wyzwaniami.\n\nMyślę, że szczególnie warto zainteresować się dwoma ostatnimi. Specjalne etapy to 6 znanych z kampanii poziomów, ale w trudniejszych wersjach, np: w zaawansowanym poziomie 16 roboty są zamknięte w klatkach, ale wciąż mogą nas atakować, więc musimy odpowiednio się ukrywać. Poziomy zaawansowane, jak sama nazwa wskazuje nie są łatwe, ale jeśli tylko znamy domyślne wersje tych etapów, nie powinno być tak źle.\n\nWyzwania to znowu te same 6 plansz, tym razem ich \"zwykłe wersje\". Dla każdego z tych etapów mamy do pokonania 3 wyzwania:\na) Jak najmniej teleportów.\nb) Jak najmniej kroków (ARGH, gra uwielbia liczyć kroki za to, że skrzynka cię popchnęła).\nc) Jak najmniejszy czas ukończenia etapu.\nMuszę przyznać, że wyzwania stanowiły nie lada wyzwanie. No dobra, masło maślane, ale muszę przyznać, że w ich przypadku sięgałem po YT, czasem człowiek nawet nie zdaje sobie sprawy jak mało portali potrzebuje do szczęścia.\n\nRozpisałem się na temat kilku rzeczy, a jak sama grywalność? Cóż, jej poziom jest bardzo wysoki. Etapy są różnorodne i dobrze łączą myślenie z rozumem. Zdarzają się czasami dziwne wpadki fizyki, ale ogólnie ta też jest dopracowana. Bardzo podoba mi się też fakt, że w wielu przypadkach nie jesteśmy ograniczeni do jednego sposobu rozwiązania zagadki, dzięki czemu możemy próbować wielu kombinacji.\n\nMuzyki w grze właściwie nie uświadczyłem, tzn: może była, ale jeśli tak, to zagłuszała ją GLaDOS. Za to w creditsach gra świetny utwór, bardzo mi się spodobał.\n\nPodsumowanie: Portal jest świetną produkcją, która powinna zaspokoić każdego fana łamigłówek. Niestety gra ta jest bardzo krótka, na szczęście wyzwania i etapy zaawansowane przedłużają nasze obcowanie z tym tytułem, ale wciąż nie jest to raczej przygoda na długie godziny. Za 10 euro raczej nie polecam kupować, ze względu na czas trwania gry, ale jeśli trafi się jakaś duża wyprzedaż, polecam brać bez wahania.\n\nPlusy:\n+ GLaDOS i jej teksty\n+ Różnorodność\n+ Pomysł\n+ Dobra mieszanka myślenia i refleksu\n+ Wyzwania i etapy zaawansowane, które podnoszą trudność łamigłówek\n+ Osiągnięcia\n\nMinusy:\n- Bardzo krótka\n- Okazjonalne błędy\n\nOcena: 9/10","timestamp_created":1502234675,"timestamp_updated":1502234675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585635364055633545","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34113967","author":{"steamid":"76561198078507681","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":196,"last_played":1500579841},"language":"italian","review":"Gioco assolutamente unico e divertente, consigliato a tutti","timestamp_created":1502234261,"timestamp_updated":1502234261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34113111","author":{"steamid":"76561198071227281","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1542,"last_played":1408169484},"language":"english","review":"If you have the privilege of having this game not spoiled for you, you absolutely should play it.\n\nEven if you don't really consider yourself to like puzzle games, these puzzles are digestible and not frustrating at all. \n\nThe only reasons you shouldn't play this game is if you've had the story completely spoiled for you, you've already played Portal 2, or your short-term attention span can only be held by nonstop action games. \n\nThis is a slowly paced, short, but highly competent game.","timestamp_created":1502230739,"timestamp_updated":1502231062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34112001","author":{"steamid":"76561198290631650","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1615751287},"language":"french","review":"Classique de Steam, go pack Steam et profitez en.","timestamp_created":1502226423,"timestamp_updated":1502226423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34110982","author":{"steamid":"76561198261256860","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":116,"last_played":1523593600},"language":"spanish","review":"Gg ez","timestamp_created":1502222683,"timestamp_updated":1502222683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34110534","author":{"steamid":"76561198111781071","num_games_owned":993,"num_reviews":182,"playtime_forever":900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":124,"last_played":1402703144},"language":"english","review":"A great puzzle game, and a must have for any serious gamers library.","timestamp_created":1502221240,"timestamp_updated":1502221240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34108944","author":{"steamid":"76561198195002602","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":617,"last_played":1549103154},"language":"polish","review":"Świetna gra lecz 2 oczywiście lepsza","timestamp_created":1502215900,"timestamp_updated":1502215900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552238762378692627","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34107256","author":{"steamid":"76561197972040704","num_games_owned":1650,"num_reviews":696,"playtime_forever":201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":201,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"This was a game I shrugged and didn't care about when I heard the Orange Box was announced.

The mechanics are simple: you have a gun which can shoot a blue portal which connects to an orange portal. (Initially you can only create the blue portal but at a certain point you gain the ability to decide where both portals appear) Using this gun you are tasked with solving puzzles which become increasingly more difficult as you progress. Apart from the gun you can walk, jump, and pick things up.\n\nThe puzzles are excellently designed, introducing new mechanics easily and hitting the perfect balance of not too hard you have to look up a guide but not too easy you fly through them either.\n\nOf course a large part of the appeal of this game comes from the snarky robotic voice who talks to you and taunts you throughout the puzzles. GLaDOS adds a lot of humour to the game and is a much needed foil to the silent Chell who you play as.\n\nThis game is relatively short, especially when compared to its sequel, but it is certainly worth it. The story is entertaining and the puzzles manage to still be enjoyably replayable even when you know the solutions. The game also offers an advanced mode with more difficult versions of some of the puzzles, and a challenge mode which limits your portals/steps/time.\n\nAs a bonus you also get the OST free (you need to download the dlc), which - along with the background music - contains the Jonathan Coulton song written for the game with both the game version and one with JoCo singing.\n\nIf you still aren't convinced by the flood of positive reviews then wait for a sale, and if you're determined not to buy it then at least get the sequel which is longer and contains a multiplayer mode. Otherwise, crawl out from the rock you've been living under where you haven't heard of Portal before and buy this game to see what all the hype is about!\n\n[spoiler]The cake is a lie...[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1501972817,"timestamp_updated":1501972817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34047373","author":{"steamid":"76561198123000995","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1597961890},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo maravilhoso, super viciante.
