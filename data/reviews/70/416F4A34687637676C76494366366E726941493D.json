Yes this game looks dated as hell, but it was also released in 1998 and by that time it looked fantastic, GoldSrc is a mix bag of an engine now mainly because source shits on it, but this game's graphics are excellent by the standards of the late 90s.

Never leaving Gordon's perspective it really felt like YOUR journey. Gameplay is obviously what we all care about and sure I don't think the games shooting is comparable to a game like DOOM or Quake, but I think where Half-Life shines is in its enemies and Weapon rosters which mashed together with great level layout makes Half-Life's shooting truly Unique and great.\n\n9/10\n\"One of the most important shooters of all time, quite literally changed the game for the FPS genre\"","timestamp_created":1590018171,"timestamp_updated":1590018171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69511679","author":{"steamid":"76561198075175701","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1091,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1091,"last_played":1590020030},"language":"english","review":"I played this in 2020 and think the game has held up pretty well.
