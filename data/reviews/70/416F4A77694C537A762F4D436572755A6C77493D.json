But I think the experience as a whole makes up for it's shortcomings. First, I'll get to what I don't like about this game.\nHalf-Life has a big departure from classic FPS level design. Instead of a maze shooter where you find switches/keys to progress in the level, Half-Life's formula is relatively linear. Although this isn't necessarily bad, the game will feel very dumbed-down to someone who is used to Doom and Build engine games. There are a few levels that are a bit more open, but they all usually are long, boring, or tedious. \nBut besides that (and a couple glitches), I had a lot of fun playing this game. I think the weapons are fun, the mechanics nice to mess around with, the enemies enjoyable to battle, and the story interesting to think about. I think if you're a fan of classic FPS's, you should play this game if you haven't already. Even if you aren't usually one to play first person shooters, check this one out.","timestamp_created":1595803006,"timestamp_updated":1595803006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.712138891220092773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73331992","author":{"steamid":"76561198342652347","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":680,"last_played":1653867022},"language":"english","review":"just get black mesa nerd","timestamp_created":1595802432,"timestamp_updated":1595802432,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.452054768800735474","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73331253","author":{"steamid":"76561198269328047","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":821,"last_played":1652812612},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente, nada mas que agregar.","timestamp_created":1595801035,"timestamp_updated":1595801035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73331084","author":{"steamid":"76561198183981122","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1050,"last_played":1503697342},"language":"english","review":"no game today would be the same without this, 10/10 timeless masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1595800749,"timestamp_updated":1595800749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73329977","author":{"steamid":"76561198858274108","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1115,"last_played":1654349637},"language":"italian","review":"Scrivo questa recensione di Half Life a caldo, una sola parola.\nCAPOLAVORO.\n\nTRAMA:\nLa trama è qualcosa di unico, siamo Gordon Freeman, uno scienziato che lavora nella Black Mesa (parodia dell'Area 51), all'inizio del gioco Gordon dovrà fare un esperimento, dai dialoghi si può capire che sia di un'importanza notevole, ma qualcosa va storto, da quel che ho capito da quel incidente, si forma un ponte interdimensionale con un'altra dimensione chiamata Xen, da Xen cominciano a uscire creature mostruose, Gordon dovrà tentare di chiudere questo ponte tentando di chiuderlo a Xen, come se non bastasse si viene a scoprire che gli alieni che fino a poco fa erano i nemici principali passano in secondo piano, l'esercito comincerà a uccidere tutte le persone che lavorano a Black Mesa, probabilmente per insabbiare l'accaduto, in parte ho empatizzato con gli alieni di punto in bianco si ritrovano in un luogo che non hanno mai visto in vita loro, vedendo che gli unici esseri presenti gli sparano ferendoli o addirittura uccidendoli cominciano ad contrattaccare e provare nella titanica impresa di conquistare la terra, la trama può sembrare semplice ma più si andrà avanti più si complicherà, finale fantastico, ammetto che non l'ho capito molto, però quel poco che ho capito l'ho adorato, dialoghi non male.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nSul gameplay nulla da dire, perfetto, non ha difetti, grafica splendida, il design degli alieni è pazzesco, non mi faccio problemi a dire che quando certi alieni si avvicinavano troppo a me ero terrorizzato nel vederli, sembrano nati da un unione mentale tra Guillermo Del Toro e H.P. Lovecraft , i passi che fa il nostro personaggio sono realistici, per quanto riguarda le ambientazioni di Black Mesa e di Xen, Black Mesa è spettacolare, è come mi sarei immaginato una base di ricerca militare a fine anni novanta.\nL'apice arriva quando mettiamo il primo piede su Xen ti pare di essere sotto un effetto di trip di acidi, originale, non mi sarei mai immaginato un ambientazione ambientata in altra dimensione (scusate per il gioco di parole).\nI comandi di Half Life sono diventati talmente \"popolari\" che gli possiamo usare su pc praticamente in qualsiasi gioco, la colonna sonora quelle poche volte che si sente è azzeccata, combat system da applausi, adrenalinico, armi di ogni genere, dal piede di porco fino a braccia aliene che sparano qualcosa che non riuscivo a capire.\nPer la prima nei videogiochi (ai tempi) la trama era attaccata al gameplay, 0 e ripeto, 0 cutscenes, tutto gameplay con una trama intrigante.\nNon ho parlato bene dei mostri a livello di IA e difficoltà, allora qui ci sono molte tipologie di mostri, dove ognuna ha i suoi punti forti e punti deboli, potrà capitare di morire spesso quando si è contro questi esseri ma appena si capisce come giocano e le loro \"tattiche\" ti immergi completamente nel gioco.\n UNICI DIFETTI? Forse forse il design delle armi, alcune armi sembrano le pistole ad acqua che compri dal wucumpra in riviera e il fatto che i personaggi ti seguono male, però sono difetti che si può passare sopra, puzzle abbastanza facili, dopotutto Half Life non deve far spremere le meningi al giocatore per andare avanti, te le fa spremere per capire la trama.\n\nCONCLUSIONE:\nSe un giorno qualcuno mi chiedesse che gioco dovrebbe giocare per fare pratica con i comandi su pc, la mia risposta sarebbe Half Life, Half Life è l'ABC del videogioco su pc, è stato il titolo che ha portato nell'Olimpo la categoria FPS, semplicemente capolavoro, difficilmente rischia di annoiare, trama che sembra scritta da David Lynch, finale da brividi, dopo Red Dead Redeption 2 penso che Half Life abbia fatto breccia nel mio cuore da amante del gaming, COMPLIMENTI VALVE\n\nVOTO\n10","timestamp_created":1595798825,"timestamp_updated":1603957303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562560617923736572","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73329544","author":{"steamid":"76561199056632911","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1599792501},"language":"english","review":"Good game good game","timestamp_created":1595798041,"timestamp_updated":1595798041,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73329523","author":{"steamid":"76561198346129554","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":875,"last_played":1630213077},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de los juegos más entretenidos de todos los tiempos.

Painstakingly tedious.\n\nHalf-Life is one of those games that are so known that it's kind of impossible to say something bad about. The nostalgia googles are on and no-one's keen on taking them off.\n\nDubbed \"one of the three titans\" (alongside Unreal Tournament and Quake III: Arena), this was a must play at the turn of the new millennium. The internet cafes were crowded with people playing the titans and also other less mentioned games (like Delta Force or Rainbow Six). The thing is... everyone played multiplayer (death match) and mostly the mods: Wanted, Opposing Force, Counter-Strike. Almost no one would play single player.\n\nI remember asking people in the day if the single player experience was any good, but most players told me they either hadn't played it or that is wasn't all that great. As someone who hasn't played the single player experience back in the day, I can surely say that playing this game decades later is a whole different experience that it would have been in '99.\n\nVisually, the game looks great for the time it came out. It has it's distinct look and feel but after finishing the game, I do feel that a lot of elements were inspired by games that were happening in that time frame, especially Action Quake II (which is funny as Counter-Strike would become the spiritual successor), Unreal (the Xen levels) and Duke Nukem as far as some panels and details go.\n\nWhat I find particularly weird is that later iterations and mods (DM, CS) would bring more improvements which were never back-ported. I really wonder why they didn't take the time to keep all games at the same level of detail.\n\nThe sound is generally bad. I understand that positional sound was a great thing at the time, but for the most time you can't really understand what anyone's saying. The sound options don't have any effect on the game. Music is nice but it's so rare that you'll probably miss it. I found myself actually listening to external music because everything was too bland.\n\nGameplay is where the mishmash comes in. Controls are dated. Very clunky, needing very high coordination for some areas. Some jumps require perfect timing. Climbing and descending stairs was never a strong point, but that fall damage really hurts (you get less damaged from enemies than from the fall damage).\n\nThe first 3rd of the game is really good. You feel engaged. Everything is done and detailed in a perfect manner. After this point, the game quickly comes to a crawl because every 5 minutes you'll encounter precisely engineered annoyances. Every step you take you'll get shot, jumped-at, exploded, stalked, etc. It becomes so tedious that a typical player would just consider it's not worth the effort. Everything is scripted to be against you. If this game was made today, I would say that developers purposely made the game hard, but that was the way of thinking for the time.\n\nThe puzzles are so prevalent that I feel this game is a Puzzle game with Shooter elements and not the other way around. And everything lacks detail. You either get it or look up a walkthrough. Hints are rarely introduced and there isn't any map or general guidelines.\n\nThere's a handful of bugs which sometimes can stop the player's progress. Saving is plentiful. Save scumming is essential. You don't take too many steps without the need to reload. All these traps and forced difficulty really play a toll on your nerves and overall opinion.\n\nBalancing is mostly ok, but sometimes munition is lacking. A third of the game I couldn't find any magnum ammo. The Xen levels are the worst offender. The Hive Hand would be your main choice and it slows everything to a crawl (shoot, miss, wait for reload, repeat). Some weapons are introduced too late and some items are too abundant (there's not too many uses for the tripmine).\n\nEnemies are not too diverse. Some of them, like the soldiers, are overpowered (grenades every few steps, with pinpoint accuracy). There's not such thing as stealth. Every enemy knows where you are. There's no point in having a silent crossbow if the enemy shoots you before you even have the time to target them. Scripted events make enemies invulnerable. Also there are some triggers that never get disabled (and always spawn new enemies).\n\nOverall the experience is ok, but with a lot of highs and lows. Playing it in short sessions is the key to beating the game.\n\nAs I was saying earlier, this game would have been a great deal in it's day, but it doesn't stand the test of time. It's all down to personal tastes, but I feel that this game is just ok, that very rare mainstream ok game. Looking back at Shooters made in the second half of the '90s, I dare say Half-Life wouldn't have even been on my top-choices list.","timestamp_created":1595785881,"timestamp_updated":1595786010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73319715","author":{"steamid":"76561199064069748","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":557,"last_played":1657325440},"language":"english","review":"Very good game overall.
