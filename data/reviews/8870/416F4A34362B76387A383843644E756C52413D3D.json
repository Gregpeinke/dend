The concept of multiple universes is intriguing, but for Ken Levine to make it the core of his narrative universe was a very dangerous move. The idea that all of this and ourselves are repeated infinitely \"beyond the veil\" is neat. \n\nHaving characters able to move seemlessly and thoughtlessly through alternate realities to solve a fetch quest is not. \n\nThis sets the predecent of a universe where the sanctity of life is completely meaningless, where if something doesn't work out in your favor you can just leap into another world where the circumstances are similar yet completely different (perhaps for better, perhaps for worse, as the duo quicky learn) but it's a cop-out all the same. When Booker and Liz swap dimensions to find an integral character because the one in theirs was dead, they don't stop to consider that they have essentially left behind Columbia to fulfill its purpose of genocide and destruction... to enter one where they are completely alien, their lives and actions never existed before, and thus the pair have no responsibilty for the chaos they instigate therein. \n\nYeah, **** that other universe!\n\nEven when confronted by irrefutable evidence of their crimes rippling through space-time, they push onward. Even when Elizabeth stops to consider that her UNSTABLE PHYSICS R@PING POWER might be tainted by personal wish fulfillment, well... Who cares? Back to shooting stuff! \n\nI don't normally go this in-depth with a game's story. But I am a huge fan of Science Fiction, even the kind that creates its own rules, but I found this casually dismissed major detail completely jarring, even insulting. That what amounts to an unnatural, physical assault on the natural world is never even mentioned by the people who just committed it.\n\nThis is in large part due to the inclusion of Elizabeth. She's a sidekick whose special power is opening holes in space-time to rob other dimensions of valuable items, items they might have needed themselves. The story would have worked fine as an intriguing tale of violence and redemption set against a brave thematic fusion of religion and quantum physics. But apparently that wasn't enough, so Irrational threw in a pouty Disney Princess stereotype to show off their fancy AI buddy system. \n\nTo be fair, it's a great system-- Liz periodically tosses you salts, health or money depending on whichever you need more at any given moment, initiating an invisible cool-down timer before she can be of further help. Unfortunately, her she feels less like a character written into the story, and more like a character the story was written around, for the sake of engaging the player in constant character interation. As a writer, this is totally acceptable if you can pull it off. However, her presence is at the center of the biggest twist in the story, one that ties up all the loose ends while at the same time falling into the trap a lot of \"hard\" Science Fiction tends to: that assumption that you cannot be intriguing without being fatalistic, nihilism is woven into the fabric of the universe, and nothing you do matters unless it ends in martyrdom. It left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nDon't even get me started on the DLC.\n\nWith that off my chest, having spoiled half the story for newcomers, on to the tactile:\n\nFirst and foremost, this game is an obvious labor of love.\n\nThe shooting is completely serviceable. Could have done without the late-game enemies pecking away at me from a mile off before the draw distance even registered them. The shootouts are deliciously violent; you can hear the crack of an enemy's skull as the bullet from your Hand Cannon travels through it. This gruesome level of detail clashes harshly with the alternate-reality 1900's setting, a Steam Punk combination of the old and the new, and I loved it. The setting is fresh and original and there is an incredible new experience waiting around every corner.\n\nThere is a cartoonish sheen to the game world that I also very much appreciated. The thing runs like a dream, even on my admittedly modest system, and I never had to endure a single slow down, even on the highest settings. The friendly and enemy NPC types are colorful and varied, both in look and personality. This is the kind of shooter where you want to stop and smell the roses, take in the sights, examine a corpse you just made to admire the sheer amount of thought that went into the details. All other production values are professional-grade across the board. The audio logs in particular, which are a staple of the Shock universe, are suitably up to par.\n\nHandymen are over-powered garbage, even on the easiest setting. This is one of those shooters where your vision bounces whenever you are shot, making it completely impossible to return accurate fire until you cut line of sight with your attacker. The Handyman delivers a melee attack that jostles your vision, *then strikes you again before your vision clears*, meaning if you let hit get within striking range, you might as well reload a checkpoint. Since he is faster than you, you'll probably be doing this a lot.\n\nThe mouse speed is way too sensitive, even on the lowest setting.\n\nOh, and one more thing: Stay away from 1999 mode. Just stay the hell away. It's a troll by the developers in response to complaints that modern shooters are too easy. As far as I'm concerned, Irrational owes me a new keyboard. \n\n10 out of 10,\n-2 for story,\n-1 for Elizabeth\n\nFinal Score: 7 out of 10. An incredibly fun and ambitious AAA shooter with a complex narrative that will leave you scratching your head in agony.","timestamp_created":1442097867,"timestamp_updated":1512973365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571941792964935303","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18004269","author":{"steamid":"76561198031144956","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1048,"last_played":1442084460},"language":"swedish","review":"First of all i must say that the visual is just jaw dropping.

When compared to Bioshock, how does it stack up? I prefer the original Bioshock. Though this one's story is great, it's perhaps just the slightest bit too much. The characters are superb, and the twists are welcome, but the story that unravels in Rapture is unparalled. \n\n2. When compared to early demos/showcases of this game, the final product let me down just the slightest bit as well. This is in regards to gameplay. I remember there was a demo of a HUGE sprawling area where the gunship was shooting down cannon fire, enemies were flying in on rails, and there were so many physical levels that Booker was moving to to engage each of these threats. The final product is quite expansive overall, but when I think about the core gameplay scenarios, I felt like I was never in an environment as large and open as I had hoped I would experience.

Interesting story concept.  Cool, modern realization of racial themes in a fictional world.\n\nMy annoyances. \n  [*]The gunplay.  If you're a first-person shooter, you better have good-feeling shooting, because odds are, the player will be doing a lot of it.  I wasn't getting that from Bioshock Infinite.  Each gun effectively felt the same when pulling the trigger, which I was disappointed by.  I was also confused why you could only carry two guns around with you at the same time.  Why not go the Wolfenstein: The New Order route and let the player carry every gun they pick up and have ammo scarcity be a problem?  That way you could have fight sequences, like in Wolfenstein, with double the amount of enemies and make you feel cooler for killing all of them by using your stash of collected weapons.  It all just feels like a missed oppurtunity.\n   [*]The unrealized promise of Elizabeth.  Is she important to the story?  Yes!  Kudos for weaving an NPC into the plot so well.  Is she a strong, female character with emotions and realistic reactions?  Yes!  In cutscenes she certainly holds her own and has her own quirky way of doing things.  But does this all stay consistent once you are playing the game?  Sadly, it does not.  Elizabeth is a compelling person, someone who can tear holes in the fabric of reality, and all she does during fights is throw you weapons and make things appear and disappear?  Another missed oppurtunity!  Why not have puzzle sequences where you and Elizabeth work your way across the landscape of Colombia by warping in and out of areas, or evading the police in a chase scene?  There are so many things Elizabeth could have contributed to the gameplay other than being a walking health dispenser.  The bottom line is, gameplay Elizabeth isn't consistent with cutscene Elizabeth, and the game feels weird for it.\n   [*]Movement between areas.  This gripe bugged me the most.  There is no middle ground with this game, and by that I mean it's either a low time or an intense time.  Other games break up the chain of walking and shooting with stealth sections, or minigames, or some kind of impactful choice you have to make, but Bioshock Infinite doesn't.  The only gameplay is walking and shooting scenes.  No variation to that formula.  This wouldn't be so bad, perhaps, if the layout of progression wasn't so damn linear.  You have skyhooks in your game, and you rarely use them for traversal!  Even when you do, there are two directions, forwards and backwards!  At least have some semblance of an open environment outside of closed-off battle areas in order to break up the monotony of the world traversal.  Have jump puzzle sections with the skyhooks, or have a path off of the main street that leads to a little gang of enemies, or something.  But don't keep forcing the player to move forward in a straight line.  It feels artificial in a world that the designers want to feel real.\n   [*]Enemies.  While there are technically many different enemy types in this game, they are all defeated the same way.  Cops?  Unload your ammo.  Pyros?  Unload your ammo.  Ghosts?  Unload your ammo.  Patriots?  Unload your ammo.  The big strong guys whose names I can't remember?  Unload your ammo.  Even the little Noisy Boys, who are enemies designed to be snuck around, need to be filled full of lead once alerted to your presence; They just spawn more enemies!  I get the effort put into designing these different bad guys, I get their significance in the world, but use some creatitivty on how to dispose of them.  \"Well there is a unique way!\" you might be saying.  \"Vigors are specially designed to work in  a different way with each enemy blah blah blah.\"  This is true.  Except the game gives you no incentive to use vigors.  Design a little environment puzzle to be solved using vigors.  Make vigors more precise when aiming them to have the player throw them at specific weak spots of enemies.  But if vigors do the exact same thing as my guns but are actually harder to pull off successfully, I'm just gonna use my guns.  Thanks, but no thanks.\n\nNow, you might have noticed a pattern to my complaints.  Each time I whined, I suggested the designers implement something new, or splice in parts of different game genres to mix it up.  \"But,\" you might argue once again, \"this is a BIOSHOCK game.  There weren't puzzle sections, or stealth sections, or open-world-like areas in OTHER Bioshock games.  If Infinite had any of these things, it wouldn't be a TRUE Bioshock game.\"  Maybe, but if adding something new makes a game better to play, if it makes it more fun, if it makes it more unique, then whatever that is should be added in.  Every pitfall of this game is rooted in the designers being too afraid to transcend the Bioshock formula.  Why dosn't Elizabeth do anything cool during battle?  Because it would mess up the Bioshock formula.  Why can't I explore the world, at least a little bit, on the skyhooks outside of combat?  Because it's a Bioshock no-no.  Cmon, live a little.  \n\nBioshock Infinite is worse off for being rooted in the Bioshock series of games.  Maybe not story-wise, maybe not genre-wise, but certainly gameplay-wise.\n\nI'm sorry, but there are better story-driven shooters.","timestamp_created":1441939064,"timestamp_updated":1441939064,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469277948141098022","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17976853","author":{"steamid":"76561198027141250","num_games_owned":1605,"num_reviews":154,"playtime_forever":2126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1742,"last_played":1443157861},"language":"english","review":"Much more enjoyable than the previous Bioshocks (those games were just depressing), the atmosphere is great. Having Elizabeth as a companion to help you in combat is very nice. The stealth focused mechanics in burial at sea ep2 are very nice (probably the most fun gameplay wise out of the whole game).\n\nWhile I do most definitely recommend this game, I do have a few pieces of criticism:\n\nVoxaphones/Audio Logs:\nReally breaks immersion IMHO. I don't know of anyone who would audibly record what should be private diary entries. Not to mention that unless you have a guide that tells you exactly where they are you'll likely miss quite a few and by extension much of the backstory. This is probably my biggest issue with the entire bioshock series and I'm sad to see it still as present and annoying as ever.\n\nCheckpoints:\nI hate them. It's not very clear when you've triggered a new one (did you walk far enough after the last fight?) so when you need to quit, you never quite know exactly how far back you'll be (at least the checkpoints are relatively common so it usually isn't too far). The checkpoints + manual saves that Bioshock 1 & 2 used was much better.\n\nTwo Weapon Slots:\nI can only carry two weapons? Apparently the devs realized how annoying this was and fixed it in the Burial at Sea DLC (but then broke it in a different way by putting a ridiculously low spare ammo limit on the weapons AND upped the health on the enemies at the same time...).\n\nEquipment:\nToo many different guns (half are duplicates anyways) and upgrades are a little too expensive (I realize it's there to force you to strategize, but given the large number of weapons and how you frequently need to drop weapons and pick up new ones due to ammo concerns, it gets annoying really fast).\n\nCombat:\nCombat is a bit too hectic and one-sided at times (i.e. get jumped by a horde of enemies) and given your relatively low health and the relative scarcity of ammo/salts (and the relatively high health of some of the enemies) means it can get frustrating, especially on the higher difficulties. Exacerbated by checkpoints and costing money when you die (further straining an already limited resource).\n\nStory:\nDoesn't always flow logically (especially the beginning of burial at sea ep2, with her power Elizabeth should have seen that coming or at least been able to tear). Feels contrived at times (the massive diversion to get shock jockey for example).\n\nLimited Replayability:\nWhile the forced choice of upgrades gives a few rpg elements in choosing your fighting style, the game itself is very linear and the story (while good compared to most games) isn't compelling enough to make me want to play it through all again.\n\nOverall great game, interesting story, great graphics and polish. These criticisms are relatively small in the big scheme of things, but they're annoying enough that I still felt I had to bring them up. Recommended (make sure you get it on sale with the season pass).","timestamp_created":1441933500,"timestamp_updated":1441933662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17976664","author":{"steamid":"76561198112627375","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2798,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1752,"last_played":1525872848},"language":"spanish","review":"uno de mis juegos favoritos jamas olvidare lo bien que me pase jugando esta obra maestra","timestamp_created":1441932308,"timestamp_updated":1441932308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17976105","author":{"steamid":"76561198023060516","num_games_owned":530,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1447,"last_played":1632404619},"language":"english","review":"In my top 5 games. \n\nGreat storty telling. \nGreat gameplay. \nGreat graphics still.\n\nJust buy it already.  \n\n","timestamp_created":1441928425,"timestamp_updated":1441928425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17975392","author":{"steamid":"76561198027918728","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":4734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4015,"last_played":1635439718},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is, in my mind, the best first person shooter of its generation.

It is art in it's own right as if it were a painting from the sheer design at some points. The gameplay is much more action oriented than previous entries in the series.

I was left in awh at how they changed the genre completely in the series and still made it just as amazing. If not more so. \n(Pre-DLC)\nThe only downside of this game is if you're a die hard fan of Rapture and expected that landscape over Columbia. But I will say Rapture in the main game has a great cameo appearance.\n\n(DLC) This is one of the BEST DLC's I have ever seen in a game. It is a -MUST- have for someone attempting to experience the trrilogy. I would consider it the best DLC out of the entire series and even competes as one of the best of all time. THIS is what DLC should be used for, and I hope other studios take notes. The DLC not only brings back Rapture for the older fans, but it essentially gives you further back story on Rapture itself while tying up loose ends visually that we only heard through the tapes. As well the DLC places this game as a prequel in the time line. Truly clever, creative, and worth the money.\n\nThis is arguably one of the best trilogies of all time. I personally wish they would make another Bioshock game. But if they were to leave this as a stand alone trilogy.

И Bioshock на данный момент является чуть ли не шедевром на этом поле. Серия на каком-то субатомном уровне является родственной дилогии System shock, хотя конечно же прямых связей, кроме схожести названия, между ними нет. И если первая часть была открытием, вторая - досадным недоразумением, то треться оказалась хорошо выверенным продуктом. \n  Нашего героя зовут Букер Девитт, и он вроде бы как совсем не хотел влипат ьв историю, но как говорится - кабаки и бабы доведут до цугундера, мужик попросту влез в карточные долги. Но тут подвернулось предложение, от которого не отказываются - неизвестный наниматель. в обмен на выкуп долгов, предложил спасти некую девушку Элизабет, но для того нужно добраться до таинственного города Колумбия. Букер. как бывший вояка, честно берется за дело, но яркий, парящий в небесах город, отнюдь не так прост, как может показаться. Да и чужакам здесь не рады - а хрупкая милаха Элизабет и вовсе способна за себя постоять, и делов наворотить.\n  Вообще, игра очень немного нового вносит в уже сложившийся геймплей - мы всё так же используем спецспособности, стреляем по недругам и лихорадочно носимся по локазциям в поисках все, что не приколочено к полу. За нововведения тут отыгрываются лихие поездки на воздшных рельсах, да активация предметов из других измерений. Впрочем, Bioshock цепляет не этим. Точнее - не только этим. Скрупулезная прорпботка окружения, некая нарочитая мультяшность персонажей (икается третий Fable), куча мелких интересных открытий в истории персонажей и местности. Как и в первой части, здесь мы снова вместе с главным героем идём от изумления новым городом к жгучему желанию разобраться, что ж тут такое творится. Отойдя от рассмотрения теории о сверх-обществе высокоинтеллектуальных личностей (а ещё от темы наркотиков), разработчики поднимают вопрос религии и её роли в социуме. И, получается, надо сказать, весьма убедительно. Тема свободы выбора и лицемерия прописана очень хорошо, а мы, заметьте, говорим о шутере...","timestamp_created":1441649073,"timestamp_updated":1441649073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17931231","author":{"steamid":"76561198029172370","num_games_owned":449,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":954,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":954,"last_played":1441645476},"language":"english","review":"Wow.

Hayatımda oynadığım en iyi fps oyunu sanırım. Nereden başlasam bilemiyorum.\n\nOyunun en güçlü öğesi olan senaryo ile başlayayım. Oyunun görünen ana senaryosu aslında böyle bir oyuna göre kısa kalmış arada boşluklar olduğunu göreceksiniz oynayınca fakat burada bir hata yaparak oyun için bulduğunuz ses kayıtlarına yedirmişler hikayeyi. Fakat ingilizceniz olmadan bunları anlamanız gerçekten zor. Yine de ne olursa olsun oyunun final sahnesinde oyunun senaryosuna hayran olacaksınız. Klasik masal öğelerini yedirmişler ana hikayeye Kuleye hapsolan bir prenses , Kurt Kuzu hikayesi , kendini peygamber ilan etmiş bir manyak hepsi bu oyunda.\n\nOynanışa gelirsek Klasik fps öğeleri bu oyunda da mevcut fakat oyunda silah çeşitliliği ve kullanım alanı çok geniş. Oyunda yaklaşık 9 tür silah olsa da Karabina ve Altıpatlar'ın hayranı olacaksınız .\nOynanışın ikinci öğesi kısaca skilleriniz oyunda 9 farklı skill var ve bunlar Salt ( tuz ) ile kullanılıyor yani aslında mana kavramını burada tuz olarak görüyoruz. Bu mana ile skilleri kullanıyorsunuz ve skillerin çokluğu ve oyuna etkisi inanılmaz ölçüde. Örneğin uzakta bir Sniper var ve elinizdeki silah ile vuramıyorsunuz. Hop hemen dalga skillini seçip adama basılı tutuyorsunuz adam bir anda dalga ile yanınıza geliyor ve işlem tamam. Ayrıca bu 9 skill'i yolda bulduğunuz otomatlar ile geliştirebilir daha az tuz ihtiyacı olmasını sağlayabilir ve gücünü arttırabilirsiniz. Aynı şekilde otomatlardan silahları da geliştirebilir , eksik mermilerinizi alabilirsiniz\n\nVe Elizabeth !!!! Sanırım bu oyunu oynayıp ona aşık olmayan bir oyuncu olamaz. Yaklaşık 1,5 saatlik bir oynanış sonucunda Elizabeth sizin yanınıza gelecek ve oyun tarihinin en güzel en tatlı ve en yardımcı asistanı ile karşılacaksınız. Neler mi yapıyor ? Savaşlarda mermi eksiğinizi karşılıyor en kritik anlarda verdiği mermiler ile bir anda savaşa yön veriyor . Diğer yandan siz savaşırken size can ve tuz vermesi de ayrı bir güzel yanı bitti mi ? Hayır savaş noktalarında oyunun ifadesiyle diğer dünyadan yırtıklar açarak buralara siper , roketatar alanı , otomatik robotlar atarak oyunun yönünü değiştiriyor ve size savaş alanında inanılmaz bir yardım sağlıyor. Senaryo icabı yaklaşık 40 dakika sizinle olmuyor ilerki bölümlerde ve oyunun onsuz ne kadar zor olduğunu anlayacaksınız o anlarda.Oyundaki karşılaşacağınız düşmanlara bakacak olursak Patriot denen Minigunlu Dev robotlar, Roketatar ve Sniperlı askerler ( bunlara kesinlikle uzaktan sıkmayın dalga skilli ile kendinize çekip halledin ) , Ateşli Dev Robot ( Fireman) , Gölge Savaşçıları ( Shadow Soldier ). Bu çeşitlilik sizi savaşlarda farklı stratejiler yapmaya sürükleyecek ve durduğunuz yerden savaşı bitirmenizi önleyecek ve daha zevkli bir oyun sunacak\n\nSon olarak Grafiklere geleyim. Holy Shit Dude. Oyunun geçtiği hayali uçan şehir  o kadar renkli o kadar güzel ki oyunun başlarında gerçekten hayran oluyorsunuz ve bu hayranlık giden bölümlerde düşmüyor kapalı alanlarda bile inanılmaz bir dekor ve ışık sağlanmış. Oynarken hayran olmadığınız hiçbir tarafı yok bu oyunun. Kesinlikle alın ve oynayın. Oyunun tek eksi tarafı hikayenin ayrıntılı kısmının oyun içinde bulduğunuz plaklarda olması ama oyunu oynayıp o kadar eğlendikten sonra bunu düşünmeyeceksiniz bile.

Тот случай, когда разработчики графоний, дизайн и стиль вытянули, а вот про геймплей забыли.\n\nСобственно геймплей представляет собой стандартное \"беги-стреляй-всех убивай\" в коридорных локациях. Есть куча оружия, но она не нужна - можно пройти всю игру с каким-нибудь револьвером и ракетницей. Есть куча энергетиков, но она не нужна - можно пройти всю игру с \"Гипнотизёром\" и \"поднималкой-врагов-в-воздух\". Есть одежда, но она не нужна - нацепил на себя первые попавшиеся шмотки - и вперёд. Если в Деус Экс или Систем Шок смена способов убиения и снаряжения влекла за  собой существенное изменение геймплея, то здесь такого нет. Единственная причина менять оружие и энергетики - это получение стимовских ачивок.\n\nВсё существующее оружие и энергетики Букер получит на протяжении игры, поэтому нет никакого смысла начинать её ещё раз, чтобы попробовать что-нибудь новенькое - всё можно попробовать за один раз. Повторно играть ради того, чтобы просто пострелять, тоже нет никакого желания из-за длинных неинтерактивных катсценок. Снова смотреть это кинцо нет никакого желания.\n\nСюжет - обычная мазафака про параллельные миры в духе \"Гиперкуба\" и \"Эффекта бабочки\". И даже в мотивации героев есть косяки. Половину игры они пытаются раздобыть один определённый дирижабль, чтобы улететь из Колумбии. Спрашивается, почему бы не взять другой дирижабль или летающую канонерку?\n\nВ общем, брать только со скидкой на распродаже.\n\nЛевин, где Систем Шок 3?","timestamp_created":1441535922,"timestamp_updated":1441535922,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.599188566207885742","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17906131","author":{"steamid":"76561198170417870","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":4133,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1580,"last_played":1584265939},"language":"english","review":"AN AWFUL GAME, I HATE IT.

I was unappreciative back then. Now, on to review.\n\n I found out about this game when I was looking through torrents for games to play while I was over at my grandparents' because over there, there's no internet. I stumbled across Bioshock Infinite. Now, I would like to state that I've never really heard of this game before. I decided I might get a few hours of this game.\n\n I found myself completely immersed into the world this game presented to me. I felt like I was the main protagonist and blocked out everything around me. Every feeling he felt, I felt. Everything he said, I muttered. Everything he did, I followed. I finished the game, and wasn't pleased with it. So, I decided to buy it.\n\n The story was amazing. It worked perfectly with the atmosphere. The characters was a huge asset in the story, each with their own unique characteristics and how their personality complimented each other. The gameplay is alittle bit iffy at some points, but overall it's great. The enemies are also different from each other, meaning you have to strategically defeat them. Some are your normal 'I'm gonna shot you in the face' and some are 'To defeat me, you're gonna have to do vigor combos and plant crits on me'. \n\n Graphics are just.... just MAGNIFIQUE! The amount of detail that goes to everything is just breath-taking. EVEN TRASH LOOKS NICE. The characters fit in every cutscene and basically, everywhere you go. Nothing seems out of place, not even the things that ARE out of place. Lighting is just right, not too much, not too little. I'm no artist, but this game is just a beauty to look at. It's like heaven on earth. (Yes, that's a game referrence)\n\n This game towers absolutely EVERYTHING when it comes to voice-acting. Are they voice-acting or were they just secretly voice-taped during their daily life? Because, I've never heard so much emotion. Trust me, you will never go \"That doesn't right. He's frustrated but why is he talking like he's laughing?\". I would like to personally see each individual voice actor and give them gifts, just to congratulate them.\n\n DLCs are abit lacking but for what it's worth, I'd recommend you getting them, every single one. Burial At Sea explains the aftermatch of the game and will give you abit of nostalgia if you've ever played Bioshock 1 and/or 2.\n\n Overall, amazing game. It is my favourite game of all time, that is, until another one takes it place, but that'll be awhile. The only thing I would like to complain about it, is the eyes. Some cutscenes make Elizabeth's eyes so wide, like they're gonna pop-out. I definitely recommened buying this game.\n\n(You may experience what I call \"Bio-depression\" after you finish the game. Totally normal, don't fear. Just... wait it out.)\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nFor the TL;DR people,\n\nGreat game. Buy it.","timestamp_created":1441504484,"timestamp_updated":1542893677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17903028","author":{"steamid":"76561198108622200","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":644,"last_played":1441507060},"language":"english","review":"Sorry for long review, but i feel its necessary for this game-  Bioshock Infinite is one of the few games that has so many amazing elements to it.  The guns, vigors, and enemies you face  keep you excited to keep going.  Also, the graphics and atmosphere of the flying city of Columbia are absolutely breathtaking.  The city is one of the nicest looking areas i have ever seen in a game.  For most of the first hour of my playthrough, i had just been walking slowly around Columbia, not following the objectives, and going anywhere the map would let you.  The city is so serene and gorgeous.  The combination of past and present with details such as music, and how people dressed and acted was so intriguing.  Now onto the confusing part of the game: The story.  The game starts out with sending you to Columbia, so you can \"get the girl and free your debt.\"  You have no idea of how the story actually plays through, no introduction, no large hints.  However from the middle to the end of the game, different ideas of how the story is supposed to work out are slowly suggested.  This gradual explanation of the story i found really exciting, as you want to keep playing to found out how this works, and how this happened etc.  Then once you complete the game you can figure out all these questions you've had for the entire game.  The ending is absolutely amazing, because it stimulates your brain to think, and think, about how the plot works, and how you are related to Elizabeth, and Comstock, and what the Lutece twins actually bring to the story. (i mean Lutece, not twins)  Also the intertwining of the multiverse theorem into this game is absolutely remarkable.  When you figure these things out, it is amazing how they all fit in with the game.     \n\n11/10  If you have any sort of intrest in this game, just get it.\n\nT.L.D.R. Every element of Infinite is outstanding and i highly reccomend it.","timestamp_created":1441497571,"timestamp_updated":1441497571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46+v8z88CdNulRA=="}
