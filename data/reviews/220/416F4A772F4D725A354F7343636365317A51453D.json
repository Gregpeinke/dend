game is so great, innovative and varieted that I'm surprised how can some find this boring.\n\n+ It is really long for a linear single player game.\n+ Soundtrack - it is quite rare, but then it happens it's really good, it fits so well. You must experience this yourself to understand.\n+ Weapons are very unique, memorable, their sounds are great.\n+ I really love how game progresses, It takes a lot of time for each new weapon to be found, so everytime you find a new weapons the hype is huge. It's really good design.\n+ The best thing about this game is how much different playstyles it tries to do and how much it suceeds at most of them. It starts slowly yet entertaining, and with a slow build it introduces to many different mechanics and playstyles. After very great introduction chapters game later becomes a shooter, but later also brings in boat section, car section, introduces horror elements, squad team play, gives strategic feel in Nova Prospect when you can use pets and even makes you feel overpowered at the end. It's all so great and memorable, many scenes feel really awesome and so not cinematic at all. Boat section, prison and sand beach are my favourites, they are so epic.\n+ This game does not feel like a regular game, it feels like a mod of a game or something. I say this, because it does not have cutscene interpearances, average tutorial, quick time events. Hud and menu are very generic yet good. It has like a really generic design for it's looks, which makes it really unique.\n+ Puzzles, you need to use game physics in order to solve puzzles, while the puzzles are easy to figure them out, they are quite creative and fun.\n+ Levels are filled with secrets, some secrets (item caches/Lambda locations) even require a tiny puzzle to be solved in order to get the hidden items.\n+ Boss battles.\n+ G-man secret encounters.\n+ Facial expressions. They are really ahead of it's time, still one of the best we have to this day. They are over the top too, characters really like to show emotions, which ussually looks too much, but I count it as a plus, cause it also looks very charming.\n+ Ending is awesome, even better than HL1 ending.\n+ Achievements, this game has some achievements which creates bonus challenge. For example don't touch the sand or beat Ravenholm using only gravity gun. Such achievements are so great, gives aditional challenge and makes whole new experience.\n+ Mod support, game has tons of fantastic mods (Nightmare House 2, Mission Improbable, Minerva: Metastasis)\n\n\n- Graphical glitches. Time to time after loading new chapter all lighting effects and shadows dissapear forever unless I disable Windows Aero Extension, which automaticaly enables itself after it, but all lighting effects and shadows come back for some time. Also there are some props which are invisible, I can see shadows of them though.\n- What the hell is wrong with npc companions? They are so brainless it's beyond. Alyx ALWAYS rushes out of cover into open field and dies instantly, because she's so exposed that 5 enemies shoot at her at the same time. Same with Priest, he just rushes into zombies and they beat him to death. Whoever said that HL2 has a great A.I companions is either brainwashed by nostalgia or only have played HL2 and games with even worse A.I npcs. Almost any game had better A.I companions even before HL2, GTA games and many more had much better companion A.I, atleast they did not try to \"suicide\".\n- Game is full of cheap traps, Shotgun soldiers... They always are put in the tightiest spaces, just waiting to appear in split second and take half my health away. I understand putting them in houses/bases and stuff, because they use close quarters guns, but they are always hidding behind corners and shows up when I'm very close to them. It's just impossible to evade the damage unless I die first and then know where they are hidding.\n- There are places with respawning enemies, I understand when enemies respawn on survival sections, but there are also sections with no indicators why there would be need of infinite enemies.\n- Combat vs soldiers is as bad as in HL1, they take no reaction to hits, so they keep shooting at the same time I'm shooting. Technicaly wins the one who has more health... You can't pull many strategies against them, high damage weapons are fine, but guns like Pistol or Smg are useless.\n- Bullet sponge enemies. Raising difficulty raises their health, in some games it's fine, even awesome(Blood, Shadow Warrior, The Suffering), but here it's clearly not fine, it's very poor mechanic, because enemies does not take any reaction to hits, they automatically make me lose more health, because it takes even longer to shot at them. Unless I have grenades, pets, crossbow or special ammo for smg and assault rifle the combat is pathetic and hopeless, I can't use any kind of strategies and all I can do is hope for the best.\n- CAN'T AIM WITH WEAPONS, only weapon I can aim is crossbow. 1. many games at the time had such mechanic already. 2. It would be fine if the game was made for such gameplay, now there are tons and tons of places where enemies are far and I really need to aim, most weapons are extremely innacurate at distance. HL1 was fine for most part, it had very few places there I could use aiming, that's when you don't need to bother adding it, but here, game is just begging for aiming mechanic.\n- I managed to find all secrets and the problem I found is that in later levels developers just became lazy or something and did not make as many secrets as in first levels. While first levels have like 5-15 secrets in each, the later levels have like 0-3 secrets per level. It really disappoints me.\n- While all levels have great level design, some levels barely have any detail put into the environments. For example many parts of Highway 17 are just plain textures of grass or mountain, feels really empty. Of course this is a minor issue.\n- Flash drones, who the hell thought it's a good idea, I understand they suppose to blind the character and give enemies advantage, but those fuckers blind me in real life, every time the screen flashes my eyes hurt(no joke, flashes really does make my eyes hurt a bit and i must close them for a sec), this is the only game there such stuff happen.\n- Source engine physics can be broken at times, you can jump in between stuff and insta die, sometimes you cannot walk over 3cm high platform, you must jump over it. It's even possible to make door stuck - kill a soldier in between doors and if his gun drops behind the door it will make it stuck, unless I have gravity gun or grenades, the door is unopenable.\n- Aux power... How in the world does such thing even exists... It is a meter which is for running, underwater time AND flashlight at the same time... WHY???? Anyway it uses out extremely fast even if i use only one of the features. As for underwater time it's fine, but 10 second flash light and like 8 seconds sprinting is way not enough, sometimes I have to spint and use flashlight at the same time, which makes the power to drain out in 3 seconds or so... 1. Why can't all these features have a different meter. 2. The whole recharchable flashlight mechanic is horrible and should be avoided in any game, why can't a game either have infinite flashlight or flashlight to run on batteries. Recharchable flashlight is cancer as it always runs out very quickly and you are forced to wait a few seconds for it to recharge. 3. Running really could have been a bit faster and considering that aux power runs out so quickly it's almost a useless feature.\n\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1562507938,"timestamp_updated":1593957146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53919386","author":{"steamid":"76561198129036387","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":57,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57,"last_played":1562145335},"language":"russian","review":"Очень

Sums it up nicely. Almost all props in the enviroment are interactable. Early on it does not make a big difference, but once obtaining the gravity gun (yay!) the fun begins. It revolutionised the shooter genre back then with this single idea of interactable physics based props, and its easy to see why.\nAI in the game is... Would say decent but there are some mayor flaws in the follower system.\nIt does interact with weapon pickups. See your followers live long enough to stumble upon a random gun on the foor/wall out of combat and they will pick it up, if its considered an upgrade. They also will try to avoid grenades, so does your foes, tho mostly unsuccesfully. Enemy AI is more than happy to use grenades against you and does it so w suprising expertise, but not with inhumane accuracy. Expect the uncommon random but hillarious mess-up from them trying to throw a nade at you, but getting bounced back intto their own face. And yes, nades are interactable objects too. Unfortunately, unlike Half Life (1), grenades can no longer cooked, but least they dont feel like a lead bobber anymore. The bad part is that friendly AI is happy to bodyblock you into the most riddicilous situations and is more than happy to stand in the face of certain death (eg.: enemies unkillable w equipped gun, sentries), tho devs seem to been avare of the latter, as in most such scenarios they do actually respawn. Also the follower AI \"Alyx\" is prone to bugging out, resulting in a softlock if levels are loaded in reverse order, wich is a game feature.\n\nPros:\n- unique story\n- unique physics assisted/based gameplay\n- great gunplay\n- facial animation system from hl1\n\nCons:\n- mediocore (forced) follower AI\n- possible softlock if using the game's backwards traverse feature w AI","timestamp_created":1562490596,"timestamp_updated":1562490596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53892394","author":{"steamid":"76561198003369491","num_games_owned":466,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":808,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":808,"last_played":1547071456},"language":"english","review":"Where HL 3 AT ?!","timestamp_created":1562489409,"timestamp_updated":1562489409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53892180","author":{"steamid":"76561198310962177","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1514723954},"language":"russian","review":"И чем же эта игра может понравиться?

O protagonista, Gordon Freeman, acorda em um trem que se dirige a Cidade 17. Mas agora a situação é bem diferente já que à terra está sendo dominada por alienígenas.\n\nA trilha sonora se encaixa muito bem, dando destaque para os momentos de mais ação, em que a trilha consegue te deixar de certo modo mais eletrizado.
