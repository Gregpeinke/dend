In the same way that the original Bioshock was a spiritual successor to System Shock 2, this game feels more like a spiritual successor to Bioshock 1. Yes, there are references to the original game (the lighthouse, Rapture, Vigors, etc.), but the gameplay is a largely different style. Bioshock Infinite adopts a more action oriented and linear gameplay style, as opposed to Bioshock's more open ended gameplay. Everyone loves this game's story, but I personally think it doesn't hold a candle to the other Bioshock games. The characters, aside from Elizabeth, aren't really as interesting, and simply put: Columbia isn't as interesting as Rapture. With that said, Booker, the protagonist, and Elizabeth's interactions and small talk are genuinely entertaining; I like them. I'm not gonna say much about the ending, because I don't wanna spoil it for those who are interested, but I don't think it's very good. Overall, this is a solid FPS and worth playing. However, if you genuinely enjoyed the first two Bioshocks' gameplay and atmosphere, you may be disappointed with this one. \n\n7/10.","timestamp_created":1562359955,"timestamp_updated":1562359955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53711739","author":{"steamid":"76561198091057080","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":320,"last_played":1562359792},"language":"russian","review":"best","timestamp_created":1562359800,"timestamp_updated":1562359800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53710960","author":{"steamid":"76561198093324963","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1466,"last_played":1562445576},"language":"english","review":"This game is great, would recommend..\n\n..Except the CitC DLC.
