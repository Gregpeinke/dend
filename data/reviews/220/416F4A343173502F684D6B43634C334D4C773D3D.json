Storyline is good, and the gun-fights that take place are very exciting.  Many eerie and creepy moments, like crawling through pitch-black vents, or watching as a headcrab latches onto someone.  Overall, I really liked this game.  It really made me think and I got stuck at many points in this terrific fps game.","timestamp_created":1413253327,"timestamp_updated":1413253327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12483638","author":{"steamid":"76561198092147689","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":3233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1537,"last_played":1652394740},"language":"english","review":"I met G-Man a few times 10/10","timestamp_created":1413250810,"timestamp_updated":1413250810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.451127827167510986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12483465","author":{"steamid":"76561198121694438","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":104,"last_played":1441904122},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games of it's generation.
