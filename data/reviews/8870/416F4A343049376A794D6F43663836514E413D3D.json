(A seminal moment in this game came early on, when Elizabeth told me she wouldn't need any protecting). In addition to this, there is also a diverse array of enemies faced, highlighted by our friends George and Abe, who come to us in the form of mechanized patriots.

Constantly increasing in intensity and depth, Bioshock Infinite creates a remarkable web around the player that can only be seen in hindsight. Without spoilers, the ending is a moving cinematic that threw many twists into the story that I thought I already knew. It leaves as many questions as answers, but one thing is for certain: this sequel is more than a shooter; it's a plot as deep as it is long told through the first-person perspective, leaving choices for players that create guilt in every scenario. Bioshock Infinite is beautiful and colorful; Columbia is alive and massive; NPCs are interesting, fully vocally scripted, and relatable; and the ending is worth the confusing, repetitive, and challenging bits occasionally found throughout. At full price, it is more than worth the cost and playthrough time.

If you're looking for a poorly-contrived and pretentious mess, then go ahead.\n\nThat's kind of harsh, but that's exactly the kind of game Bioshock Infinite presents itself as - it tries to come off as intelligent and thoughtful, bringing up themes of classism, racism, destiny, reality, etc, but it only goes far enough to bring them up. It shows the ideas and says nothing profound about them, just showing the viewer that they exist through in-your-face, constant imagery in an attempt to deep. If you personally found something profound and life-changing in the game, that's fine - everyone takes media in different ways, after all, but it feels to me that the writing team didn't think very hard about the thematic choices and messages in the game. I don't usually harp this much about this aspect of a game, but the game's received such an absurd amount of critical acclaim as being \"art\" or whatever that it was completely absurd, considering I thought the exact opposite - this is just another mindless shooter.\n\nAs a mindless shooter, it's fine, I guess. It really doesn't bring anything new to the table - magic powers that were in the other Bioshocks, upgrading weapons, big clunky enemies, blah blah etc. It's completely average, dull FPS gameplay that won't exactly convert you to the genre if you aren't super into it. The skyline stuff is cool to look at, but it doesn't actually accomplish much of anything that walking or locked doors wouldn't do just fine. The enemies barely react when shot and are massive walking bullet-sponges, and even though the sound effects are as crisp as ever other game released within the last decade, it's really not super satisfying to shoot them when they take a thousand hits.\n\nThe storyline is riddled with plotholes and inconsistencies from the very beginning - why does Booker take no effort to cover the AD scar when he sees that Columbia clearly considers it a bad thing? Why does he take the 77 ball when clearly told not to? Why is Eilizabeth happy, social, and talkative when she's been locked in a tower her whole life with only a giant robot bird to talk to? If people go crazy by being dead in an alternate universe, why isn't everyone crazy because everyone's probably dead in /some/ alternate universe? Why is the ending completely outrageously badly written and makes no sense? \n\nThe characters are all bland, unpolished caricatures who are mostly unmemorable - Songbird is awesome, but that's really it. Booker in particular, for all the stupid decisions he makes (see above) and the fact that he kills a gajillion people without remorse really distances himself from the player, leading to another one of the game's biggest problems. There is a divide between the gameplay and the storyline that the two don't really cross at all. The entirety of the game's story is told out in cutscenes and audio recordings. (which has to be one of the laziest ways to get across backstory I have ever seen) The gameplay and the storyline rarely intersect - Booker is never able to be controlled during the cutscenes, and any choices to be made are done via button prompts rather than by actually moving your character - heck, none of them even changed the game, just being there to arbitrarily give the player some illusion of choice.\n\nThis is just sloppy, lazy design, which really sums up the game. It tries to be more than it is and fails. Despite this, basically infinite reviews (hurrdurr) have heaped praise onto Bioshock Infinite, calling it art and the next big leap and gaming storytelling and blah blah etc. If you really think this is art, go to a museum. Listen to some music. Go play a better game.","timestamp_created":1419914591,"timestamp_updated":1419914591,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13705402","author":{"steamid":"76561198029210019","num_games_owned":563,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":1010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":861,"last_played":1427537421},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра,шедевр 2013 года.Сказка с грустным концом.Теории о других вселенных и путешествий через них.Вообщем покупайте,не пожалеете.","timestamp_created":1419913636,"timestamp_updated":1419913636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502850592136383057","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13705391","author":{"steamid":"76561198068139824","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":587,"last_played":1598947082},"language":"english","review":"Best Campaign of any game I have ever played.

Really, I love playing singleplayer games but a lot get lame and boring after a couple of hours, but this one... you won't be disappointed. So allow me to reveiw the good and the close to no bad in this amazing singleplayer game.\n\nGraphics- Amazing. Plain out great looking! If you have a pc that can handle this game in ultra settings you won't be sad you spent a lot on your graphics card because the amount of detail in everything is so great! Lighting, guns,etc. just look great. \n\nAudio- I love music but for games i let music slide but this game has amazing audio. Guns sound great the characters speck cleary and sound great. When walking on certain stuff like water, grass, etc. it sounds real. And well am not to much of fan of 1900's music the songs sound great too!\n\nGameplay- Can't really say much besides \"outstanding\".\n\nStory- Since this is a singleplayer game the story has to be good right? Well no, it can be a jaw dropping, creppy, warm and mostly unforgettable game. This felt more of a movie then a game. Would play again just for the story.\n\nOverall- Mostly what am trying to say is just get it. Really. Graphics are great. Audio is satisfying.

Po spontanicznym zakupie przepustki sezonowej i przejściu wszystkich dodatków z niej doszedłem do wniosku, że błędnie oceniłem w pierwszym podejściu [i]Bioshocka[/i]. Można zapytać dlaczego? Już spieszę z wyjaśnieniem.\n\nPrzede wszystkim jest to spowodowane tym, iż wtedy nie połączyłem wszystkich wątków i zrozumiałem, nie ukrywajmy, zawiłej jak cholera fabuły i zmieniłem swoje nastawienie do tej gry przez ten okres czasu. Potraktowałem ją w tamtym czasie sztywno jak każdego innego FPSa przez co zmieniłem całkowicie odbiór tej gry, łamiąc tym samym credo tej serii gier, gdyż od niepamiętnych czasów było wiadomo, że nigdy nie były i nie będą to zwykłe strzelanki, jakich pełno dookoła. Seria ta nie zmieniła swoich zasad i w tym przypadku, bo historia nadal bazuje na tajemnicach łączonych z odwieczną walką ludzkich wad, istoty człowieczeństwa, istnienia boga i sensu egzystencji utopii. Te filozoficzne dywagacje, które są bardzo żywo prowadzone w czasie rozgrywki, są w porównaniu do poprzednich części o wiele bardziej niejednoznaczne i poplątane, przez co ich rozwiązanie będzie stanowiło ogromny problem lub interesującą zabawę. Grafika wbrew pozorom nadal dzielnie się broni. Jak mamę kocham; Columbia jest nadal tak samo piękna, jak w dniu ukazania się gry. Nadal zachwyca mnie swoją otwartością, zupełnie inną atmosferą jaka panowała wcześniej w Rapture - mrok, smutek i odwieczną depresję, którą można było ciąć nożem, zastąpiono ciepłym wizerunkiem ideału patriotycznego i religijnego stolicy Stanów Zjednoczonych Ameryki. Widać, że to miasto żyje. Spacerując po dzielnicach widać wszędzie krzątające się dzieci lub dorosłych, wykonujących czynności dnia codziennego. Jeżeli oczekujecie drugiego miasta pod woda, to się niestety zawiedziecie. Melomanem co prawda nie jestem, ale mogę zapewnić, że muzyka idzie równo z grafiką w kontekście tego samego poziomu jakości. Dialogi to mistrzostwo w każdym calu. Tak samo, jak głosu Andrew Ryana mogłem słuchać godzinami, to Elizabeth błagałbym, żeby czytała mi książki na dobranoc. I teraz przechodzi do meritum każdej gry wideo, czyli jak w to się gra. Nie ukrywam - topornie. Gra postawiła na zupełnie swoje aspekty w porównaniu do poprzedniczek, przez co utraciła dość dużo na samej rozgrywce. Strzelanie pomimo ogromu pukawek i ich ulepszeń, jak i różnorakich wigorów, odpowiedników podwodnych plazmidów, jest wygodne jak wprowadzenie czołgu za pomocą stóp. Gra na padzie od Xbox'a była dla mnie mordęgą na włączonym wspomaganiu, a co dopiero na klawiaturze. Sama mechaniki gry również uległa uproszczeniu, przez co nie mamy, chociażby starych automatów takich jak Wy-twórcy. To pod tym względem, niestety, znowu nie jest ten sam [i]Bioshock[/i]. Reasumując, [b]gra ta nie jest dla wszystkich[/b]. Jeśli jesteśmy pasjonatami zabawy poprzez poznawanie fabuły, rozwiązywaniu jej zagadek i nieścisłości lub zachwycanie się widokami poznając przy tym niesamowity, z góry odmienny i wrogi świat jest to tytuł obowiązkowy dla nas. Na pewno [b]nie jest to gra dla tych, którzy chcą się rozerwać przy czystej pasji strzelania[/b] do wszystkiego, co się rusza. Po prostu strzelanie tutaj nie sprawia większej frajdy, co więcej, cholernie frustruje na dłuższa metę.\n\nO, bym zapomniał! [b]Nigdy nie zaczynajcie grać[/b] od epizodycznych dodatków [i]Burial at Sea[/i], gdyż są one umieszczone w zupełnie innym klimacie i atmosferze. Poza tym opowiadają historię, która dzieje się po głównej linii fabularnej gry właściwej, więc odkryją oba te dodatki przed wami wszystkie odpowiedzi na zawarte w niej zagadki fabularne, a meandry fabuły staną się co raz to bardziej zawiłe i niezrozumiałe. Mówiąc po prostu - zrobią wam wodę z mózgu.\n\nP.S Elizabeth <3","timestamp_created":1419903606,"timestamp_updated":1480251883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.633358955383300781","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13702292","author":{"steamid":"76561198021064669","num_games_owned":4106,"num_reviews":156,"playtime_forever":1729,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1284,"last_played":1457033738},"language":"english","review":"Elizabeth <3","timestamp_created":1419901754,"timestamp_updated":1419901832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570707082748413086","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13702187","author":{"steamid":"76561197971685825","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2608,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2412,"last_played":1417984070},"language":"english","review":"Buddy, it's Bioshock, there's nothing more to say!","timestamp_created":1419901342,"timestamp_updated":1419901342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13701446","author":{"steamid":"76561198031041930","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":5584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4133,"last_played":1543513320},"language":"english","review":"This game is beautiful.\n\nThis is a game that will become as beloved and well-known as the first BioShock, maybe even more so. \n\nI was drawn into this world in a way that a book or a movie could never do, and the characters and stories stay with you long after you leave.

I came from Loving Bioshock and enjoying Bioshock 2 so was highly anticipated when it came out. If you want a comparison between the 3: The first Bioshock remains the best by far (if you havent played any of the -shocks than start there), then Infinite and then Bioshock 2. \n\nThe story will have many simliarities to those familiar with BIoshock. People had very high hopes given Kevin L. background and, while it may not have met everyones expectations, will keep you involved the entire way through; definitely beats most FPS stories. The gameplay is exactly the same as previous bioshocks but does have slightly less variety; there is opportunity for experimenting but I found myself relying on a few core skills and weapons. \n\nYou will have a companion for most of the game and overall I found it well implemented; she pretty much takes care of herself and there isnt any micro-management. Length is good and I found it good value for the money. \n\nLastly if you have played the orignial Bioshock GET THE STORY BASED DLC. Under the sea was fantastic story wise and an excellent compliment to both games. I would go as far to say that of all the DLC I have ever played it was the perfect example of what DLC should do; adding new expereiences to the story of the main game while not feeling tacked on.","timestamp_created":1419834486,"timestamp_updated":1419834486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13681631","author":{"steamid":"76561198031430884","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":668,"last_played":1419833028},"language":"english","review":"Did not enjoy being confused by the story for 30 hours.

The story is fantastic and colorful with awesome character development of non-focal characters through the collectible voxophones scattered throughout the game. It does get a little jumbly at times with comments being made about characters or pasts during gameplay and then similar questions being asked/answered in story influencing scenes where it comes across as a shock to Elizabeth or Booker even though they recieved the very same information only ten minutes previously. \nOverall, I would give the story a 8 out of 10 simply because the very end was pretty crappy and should have had an option to avoid/alter. \n\nAs for the gameplay I'd say its pretty slick. In Easy and Normal difficulties the aim assist makes for extremely smooth gunfights and entertaining kills, though makes it a little buggy when you try to aim at someone in the distance and it auto-focuses on a closer enemy. In 1999 mode you don't have this issue and it makes the gunfights noticably more challenging as your bullets don't magically seek out the enemy's head (I haven't played through the game on the hard difficulty and skipped straight to 1999, so I don't know if the aim-assist is in hard mode or not). \nThe melee is a little buggy as well, since it seems to seek out nearby enemies when you melee, even if they're behind you. This makes for some wild fistfights when you go to melee an individual in front of you and you whip around to hit the guy behind you. It takes some getting used to, but once you're accustomed to it, it becomes a lot smoother and more entertaining. \nSky-lines/Freight Hooks are a little goofy as well, mostly because it feels like half the time you're trying to target them they don't target, and then when you're randomly jumping along the game just snags one and sends you flying. While this can be a pain in the beginning, you get a feel for it by mid-game and it becomes more enjoyable. \nFor this aspect of the gameplay I'd give it a 7/10.\n\nAs for the weapons in the game (your vigors [superpowers] and guns), they're pretty well balanced and while none of them stand out as particularly OP, they're all useful (Unlike some games that include useless weapons or abilities just for the purpose of filling space.) You can upgrade them with damage boosts, accuracy boosts, reload speed boosts, clip size increase, and trap boosts (for vigors), and there might be other upgrades I'm forgetting, but you'll see when you play. And also unlike a lot of games, the money isn't endless, and kind of annoying to gather at times if you need a particularly useful upgrade before a part of the game and you neglected to purchase it previously. So its important to experiment early in the game and figure out what guns and vigors you like/use the most so you know what you should be upgrading.  While this might annoy a lot of people, I found it to be kind of refreshing and a good way to challenge players. \nFor the weapon and ability aspect of the game I'd give it a 9/10.\n\n\nSo overall I'd say its about as solid as they come and an entertaining play. I've purchased the DLC as well and am in the process of downloading them, I look forward to playing through them and hope that they're just as fun as the game is in its vanilla state.","timestamp_created":1419813144,"timestamp_updated":1419813144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13677223","author":{"steamid":"76561198034598217","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1438623269},"language":"english","review":"Well I just started playing, and I think its pretty cool so far.","timestamp_created":1419812030,"timestamp_updated":1419812030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13676869","author":{"steamid":"76561198070325466","num_games_owned":428,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":294,"last_played":1402962019},"language":"english","review":"The gameplay is more enjoyable than Bioshock's, but the story is just plain confusing and stupid.

However, gameplay was definitely improved in some situations.\n\nGameplay and Customization:\nBioShock Infinite made shooting much smoother than its predecessors. It also threw in a lot of different guns. However, i expect that the reason for this is because of the dullness of the plasmids (now known as vigors), most of them just didn't feel cool or that much enjoyable. The Skylines though, they were a different story. It was enjoyable nonetheless.  It also wasn't very much customizable. The currency system was redone to the point where you buy everything with cash. Tears were cool.\n\nHacking and Elizabeth:\nHacking was pretty much removed from this game. But one vigor known as \"Possession\" kind of takes hacking's place. Elizabeth, in all her glory, is a great addition to the BioShock games. She can open up Tears and toss you ammo,hp or salts. She also seems to have a thing with finding Gear parts. \n\nStory and Atmosphere:\nHere is probably what intrigued me the most, the story. This game has been known to very much mindf*** many of its players. I don't happen to be one of those players. Also [spoiler] the story of Booker and his debt. How he had to \"Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt.\" It definitely was something to remember. [/spoiler] The atmosphere was nothing super special. Columbia was nice, but it wasn't as good as Rapture.\n\nOverall:\nThe gameplay was definitely smooth, the story was even smoother. What it lacks in vigors, it makes up with Elizabeth. \n10/10 would Handyman again.","timestamp_created":1419781109,"timestamp_updated":1419781109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40I7jyMoCf86QNA=="}
