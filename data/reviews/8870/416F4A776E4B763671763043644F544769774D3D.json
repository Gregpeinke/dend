give BioShock Infinite the one thing I can really give it: The game starts out strong. REALLY strong. [/h3]The atmosphere in Infinite is established very quickly and solidly with great visual storytelling, expressive characters and clear showcases of the disturbing morals and practices of the floating city of Columbia. One second you're stepping into a world that seems like paradise, next finding out how hellish it really is, then jumping off of a burning zeppelin onto a zipline while shooting soldiers with your pistol.\nAnd then.....what happened to this game?\n\nThe shootouts become more and more mindless as Booker (the player-character) gets stronger and all the other enemies retain their same difficulty level. Even though I played on the hardest difficulty available on my first playthrough, the combat was pathetically easy except for a few huge difficulty spikes with certain boss fights. Every time you die, you respawn with the same number of enemies near you, except you also lose money so it's harder to purchase upgrades. The zipline mechanic gets old quickly, and the melee executions usable in combat are flashy and originally cool, but just get annoying after watching the same few animations over and over again. Also, Elizabeth, your companion for the majority of the game, ends up cowering behind boxes for 90% of the time while in combat.\n\nI'll give Infinite some points for exploration. The world of Columbia is enthralling, and it's really fun looking around for little details hidden in this gigantic floating city. However, the design of the overall maps doesn't always feel practical, and upgrade stations and items often feel like they are scattered around randomly without a good way to find them. How does Infinite solve this problem if you can't find where to go to progress the story, though? The most bizarre mechanic I've seen in this game: YOU PRESS A BUTTON AND AN ARROW SHOWS UP ON THE GROUND TELLING YOU WHICH DIRECTION TO GO. Yes, really. Never mind having an actual map or minimap that shows where you've been, where you're going, locations of collectibles, etc. Just press a button and press on. I'm not sure why Infinite couldn't have implemented an actual map system like its two predecessors.\n\n[h3]Now onto the biggest problem with Infinite: the storytelling.[/h3]\nAs with the atmosphere, Infinite's storytelling starts out very detailed and satisfying to experience. It sticks with the gameplay-focused method of storytelling that characterized BioShock 1 and 2, which is great (I hate sitting through cutscenes), and learning more of the story by having Elizabeth as a companion. However, partway through the game, the storytelling COMPLETELY goes out the window, and devolves into one of the most ridiculous plots I have ever seen in a game. I'll keep things vague here as to not spoil anything for those who haven't played Infinite, but trust me - you aren't missing much.\n\nThe game starts introducing time travel and alternate universes as a way to drag the characters out of seemingly impossible situations, making it possible for the characters to alter their world in a way where the stakes of the game don't really seem to matter. By the end, Elizabeth is literally explaining the tropes and similarities between Infinite and the first two BioShock games as a way to explain how alternate universes work. I don't want to say more than that for the sake of not spoiling the ending. Honestly, though, the ending feels like when I tried to write an essay about a book in school without reading the book. It's incoherent, unsatisfying, and feels unrelated to events of the game, not to mention it literally tries to compare itself directly to BioShock 1 and 2 (probably just so that players will lump it in with games with plots that actually make sense).\n\nAnyone who has played BioShock 1 and 2 is probably expecting some big plot twist in Infinite, and there actually IS something different about Infinite's plot twist: It's embarassingly bad. Overall, I don't recommend this game, mainly because of its somewhat monotonous combat and drop-off in storytelling, but I have to acknowledge that there are elements in Infinite of genuinely interesting atmosphere that aren't seen in many other shooters. It's better than many of those other shooters, but compared to BioShock 1 and 2? It's weak.\n4/10","timestamp_created":1637904963,"timestamp_updated":1638318617,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585532665252685547","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104016377","author":{"steamid":"76561198988578593","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1656947612},"language":"hungarian","review":"Remek történet remek látvány kell több indok?","timestamp_created":1637904543,"timestamp_updated":1637904543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104013234","author":{"steamid":"76561198104234623","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":462,"last_played":1628868171},"language":"english","review":"A must play game.
