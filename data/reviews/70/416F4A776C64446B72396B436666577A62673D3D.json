As someone who did not play the game in those almost 2 decades, and only up to now did I play it, I can see why it was deserving of all those awards. It is quite the product for its time, and while the graphics haven't aged well and some irritating grab mechanics with crates being wonky, I still had fun from start to finish (except maybe near the final part). \n\nAside from the outdated graphics and audio, level design was pretty linear but clever. Like, it's not always going down a striaght hallway, there are moments you're going in vents, going down railways, fighting your way outside, etc. You just have to think about how to progress, and the game presents this without some marker pointing it out to you, and the levels themselves get more distinct as you progress, so I can give a lot of respect to this game, that while graphics and audio haven't aged well, the levels have.\n\nEnemies as well are unique as you fight them, you get the famous head crab zombies, then you got some monsters spitting acid, some shooting electricity, some that go to herds ready to do a kind of sonar blast at you, some with a sort of bee tracking gun, some bullshit flying monsters and some typical soldier enemies. The way they are uniquely designed and how they attack you makes you sure you never forget them or confuse them with some other enemy.\n\nStorywise, its more or less of you trying to get out of a labortory in an experiment gone wrong kind of sci-fi story, which is all I can say. And I can say that it works with the environment the game has built.\n\nA complaint I can say nearing the final part. I'm not gonna spoil much except that there are boss fights, and the final one is where it gets frustrating. It gets points in its creativity in the battle field being with how I can say as vertical and some creativity in the way it attacks. But that creative way it attacks is what makes it frustrating. All I can say is save often in that fight, and get ready to load when you get hit by that special attack, because its not worth getting hit by it, oh and it can follow you.\n\n\nNow another criticism I could say with this game would have to be lack of indication of an enemy's death but I think I could chalk that up for being the product of its time, because the way they die is animated, not physics based and with some enemies being close to ground already you may waste some extra ammo on their dying animation. I wouldn't say its a really big complaint, but in my playthrough I did lose precious explosive ammo on that.\n\n\nOverall this game was fun from start to finish. I was still captivated to continue on in the game, finding new areas to shoot down enemies in, exploring the different areas to keep me in the game. Now graphics included it hinders the game as the textures and sound again, haven't aged well.\n\nBut considering those being the parts of its time, I say the game deserves.\n\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1483861171,"timestamp_updated":1483861171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29105033","author":{"steamid":"76561198123778076","num_games_owned":772,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":152,"last_played":1605191300},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life - игра ставшая Легендой.","timestamp_created":1483842897,"timestamp_updated":1483842897,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526462376117706299","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29100182","author":{"steamid":"76561198241261112","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1046,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":570,"last_played":1462312531},"language":"english","review":"This game almost convinced me that Nuclear Scientists are extremely trained up to fight a war...

Togliendo l effetto retrò gaming, dato dall innegabile fatto delle meccaniche di gioco ormai superate da quasi 20 anni, l odiosa camminata scivolosa che alcune volte costringe a ripetere molte volte alcuni passaggi ed il mirino primitivo delle armi, questo gioco possiede, a mio parere, la migliore trama mai sviluppata in un videogioco. Un capolavoro assoluto, giocarlo oggi fa effetto; la difficoltà risulta elevatissima rispetto ai giochi attuai ( molto player-friendly), qui il gameplay è duro e puro, anche a difficoltà media il gioco richiederà impegno per essere portato a termine e gli \"enigmi\" per procedere nel cammino di gordon sono a volte intricati rispetto agli standard attuali ( ovviamente se uno non si spoilera niente). Colonna sonora fantastica ed una suggestione densissima nel giocare sono altri prelibati ingredeinti, assaporando come dessert il finale del gioco, ormai famoso, ma assolutamente fantastico. Posso ben capire come mai sia in 1 posizione nella classifica sparatutto IGN; unica pecca? L elevato script nel procedere del gioco a volte puo' dare la sensazione di essere troppo incanalati in \"binari\"  ed essere trasportati dagli eventi nonostante la trama ed il suo svolgimento singolare per l epoca ( ed anche attualmente, molti giochi dovrebbero imparare da gordon) lasciano perdonare questo e quella dannata camminata scivolosa anni 90.

You play as physicist Gordon Freeman as he attempts to not only escape the facility known as Black Mesa, but right the wrongs of his experiment gone wrong. What sets this apart from most FPS games is that you're never taken out of the action. There are no cutscenes, the story unfolds right before your eyes, keeping you completely immersed. There is a slight exception for the loading screens, which are common, but they are brief and don't overstay their welcome. It was a great experience to see how this disaster unfolded and how it would be corrected. My only complaint, though, is the lack of any real characters. Don't get me wrong, its shocking to see your fellow scientists killed by enemies, but none of the scientists or human characters ever really stood out except for one in particular near the end, which I won't spoil here. However, the overall story as well as the progression of it makes up for this complaint. Gunplay is, well, great. This is the gunplay which helped model our modern day FPS games. Enemies are only slightly varied, with the Xen creatures having their differences, such as the Head Crabs, Bullsquids, and Gargs, and the human enemies are pretty much the same. However, their AI makes up for this lack of variation. They'll team up on you, attack each other, hide from attacks, the whole bunch. The AI is impressive, especially for the time it was released. The puzzles in this game can be tricky, but are never too difficult nor impossible. The only true thing which is difficult is the combat, which is a series of trial and error segments, seing which strategy will suit you the best. Be wary, however, that you will die alot, so use that quick save button like your life depends on it. The graphics are slightly dated to today's standards of gaming, but this was not too much of a distraction given the impressive gameplay and story.\n\nIf Doom is the father of all FPS, then Half-Life is the son which helped paved the way for all FPS. It is a classic and a must own for all FPS lovers. Although better characters might have been needed, it's tense and thrilling story and gameplay will keep you satisfied from begining to end.\n\nFinal Score: 9/10","timestamp_created":1483594912,"timestamp_updated":1483595348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29026158","author":{"steamid":"76561198343573971","num_games_owned":1162,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":59,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59,"last_played":1483219134},"language":"spanish","review":"excelente historia la jugabilidad es buena es autentico por eso gano el juego del año","timestamp_created":1483593660,"timestamp_updated":1483593660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29026145","author":{"steamid":"76561198069735211","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":1019,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":928,"last_played":1483612609},"language":"english","review":"\"With my brains and your brawn we'll make an excellent team.\"\n\nAhh, yes, Half-Life.
