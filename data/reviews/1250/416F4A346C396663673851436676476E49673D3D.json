After each round, you gather with your mates at the local trading floor and spend money on largely unprofitable, high risk weapons arbitrate, or engage in old school day trading, throwing cash and shouting such inspired phrases as \"MONAY, MONAY, MONAY\", and \"DOSH, grab it while you can lads\". The complexity of English financial services boggles the mind.\n\nThe graphics are top notch; a true to life representation of the state of modern England and her subjects. However, I am inclined to say the vanity of developers came through when they gave the enemy NPCs uncommonly good dental hygene. Having traveled to the UK myself, the enemy mobs are comparable to what a typical Briton would consider to be a supermodel.\n\nEven still, the honest presentation of British finance and culture set the game apart: 10/10","timestamp_created":1392327727,"timestamp_updated":1392327727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9090394","author":{"steamid":"76561198117475434","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":7583,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4253,"last_played":1451430386},"language":"english","review":"Fun game, simple and easy to understand.

(great cheat, weakens gameplay)\n- Audio breaks on some maps under certain conditions. (Farm is one of those maps)\n- Better, but still not optimal: lacking optimization for the graphics. This is painfully obvious on maps like Steamland which is unplayable due to frequent framerate-drops.\n- Steam friend invite/join server doesn't work making it hard to join friends. (always get server not responding)\n- bugs aren't being fixed, instead we get new maps and DLC weapons. Fix bugs plz..\n\n\nThe game:\nIn my oppinion one of the best co op games ever! The theme is very cliche, calling them \"specimens\" instead of \"zombies\" does not help that. This game does however offer a tactical depth that few other shooters can match.\nMany noobs will think that the best strategy is to stay in a corner while experienced players know that is only a fast way to get cornered and killed. That said, some spots are better for last stands than others, you need to organize your team to defend all possible entrances.\nThe game is class based (perk based) with each class having a set of specialities that translate to in-game bonuses. Waves of enemies will spawn, your job is to kill them all. In between waves you purchase weapons and upgrades using money you get from kills or donations from nice team mates who clean the maps using mad shooting skills. \nThe game has no crosshair and relies heavily on the player knowing when the shoulder/aim a weapon and when to leg it. The aim is highly affected by any movement, you'll need to learn how to shoulder the weapons quickly to minimize spread.\nThis game is loads of fun! And I'm not alone in thinking so, servers are still highly populated, yay!\n\nScore:\n3/5 (fix the bugs and get

No Problem!) This is in part rectified by the increasing health of the specimens per difficulty, doing 5 million damage may seem like a lot at first, but when the most basic zed has 228 health at max difficulty it isnt too awful, and the levels grant huge bonuses to price, ammo, damage and more.\n\nThis goes on sale often enough to be a low risk buy.

The idea is simple- you and up to six other people go and clear a map of all the ZEDs (the official name for the game's monsters- they're basically zombies for most intents and purposes). After each wave, you have a limited time to find the Trader to buy and sell weapons and restock your ammo. When the timer elapses, her doors shut and then you're left to fend for yourselves and kill another wave of zombies. This culminates in the final battle against the Patriarch. \n\nThere are a few things going for the game. It's class-based, and it has a progressive levelling system. The more you play, the more experience towards a level-up you'll get, making you stronger. It's a simple idea to keep you coming back for more. Enemy variety is great- they all have strengths and weaknesses much like the player classes. From the invisible Stalker to the fireball-shooting Husk to the fearsome monstrosity the Fleshpound, it keeps the game feeling fresher for longer. \n\nThe game looks perhaps a bit dated (it runs on a 2004 engine, after all), depending on your set-up, but it's very visceral. Hack s zombie's head off their neck, and they'll spurt blood, for instance. Headshots will often make brain matter explode out of them in a gory fountain. Shooting high explosives at them reduces them to a bloody mist that feels very satisfying. \n\nThe greatest strength to the game, though, is the gunplay. Weapons feel weighty and punchy. Guns handle well- there's no crosshair, so use aim-down-sights effectively unless you practice a lot with hip-firing. Guns handle well because they have kick- they will move about from where you pointed them if you keep your finger on the trigger, much like a real gun. Some of the best gunplay in a shooter.\n\nAnother great asset to the game is that it balances difficulty and co-operation well. It's natural to assume you fight more zombies (which you get two dozen or more at a time on screen) with more players, but zombie health will also go up, in addition to the difficulty you fight on. It's a fantastic way of high-risk, high-reward, since levelling up is often dependent on the total damage your class has inflicted. \n\nKilling Floor has seasonal Summer, Halloween and Christmas event to liven things up, and it receives regular updates as well as some free content such as new weapons in addition to all the maintenance- weapon balance and so on. \n\nIt's a game that's a bit of a one-trick pony in that it's a wave-based shooter- that's all it does, but it does that exceptionally well. It's a master of its craft.","timestamp_created":1391984901,"timestamp_updated":1391984901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9037235","author":{"steamid":"76561197970770460","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1668,"last_played":1413573847},"language":"english","review":"Better than sex cake","timestamp_created":1391983460,"timestamp_updated":1391983460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9036664","author":{"steamid":"76561198068455068","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1434074385},"language":"english","review":"the killing floor i a awsome game i love it so much if your looking for a game were you fight zombies this is the right game for you  fight endless waves of zombies and other monsters its like serious sam or painkiller and i also recommend those games too\n","timestamp_created":1391980459,"timestamp_updated":1391980459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9036570","author":{"steamid":"76561198058454404","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":105,"last_played":1452221692},"language":"english","review":"It's much better verison of left for dead.","timestamp_created":1391979885,"timestamp_updated":1391979885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9033969","author":{"steamid":"76561198072882371","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2653,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2265,"last_played":1447851961},"language":"portuguese","review":"Um exelente jogo para jogar sozinho ou com amigos!
