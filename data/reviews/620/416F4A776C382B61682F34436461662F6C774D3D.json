For what it is, Valve masterfully crafted the experience's gameplay and storytelling elements into an instant-classic. The innovations on the gameplay-side since Portal 1 are wonderful, and the gradual difficulty progression curve keeps you in a flow state even as the game gets exponentially harder than the first hour of the game. It's so well-thought out how they introduce new tools to your arsenal and mental frameworks for approaching puzzles that they clearly spent as much time and playtesting as they needed to nail it down.\n\nThe only weak point is the story/narrative. For what it was for it's time, the lack of dialogue from the character and the interactions being limited to robots talking to your POV was like a 7/10 imo. Being largely an action puzzle game this can be kind of forgivable and the excuse that they were inspired by the end of 2001 a Space Odyssey and other human/robot relationships kind of covers them... it doesn't quite excuse the world feeling quite lonely or weak connection to the silent main character you play as. There should have been other human characters or in-game or over an intercomm having direct dialogue with the main character at the very least... It's a missed opportunity that any Portal 3 would surely fix, potentially making this classic become quite outdated.","timestamp_created":1640960562,"timestamp_updated":1640960562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106985477","author":{"steamid":"76561199092465897","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1652812094},"language":"russian","review":"ОЧЕНЬ УВЛЕКАТЕЛЬНО, но есть минусы!(я не буду говорить что бы не спойлирить)\n","timestamp_created":1640960323,"timestamp_updated":1640960323,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106985045","author":{"steamid":"76561198417748311","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1641918311},"language":"german","review":".","timestamp_created":1640959928,"timestamp_updated":1640959928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106984987","author":{"steamid":"76561198187375093","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1609425962},"language":"english","review":"i think i broke the game","timestamp_created":1640959878,"timestamp_updated":1640959878,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490552037954330444","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106984397","author":{"steamid":"76561198128167089","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1283,"last_played":1640959128},"language":"russian","review":"Action-puzzles`s classics.

Vavle, кстати, вводили торговую площадку с косметикой и жестами, но при этом потом игру не обновляли в плане уровней или ещё как-нибудь в плане контента. Уровни от комьюнити  не рекомендую т.к. они какие-то сломанные. Приходилось по несколько раз повторять одно и тоже чтобы пройти дальше. Из персонажей, кроме молчаливой гг, есть ещё 2 основных персонажа: Гладос [spoiler] бывшая Кэролайн [/spoiler] и Уитли, по мимо их: записи Кейва Джонсона, [strike] ЯНЕТАКАЯ турель [/strike] и шиза модули. По сути не густо и было бы глупо если бы эти персонажи получились плохо. После первой части тупников особо не было кроме 1 момента с краской. Чувствуется что уровни даже без опыта с первой части не сказать что сложные, даже если в голове у того кто проходит включен Папич мод. В целом не жалею что её прошел.\n","timestamp_created":1640947886,"timestamp_updated":1640947964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106974617","author":{"steamid":"76561198087993441","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1640784312},"language":"english","review":"Very

Второй же портал с его механикой геля появился из-за новых студентов того же заведения, так же из-за их демки и их так же забрал габен)\n+Шутки гладос, они зачётны\n+Сюжет (Лично я не принимаю сюжет первой игры в рамках этой, в минусах будет понятно почему)\n+Головоломки, даже те, что я уже проходил заставляют думать\n+Кооп с рофлом над другом\n+Ну и лор за счёт кейва\nМинусы:\n-Сюжет первой части, на которой якобы строиться вторая тут не как не привязан, а так же не объяснено, почему гладос убрала энерго шарики и их приёмники, с точки зрения разработчиков то ладно, они просто хотели, что бы портал не использовала механики халвы, но в сюжете было бы не лишним это описать.\n-Старые камеры из 1 портал на себя не похожи, как будь-то бы первый портал проходил иначе\n-Камеры старых лабораторий говорят о том, что прошло не мало лет, но их стилизация одна и та же у всех, к тому же они смотрятся как-то не так, так как в демке не было этого всего и разработчики просто впихнули сеттинг старости в камеры, что не подразумевали этого.\n-Уитли показывает из себя не весь что, то его планы и действия умны, то он ведёт себя как валенок, что за не определённость? Не понятно, потому что его план с турелями и нейро таксином были составлены из боя Гладос и чел, то есть он анализировал их бой и в тот же момент он разрушает своим телом стёкла и пытается не машинным, а словесным способом подобрать код. Уитли, что смог управлять частью комплекса, а после не смог даже с переводчиком справиться нормально. Я понимаю, что Валв хотели показать, что он не просто дурак, он вполне умён, просто безрассуден и вспыльчив из-за чего его вполне умные решения превращаются в какой-то бред. К чему это я всё?

Portal 1 is significantly shorter, but both are still very easy to pick up and put down. I got them for a combined $3 USD during a sale, but honestly, despite having one of the worst price/hour ratios in my library at full price (about $1.20/hour), it is worth every cent, even without a sale. Like I've heard many times, One of the worst things about Portal is that you can never play it for the first time again, and I'd have to agree. These games are 100x better if you don't know anything about them. Not to mention it's got one of the best lines in gaming history (\"So. How are you holding up? BECAUSE I'M A POTATO.\").\n\nTL;DR: The Portal series is phenomenal and can be obtained for much less than base price, but are worth every penny of full retail.
