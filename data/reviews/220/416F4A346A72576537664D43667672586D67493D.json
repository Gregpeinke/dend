Maybe two for games like Amnesia: The Dark Descent. But Half Life 2?\n\nLets just say use the restroom, get a snack and a drink, and keep your computer plugged in. You'll get completely immersed in the world Valve has created from the intriguing speeches of notorious Dr. Breen, to the chilling atmosphere of Ravenholm. You'll be invested in the story, and when it finishes, you will stare at your computer screen, your eyes telling you it's over, but your soul wishing for it to go on. You'll be longing for more. So you will play it again, and again, and again. You'll find new details you missed the first time, enjoy new dialogue you didn't know you could find, and relish every exploit as you try to beat the game faster than before. You'll eventually mess with the dev console, you'll find alternative endings (kinda?), you'll go on rampages, you'll mess around with physics, but still the game will be just as much fun. I am playing through it for the last time sadly. Mac is dropping support for the 32 bit gaming platforms in favor of 64 bit. This game has been such a facet of life. I seem to always go back to it for more bullet storm fun. I will hold off updating to Catalina until I get my fill of the game again.\n\nIf you are still reading this, 1: why are you still debating? Buy the game. It's fantastic. 2: If you are a scared person, if you don't do well with horror at all, Ravenholm will be unpleasant for you, but I URGE you to play it through. It becomes less scary with time, although it never fails to give me the creeps. It is my favorite chapter of the game by far, as it is with many who have fell in love with this game. Eventually I expect it to upgrade to 64 bit, I doubt the community is at all willing to leave this classic behind. I know I'm not.\n\n\n\nWhy are you still reading this? BUYT THE GAME. You could be in City 17 right now!

Half life 2 is one of those games where if you are open minded enough and willing to commit to enjoying it, will stay with you forever.\nIf you play a lot of old games, you can make the comparison between this and games released before it and see what everyone at the time was so excited about, but even now in the 2020s, the game still holds up as a masterpiece of a shooter. It's fast, it's fun, it's got an incredibly unique vibe and story that isn't shoved down your throat (in fact you kind of have to look for it if you want it). Graphics don't hold up incredibly, but half life 2 update does make it look a lot prettier. Source uses an old method of ray tracing, and even though it kind of looks shite by today's standards, occasionally I catch myself looking at some random area of the game and my ape brain from 2004 will be amazed by it just for a second.\n\nMore than that, the community is one of the greatest and most consistently active gaming communities there has ever been. The source engine spawned countless works of art and multiplayer beasts, like Team Fortress Two, the Portal series, Titanfall, Apex Legends, Counter Strike Source and CS:GO, GMod, and many more. The modding community just will not die no matter how little maintenance valve does on Hammer, and even once you finish the main game there are a million more things to do with HL2 afterwords. It's a huge and very lively community with a lot, no probably the most, content that a game has every produced.","timestamp_created":1597210017,"timestamp_updated":1647679067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74170020","author":{"steamid":"76561198038327564","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":440,"last_played":1583032165},"language":"english","review":"One of, if not the best game ever made.

HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named \"Best PC Game Ever\" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.\n\nNOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.\n\nThe player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.\n\nThe intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source®, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:\n\nCharacters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \"muscles,\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.\nPhysics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.\nGraphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story® and Monster's, Inc.®, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.\nAI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.\n","timestamp_created":1597143535,"timestamp_updated":1597143535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74128985","author":{"steamid":"76561199056423676","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16,"last_played":1631373074},"language":"koreana","review":"포탈처럼 나에게 스팀을 입문하게 해줬던 최고의 인생작 하프라이프. 어쩌면 지금의 스팀을 있게 해준 게임이라고 해도 과언이 아닐정도로 완성도가 뛰어난듯. 심지어 가격도 착하고 세일은 커녕 기다리지 않고 바로 질러도됨.           그러니 3좀 내라","timestamp_created":1597143407,"timestamp_updated":1600260709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74126503","author":{"steamid":"76561198154999005","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":1257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":676,"last_played":1597239811},"language":"english","review":"It's really, really fun.
