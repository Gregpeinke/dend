You play as Barney Calhoun, a Black Mesa security guard who is on duty when everything goes to shambles. Barney must then help a group of scientists with finding a way to escape by traversing the less traveled paths of Black Mesa.\n\nBlue Shift is fairly straightforward in its presentation, but its charm comes from the story and the vulnerability of your character, which heightens the experience. Barney isn't equipped with military style weaponry or a HEV suit, instead relying on armor pieces he finds rather than HEV armor panels. Blue Shift isn't terribly difficult unlike the others, but experiencing an alien invasion as a vulnerable average joe is expertly demonstrated. \n\nThe story also deserves praise for its different approach. If Half Life is a tale of survival and endurance, and Opposing Force is a tale of betrayal and redemption, then Blue Shift is a tale of cooperation and human decency.  Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues use scientific methods and advanced technolgies to find various ways to escape, but none of that woud be possible without Barney's bravery and dilligence in fighting the aliens and reparing old tech in decrepid, dim areas of Black Mesa. Trapped in a facility with aliens and the military around every corner, both groups push to accomplish their goals together for the sole purpose of saving each other from a terrible death. \n\nThis is what makes Blue Shift a memorable experience. It is short and straightforward, and may not be as groundbreaking or innovative as Half Life or Opposing Force, but for some games, it's all you need. \n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1597614279,"timestamp_updated":1597614279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74414096","author":{"steamid":"76561198964068188","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":91,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":91,"last_played":1582123447},"language":"english","review":"Short, but sweet.

Indeed, many features from the base Half-Life game are missing from this expansion.  I think they're being a little unfair.  Opposing Force is a great expansion, but I think in-between that and Blue Shift Gearbox learned a lot about the essential feel of Half-Life, and the result made me think of an old cliche: Less is more.\n\nI really like how this expansion explores the Black Mesa crisis from a totally different angle.  You play as a security guard, rather than a scientist, and explore the life of Barney Calhoun as he attempts to protect the personnel from violent aliens and a military cover-up operation.  Unlike Gordon Freeman, or indeed Adrian Shephard from Opposing Force, you don't get access to god weapons or powered armor; you're just a security guard.  That changes the entire way that Half-Life feels without fundamentally changing the gameplay all that much.  Some of the new puzzles were actually real head-scratchers for me, but you can rest assured that if you pay attention you'll rarely if ever need to consult a walkthrough.\n\nIt's pretty obvious to me that Gearbox really tried to make a game the same way Valve makes them, unlike in Opposing Force where they changed almost everything.  To give one example, there's a puzzle where you have to drain a pool of toxic liquid so that you can rearrange some barrels so that when you refill the pool they'll float up and make a bridge.  It's not executed perfectly, but you can really see the effort.  It earns big points from me.  Even the Xen levels are more tolerable than they are in Half-Life, because they're less tedious and give you more time to come to grips with the new environment.\n\nTowards the midpoint of the game you meet up with a scientist named Doctor Rosenberg and accompany him to an older area of the Black Mesa facility where you have to help him get an older version of the teleporter working.  I think this is the point where a lot of things really started to click for me, because here the game starts to feel a lot like an old science fiction movie, with old-fashioned computers making bleeping noises and a loud-mouthed scientist muttering technobabble at you.  You even have to fiddle with some of the machinery while defending the lab from hostiles at one point.  This really ticks a lot of boxes for me.\n\nI tried to keep this review short, but I find that I have a lot to praise about Blue Shift.  I went into this expecting a pretty lackluster experience, but I came out of it actually really liking it.  Sure it's shorter than Half-Life, and arguably there's less stuff in it, but I felt that most of it was used to great effect, and I can safely say I was pleasantly surprised.  Sometimes, every once in a while, less really is more.","timestamp_created":1597546719,"timestamp_updated":1597546748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74362012","author":{"steamid":"76561199044182975","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":470,"last_played":1597037616},"language":"english","review":"This game may be a lot shorter than Opposing Force and Half-Life, but it is definitely another good game.

It's still Half-Life and, therefore, remains a great FPS.

The gameplay, as said before, is identical to the original game, although it has fewer weapons, enemies, and is even easier. The interesting thing is that armor is no longer recharged at electrical terminals; instead, you must find helmets and vests scattered throughout the game, which fits your role perfectly.\n\nOverall, I recommend buying this game, but keep in mind that it's quite short.","timestamp_created":1596489252,"timestamp_updated":1596489252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73717351","author":{"steamid":"76561198045793727","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1596485059},"language":"english","review":"While Opposing force has more brand new content, I prefer Blue shift for it's tighter story and better atmosphere. it's very short, I finished at 4 hours, but it's worth the 5 bucks!","timestamp_created":1596485694,"timestamp_updated":1596485694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73716202","author":{"steamid":"76561198092233942","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":62,"last_played":1597020934},"language":"japanese","review":"great game but ... it would be nice if they correct the languages .thank you.\n","timestamp_created":1596483796,"timestamp_updated":1596483796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73710684","author":{"steamid":"76561198271534208","num_games_owned":416,"num_reviews":139,"playtime_forever":200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1592500144},"language":"russian","review":"-","timestamp_created":1596475115,"timestamp_updated":1596475115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73709891","author":{"steamid":"76561198148947709","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":397,"last_played":1613094893},"language":"english","review":"It's a good DLC but not as good as Opposing Force.","timestamp_created":1596473721,"timestamp_updated":1596473721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73694425","author":{"steamid":"76561198009130162","num_games_owned":463,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":18,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1596447851},"language":"english","review":"\"Hey, catch me later, i'll buy you a beer\"\n\nAfter all these years...

Рекомендую пройти игру каждому, особенно фанатам.","timestamp_created":1596204574,"timestamp_updated":1596236259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546539366245269775","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73545885","author":{"steamid":"76561198836850643","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1595492294},"language":"english","review":"Catch me later, I'll buy you a beer","timestamp_created":1596171427,"timestamp_updated":1596171427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73541316","author":{"steamid":"76561199054283975","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1655682240},"language":"english","review":"Kinda cool, only 1 1/2 hours or 2, so its easy and would recommend this game for people who want to run through almost like a demo of half-life but still have a great time","timestamp_created":1596161917,"timestamp_updated":1635692186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73538652","author":{"steamid":"76561198125964796","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1601167294},"language":"english","review":"About that beer I owed ya","timestamp_created":1596156350,"timestamp_updated":1596156350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73534498","author":{"steamid":"76561198373392003","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1596147644},"language":"english","review":"The extra of Freeman being captured was awesome","timestamp_created":1596147729,"timestamp_updated":1596147729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73530048","author":{"steamid":"76561198373616344","num_games_owned":323,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1597793574},"language":"russian","review":"В три раза короче оригинала, но тоже хорош, сюжет неплохой, в целом то же, но не за Фримена в костюме, а за Барни в броне - занимательное путешествие в Кзен на 20 минут туда и обратно, помощь ученым, побег из комплекса - это если вкратце описать. В плане сюжета - вряд ли что-то потеряете, а вот пройти это 4-х часовку рекомендую всем любителям классической халвы.\n\nНа самом деле, \"Синяя Смена\" очень хороша геймплейно, вас кормят почти всеми рядовыми противниками, только жиробасов с шершнями маловато, в остальном вы получаете весь арсенал кроме шершнемёта и энергетического. Сопутствует оригиналу в плане решения загадок на логику (а-ля подставьте железный бак как проводник электричества).\n\nИз минусов отсуствие мультиплеера при неналичии у вас оригинала, редкие вылеты с первой по четвертые главы. Очень редкие баги с несрабатыванием скрипта.","timestamp_created":1596140057,"timestamp_updated":1596140057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73528529","author":{"steamid":"76561198283946217","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1659657759},"language":"english","review":"Half life gud.\nThe man who owns a beer to gordon.","timestamp_created":1596137525,"timestamp_updated":1599247271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73525958","author":{"steamid":"76561198056312879","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":628,"last_played":1596270926},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un juego muy antiguo, pero adictivo.
