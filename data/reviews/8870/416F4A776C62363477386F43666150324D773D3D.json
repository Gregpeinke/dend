Avec une histoire très, très, TRES poussée, des personnages principaux attachants dans leur relation, le scénario et l'intrigue principale sont un très gros point fort de ce jeu. On salue aussi la création de personnages secondaires créant réellement une ambiance propre au jeu, avec notamment les Lutèce, qui sont géniaux à mon sens. Un effort pour créer un univers immersif d'un point de vue graphismes, sons, et réactivité de la caméra, avec les petits \"voxophones\" et \"kinétoscopes\", qui donne vraiment une âme au jeu. Ce n'est pas pour rien qu'il dispose d'une valeur ajoutée en new game +, et une fin qui risque de vous faire réfléchir beaucoup, vraiment un plus appréciable au vu des parfois piètres scénarios développés récemment.\nLe point qui cependant mérite un peu de travail reste le gameplay, et les équipements, mais je trouve qu'ils vont de pair avec les problèmes majeurs du gameplay. Les toniques, qui remplacent les plasmides des opus précédents, ne sont pas tous forcément extrêmement utiles, certaines combinaisons sont quasiment des must pour passer certaines portions du jeu (hahem... bataille finale... boss Mme Comstock... hahem). La partie tir est, comme les toniques, bien réalisée d'un point de vue exécution (système de visée bon, réactivité du jeu de même) mais il manque une option, qui elle est sur les toniques... LAISSEZ MOI AVOIR TOUTES LES ARMES!!! Autant les toniques sont limités, autant les armes sont très utiles dans certaines situations précises, ce qui exige que vous sauviez une arme particulière à l'approche d'un combat particulier sinon vous êtes en mauvaise posture. Un défaut regrettable, mais compensé par l'utilisation des failles en combat d'Elizabeth, qui rend beaucoup service, ainsi que des potions, munitions et cristaux que cette dernière vous fournit.\nEn conclusion, malgré le fait que le gameplay soit parfois répétitif, malgré la véritable amélioration que représente les Aérotram dans ce sens, ce défaut reste mineur devant une histoire à couper le souffle, un scénario rondement mené, et des personnages qui à mon sens, sont vraiment bien faits... Je mettrais à Bioshock 17/20, et conseillerais à ceux en manque d'une claque scénaristique de sauter sur le jeu.\nP.S: DLC encore non faits, une critique en sera probablement faite sur la page du Season Pass pour le jeu correspondant","timestamp_created":1419731882,"timestamp_updated":1419731882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13652356","author":{"steamid":"76561198071411736","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":8494,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2005,"last_played":1586930636},"language":"brazilian","review":"[h1][b]Ótimo jogo.[/b][/h1]\n\nAlém de ser um  shooter com cenas de ação muito legais e um protagonista excelente, o jogo critica religião, preconceito e ainda fala sobre paradoxos e tempo-espaço.

I'm not sure how they pulled it off but this game felt new and yet nostalgic (great 80's time referances and easter eggs in this game for those of us old enough to appreciate them!) . The first Bio Shock greatly entertained me with its clever story line and surprises but this one some how took it to the next level. At no point early in the game was i able to see what was coming like i have in most all games i've played in the past 25+ yrs. This one was no different. From start to finish i was entertained and felt compelled to finish the game to see how the story would end and even start a new one just to try diffenent choices and the effected outcomes of such.  The game play felt solid and there were a good amount of weapon and \"plasmid\" choices and combos to choose from.  The only thing that felt a bit off was the \"rail\" system usage. While they tried to work it in as much as they could for transportation and game play, it never felt fully necassary in the game combat system (with the exception of the airship battle).

While exploring the lighthouse, he stumbles upon a chair that shoots him up into the sky, where he finds a floating city known as Columbia. There the people of the city seceeded from the U.S. due to Abraham Lincoln's Civil War, and became its own \"state.\" There, the people worship George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, and follow the prophet and leader of their city: Mr. Comstock. Booker, bewidered by the place he stumbled upon walks around, allowng the player to learn how to play the game and ue each vigor as a carnival is going on show casing the different abilities the player will be experiencing. Everywhere he looks he sees posters of Comstock, and posters saying how he is the greatest man ever, and other posters claiming to avoid the \"False Prophet,\" created to \"stray the lamb away.\" One poster in particular claims that the \"False Prophet,\" has the letter \"AD\" engraved on his hand, at this point Booker raises his hand to show the player that \"AD\" is on his own hand. As you are walking through the street, a note is handed to you, telling the player to NOT get #77 when playing the raffel that the city is doing that day. Lo and Behold, when you go and play the raffel and win, you got #77. You are given a baseball bat, and a black woman and Irish man is dragged out onto the stage and the announcer tells the player to throw it at them as the couple begs them. Here the player learns that the town is racist. The player is given their first choice in the game, throw it at the couple or throw it at the announcer. [I chose to throw it at the announcer] The player raises his hand, where a police officer grabs his arm, and points out the \"AD,\" is on his hand. Instantly, people run, and you kill the police officer, stealing his gun, and the real game begins. You use the gun to shoot at the officer. The game progresses like this until you reach a tower, where you learn that the tower holds a girl hostage, Elizabeth. You free her, learn she can open tears (doors into other dimensions,) and that she is possibly the daughter of Comstock. The rest of the game is trying to find out who Elizabeth really is, and how to defeat Comstock and fix your life.\n     \n     To begin, the storyline is amazing, and is constantly keeping me wanting more. While I played it on hard (for the first time,) I was constantly having a challenge and to me, that was fun. The characters developed nicely, evolving as the plot developed, which also fitted nicely into the journey your character was embarking on. However, while I say that, the main character seemed to not develope in character as in how the character percieved certain things or how the player reacted to certain events, it was always the same, a gritty \"I don't want to be here,\" attitude; while this may be part of his character, it did seem to get a bit repetative.\n\n     Guns sounded nice, and did what guns are supposed to do. kill enemies in a realistic way. Upgrades could be purchased for the weapons and I admit that I did purchase a lot of them, but it is entirely up to player to buy upgrades, not only for the guns but for vigors as well. Vigors are powerups that the characters can use giving him special abilities, my favorite being possession; I rarely used the others however, but again, it is up to the player. Enemy variety is low, all characters that look one way also have the same type of gun, but do not carry the same gear when you search their dead bodies. These enemies range from anything to enemies with simple weapons and barely any armor (the police in the beginning,) to extremely hard (the helpers.) I will admit though, I did enjoy fighting all enemies when they showed up.)\n\n     Elizabeth, the character probably most people are familiar with, is an amazing ally. Constantly finding ammo, salts (item to use vigor,) health and pointing out items in the room you can grab. Without her, the player would have a hard time fighting. Her facial expressions are nicely done, changing as the story progresses. She mad at you? She will show anger, and talk to you differently. She will throw things to you without speaking, and show the player her anger by facing away from the main character: Booker De Witt.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ending to the game was not something I could expect, especially when you find out Elizabeth is your daughter.

There is very little exploration, very little opportunity to plan strategically for any firefight, and practically no resource management. What this all means is that the only major mechanical difference between BioShock Infinite and more generic shooter games is the Vigors, which turn out to be not that useful in a lot of encounters because of the fact that you can't carry around extra Salts, so unless Elizabeth throws you some, you can only use the Vigors a couple times per fight.\n\nThe story fares much better, but even if it as thought-provoking as BioShock or as emotionally compelling as BioShock 2, there's not much point in playing this game over those, since they both managed to have good stories without turning into bland corridor shooters.","timestamp_created":1419652369,"timestamp_updated":1419652369,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13628008","author":{"steamid":"76561198084450958","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1281,"last_played":1419779786},"language":"russian","review":"найс игра","timestamp_created":1419652324,"timestamp_updated":1419652324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13627727","author":{"steamid":"76561198042467521","num_games_owned":795,"num_reviews":106,"playtime_forever":2345,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2048,"last_played":1584018287},"language":"russian","review":"BEST GAME EVER !!!

I played BioShock 2 some years ago and loved it. But I must say that this game is probably one of the greatest I've ever played, in terms of everything. The escapism is what draws me, I think, so maybe my judgement isn't completely objective. But so what? This game is a must. In fact, the whole series is a must. I cannot stress how fantastically beautiful this game is. I don't know what else to say... other than 'recommended'.\n\nEDIT: Having now fully completed the game and the associated DLCs, I plan to write a more detailed review in the near future, for people to see why I regard this as one of the greatest games (and indeed game series) ever made, particularly the story, but not exclusively so (graphics, AI, music et cetera deserves immense praise as well).","timestamp_created":1419639593,"timestamp_updated":1419865293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13623911","author":{"steamid":"76561198024933531","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":754,"last_played":1459020896},"language":"english","review":"It's rare that a game's ending is as moving as Bioshock Infinite's; Even though you can probably guess where it's going it is so well done that it doesn't matter. \n\nThe addition of Elizabeth to the Bioshock formula makes the game much more captivating and immersive than the earlier Bioshock games; It's just not the same in the sections in the game you are separated. It's also nice that they implemented her in a way that doesn't require you to protect her in combat- she stays out of the fight and no one shoots at her so the whole game doesn't turn in to an escort mission.\n\nAs for the game mechanics, it plays very similar to the earlier games in the series with the exception that you can only hold two guns at a time like in the Halo series. That, combined with limitations in ammo availability and enemy scaling towards the end of the game can be a bit frustrating but not enough to really take off for it.\n\nAlthough it isn't really on rails it's not really open world, so you get a more focused story than is possible with a full open world (e.g., think Arkham Asylum versus Arkham City). \n\nThere is no need to have played the earlier Bioshock games to understand anything in here (although there is a reference to the original, which draws attention to the parallels in the two stories, you can still play through and not miss much if you aren't familiar with the older games).\n\nThe city of Columbia is very well done- sort of like Disney World's main street if Walt Disney was an evil bigot with a flying city.  As the game progresses, though, things become a little more dreary and the locations less iconic. Still, the story is what really sells this game- If all you are looking for is a dumb first person shooter than this might not be the game that best meets that need for a little of the old ultra violence. If you want a thinking person's first person shooter, than this one will give you something to think about for a while.\n\nJust a warning- the ending sequence is pretty long; After the last battle there is a lot of non-shooty things that happen, so get comfortable. Also, stick through the credits; It makes the ending that much more poignant.","timestamp_created":1419638095,"timestamp_updated":1419638095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13622610","author":{"steamid":"76561198092365425","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":908,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":908,"last_played":1419626779},"language":"english","review":"My own opinion on this game is that it is good.  Really good.  Not great.  The graphics are amazing, the characters have depth and can be truly toughing at times.  But that leads to the real letdown: the plot.  The plot is not full of holes, but it is disappointing.  Most plots with alternate realities/time-travel do not fully satisfy.  The first two Bioshock games did not delve into these areas too much, but this one embraces all of the impossible elements wholeheartedly...which leaves some things not completely addressed.  I am told that the Burial at Sea expansions (two of them) provide a measure of solace for those who want more of an ending to the story, but this review does not encompass those expansions.  The gameplay is somewhat streamlined and so are many of the maps, which makes sense with a much more linear story...which is another bothersome point.  There is only one ending.  You cannot alter the story in any way.  The choices you make will change nothing.  Is it still fun?  Yes.  Is it still emotionally moving?  Yes.  But the first two Bioshaock games got something right that gamers immediately latched onto: choice.  Making choices in video games gives the player a feeling of ownership over the ending.  In this games, the characters make choices, but the player is really just an observer.  That is somewhat irksome, because the story is essentially about choices.  Having only one ending really undermines that.  Most people gave the game a 9/10 rating, but I am giving it a solid 8/10 for great writing, great visual details, a marvelous immersive quality, and fantastic gameplay.  Being unable to change the story at all and following a linear path through the game, is frustrating and detracts from this being one of the greatest games ever made.  Oddly enough Bioshock 1 and 2 are far better in terms of gameplay and story while Infinite has stonger character development.  Both of the earlier Bioshocks are better games overall in spite of having graphics that have aged with time due to gameplay and story development.  The endings are cathartic, having resulted from choices made throughout the game.  Infinite has no real catharsis.  But it is still fun.","timestamp_created":1419633785,"timestamp_updated":1419633785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13622556","author":{"steamid":"76561198080863794","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":300,"last_played":1481469097},"language":"greek","review":"Fantastic story,graphics,general gameplay and price!","timestamp_created":1419633609,"timestamp_updated":1419633609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13622283","author":{"steamid":"76561198073563479","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":530,"last_played":1478214161},"language":"german","review":"Ich habe lange versucht mich von BioShock Infinite vernzuhalten, da ich eigentlich kein großer Shooter Fan bin!\nAls das Spiel im Sale war musste ich allerdings, aufgrund der großartigen Reviews, zugreifen!\n\nGrafik: \nBioShock ist nicht mehr das allerneuste Spiel, dennnoch ist es mit das best auschauenste, allerdings kann es von den Texturen etc. nicht ganz mit manchen Next-Gen Titeln mithalten. Die 1 1/2 Jahre sieht man ihm dank der Ureal Engine nicht an! 9/10\n\nArt-Design: \nAlle Grafik \"schwächen\" macht das Art-Design mehr als wett! Selten, wenn überhaupt so ein liebe- kunstvoll gestaltetes Spiel gesehen! Die Atmosphäre ist umwerfend schön und unheimlich zugleich! Steampunk der feinsten Art! 10/10\n\nSoundtrack:\nUm es kurz zu machen: Perfekt! Die Musik könnte zu 99% kurz nach der letzten Jahrhundertwende stammen, doch der 1% ist der Teil der sie zur Perfektion treibt! 10/10\n\nGameplay:\nDas Gameplay und die Shooter-Mechanik ist gut! Nicht hervorragend, aber auch nicht schlecht! Kurzum: Man kann es zu größten Teilen genießen! Auf höheren Schwierigkeitsgraden kommt dazu, dass wenig Munition vorhanden ist. Somit seigt die Spannung in den teils langen Shooterpasagen! 7/10\n\nStory und Lore:\n+Charaktäre: In BioShock Infinite kommen nur sehr wenige Charaktäre vor! Man beginnt ohne Kenntnisse über seinen eigenen Charakter, nur mit dem Hinweis man muss ein mysteriöses \"Mädchen\"  finden. Das Mysterium ist generel ein stehter begleiter der Charaktäre und gerade wenn man denkt, man kenne eine Person, kommt man zu einem Wendepunkt. Dieses Mysterium macht die Charaktäre unendlich viel Interessanter, als sie eh schon sind! Stark im Vordergrund steht die Beziehung zwischen den beiden Protagonisten, die excellent herausgearbeitet und tiefgründig ist! 10/10\n\n+Welt: Wunderschön, lieblich doch zugleich Erdrückend! 10/10\n\n+Story: Doe größte Stärke des Spiels! Die vielleicht beste Story die je in Form eines Videospiels übermittelt wurde. Man merkt schnell, dass man ein Mysterium lüften muss, dass irgendwas mit der Protagonisten, dem Antagonisten und der fliegenden Stadt \"Columbia\" zu tun hat. Jedes Wort mehr wäre schon zu viel. 10/10\n\nFazit: Selbst als strickter Shooter-hasser ist das Spiel ein absolutes MUSS, für jeden der Freude an einer komplexen, tiefgründigen, ja sogar intellektuellen Geschichte rund um Relligion und Fanatismus, hat!

The Songbird, holy shit, this massive bird that you see half way through the game is absolutely terrifying! With its loud screech and creepy eyes, it will surely send shivers down you're spine when you meet the Songbird for the first time! The Boy of Silence, one of the most terrifying bits in the game. And especially that bit! (People who have played the game, you know what I mean!)\n\nReturn to Rapture, although you never see Rapture until half way through the game, it makes me happy to see it back once again. Also note that Big Daddies and Little Sisters are non-existent in this game.\n\nThe game does take a dark side to it, the game unlike it predecessor deals with racism, discrimination, extreme religion and very serious and mature hot topics which involves the White race having all the fun whilst the Black race and other \"lowlifes\" that are in the slum areas of Columbia be treated like dirt, which some people may find offensive. Also some people may find the violence to be a little too graphic and may find it disturbing to watch/play\n\nI hardly noticed any glitches or bugs, the only bug I encountered with was half way through the game, whilst rowing to a lighthouse the audio of the rowing paddles with the water were glitching out a bit and making a loud water sound effect muffling all the other voice actors\n\nThis game is absolutely brilliant and it is a big change from what was in BioShock and BioShock 2 and hopefully we may see more of the BioShock series in the near future!\n\nNow, bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt.\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]\n[i] THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!
