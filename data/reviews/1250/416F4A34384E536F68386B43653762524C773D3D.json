This game is really fun, and I enjoy the boss battles at the end of all the waves. What I enjoy the most is how some players may have DLC while others have different DLC; making everyone seem a little more unqiue compared to one another. For instance, you may have a player who likes being that person who makes up their own defenses against zombies and one of the DLC packs has something for someone like that. You may meet someone who likes being a medic so much that they purchase one of the DLC packs with an EMT in it. I really enjoy the personalities and uniqueness this game lets you do and make.","timestamp_created":1413510439,"timestamp_updated":1413510439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12518128","author":{"steamid":"76561198044069403","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1815,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":961,"last_played":1431053198},"language":"english","review":"Makes Cod zombies seem like a walk in the park. 10/10","timestamp_created":1413508628,"timestamp_updated":1413508628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12518073","author":{"steamid":"76561198061250403","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":13553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12523,"last_played":1440187750},"language":"romanian","review":"frumos","timestamp_created":1413508258,"timestamp_updated":1413508258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534391522407531738","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12517941","author":{"steamid":"76561198129095933","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":653,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":653,"last_played":1423410930},"language":"english","review":"wtf gay game!","timestamp_created":1413507448,"timestamp_updated":1485910776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462902247905731201","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12517917","author":{"steamid":"76561198090876133","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3808,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1648222877},"language":"russian","review":"Великолепная игра с неплохой графикой и широким перечнем возможностей.

It's fun, but it's a lineal no brainer.\nKilling floor is a lot more challenging. You can't run. You have to stand your ground until the wave ends. You have to play as a team, otherwise you are fucked.\n\nYou have a variety of weapons and classes- or perks- to choose from, you have to be careful about what you are doing in.

Хм, мне нравится это название! Наверно, надо... ик... рассказать, что это за игра.\n\nНу, сюжет в ней довольно прост: компания из Вас и Ваших друзей... ик... отправляется в Англию, чтобы бухнуть, поржать и вообще отдохнуть как нормальные люди. Однако, по прибитии выясняется, что здешняя группа бомжей и безработных... ик... не довольна таким раскладом. И по ходу вечеринки они будут делать всё возможное, чтобы забрать у Вас ВАШЕ бухло! Ваше же задача... ик... не допустить этого. Несмотря на довольно однообразный геймплей, игра действительно затягивает за счёт большого разнообразия бомжей и средств их усмирения. Пару слов... ик... о бомжах:\n\nБомж обыкновенный - кастрированный мужик-нудист. Угрозы не представляет. Почти.\nОдрорукий бомж - странный мужик с непонятной железкой в руке. Быстро бегает.\nТаракан - маленькая мерзость (друзья Извивайки Ночножука?), которая появляется внезапно и большом количестве. При встрече готовьте дихлофос.\nЖирный - очень толстый бомж. Может представлять угрозу. Иногда.\nПроститутка безработная - так же любит нападать внезапно. Большой угрозы не представляет.\nЖенщина. Просто женщина. Любит подойти в упор и орать под ухо! Причём постоянно, даже если вы ещё не пили.\nЧерти с огнемётом. Опасные гады. Реально опасные. Любят жарить игроков.\nСадист - бомж с бензопилой. Бывший дровосек. С некоторым опозданием, узнав о начале вечеринки, собирается напасть на игроков и забрать бухло себе.\nСтарший дядя - очень опасный бомж, бывший повар. Весьма ранимая личность. Любит обижаться по поводу и без. В обиженом виде способен очень быстро сделать из игроков фарш.\nДядя-нагибатор - лидер бомжей и главный негодяй в игре. Появляется, когда все вышеперечисленные сливаются. Один в состоянии поставить команду игроков раком и забрать всё бухло, испортив вечеринку!\n\nТак же есть куча специнструментов для усмирения всего вышеперечисленного, но перечислять их лень. Просто поверьте, что... ик... игра играется бодро и весело. Хорошая музыка, разнообразная выпивка из разных частей Англии, в общем, всё как надо. Разве что визуальное оформление там не очень, но когда... ик... прийдёт она - Белочка! - вам на мелочи будет плевать, гарантирую.\n\nСтавлю 7 бутылок... ик... из 10.\n\nОтличный симулятор совместной вечеринки с последующей обороной ценного бухла от бомжей!
