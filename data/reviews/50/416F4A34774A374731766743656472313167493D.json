The game puts you in the shoes of Adrian Shephard, a corporal in the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) from the original game. Widely considered one of the best expansion packs of all time, Opposing Force takes the core of the original game and adds more to it, without changing what made the original so appealing. \n\nGameplay: \n\nThe general gameplay of Opposing Force is almost identical to that of the original game, which should come as no surprise considering it's built off the same engine. The primary focus is fast paced but also methodical combat. That being said, there are some new additions to the gameplay, primarily in weapons and new enemies. \nAlthough some weapons such as the MP5, shotgun and RPG make a return, Shephard also gains access to a plethora of new guns. Some replace the weapons from the original, such as the Desert Eagle serving as a replacement to the Magnum Revolver, and a sniper rifle to replace the crossbow. But other weapons are entirely unique, such as the spore launcher, SAW and a barnacle grapple which can attach itself to certain organic surfaces, serving as an alternate means of transportation. This extended roster has bots its strengths and weaknesses. For one, each and every weapon is very fun to use, and gives the player plenty of options in the late game when entering combat scenarios. However, some weapons easily outclass others, such as the SAW making the MP5 practically useless, unless you need to lob a quick grenade.\nThere is also a slew of new enemies called \"Race X\". There's three of these in total: Pit Drones, which are mostly fine. They charge at you and shoot poisonous spikes when far away. Shock Troopers, from whom you get your shock roach. These  guys can dish our a lot of damage very quickly and are a bit too tanky for my liking. The SAW or Spore Launcher are most effective against them. Lastly, we have the Voltigores, who are incredibly powerful and have an attack which can kill you in a single hit. If you have no ammo for the Displacer Cannon (Basically a BFG, one hit kill weapon with splash damage), they will give you a really hard time. \nAll in all, all of the new content, although not always working in the game's favor, makes it stand out from its predecessor whilst keeping the core gameplay elements that made the original game a blast to play. \n\nLevel Design: \n\nCompared to the original, this expansion has 12 chapters, with a boss fight near the end. Unlike the original game, which had a few chapters of questionable quality, I found myself enjoying all that the expansion had to offer in terms of levels. It's cool to see some parts of the Black Mesa Research Facility that Gordon never got to visit in his run. Level design was very fluid and I never got lost even once. It is also nice to see that the developers kept faithful to Half-Life 1's great sense of pacing. There are also some great and memorable set pieces, just like in the original game, even though some ideas are recycles, such as the pit worm chapter being very similar in style to Blast Pit from the original. Unlike the base game, the player is put almost immediately in the action, which is also very welcome, as another train ride would have been tedious to sit through a second time (granted there is a train ride later on, but there is a twist in it). This does not, however, break the pacing of the game, as there is still a very good introduction, albeit it being a lot shorter.  \n\nStory: \n\nThere is a big debate within the community whether or not Opposing Force's story can be considered \"canon\" in the franchise. In my opinion, it is. \nAs stated previously, you are put in the shoes of corporal Adrian Shephard of the HECU, the same unit of marines sent to Black Mesa after the resonance cascade in order to silence the personnel. What's interesting is that, Shephard never receives his orders to silence the science personnel, so it is upt to the player how they want Shephard to be perceived, just like with Gordon Freeman in the base game. \nIt is also great to see nods to the original game, such as the Lamba Complex portal room, where Freeman enters the portal to Xen, or the radio near the end of the \"Forget About Freeman\" chapter. \nSome other things are also explained in Opposing Force, such as the role of the Black Ops in this whole situation. Turns out, they have been sent in to silence the remaining military personnel. Although it may not make a whole lot of sense on the surface, it's still a decent excuse to add a replacement for the HECU marine enemies, as they were the highlight of the original game's combat (The Black Ops soldiers share the same AI as HECU soldiers, since you work with the HECU soldiers this time, obviously). \nWhat's very interesting though, is Race X, the mysterious new alien race. This race used the resonance cascade and dimensional rift to try and invade Earth and take its richest for themselves. Thing is, these guys never make an appearance in the original game, but one could argue that is because by the time Gordon leaves for Xen is when Race X begins its invasion of Earth, which is why he never got to see any of them. Another plot hole is the lack of mention of Race X in the sequel, Half-Life 2, but that can be passed on as the lack of survivors within black mesa by the time Race X begins attacking, which is shortly after the nuking of the facility. \nThroughout the game, the G-Man also makes several cameos, and plays an important role in Adrian's future within the franchise, but I will not spoil anything further. \nThe story might have many plot holes with future installments, but it also has a lot of tie-ins with the original's plot, so it is indeed very debatable if it can be considered canon or not. At the end of the day, it depends on what you choose to believe. \n\nGraphics: \n\nVirtually no advancements have been made in this department. There are some new textures here and there, but even those are very low quality due to the limitations of the engine. Just like with the first game though, this expansion has no problems running on modern machines in 1080p and 60 FPS, though it still shrinks the HUD. \n\nSound: \n\nThis section is also very similar to the original. A lot of the sounds are the same, with only new sounds being for the new aliens and guns, as well as some voice lines of soldiers. Said new sounds do fit the other existing sounds of the game, however, and there is a brand new OST with a heavy militaristic theme, which suits the game's tone very well. \n\nVerdict/Conclusion: \n\nHalf-Life: Opposing Force is what any video game expansion should be: Take the formula that made the original game great, and build on it. Gearbox have managed to expand Half-Life 1's universe in a way that feels natural, add a plethora of new, fun content and keep the same golden standard pacing from the original game. Just like with the first game, I struggle to give this anything lower than a 10/10, and I can confidently recommend this to any Half-Life fan.","timestamp_created":1618957833,"timestamp_updated":1618957833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90647049","author":{"steamid":"76561198171801483","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":693,"last_played":1618952415},"language":"russian","review":"Понравились графика, сюжет...

story of Half-Life: Opposing Force, is that of Adrian Shephard, who is the protagonist as a corporal in the marine corps. Adrian is on a mission to a facility where scientific research takes place. As the story is told, one of the experiments has caused a disturbance, and Adrian and his unit are send in to take control of the situation. During this crisis, Adrian and his unit crash-land at the research site, and are soon caught in a maelstrom of unnatural events, as the area in and around the facility is being used as a focal point into an extra-dimensional reality. The facilities' personnel are presumed to know more about the situation, and during enquiring on their objectives, Adrian and his unit are faced with unknown resistance and other calamitous occurrences, as the corporal drives himself deeper into the unknown.\n\nThe protagonist is to be directly controlled, and the environments are seen from his own perspective. The protagonist can be directly controlled to move through the environments in all directions. He may also lead squads of soldiers. These guys secure the environment, and may follow the protagonist, or stay behind. They may also assist in various other ways, such as creating an entry point, offering medical assistance, or laying down covering fire.\nThe protagonist has access to heavy weaponry and tools, such as explosives, a wrench, and firearms, which he is authorized to use with force against any resistance. He has to find a path through the environments in order to defend and contact his unit.\n\nThe protagonist is an athletic individual; he may for example climb and swing by using a rope. This is useful, because he has to navigate through a hazardous world, that is tough to survive in, and offers little security, and contain many environmental obstacles. Luckily, there are drill instructors available at boot camp, who assist in training the protagonist. Progress may also be saved at any moment.\nA green coloured heads-up display, night vision, a wrench, and a heavy pistol, are also available. These work well in tandem with the protagonist's precise aiming and shooting controls.\nSquad members and adversaries give away status information, have banter, and interact with the environment.\nHalf-Life: Opposing Force, forms part of a non-chronological trilogy that is Half-Life, and grants another perspective on what happened at the research facility.\n\n\nThis smoking image shows two squad members:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2457941277","timestamp_created":1618540433,"timestamp_updated":1631218821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90353095","author":{"steamid":"76561199051530128","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":917,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":844,"last_played":1623381323},"language":"brazilian","review":"[b]Melhor expansão de Half-life[/b]","timestamp_created":1618496566,"timestamp_updated":1618496566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90346049","author":{"steamid":"76561198122640554","num_games_owned":286,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1618352293},"language":"english","review":"This game adds so much to the Half Life world, I loved every second of it.

It's short and sweet and I would've easily paid for more content. The soundtrack is excellent, really makes you pumped for battle or cautious depending on the track and the situation. The new weapons are an absolute treat, my favorite being the M249 Light Machine Gun. You know it packs a punch when it sends you flying backwards. I never found the game to be frustratingly difficult. It was hard at points, but not to the point where I'd rage-quit. The different types of soldiers you can command are really neat. I found the medic to be a vital asset to certain parts of the game. A lot of people find the rope swinging mechanics to be absolutely abominable and hard to use, I disagree. I find the rope swinging to be abominable, at least in the way of rope physics, but I don't find it too difficult to use. I can swing from rope to rope quite easily. The Shock Troopers were quite a challenge to defeat, I found myself constantly dying to them but I eventually overcame them with the help of the Spore Launcher among other weapons. \n\nI truly find Half-Life: Opposing Force to be one of the best Half-Life experiences out there.

я прошел Half-Life: Blue Shift и эту игру, что могу о ней сказать сказать?[/h1]\nЕсли вы не знакомы с серией вообще, то можете прочитать мои обзоры на оригинальный [b]Half-Life[/b] и [b]Half-Life: Blue Shift[/b] чтобы понять что к чему. Я могу отличить эту игру тем что тут не такой интересный сюжет как в вышеперечисленных играх, но я все-же рекомендую в это поиграть, т.к. здесь гораздо круче геймплейная составляющая, сам левел-дизайн, как по мне, графика также немного улучшена и в целом приятно посмотреть на игру с другой стороны конфликта. \"коктейль\" из трех этих частей создаст у вас лучшее представление о произошедшем в черной Мезе и каждая игра по-своему хороша, оригинал хронометражом, сюжетом и шутерной составляющей, [b]Blue Shift[/b] имеет интересный геймплей и как по-моему, лучший сюжет, а [b]Opposing Force[/b] имеет лучший геймплей и раскрывает события со стороны военных, ведь они во время событий игры сами не понимали, зачем и куда они направляются.\nПрохождение заняло у меня около 4 часов и 40 минут, но у вас на это уйдет больше, т.к. я сомневаюсь что вы будете решать головоломки также быстро как я. \n[b]Геймплей.[/b] тут появилаось очень много новых врагов и оружий + новые механики и 2 босс-файта. Всем рекомендую поиграть, т.к. это очень интересная игра.\n[b]А теперь вкратце о сюжете и что вообще происходит.[/b] [spoiler] Вы - Рядовой Шепард, летите с военными в вертолете, не понимая вообще куда и зачем, вертолет падает, вы пытаетесь пробиваться через множество новых, в рамках серии, тварей из Зена. Позже вы встречаете оперативников из Black Ops, которые в первой части оглушили и пытались убить в прессе Гордона, те самые люди, пару раз вы встречаете других военных и вместе с ними пробиваетесь к зоне эвакуации, но когда вы приходите к вертолету, двери ангара закрываются прямо у вас перед лицом, к вам подойдет G-Man, посмотрит на вас и уйдет. После этого вы спускаетесь в черную мезу и пробиваетесь через оперативников в зоне Черной Мезы где изучали фауну Зена, там вы повстречаете много интересного и нового, а также пару живых \"оружий\" из Зена. Вы находите какой-то странный портал, оттуда вылезает огромная тварь. В последствии вы ее убиваете, это был финальный босс, потом телепортируетесь к Джи-Мену в вертолет, он с вами поболтает, поблагодарит за выполнение грязной работы и отправит \"туда, где мы точно будем уверены что вы нам не сможете навредить\" и игра заканчивается пустотой, черным экраном, и страшными звуками.[/spoiler]\n[b]В целом сюжет классный[/b], но не поразил меня как сюжет в [b]Blue Shift[/b]. Если спойлеры не отбили желание играть, то желаю приятной игры. Эту игру не стоит пропускать, не смотря на ее возраст.\nОбзор, не считая спойлера, очень краткий, т.к. особо про игру нечего сказать, она схожа по игровому процессу с оригиналом, все отличия и интересные детали я отметил.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1618048414,"timestamp_updated":1618048414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.410340309143066406","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90041938","author":{"steamid":"76561198872297642","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1162,"last_played":1618860235},"language":"english","review":"It's a good DLC, the athmosphere is somewhat different than in the original but in a good way.","timestamp_created":1618025184,"timestamp_updated":1618025184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90026965","author":{"steamid":"76561198202999986","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":281,"last_played":1586549273},"language":"turkish","review":"Ana oyunun güzel bir yan oyunu.
