Im zweiten Teil wacht Chell, die Protagonistin, nach einiger Zeit aus einem Hyperschlaf auf, nachdem sie von der gewaltigen Explosion in Teil 1 völlig weggetreten ist.\n\nZu Beginn versucht Wheatly, eine der beiden KIs, uns aus der Anlage rauszuholen, führt uns aber direkt ins Gehirn von GLADoS, die KI welche wir im ersten Teil vernichten mussten, und lässt sie uns wieder reaktivieren.\n\nAlles scheint wie früher doch nachdem wir GLADoS ein weiteres Mal besiegt haben übernimmt Wheatly die Anlage und stellt sich gegen uns.\n\nDurch diesen Plot-Twist bekommt das Spiel nochmal einen ordentlichen Spannungs-Boost was mich dann insgesamt auf 7/10 Punkte bringt.\n\n\n[h1]Das Gameplay:[/h1]\n\nZur Bewältigung des Spiel haben wir exakt 2 Waffen zur Verfügung: Unser Gehirn und eine Portal-Waffe.\nDurch geschickte Platzierung von Portalen müssen wir uns durch verschiedene sogenannte Testkammern kämpfen.\n\nIch bin allgemein ein riesen Puzzle-Game Fan und habe von eben dieser Sorte schon einige Spiele gespielt.\nDoch Portal bietet eine Menge Features, die andere Spiele aus diesem Genre nicht bieten.\nAlles in allem ist es die beste Kombination aus Platformer und Puzzle-Game, die ich je gesehen habe.\n\nFür das Gameplay gebe ich satte 9/10 Punkte.\n\n\n[h1]Meine Bewertung:[/h1]\n\n[b]Pro[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Zusätzlicher CO-OP\n[*]Volle Controller-Unterstützung\n[*]Einfach bedienbarer Level-Editor\n[*]Hintergrunderzählungen zu \"Aperture Science\"\n[/list]\n\n[b]Kontra[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Teilweise zu einfache Level\n[*]Die Story endet :P\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Mein Fazit:[/h1]\n\nDas Spiel ist insgesamt betrachtet für mich eine absolut sichere 9/10.

It really depends on how much you explore and try to piece it all together, which is something I love in a game.\n-GLaDos once again brings all her lovable charm along with other new characters that make me appreciate the Portal series even more.\n-Valve does something I wish other game companies would: \"If it ain't broke don't fix it.\" The gameplay of Portal is it's crowning achievement and not only did Valve keep it same from the first Portal, they perfected and improved it. \n- Co-op is something that I always thought would be perfect for Portal and Valve did not dissappoint. You haven't truely completed Portal 2 until you've played co-op, it is amazing. \n\nCons:\n-While I do love the subtle mysteries in the story, I do wish the game would expand on them more. Sometimes I feel like there are so many unanswered questions that it's frustrating. \n\nOverall:\nPortal 2 does exactly what I think sequels should always do: be better than the first one. Which is something incredible that Valve has achieved since the first Portal was so good. Portal 2 is a wonderful experience that combines a serious plot with super fun gameplay and the wonderful characters put a bow on top of it all. Not only is the single player great, but the co-op is equally as good. \n\nPlease, do yourself a favor and play Portal 2. (And the first one too) \n\nRating:

You don't realize it, but you just start thinking and making new uses of the portals while they also teach you the mechanics (in the singleplayer) if you didn't get it.\n\nThe game's one of the best multiplayer puzzlers out there, so go grab the 2-pack and redirect lasers at your friends.","timestamp_created":1454563779,"timestamp_updated":1454563779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20944601","author":{"steamid":"76561198166047091","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1622860350},"language":"english","review":"I highly suggest this game.

Richtig gutes Spiel, Story nice, Spielprinzip nice... Nur was mich ein wenig gestört hatte, war das 4. Kapitel (aufgrund des Storymangels und den meist nervigen Tests) und teilweise das 8., besten Kapitel sind das 6. und das 7. Kapitel (meiner Meinung nach).","timestamp_created":1454461709,"timestamp_updated":1454461709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20922076","author":{"steamid":"76561198175909843","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":15964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1009,"last_played":1658284679},"language":"english","review":"AWESOME WORK GUYS i love this game","timestamp_created":1454457767,"timestamp_updated":1454457785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20921592","author":{"steamid":"76561198120765573","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1653543236},"language":"english","review":"Pretty fun if you got a friend to play with","timestamp_created":1454455732,"timestamp_updated":1454455732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20921574","author":{"steamid":"76561198054113799","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":583,"last_played":1454765647},"language":"polish","review":"Grałem w pierwszy Portal od razu po premierze w 2008. Od tego czasu przestałem grać w gry komputerowe sprzęt się zestarzał przesiadłem się na Macbooki. W Portala 2 zagrałem dopiero teraz w 2016 roku wpadając przypadkowo na niego w sklepie Steam. Nie sądziłem że teraz może coś tak bardzo przykuć mnie do ekranu. Ta gra jest absolutnie fenomenalna, świeża, wymagająca IQ wyższego niż temperatura pokojowa i piekielnie wciąga. W całym klimatycznym uniwersum jesteśmy tylko sami z dwoma robotami których dialogi są prześmiewcze, placówka Aperture ma doskonały klimat i jest świetnie zaprojektowana. Portalowe i żelowe zagadki są świetne a ich rozwiązywanie sprawia dużo frajdy. Grafika w ogóle się nie postarzała i czasami potrafiła mnie zaskoczyć. Gra bez problemu działa na Windowsie 10. Nie sądziłem że można zrobić sequel lepszy pod każdym względem lepszy od pierwowzoru. Jeśli nie grałeś w Portala 1 albo nie podobał Ci się odpuść ten tytuł jeśli na tekst \"Cake Is a Lie\" przypominają Ci się wszystkie obelgi GlaDOS'a to zapewniam - będziesz zachwycony.","timestamp_created":1454455667,"timestamp_updated":1454455667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20921569","author":{"steamid":"76561198076151407","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1456674190},"language":"brazilian","review":"Historia do jogo é muito bem elaborada, as mecanicas funcionam muito bem de acordo com historia. s dialogos do jog parecem de filme top, e ainda possui puzzles divertidissimos e que vão te deixar horas para resolver.Alem disso tem o modo coop que com um amigo fica sensacional","timestamp_created":1454455647,"timestamp_updated":1454455647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20920535","author":{"steamid":"76561198272929242","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2048,"last_played":1617079714},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de los mejores juegos Puzzle de toodos los tiempos \n\n\n\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1454451160,"timestamp_updated":1454451160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20916555","author":{"steamid":"76561198254953947","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1856,"last_played":1656105934},"language":"turkish","review":"Mükemmel bir valve oyunu 10/10","timestamp_created":1454438473,"timestamp_updated":1454438473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40rvS0dICe5TlTw=="}
