The only sort of tie-in has to be bought for $30, forcing any player to have to pay at  least $35 to get the full experience (not including the other dlc only including the Burial at Sea episodes). Anyways, the tears and such are great and fabulous yaddayadda but it's all very open. Basically the series goes from tight spaces, nooks, and crannies, to open, fresh air and not a drop of water that could come crashing through glass at any second. I get it's supposed to be a prequel but come on, it has very little to do with the first 2 games. No tight spaces, no freakishly weird maniacs to fight. The game's new functions are fun and helpful, but it still has nothing brought from the first and second except maybe a few select mechanics. The grabber/melee weapon (whatever you want to call it) helps a bit in battle but soon after beginning the game, that thing basically becomes useless as a melee weapon. Being forced to beat some guy with that thing 7-15 times is just boring and wastes time. The game was overall loads of fun, and the storyline didn't seem to have any sort of inconsistensies, probably because of the fact that you entered a tear every few hours of gameplay. Anyways, the story is very well made, however the ending is very rushed, it's almost like you're forced to try and understand 32 things at once. The ending only really makes sense after thinking about it quite a bit. Also, there are no choices to make, the game is extremely linear. The game really falls through with all the lovable things about the other 2 Bioshock games, basically throwing the mechanics and storyline from those 2 out of a window and into a dumpster. If the 2 Burial at Sea episodes weren't so dam expensive I wouldn't even be talking about this right now. Overall: 7/10 due to the lack of anything Bioshock, Bioshock 2, and Rapture.","timestamp_created":1402713000,"timestamp_updated":1402713000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10465593","author":{"steamid":"76561197986228817","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":3677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1627,"last_played":1588703421},"language":"english","review":"Interesting idea,nice story","timestamp_created":1402712955,"timestamp_updated":1402712955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10465291","author":{"steamid":"76561197987263380","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1605407962},"language":"english","review":"this game blew my mind. completely.
