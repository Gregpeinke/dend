It's an extraordinarily nice hallway, which houses beautiful art design, deeply disturbed characters, and a strange twisting story. But after playing through, those feel like they exist to mask the severe lack of good gameplay and player choices.\n\nKudos to Irrational games for creating a genuinely novel game setting and working to advance the medium, but for every step forward here there is an equally major step backward. If you enjoy FPS titles, you'll be totally underwhelmed by the weapons and combat; if you enjoy puzzles you won't be challenged; if you enjoy RPGs you'll be thoroughly disappointed by the lack of choices; and if you like stealth, well they based the the final DLC around stealth but it's a frustrating mess that could only be suffered by masochists.\n\nThe art, level design, and voice acting are fantastic, so in that sense it's still quite an adventure... an extremely linear adventure. Y'know, like a movie, except occasionally interrupted by backtracking or restarting the last 20 minutes of your session.\n\nSo go watch someone else play though Bioshock Infinite and you'll squeeze out virtually every ounce of possible enjoyment. The developers didn't actually include any good reason to play it for yourself.","timestamp_created":1460426902,"timestamp_updated":1460427698,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478082954883575439","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22366753","author":{"steamid":"76561198117405888","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":795,"last_played":1622344477},"language":"spanish","review":"muy buen jugo trama y la historia perfecta para jugarlo varias veces","timestamp_created":1460425336,"timestamp_updated":1460425336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22362639","author":{"steamid":"76561198037572331","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2,"last_played":1516144194},"language":"english","review":"Great game, great story , great visuals a must have game in my eyes 😀","timestamp_created":1460407589,"timestamp_updated":1460407589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22361775","author":{"steamid":"76561198140048612","num_games_owned":512,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":4928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2838,"last_played":1641434178},"language":"english","review":"Minecraft is much better\n\n\n\n(JKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJKJK).

I've heard that some people find the combat fun, but I do not. The reason is simple: I play everything on the hardest difficulty from the beginning, but BioShock simply raises enemy health and damage, which is frustrating. If you play on lower levels of difficulty, it's too easy, but higher levels require more bullets and more spells rather than more skill. Any combat system that requires more than one headshot to kill a human enemy is a combat system I will not enjoy.\n\nEven so, it's easy to recommend any of the BioShock games, just don't bother raising the difficulty.","timestamp_created":1460305504,"timestamp_updated":1460305504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22342312","author":{"steamid":"76561198085345844","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1451050889},"language":"russian","review":"K R A C U B O\nКрасивое продолжение не менее красивой игры в которой вам предстоит умопомрочительное путшествие с не менее умопомрочительной девушкой Elizabeth вместе с котрой вы будете взлетать на вершину мира и падать в яму хуже ада=)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/itisaChrismas","timestamp_created":1460304740,"timestamp_updated":1460304740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22342144","author":{"steamid":"76561197960960793","num_games_owned":316,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1413,"last_played":1406405857},"language":"english","review":"To the point reviews:\n\nDid not enjoy it.

Elizabeth and Booker will never have a relationship as pure as Eleven and Mike. Mike really became himself again when he reunited with El. I’ve watched the new season like twice now and it has been out for 3 days. It makes me want to be in the show and I get so sad when I remember that this show is not real life. After I watched it, I actually looked up how to audition for Stranger Things. You never know, they might need new characters for season three! Plus, I love acting. I REALLY hope there is a new season. How can a show be this freaking good??!! When I finished it, I was so shocked and I didn’t want to watch any other show because I know that none of them will amount to how good this show is. Even when I tried to watch another show, I was like, “Nope, this isn’t Stranger Things”, and I would shut it off. Stranger Things is - and always will be - my favorite show EVER. Plus, shout-out to all the people who went to the bathroom after this, looked at themselves in the mirror, and pretended to be in the show 😂. Or maybe that was just me. My family is not nearly as obsessed with this show as I am, and no one I talk to seems to really love the show (how can they not???) as much as I do. This show has seriously got me tripped up and I never want it to end. I am literally so emotional about it. It’s like it’s REAL LIFE, yah know? But when I see all the kids from the show on tv and YouTube videos talking about making Stranger Things, I’m like, “Oh, it’s not real, and they don’t actually have those lives”😔. I’m way too obsessed. Props to you if you made it to the end of my comment. No one I know feels the same about this show as I do, but if you do, TALK TO ME!! Tell me what you guys think! Start a convo! Share with me your obsessions and questions because quite frankly, I am DYING to talk to somebody about this show who feels the same about it as I do.

Literally, because you get to be outside much of the time :).\nFor most of the game, you won't be alone. Your companion, Elizabeth, certainly deserves a separate paragraph. As far as game characters go, she is one of the best I've ever seen. The acting represented by both voice and animation is superb and the character itself is quite deep and interesting.\nDuring your adventure, various weapons and powers (vigors) will be available to you.\nWeapon variability is decent, though not staggering. I got the impression that in the end it matters very little what weapons you use (you can only carry two at a time) because they can all become quite powerful through upgrades. I'm not saying a rocket launcher is the same as a sniper rifle, of course. This can be both good and bad. Good because you can choose weapons based on your playstyle (for example machine gun X rifle) and if the two weapons compliment each other well you won't have to change your mind later. Bad because you probably won't have enough money to upgrade more weapons if you do change your mind. But that's a minor thing that you can certainly plan for.\nThe vigor powers are, well, OK. I ended up using only two or three of the supporting ones. For attacking you're mostly fine using weapons.\nThe final thing I'd like to mention is the story. Even though it's not very original and doesn't actually make sense :), it's presented is such a way that I didn't really care and thoroughly enjoyed it.\nOverall great game, highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1460203774,"timestamp_updated":1460203774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22315347","author":{"steamid":"76561198132848419","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":582,"last_played":1460193971},"language":"english","review":"From start to finish this game is absolutely amazing, from the gameplay to the storyline.\n\nThey polished the gameplay a bit in comparison to the first two BioShock games (less backtracking and more satisfying combat) but kept the feeling of a BioShock game.

Contrairement aux autres jeux, Dewitt parle et dialogue, campé par un acteur impliqué, et le personnage est, comme dans tous les Bioshocks, assez attachant. \n\nRendez - vous à Columbia, ville volante ayant fait sécession d'avec le reste des Etat - Unis depuis plusieurs années déjà, dirigée par le prophète auto - proclamé Comstock. Sorte de miroir de la citée de Rapture, non pas gouvernée par une idéologie ultralibérale (Bioshock 1) ou socialo-paternaliste (Bioshock 2), mais par une théocratie raciste et eugéniste. En effet derrière les lumineux ensembles flotants de la ville, se cache une gangrène révélée étape par étape au fil du jeu. Le personnage d'Elizabeth, très expressive et animée reste indissociable du jeu et l'incarne bien plus que votre personnage. Et je n'en dirai pas plus : ).\n\nLe jeu est magnifique de par sa bande - son et sa direction artistique, et reprend dignement le flambeau de ses prédécesseurs. Le changement de décor est bienvenu et reste fidèle au deux premiers jeu par un style rétro - fantaisiste de toute beauté. Les environnements sont plus variés et contrairement à Rapture, la vie bat son plein dans la cité. On pourra par exemple choisir de jouer profil bas à certains moments et traverser ces segments sans tuer qui que ce soit :p.\n\nLe scénario est toujours un point fort des Bioshocks, et je n'ai pas été déçu. Connaissant bien la série, je m'attendais à un / deux twists, mais là, il faut reconnaître qu'un effort considérable d'écriture a été fait, à un niveau comme j'en ai rarement vu dans un jeu vidéo ou sur d'autres médias. Je vous conseille de refaire le jeu afin de vous rendre compte à quel point chaque réplique, situation, ou apparition inexpliquée au premier abord fait sens et se fond dans l'intrigue. Le dénouement final est obsédant, et fait partie de ceux auxquels on repense dans les jours qui suivent.\n\nJ'ose cependant formuler une critique au sujet du rythme du jeu. L'exposition, si vous prenez le temps de tout contempler, s'étale sur presque une heure de jeu ! Là où les premiers Bioshocks savaient alterner les phases d'actions avec les phases plus passives, l'équilibre ici est assez instable. Certains niveaux sont entièrement dédiés aux combats, par exemple.\n\nLa gestion des combats est bonne, mais je la trouve inférieure à celle des précédents. Irationnal Games semble avoir plus de mal à configurer des niveaux de grande taille. Les boss sont classiques mais certains peuvent être assez frustrants pour peu que vous ayez fait les mauvais choix d'infusions (pas assez de vie / de cristaux). Ne vous méprenez pas, cela reste d'un excellent niveau, mais le génie est ici un peu en retrait.\n\nCôté gameplay, on retrouve le combo sort / armes à feu avec quelques ajustements, comme la possibilité de poser des pièges à l'aide de la magie. Côté nouveautés sont à signaler :\n-Les rails, qui rendent les combats extrêmement dynamiques dans des zones bien plus grandes.\n-La possibilité d'exploiter l'environnement en y \"invoquant\" des éléments pour vous aider. \n-Les nouveaux ennemis (blindés, handyman, snipers, patriotes).\nLes vita - chambres ont disparu, mais ont été remplacées par un système similaire.\n\nJe dois également, en ayant encore les Bioshock 1 et 2 en tête, faire la cruelle comparaison de leur gameplay. \n- Je ne comprend pas pourquoi l'inventaire a été limité à seulement deux armes dans Infinite. Avait - ont besoin de sacrifier cet élément pour introduire de la cohérence dans un Bioshock. J'ai trouvé que cela n'incitait le joueur pas à varier son gameplay, d'autant que les munitions abondent en général. D'autant que les améliorations des armes ne sont plus manifestement visibles sur celle - ci, ce qui gâche un peu le sentiment de progression, bien plus marqué dans le premier. \n- Pour une raison qui m'échappe, le système de vêtements, censé remplacer les plasmides passifs, est très limité mais reste frustrant car ses effets sont très limités (quatre emplacement contre plusieurs dizaines avant !) Pourquoi, au nom de Zeus, ne pas avoir introduit des vêtements nivelés dans les distributeurs du jeu ? Ou encore de pouvoir équiper Elizabeth ? Voir cette dimension du gameplay à ce point restreinte est vraiment dommage.\n\nLieu différent et scenario à niveaux de lecture obligent, la récolte d'Adam n'est évidement pas de la partie, mais a été remplacé par des quêtes bateaux qui souvent justifient des allez - retours pour gonfler la durée de vie du jeu. Même constat pour certains segments de l'histoire. On passe ainsi à une grosse dizaine d'heures. La fin ici est unique, mais reste à tomber par terre.\n\nJ'ai beaucoup d'affection pour la saga et pour cet opus, que je recommande évidement, que vous commenciez la série par celui - ci ou bien que vous soyez un habitué. Comme ses prédécesseurs, il est fun, immersif, intense, et exotique. Son scénario le place en au dessus de ses prédécesseurs mais son gameplay reste en deçà de ses aînés et pour ce dernier point je le trouve moins mémorable que les autres. Je pense que mon préféré reste le second, avec le recul.\n\nAppréciation personnelle : 17/20\n\nLes deux extensions \"Tombeau sous - marin\" valent le coup si vous avez terminé les trois jeux. Ils proposent de faire le lien entre Rapture et Columbia et ont un réel intérêt scénaristique.\n\nUn grand merci à Irationnal games pour cette dernière petite merveille.\n\n*Avis de 2013 édité en 2016","timestamp_created":1459968443,"timestamp_updated":1459968751,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22273339","author":{"steamid":"76561198103625098","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":490,"last_played":1479269569},"language":"english","review":"Best single player game ever.","timestamp_created":1459967853,"timestamp_updated":1459967853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22271243","author":{"steamid":"76561198149849355","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":729,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1508867803},"language":"russian","review":"Сюжет ОГОНЬ!!!!!","timestamp_created":1459959316,"timestamp_updated":1459959316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522293031215667725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22270252","author":{"steamid":"76561198061918842","num_games_owned":351,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":611,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":611,"last_played":1459954710},"language":"english","review":"Holy mother of endings.\nNot a perfect game, but one that entertains you.
