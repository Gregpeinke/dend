Шикарнейшая игра! Очень сожалею что не играл в нее раньше(( Теперь тоже жду 3-ю часть))) \nИз плюсов можно отметить приятный гемплей, простота управления, интересная сюжетная линия, отличный саундтрэк, атмосфера и динамика игры на протяжении всего прохождения.\nИз минусов быстро заканчивается (около 15 часов игры затратил, хотелось бы побольше насладиться этим шедевром), мало рассказывают о предыстории и вводят в курс происходящих событий (не очень понятно что? где? и когда?), самое прикольное оружие выпало в конце(((\nОценка 10/10.

Ainda assim, achei (do que entendi) a história bem interessante. A jogabilidade é meio tensa de vez em quando (é horrível pra sair das escadas pra alguma plataforma), mas nada espantoso pra um jogo de 2004.\nAinda sendo antigo, o jogo tem gráficos lindos, e efeitos de luz muito bem elaborados. O jogo é leve o suficiente para rodar no máximo no meu PC (Com core i3) quase sem lag (só mostrando lag com algum efeito de fumaça mesmo).

Честно, больше похоже, что это вообще две разные игры: здесь вообще не чувствуется атмосфера первой части ( хоть первая часть и просто шутан, но своя атмосфера там была ) и здесь нас связывает со своим предшественником только монтировка и ГГ. Откинув вопрос об связи с первой части, мы имеем снова тот же шутер, только на этот раз даже вооружения оригинального нет - типичные винтовки с гранатами ( да, был слив Беты и многий контент пришлось менять, но все же это не освобождает разработчиков), а еще здесь есть места с логическими задачками при использовании физики, правда их любой школьник-неуч может решить.\n\nСюжет\nВо второй части его добавили чуть больше, но он так и остался не расскрыт полностью. Его просто подали нарезками, которые фанаты по сей день пытаются склеить во что-то непонятное. Все тот же молчаливый герой, молчание которого уже сделали фишкой и все та же его бессмертность, благодаря которой он выносит всю базу внеземной цивилизации к чертям. \n\nГеймплей\nНедалеко ушел от первой части - \"экшона\" как такового нет, толпы тупых противников, которые не научились прятатся в укритиях, а только кидать гранаты мимо окна. Единственное достойное внимания - карты с транспортом, где хоть какое-то чувство удовольствия от игры получить можно. Во всем остальном - тир с убогим набором оружия\n\nSource\nИ опять Valve создали хороший движок, но не игру.
