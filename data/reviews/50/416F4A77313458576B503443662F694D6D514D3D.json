Because it was made by a different dev team I just assumed it wouldn't match the fun that the original Half Life delivered. I was still expecting a good time though, and Opposing Force rose above my expectations. It's a fairly lengthy campaign about Adrian Shepard, a Marine who arrives at Black Mesa shortly after the Resonance Cascade. You are given a variety of new tools to mess around with. Most of them are great fun. I especially enjoyed travelling to Xen for supplies with the Displacer Cannon. It isn't flawless, as expected. The Barnacle Grapple is clunky and useless in combat, and the rope function is interchangeable with ladders.

Opposing Force brings new weapons, enemies, and mechanics (ROPES! IT HAS CLIMBABLE ROPES!) very good.

It came out during the \"Golden Age\" of PC gaming and added a new single-player campaign that is the size of approximately 1/3 of the original game.\n- It features several new weapons, a few new enemy types, new maps to play through.\n\n- A few FIXES worth mentioning are: \n1. Mouse glitch fix - go to OPTIONS, in the MOUSE submenu be sure to check \"Mouse Raw Input\"\n2. Field Of View fix - by pressing tilde (~) on your keyboard during gameplay you'll bring up the console; there type in \"default_fov 90\" and change the 90 with 100 or 110.\n\n- Be sure to check out \"Operation Black Mesa\" which is a remake of Half Life Opposing Force.
