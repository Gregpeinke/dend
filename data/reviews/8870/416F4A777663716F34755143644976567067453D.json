It reminds me a bit of Fallout 4 with the combat, which is very fun. Sound effects are very pleasing to the ears and the visuals are STUNNING. I am running this on a laptop with low settings and I literally couldn't tell when I started up the game that the graphics were on low. Being an old game though it has it's flaws, a term that I am using losely, and that is mostly in the animation. It seems as if none of the game is in motion capture but just strictly computer animation, which is fine by me but for others it may prove to be unimmersive. Another weird nit pick of mine is the animation for the mouths, the characters when the say anything with \"oh\" their mouth looks really weird and contorts in a weird way but it's not anything big.

Bioshock Infinite made me break this pattern.\n\nThis game is as close to perfection as any game could ever come. The story is so good and well thought out that I wish it were a book, the gameplay has its flaws, but I find that most games do, it has stunning views and a superb design, albeit quite creepy in the later stages. Of course, I can't talk about this game's strong points without mentioning the incredible character development. One minute I'm rooting for a character, the next I want to send a bunch of killer crows their way.\n\nHaving just finished this game, I am perhaps a bit enthusiastic about it. But you will be too. It's the kind of game that you just want to keep playing, not (only) because of that area you can't seem to kill your way through, but because you need to know what happens next.
