comfortable calling Portal 2 a timeless classic. It’s one of those lightning-in-a-bottle video games that came out at a unique time and helped define a moment in gaming.\n\nIf you’re somehow under a rock and have never played the Portal series, it is definitely worth playing the prequel before this, but that prequel lasts about three hours at best. You don’t need to, though, and can dive in straight here if you’re feeling saucy.\n\nThe moment-to-moment gameplay is punctuated by well written humor alongside Valve’s excellent pacing, and it all comes together in a notoriously awesome package. It’s tough to say anything bad about Portal 2, even years later it still plays well, and I honestly can’t think of a negative for this game. I guess it doesn’t alt-tab cleanly, it’s from that ugly build of source, but that’s about it.\n\nAlongside the singleplayer, there’s a cooperative mode with a unique campaign storyline, and you can download maps and campaigns off the steam workshop to play through. The coop campaign is, indeed, a canon story, and worth checking out if you can find a friend to play with. Workshop maps vary in quality, as is expected.","timestamp_created":1588053255,"timestamp_updated":1588053255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68158253","author":{"steamid":"76561198195892298","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":3071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2639,"last_played":1639975055},"language":"english","review":"Good puzzle game and story.

The history you find out about her is really nice too. Wheatley is really nice too, i think Stephen merchant was a really good choice in voice actor. Both characters are really well put together and i was never left thinking they were just 2D throw away characters.The level designs are really well put together and original for the most part. The levels need creative thinking but don't demand too much. It's a very good line between difficult yet accomplishable. (I haven't played portal one yet so i don't know if they recycled much) The ending is really cool too and uses a lot of cool mechanics and requires a little creativity. There's a song at the end, its really good. This game overall left me with a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment, which i really haven't felt with too many games in recent times. This game deserves your time even if you aren't much of a puzzle person.","timestamp_created":1588043349,"timestamp_updated":1588818297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68153833","author":{"steamid":"76561198847953767","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1594091713},"language":"schinese","review":"非常好玩，相对1来说并没有太让人眼前一亮，却也是一款玩一款少一款的好游戏","timestamp_created":1588042855,"timestamp_updated":1588042855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68153794","author":{"steamid":"76561198810533926","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1986,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1269,"last_played":1654329679},"language":"koreana","review":"어렸을때 꼭하ㅏ고싶었는데 재밌음 하지만 친구가없는 나에게는 2인용을 못함 온라인으로하면 검나 느림","timestamp_created":1588042795,"timestamp_updated":1588042795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68153546","author":{"steamid":"76561198821732462","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":894,"last_played":1618288742},"language":"english","review":"The dialogue is AMAZING.

[/h1]\n\nWell, I bought this (along with Portal 1) back in July of 2012 on a Steam summer sale. It only took me 8 years to finally complete this game. I think I enjoyed Portal 1 more, but I only played the single player mode for this game. I never got a chance to play co-op, mostly because I'm kind of anti-social. That was part of the reason for the delay. Kept thinking I'd have a nerdy gf to play this with someday. Well, now with Covid-19 and social distancing, there's no better time to forget couch co-op and just play single player mode!\n\nStill, the single player mode was challenging. I really had to rack my brains for a few of the puzzles. I especially liked the cinematic scenes where you still used the logic from the regular puzzle problems in the outside world. It was a nice break from the normal puzzles and kept the game from getting stale. \n\nI enjoyed the story. I think this story was better overall than Portal 1. I definitely had no idea where it going. It has the same type of humor from the first. It took me 14 hours to complete the game. However, a lot of that was spent experimenting with different injectors because I did want to play this game in VR (but never found a satisfactory solution). \n\nAfter playing Portal Stories, I wish this game did have a VR mod. I don't play too many pancake games, but this is a classic. If you enjoy puzzle games, this is a must buy. Even if you don't enjoy puzzle games, this game may change your mind.\n\n[b]Rate 9/10.
