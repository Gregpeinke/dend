This one will talk exclusively about the main game, while I'll write reviews for each of the DLCs. So, on to the review!\n\nWhat should I talk about first? I guess gameplay would be an important factor. In BioShock Infinite, the combat feels more frenetic; so to speak. Rather than focusing on exploration like the previous games, you'll usually move from one combat arena to the other; not literally, of course, there will be moments where you're free to explore a bit, but the game still feels pretty combat oriented. Not that it's something bad, considering that, in my opinion, the combat in this game is pretty good, with lots of options to dispatch enemies; from the different weapons, to the Vigors (Infinite's version of Plasmids), and Elizabeth's Tears. If there's something I'd complain about, though, is the fact that you're limited to carrying two weapons at the same time. Somewhat disappointing, but the variety of Vigors (and Vigor Combos) more than makes up for this. Also, the Sky-Hook is a great addition, allowing you to quickly move through certain areas, while also working as a melee weapon. Finally, there's the Tears. Elizabeth, who will be your companion for most of the game, can open them to bring things to help you out during combat, which is quite useful.\n\nAs for the story, well, it's pretty good in my opinion. It starts out somewhat \"normal\"; you're a guy sent to the city of Columbia to rescue a certain girl, but as it progresses, it gets more and more complex, in a good way. The characters are all pretty well written in my opinion, and a particular mention goes to the Lutece twins. Their dialogue always cracks me up a bit. Some people might feel that the main character, Booker, feels like a \"regular\" hero; you know, guy with a dark past, atoning for his sins, etc. Well, I'd say that's because, while being the playable character, Booker isn't the main character. The main character would be Elizabeth, and when you play through the game, it kinda makes sense. The story isn't about Booker's trip to Columbia, but rather about Elizabeth escaping from Columbia.\n\nAnd now, I'll dedicate a paragraph to Elizabeth. Like I mentioned above, I feel that the game is more about Elizabeth than about Booker. After all, she is kind of the driving force behind the plot; what moves it forward. And like I also mentioned, she'll be your companion for most of the game. Even then, the game doesn't feel like a long escort mission. During combat, Elizabeth helps you out; not fighting enemies directly, but by providing you supplies, opening tears to bring in help, and even warning you of powerful enemies. Outside combat, she'll wander on her own; not going too far away from you, but she'll still look at things that interest her, and might even find things you missed; she can also open doors for you through lockpicking. I think they did a great job at giving her a personality; she doesn't feel like another NPC at all, but rather as an actual person. Still, there are a few details here and there; just as an example, when lockpicking, she'll usually talk in a cheerful tone, which can feel out of place when, only a few minutes before, she was angry at Booker for something he did.\n\nThe environments are superb. The city of Columbia is a pretty beautiful place, and I can see why they went with the \"city in the sky\" theme rather than going back to the bottom of the ocean. Not to say that Rapture wouldn't have looked good; in fact, you'll get to visit it in its prime in Burial at Sea! However, having a different setting was interesting, with 1912's Columbia providing a nice contrast to 1950's Rapture. The level design, by itself, is pretty good; still, most of the places you'll visit feel like combat arenas, consisting of big, open spaces, unlike Rapture's labyrinth-like structure. The soundtrack is pretty good as well.\n\nWell, I think that's all I can say about BioShock Infinite. Personally, my favourite BioShock game is BioShock 2, but even then, I think Infinite is an excellent game, which is why I recommend it.","timestamp_created":1478012653,"timestamp_updated":1478041264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":32,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.727358639240264893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26356090","author":{"steamid":"76561198325782573","num_games_owned":652,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":847,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":798,"last_played":1503829187},"language":"schinese","review":"操作手感音乐什么都很好，只想评论剧情，剧透慎入剧透慎入剧透慎入剧透慎入剧透慎入。一开始明亮温暖悠闲的美好画面让我以为是轻小说游戏，捡到枪突突突之后时候觉得是奇幻风格FPS游戏，玩到中间有一段尼玛简直是在玩恶灵附身吓死爹了，最后准备迎来最终一战的时候剧情莫名奇妙让主角地把大BOSS溺死了。。。然后本来以为战胜了邪恶势力，将要迎来新生活的我，在精神分裂转换无数个场景之后，看着主角被N个萌妹子溺死在了河里。。。查了下百度才大致理解了剧情，这个结局让人感觉非常不是滋味，浑身难受，因为我一直是一个期望HE的玩家，但是同时也为这种构思巧妙精细的剧情所折服，就如同看完一部电影一般需要细细琢磨。","timestamp_created":1478012453,"timestamp_updated":1505293307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54136359691619873","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26356023","author":{"steamid":"76561198093564337","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":2095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":931,"last_played":1590086869},"language":"schinese","review":"好游戏啊~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","timestamp_created":1478012273,"timestamp_updated":1478012273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26355401","author":{"steamid":"76561198209704051","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":768,"last_played":1617134105},"language":"english","review":"Brilliant.\n\n\nBrilliant MindF-ck.\n","timestamp_created":1478010264,"timestamp_updated":1478010264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26352873","author":{"steamid":"76561198143131966","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":956,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":956,"last_played":1507463912},"language":"spanish","review":"Es una obra maestra.

This gives us an extraordinary historical outline and plot of which is not going to get away, even for a moment. Hard and snappy hero is a perfect contrast to the wonderful, sweet and slightly lost as Elizabeth, and it is enough that we feel torn between the two different worlds of black and white.\nThe game offers a nice variety of arsenal and skills that will help us in the execution of our task to both \"land\" and in the skies.\n\nPlus:\n[list]\n[*]Stock conveying the great atmosphere of steampunk Columbia\n[*]Great music\n[*]Extremely well-designed locations\n[*]Brilliantly sketched characters\n[*]Dynamic, action-packed fight\n[*]One of the best storylines in games, and I love the game focused on the story.\n[*]Elizabeth <3 <3 <3 <3\n[/list]\n\n̶M̶i̶n̶u̶s̶e̶s̶:̶\nFCK, THIS GAME HAS NO DISADVANTAGES!","timestamp_created":1477987458,"timestamp_updated":1477989788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.573333323001861572","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26349513","author":{"steamid":"76561198262681027","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":705,"last_played":1468747941},"language":"schinese","review":"不負藝術之名","timestamp_created":1477982772,"timestamp_updated":1477982772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26349350","author":{"steamid":"76561197967229561","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":981,"last_played":1365922800},"language":"english","review":"Amazing story, beautiful world-building, pretty good FPS combat, so-so level design.

From pipping hot frying pan to the infernal stove, no worries for the weapons are almost everywhere even when cops and rebels are ahead of you. \nTurned out the damsel in distress became quite a partner and tossed me stuffs often. When the girl yells and tosses you a gun, trust me, better to catch it than sorry. Best, most useful heroine I've ever seen and interact with.\n\nThe story? Man, never been fucked up like this. Unexpected, and baffled me for moments. \nBeen in Rapture, twice to be exact, and a brief revisit to the city under the ocean gave me chill and nostalgia at the same time.

Я играл и получал удовольствие от такой красивой картинки и мельчайшей детализации;\n[b]+Музыка.[/b] Музыкальное сопровождение создаёт свою позитивную и местами угнетающую атмосферу;\n[b]+Геймплей.[/b] Несмотря на линейность сюжета, можно так же проходить дополнительные задания, не менее интересные.\n[b]+Философия.[/b] У сюжета Bioshock явно есть некий скрытый посыл. И как я считаю - это [b]выбор[/b]. Вся последующая наша жизнь может зависеть лишь от одного нашего выбора, который порой может оказаться не самым простым. Опять же вспомнился фильм \"Господин Никто\".\n[spoiler]+Локализация. За это отдельное СПАСИБО нашим добровольцам из творческого объединения CGInfo, которые добровольно проделали колоссальную работу над озвучкой всех персонажей, которые по качеству не уступают оригиналу, и перевели буквально все возможные надписи в игре. И за такой труд они даже не приняли финаносовой благодарности от фанатов игры.[/spoiler]\n\n[u]Из минусов:[/u]\n[b]-Стелс.[/b] В таком хорошем шутере можно убивать врагов сломя голову или более аккуратно, но устранять их бесшумно игра не позволяет, хотя предпосылки к такой возможности есть в одной из миссии;\n[b]-NPC.[/b] Никакого взаимодействия с местным окружением, и местами никакой реакции от них, печаль;\n[b]-Затянутость.[/b] Порой казалось, что были ненужные моменты в игре, которые нужны, чтобы расстянуть часы геймплея. Ну это очень мелкая придирка.\n\n[i]После прохождения Bioshock Infinite меня просто переполняли эмоции. Это была именна та игра, которой мне давненько не хватало. Она надолго останется в моей памяти. Можно долго над ней думать и рассуждать. Биошок - это как шикарное кино, над финалом которого следует поразмышлять. Тебе нужно пересмотреть его, чтобы все непонятные моменты встали на своим места, и только тогда ты получишь максимум удовольствия. Своих денег игра стоит определенно. Не купить её и не пройти - это себя не уважать, если вы любите шутеры от 1-го лица с глубоким сюжетом.[/i]\n\n[b]9.5/10[/b]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=784783575","timestamp_created":1477510058,"timestamp_updated":1477511571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.695920586585998535","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26234898","author":{"steamid":"76561198062468421","num_games_owned":329,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":2483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2399,"last_played":1537477521},"language":"english","review":"the game you finish and then a week later you understand.","timestamp_created":1477507719,"timestamp_updated":1485387251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570421516895294189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26234304","author":{"steamid":"76561198040764903","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1042,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":838,"last_played":1475772507},"language":"brazilian","review":"História sensacional, gameplay fluído, gráficos bonitos.

The story was great up until the ending. But even then, the ending of the base game only leaves you with a mild stomach ache. But the DLC is full on diahrea. With hindsight I would have given this game a pass. To me, a game like this is an interactive story, and the story is crap, even if the mechanics are solid. The first two games are much better.\n\n***spoilers***\nIts not the sad ending as such that annoys me, it was just badly written where Liz puts into events that are worse than if she did nothing. Plus the DLC basically invalidates the ending of the main game. And the ending of the main game is a stereotypical time travel paradox ending. The other thing I was dissapointed with was the lack of any fan service to bioshock 2. with all the time travel it would have been cool to see glimpses of Eleanor.","timestamp_created":1477489015,"timestamp_updated":1477489015,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460576564073562622","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26227024","author":{"steamid":"76561198066936169","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1502192766},"language":"english","review":"Can't describe this game.. \nBuy it","timestamp_created":1477467198,"timestamp_updated":1477467198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26225650","author":{"steamid":"76561198026645645","num_games_owned":532,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":839,"last_played":1477355942},"language":"english","review":"Excellent story and cool weapons.","timestamp_created":1477455956,"timestamp_updated":1477455956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26225482","author":{"steamid":"76561198081880918","num_games_owned":572,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":410,"last_played":1577618989},"language":"russian","review":"Тупо тир","timestamp_created":1477454576,"timestamp_updated":1477895408,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.358076393604278564","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26222978","author":{"steamid":"76561198163661900","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1594509073},"language":"spanish","review":"Bioshock infinite es un gran titulo con una gran historia, jugabilidad y unos graficos espectaculares.Aunque no sea igual a su antecesor aun mantiene su encanto con una banda sonora cuativadora a pesar de no poseer un modo cooperativo o un modo multijugador el juego el juego cotinua siendo excelente y con sus dlc bioshock infinite burial at sea (panteon marino) episodio 1 y 2 te brindan una nueva campaña, jugabilidad y una nueva historia.Sinceramente no me aburro de este juego.Recomiendo este titulo","timestamp_created":1477438741,"timestamp_updated":1477443113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26222869","author":{"steamid":"76561198024439317","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1408,"last_played":1449250254},"language":"english","review":"You can send crows at your enemies and then shove a hook in their head while the crows eat their flesh\n10/10","timestamp_created":1477438176,"timestamp_updated":1477438176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26221702","author":{"steamid":"76561198058449279","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1467114002},"language":"russian","review":"Что то не то, играя несколько часов не понял что к чему, куда то постоянно бежишь, причем по одним и тем же локацииям, вечные перестрелки, кароч какаето кол оф дути","timestamp_created":1477431757,"timestamp_updated":1479016768,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.358472675085067749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26217228","author":{"steamid":"76561198109301953","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1008,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":903,"last_played":1571886590},"language":"koreana","review":"재밋었고 스토리도 인상깊었어","timestamp_created":1477412973,"timestamp_updated":1477412973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26215869","author":{"steamid":"76561198104009509","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":791,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":638,"last_played":1508076945},"language":"czech","review":"B.
