There's multiple difficulties to try, so you can play a quick game with a friend if you're new or you can try Hell on Earth difficulty, which would typically require experience, teamwork, and a lot of focus. There are tons of maps to play and learn strategies for and that doesn't even include the vast amount of downloadable content in the workshop.\n\nOn a side note, the game is getting quite old now, so new players should probably look at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/232090/Killing_Floor_2/]Killing Floor 2[/url] as KF2 is far better with exceptionally improved graphics, mechanics, animations and more.

Ele ganhou o prêmio de melhor jogo de PC de 2009, melhor shooter e melhor expansão de PC em 2009. Você pode jogar com até 5 jogadores no modo online, ou sozinho jogando no solo mode (O ''singleplayer'' de Killing floor). O jogo não os conta como 'zumbis' e sim como 'specimens' de um programa do governo inglês para clonar soldados.\n\nÁudio:\nUma coisa que impressiona muito é a quantidade de falas que se tem no jogo, não só dos personagens mas dos 'specimens'. O áudio do jogo é bem simples, não há tantos efeitos sonoros quanto nos jogos de hoje em dia, porém seu som é bem agradável e, por parte dos personagens, um sotaque inglês.\nO áudio (no caso trilha sonora) também muda de acordo com o que acontece no jogo, quando não há zumbis a música de fundo é mais suave, tranquila porém quando os jogadores estão em combate a música passa a ser básicamente composta por Heavy metal e batidas de tambor.\n\nGráficos:\nA engine do jogo é a Unreal Engine, seus gráficos são simples e não são lindos ou perfeitos como o de Crysis, porém não são gráficos desagrádaveis que tiram o entretenimento do jogo. O lado bom disso é que qualquer pessoa com um pc mediano pode 'rodar' o jogo sem qualquer problema.\n\nJogabilidade:\nA Jogabilidade de KF é muito boa, os comandos são fáceis e respondem bem ao movimento do mouse, porém não tem suporte para canhotos. Assim como Left 4 Dead, você não pode apertar uma tecla e correr mais rápido (o que acontece em vários FPSs) sua velocidade é determinada à partir da quantidade de peso que tu carregas e de seu Perk.\n\nEstória:\nKilling Floor não tem uma estória definida, é apenas falado de que na Inglaterra alguns cientistas faziam experimentos e algo aconteceu ocasionando na criação dos 'specimens'. O jogo deixa vago essa questão, fazendo com os jogadores criem sua própia versão da estória.\n\nGameplay:\nO gameplay de KF é muito simples, consiste em um jogo 'Solo' (sozinho) ou em multiplayer (vários jogadores), no qual você e seus colegas devem lutar contra hordas de zumbis (mais precisamente 'specimens) em que cada ronda (wave) se torne mais difícil, até que ao concluí-las haverá uma batalha contra o 'Super-Specimen' que se chama 'Patriarch'. Os jogadores podem escolher aonde ficar, correr e lutar. O jogo pode ser modificado atráves de mods, mudando a dificuldade, número de inimigos, de waves, ou de jogadores. (Algumas dessas mudanças pode impedir que você avance o seu perk)\n\nHá diversas armas no jogo, incluindo armas corpo a corpo (melee), Shotguns, Rifles dentre outras. Jogadores ganham dinheiro ao matar 'specimens' ou curando seus colegas, o dinheiro ganho pode ser gastado no Trader em troca de armas e você também pode vende-las no Trader.\n\nUma característica do jogo chamada de ''ZED-Time'' faz com que o jogo fique com o efeito 'Matrix' de 'slow-motion' o que pode salvar seus colegas.\nPode-se usar elementos táticos como soldar portas e fazer com que os inimigos venham em apenas uma direção.\n\nHá um chat de voz in-game com simples avisos/insultos etc, como há o chat de voz em que os jogadores podem conversar com outros, trocando estratégias ou pedindo ajuda.\n\nPerk:\nUma das coisas que diferencia Killing Floor de vários FPSs atuais é seu sistema de 'Perk'. Esse sistema é bem encontrado em jogos de RPG, em que se escolhe uma classe e ela tem suas vantagens e desvantagens. O jogo conta com sete classes: Field Medic, Support Specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Beserker, Firebug e Demolitions.\n\nCada perk tem sua vantagem/desvantagem e exigência para dar um 'up'. As exigências são ganhas fazendo certas ações durante o jogo, como curando seus colegas ou fazendo dano nos 'specimens'.\n\nO perk é detalhado no canto inferior esquerdo, com a imagem do perk e seu número de estrelas. Jogadores com perks de 0 à 5 terão a imagem de seu perk vermelha com o número de estrelas equivalente ao seu nível. Jogadores no nível 6 terão uma imagem dourada de seu perk com uma estrela. Seu perk deve ser selecionado antes do começo de uma partida e pode ser mudado uma vez ao final de cada 'wave'.\n\nSpecimens:\nOs ''specimens'' são os principais antagonistas em Killin Floor. Enquanto eles são bem referidos à zumbis, eles são o fato de uma falha em um experimento de clones criado pela ''Horzine Biotech'' (uma compania fictícia de biotecnologia em London). Há dez tipos diferentes de 'specimes', incuindo o Patriarca (Patriarch), todos eles com suas própias ''habilidades especiais'' e estética.\nAo decaptar um 'specimen' você o deixará incapaz de fazer algumas de suas habilidades.\nMuitos 'specimens' têm tendências canibalísticas, e iram alimentar-se em corpos de jogadores mortos recentemente.\nOs 'specimens' não têm um 'Spawn point' fixo, eles sempre nascem perto dos jogadores.\n\nSolo/Multiplayer:\nO jogo não tem um modo campanha em que fala sobre sua estória, no seu modo ''Single-player'' o jogador pode escolher dentre vários mapas e jogar sozinho (o que é bom para quem é iniciante no jogo aprender os controles e upar seu perk), em cada mapa há um box com uma descrição, uma pequena estória sobre o mapa. Esse sistema do ''Solo'' é bem similiar ao de Battlefield 2.\n\nConclusão:\n\nSe você procura um jogo de zumbi, muito mais desafiador do que o Left 4 Dead e não se importa muito com os gráficos e sim com a diversão, Killing Floor é o jogo ideal, além de ser barato (apenas 15 doláres na steam) ele vai lhe proporcionar diversão por muito tempo.","timestamp_created":1406893615,"timestamp_updated":1406893615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11504632","author":{"steamid":"76561198128817993","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":772,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":635,"last_played":1469914982},"language":"russian","review":"По моему мнению  Killing Floor лучшая кооперативная игра против зомби.\n Плюсы:\n + Большое кол-во оружия.\n + Разные скины на любой вкус\n + Есть такие классы как:Медик,снайпер,поджигатель,коммандос и тд.\n + Просто туева хуча Карт.\n + Можно ставить разные моды из Мастерской.\n + Песочница.\n + Разные режимы игры.   \n + Много видов зомби.\n + Присутствует прокачка классов.\n + Хорошая графика.\nМинусы:\nНаверное, минус только один это большая стоимость дополнений.(я купил все дополнения по акции за 139 рублей,а так их стоимость больше 3000 руб.)\nИтог: Игра стоит своих денег и её оценка  9.9/10","timestamp_created":1406890956,"timestamp_updated":1416115304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565443813800811768","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11504506","author":{"steamid":"76561198070180161","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":970,"last_played":1516887421},"language":"english","review":"This is a great game, addictive, fun and fantastic","timestamp_created":1406890162,"timestamp_updated":1406890162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11503115","author":{"steamid":"76561198044574019","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":55095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34168,"last_played":1591456135},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor was a game I bought on impulse during one 2012 Halloween sale and played off and on following one particular LP that got me interested in KF, and it only took me a few months ago to get back into the fray.\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay: \n* As a F.o.B., I quickly realized that KF does not hold the player's hand, only briefly explaining what one can do during the first wave (you can toggle the hints back on in the settings later) before letting the player ride their bicycle without their training wheels for the rest of the game. One thing I highly suggest any new player do, before any actual game play, is to look at the controls as KF has a control scheme that is similar to yet very different to the more common FPS game on PC. Another thing to take note is that unlike most FPS games, there is no crosshair; the player must accurately adjust their firearms to properly fight off the main threat (dubbed \"specimens\"), but players do have the ability to aim down their ironsights, so accuracy is not complete guesswork. By killing the specimens, players earn money that they may spend at the trader's shop between waves to buy more guns and ammo, which is a vital thing players must realize if they are to survive the horde. With all of these things, one might feel that their FPS background might translate well into here. Allow me to quickly dismantle that idea now, as most players (myself included) need to unlearn certain habits if they plan to succeed. Lone wolves rarely survive alone without the proper know how of dispatching each threat, and very rarely will standing in one spot without moving a step yield victory. Should one step into the multiplayer (which is where many say is where the real fun is), there is a strong emphasis to work as a team and support one another to reach the end game. Yet another big separation from most FPS games is that there is no PvP bar a community made mod (that does not come with the base game), and the game will spawn more enemies with more health if there are more players on the server, which reinforces the \"united we stand or divided we fall\" mentality needed to succeed (and if one is not particularly attracted at the notion of playing with others, there is a solo mode to realize one's dreams of being a one person army). The game is challenging enough that even on Normal difficulty, new players will have some struggles making it to the end of the game's waves. And if the players do get to the end and win or if they lose? They must start the next game from scratch and build their way back up to their zeniths (If this idea does not sit well with you, do not buy this game). Fortunately, Tripwire Interactive devised a way to make this less of an uphill battle in its unique Perk system. Unlike many other games, there is a RPG-esque leveling system for Perks, which are the classes of this game, each with its own emphasis in its choice of weaponry and along with them their own strengths and weaknesses. I will say right now that leveling perks after a certain point does become tedious, but the reward for achieving higher ranks allow for that perk's guns to be discounted further and become stronger (some weapons may not apply), which make the climb progressively easier. One thing I found that added to the game's charm is that the added difficulties are just there for players looking for a challenge, one may never have to step out of their comfort zone if they choose not to.\n\n* The gun play is very solid. The guns sound crisp and each have their own distinctive feel, and while some weapons won't necessarily feel or be good at first glance, the game is free enough to allow the player to build their own loadouts to cater to their needs.\n\n* The maps are very varied. One may be playing in a wide open space with nary a spot to hide and relax at for a moment or be bogged down into a chokepoint heavy corridor fest. As of the time of this writing, there are 26 maps that are included in the base game and the maps all look very nice and have their own quirky themes while also fitting with the idea of being specimen hotspots the player(s) must neutralize. \n\nLet's now talk about non-gameplay elements:\n* For the most part, one is not going to find an ongoing plot within the game and the characters themselves are just simple avatars with a bit of backstory to explain their involvement in the game. Plot isn't very strong here as it would be in Left 4 Dead or Amnesia, but a plot is a bit unnecessary in a game where it is the player(s) pitted against waves of enemies that stand between the players surviving and dying.\n\n* Voice acting is rather miniscule and lackluster. There is a total of maybe three character voice packs save one exception, but once again, with waves of enemies, I'd figure one would be more preoccupied with trying to stay alive than attempting to act out an entire Shakespearean play within the span of 30 minutes to an hour.\n\n* The enemies - I have to give Tripwire props in this regard, the specimens the player(s) must fight are very distinctive with their own unique abilities and are recognizeable by their silhouette alone in a manner akin to the mercenaries of Team Fortress 2. If one wants any chance to survive, they need to be familiar with each specimen's traits and abilities because as the saying goes, \"...knowing is half the battle.\"\n\n* The community - I have a skewed opinion in this regard, but the community here in KF is one of the nicest and friendliest around. If one has the courage to ask, there usually is an answer for that question and most players are willing to assist their allies should they ask. While this game is far from having no toxicity, most people here are just looking for a good time and those griefers or negativos are few and far between. Do not be too concerned that people are out to forsake others, it rarely occurs.\n\n* The DLC - Every piece of DLC, whether it be the weapon packs or character skins, are COMPLETELY, 100%, unnecessary to win. At best, they just support Tripwire and make the stuff look cool. At worst, one still has a look only shared with people who also bought those packs.\n\nConclusion: If one is willing to play through the grind and gain the skill and knowledge to survive, Killing Floor is absolutely worth the $20 entry gate. If not, please look elsewhere as this might not be the right fit. As a game that has been around for about 5 years now, the game is pretty frequently discounted every sale or so, so keep an eye out for those sales. If KF is on sale, I absolutely recommend buying the complete bundle if it dips under $20 as it is a steal to buy at even $5 for the base game. But, if you think you are interested in having the DLC and unsure if you are willing to buy it later, I'd still recommend buying the complete pack during a sale as one would get ALL THE SKINS AND WEAPONS for a fraction of the cost than if they were to have bought just the base game at discount and get the DLC after the sale ends.","timestamp_created":1406881229,"timestamp_updated":1406881229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514476656913757324","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11502858","author":{"steamid":"76561198075016629","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":348624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":13,"playtime_at_review":66477,"last_played":1660496559},"language":"russian","review":"Если ты, мой дорогой Друг, ищешь во что бы эдакое \"мясное\" сыграть со своими друзьями, и в глаза тебе попадается эта игра, то знай, ты на верном пути. Поначалу название \"Убийственный пол\" (наверняка хоть раз слышали) может ни коим образом тебя не привлечь, а матерый фанат компьютерных игр и не обратит внимания или даже отзовется нелестным образом. Так почему же эта игра привлекает не такую уж и малую аудиторию игроков по всему миру? Засчёт каких ключевых особенностей Killing Floor заставляет нас с вами проводить многие часы за монитором? Попробуем немного в этом разобраться.\nKilling Floor, как и большинство подобных игр передает своеобразную атмосферу: разборки с полуходячей мертвячиной, которая так и жаждит оторвать от тебя кусочек свежей плоти; яростные схватки, переплетающиеся с ревом и визгом, рвущихся к тебе жертв экспериментов ученого; даже, возможно, некое чувство паники в тебе возникнет, если ты только-только начинаешь первые шаги. Ты скажешь: \"Ничего особенного не вижу\", но не все так просто с одной стороны. В игре колоссальное значение предается именно отлаженной командной игре: пока один оперативно пытается заварить дверь, другой в это время всеми силами пытается отстреливать идущую пушечную плоть с другой стороны, следующий в это время лечит раненого товарища по отряду, еще один осматривается, чтобы отряд не был забит в угол. Настолько все взаимосвязано, что любой отчетливо заметит важность взаимодействия внутри своей команды. Такой аспект действительно инетересен. В любом случае у тебя есть право и на альтернативу: либо с командой, либо сам по себе. Азарта в игру добавляет, конечно же, наличие специализированных классов, имеющих свои приятные особенности, что, несомненно, радует. Рассказывать подробнее про специализацию не буду, лучше все попробовать на собственной шкуре, чтобы найти себе предпочтительную роль и показать себя коммуникабельным товарищем по отряду. Не хочется вечно стрелять? - Бери в руки обычный топор и покажи, откуда руки у тебя растут. Не хочется возиться с \"кровавым фаршем\" на поле боя? - Вооружись шприцом и лечебной гранатой, чтобы отряд чувствовал надежную опору. Естественно не обойтись без наличия методов ударной мощи, то есть старых добрых стволов. Пусть тебе покажется выбор не таким царским, но все равно получить массу неизгладимых впечатлений удастся, когда ты слишишь взрыв, и оторванные части тела как пушинки летят под ноги тебе или, когда ты попадаешь под прицел ракетного снаряда от так называемого Патриарха (название уже само за себя говорит). Так мы, дорогой друг, добрались до врагов наших меньших. Можно сказать с полной уверенностью, что их нельзя недооценивать. Да-да, даже самых на первый взгляд безобидных, так как они могут решить исход выживет ли отряд, либо потерпит сокрушение. Может случиться и такое, что один мутант сотрет в порошок весь отряд. Думаешь, это сказки? - Вынужден тебя разочаровать. Это еще одна немаловажная составляющая игрового процесса. Стоит отвлечься на какие-то незначительные доли драгоценного времени, как твои кости уже обгладывают голодные до боли противные существа. Виды оторванных кусков плоти, летающие осколки гранат, занавес клубов дыма, крики о помощи союзников прекрасным образом сочетаются с прекрасной звуковой частью Killing Floor. Я бы сказал очень удачно подобрано звуковое сопровождение. Также сумели внедрить своеобрвзную изюминку и в карты, где разворачиваются самые кровавые бои. На твой вкус открытые пространства, где можно бегать и бегать, более компактные карты. Везде можно применить уйму тактических действий, расположиться с товарищами в укромном месте, либо разделиться по несколько человек - Выбор за тобой, Друг. Хорошо осваиваешь обычное убийство и умеешь вовремя взять ноги в руки? Стоит попробовать так называемый \"Режим Заданий\" (Killing Floor Objective Mode). Из названия можно уже сделать вывод, что требуется выполнить для достижения конкретных целей. Это лишь небольшая часть того, что может ожидать тебя здесь. Ты не только должен бежать сломя голову и рубить все на своем пути, также необходимо уметь видеть на 1-2 шага вперед, так как всякое может произойти и, поэтому ты должен быть готов ко всему.\nСпасибо за внимание.","timestamp_created":1406879410,"timestamp_updated":1406887541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.694503068923950195","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11502595","author":{"steamid":"76561198055819458","num_games_owned":365,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":32513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6817,"last_played":1581156508},"language":"english","review":"Just do it.","timestamp_created":1406877646,"timestamp_updated":1406877646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11502050","author":{"steamid":"76561198098058066","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1542880033},"language":"russian","review":"зомби)))))","timestamp_created":1406873292,"timestamp_updated":1406873292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11500519","author":{"steamid":"76561198067012912","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":588,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":487,"last_played":1526602789},"language":"english","review":"Outstanding game, nothing wrong with this at all :DD","timestamp_created":1406861955,"timestamp_updated":1406861955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11499778","author":{"steamid":"76561197970814909","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8748,"last_played":1574705273},"language":"english","review":"Best Game Ever.","timestamp_created":1406856962,"timestamp_updated":1406856962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.436507940292358398","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11498459","author":{"steamid":"76561198120428261","num_games_owned":528,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1448680042},"language":"english","review":"i love the game so far i can play this anytime","timestamp_created":1406848815,"timestamp_updated":1406848815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11497718","author":{"steamid":"76561198113351473","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1264,"last_played":1513947215},"language":"english","review":"really love this game, lots of creatures to kill","timestamp_created":1406844549,"timestamp_updated":1406844549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11497505","author":{"steamid":"76561198121915604","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":151,"last_played":1430514290},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um jogo de terror muito bom pra quem gosta de ação!!","timestamp_created":1406843501,"timestamp_updated":1406843501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11496575","author":{"steamid":"76561198137218858","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":31640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15024,"last_played":1505035949},"language":"russian","review":"Крутяцки епта","timestamp_created":1406838913,"timestamp_updated":1406838913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11496478","author":{"steamid":"76561198135433224","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1403181611},"language":"russian","review":"Эта игра достаточно играбельна, я даю 9\\10 баллов этой игре.
