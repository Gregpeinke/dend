no es una critica ni un análisis del juego, quiero expresar lo que sentí al jugarlo y tratar de plasmar en las personas que deseen comprarlo o aun no lo juegan, las ganas de disfrutar de este titulo.\nSoy muy consiente de los años que tiene este juego, Half life es una de esas obras de culto para las que llegué tarde. Todo el mundo habla sobre este juego, hay un meme muy famoso referente al número 3 y la desarrolladora de Half life que da vueltas por todo internet y es casi imposible no conocerlo. me anime a jugarlo por primera vez el día 25 de diciembre del 2018 por que al fin pude comprarlo en una rebaja de navidad, junto a todas sus expansiones y su tan aclamada secuela.\nEntrar en Black Mesa por primera vez fue un poco extraño, sabia que este juego era un fps, algo que es conocimiento común, pero no conocía nada de su trama, así que al encontrarme que todo se desarrollaba en un laboratorio científico pensé inmediatamente en una historia genérica y cliché de títulos fps de los años 90 - Principios del 2000, como me equivoque.\nPuedo asegurar ahora, que este juego posee quizá, los mejores primeros 30 minutos de un video-juego, sin menospreciar el trabajo de otros, como por ejemplo Bioshock. Pero quede impresionado como me atraparon en tan solo un par de docenas de minutos en su mundo. Quiero comparar una experiencia similar que me paso con el juego Mass Effect 1, también pensaba que era otro juego mas del monton, pero en la primera mision senti que ya me tenían agarrado de los pies y no me soltarían.\nEl juego es simplemente perfecto dentro de lo que puede serlo, si dejas de lado los problemas técnicos y limitaciones de la época y te plantas a disfrutarlo por lo que fue en su tiempo, lo disfrutaras como nunca has disfrutado otro juego. Scripts deliciosos que te narran la trama, escenarios coherentes incluso conectados entre si que le dan aun mas realismo, una historia fragmentada en miles de detalles, debes mirar situaciones, escuchar conversaciones mientras pasas, detenerte a observar partes de las instalaciones para entender algunas cosas. A los que son seguidores de la saga Souls esto les sonara un montón.\nHalf life es una obra maestra dentro de su genero y grosso modo una obra maestra dentro del mundo de los video juegos en general. Vanguardista, inteligente, detallista, desafiante y por sobre todo, divertido.\nRecomendado al 100 %, no le colocare una nota por que como dije al principio, solo estoy relatando lo que me hizo sentir, pruébenlo y si les gusta al menos el 10% de lo que me gusto a mi, valdrá totalmente la pena.","timestamp_created":1546737981,"timestamp_updated":1546737981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.625283896923065186","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48126240","author":{"steamid":"76561198414134422","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":407,"last_played":1612710780},"language":"english","review":"If you want the worst Half-Life experience ever, get this version.

This review is for the game as a port.\n\n     As an engine port, it has it's ups and downs. Weapons have redone textures, bullets are more easily nowing where they go, and ragdolls exist. But even the game mechanics are different from the Goldsource edition, such as guns and enemies.\n     The guns' metal texture now shines on movement, a staple with the Source engine. And the HD weapons were also replace with high-quality models and textures. But the looks may be a downside, as the some of the HD weapons don't have reload sounds. And some weapon mechanics are completely different. The SMG's recoil is as if you are baubbling your head instead of being taken back by firing a gun. And the grenades don't fly across the room like you'd expect they'd do in the source engine.\n     For the port, the difficulty no longer changes the amount of damage you give and take, it changes how much of a bullet sponge enemies are. And the maps have explosives and more enemies to show how Source can make the whole mutliple aliens scenario work better in your favor. NPCs are improved in this, as followers no longer walk around in a grind like fashion, the Tentacle (the three alien claws) react to sound faster, and headcrabs don't slide around as much. But vortigaunts and securities won't shoot at breakable windows like they used to.\n\n---UPDATE---\n     Okay after finishing the game, this is basically harder than play Half Life 1 on hard difficulty. Ever since I entered Xen, difficulty has been cranked to the max. Enemies are difficult, and the lower gravity does NOT work on the Source engine, any slope you walk up on sends you flying fifty meters high. And the fight with Nihilanth is longer than before, making you teleport more than originally.\n\n---New UPDATE---\n     The helicopter is broken. Nearly impossible to hit.\n\n     So the port is somewhat of a game changer in certain aspects.

Из положительного следует выделить, слегка подтянутую графику и возможность выбора любой главы. Из минусов, в игре присутствует немереное число багов (исправлять, которые никто не собирается, лол). Так же огорчает, что в игре нет поддержки субтитров, и официальной локализации (которая во второй части и эпизодах, была очень неплохой). \n\nЕсли вы хотите понастольгировать и вновь пройти первую часть, то лучше купите для этой цели оригинальную версию игры.

Yes, the game is based on the Source engine and some textures such as water surfaces have been improved and now look much more realistic, but HL 1 is not about realistic graphics and physics but about the nostalgic feel, which was in my opinion removed by this update. Besides of the above mentioned, the game is quite glitchy, so you have to be ready to do a lot of quick saves, otherwise it may happen that in certain point the game just decides that you cannot continue and have to start from the beginning (or the last functional save). In a nutshell, if you want to play HF 1, just buy the original version of the game.\n\nRating: 4/10","timestamp_created":1544286443,"timestamp_updated":1544286443,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597458481788635254","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47379023","author":{"steamid":"76561198063830557","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":637,"last_played":1544943780},"language":"koreana","review":"아니 이거 좀 오바지 더빙은 꽤갠은 무슨 \n스토리나 그런건 괜찮아요 그래픽도 옛날이라서 \n더빙에서 -96점\n총점수 4점 드립니다 \n","timestamp_created":1544248411,"timestamp_updated":1544248411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t5iYxucCf6TetAE="}
