Falei no 3D porque eu conheci o jogo, inicialmente, em uma versão 2D naqueles sites de jogos de browser online. Achei a ideia de criar portais para se tele transportar muito interessante, mas nunca terminei o jogo por lá. Tempo depois, fiquei sabendo que o título se tratava de uma adaptação de um outro jogo. Procurei, joguei e fiquei positivamente muito surpreso. A jogabilidade era incomparavelmente superior na versão original, sem contar com a trilha sonora e os comentários da GLaDOS.\n    Em suma, além de Portal ser um título que exige raciocínio para prosseguir jogando, ele traz consigo uma boa dose de humor, na maioria das vezes, vindo dos comentários da GLaDOS. Mas, sem dúvida, um dos pontos mais altos do jogo é o final, [spoiler]quando derrotamos a inteligência artificial e os créditos vêm em forma de console de computador, acompanhados por uma linda canção¹, interpretada por ninguém mais, ninguém menos que GLaDOS, afinal ela é a sua única companhia no jogo inteiro.[/spoiler]\n    Por outro lado, confesso que acho o jogo um tanto quanto perturbador, porque fico a pensar no que a protagonista está passando, confinada naquele lugar, servindo de experimentação e tentando que lutar por sua própria sobrevivência, sozinha [spoiler]e com alguém querendo, constantemente, acabar com a sua vida. Como se isso não fosse o bastante, ainda encontramos vários sinais de que você não é a primeira pessoa a passar por aquilo, o que te leva a pensar que você pode ser apenas mais uma na lista de cobaias desse experimento.[/spoiler]\n    Sem mais delongas, [spoiler]the cake is a lie.[/spoiler]\n\n    [i]¹Gostei tanto dessa música que ela foi salva na minha playlist do Spotify.[/i]","timestamp_created":1518738064,"timestamp_updated":1518738356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40111681","author":{"steamid":"76561198008936366","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":18921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9875,"last_played":1640917290},"language":"english","review":"AaAaaAaAAAAAaaahhhhhHhhhHhhhhhHhhHHHHHHHhHHHHH","timestamp_created":1518736732,"timestamp_updated":1518736732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40110791","author":{"steamid":"76561198429406628","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":4224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":667,"last_played":1637367586},"language":"english","review":"So fun\n\n","timestamp_created":1518733335,"timestamp_updated":1518733335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40110530","author":{"steamid":"76561198121436539","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1558933949},"language":"brazilian","review":"o jogo é simplesmente MARAVILHOSO! só isso q eu tenho a dizer =P","timestamp_created":1518732372,"timestamp_updated":1518732372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40108289","author":{"steamid":"76561198351920954","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1590085331},"language":"turkish","review":"Still alive.                 -GLaDOS","timestamp_created":1518725498,"timestamp_updated":1518725498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540229856967926025","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40107210","author":{"steamid":"76561198371964970","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":347,"last_played":1603168736},"language":"brazilian","review":"O melhor!","timestamp_created":1518722791,"timestamp_updated":1518722791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40106224","author":{"steamid":"76561198087476001","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1659696501},"language":"polish","review":"Gra świetna","timestamp_created":1518720144,"timestamp_updated":1518720144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40102685","author":{"steamid":"76561198088952907","num_games_owned":366,"num_reviews":125,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1518697302},"language":"english","review":"hmmmmmm steamed hams!","timestamp_created":1518710234,"timestamp_updated":1518710234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489510476589202881","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40099386","author":{"steamid":"76561198803680317","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":317,"last_played":1652651017},"language":"english","review":"This is a great game for it's value.
