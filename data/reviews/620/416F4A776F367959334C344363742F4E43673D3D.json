It comes after Portal, which revolutionized the concept of running through portals to solve puzzles, which is an ingenious new take on gaming itself. I have never had a true favorite game until I played Portal 2. I admit I wasn’t so addicted to it at first, playing it off and on over the span of a few weeks. I honestly don’t know what grabbed me, but as soon as I blinked, I was addicted. \n\nNow, I hear all the negativity that can come with saying that one thinks Portal 2 is better than Portal, but honestly, if I’d played Portal first, I wouldn’t have bought as much merchandise as I have sitting in my house right now. It’s the kind of game that makes you WANT to contribute as much of your money to as possible, because it’s that great of a game. \n\nI love gifting this game to other Steam players (as well as Portal, but I particularly love giving out this game twice as much). It’s not a game many people should miss out on, and if you love puzzles and verbal abuse from an AI, this game is definitely something you should buy (even at full price). \n\nGLaDOS is waiting.
