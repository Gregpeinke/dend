This game also gives a lot of realism with the fact that you have no crosshair and your character doesnt have experience with a gun but as you level up you get more comfortable with your weaponary.  Its a pity that this game was programed with simple programing actions in the unreal engine but its an exception.  This takes place in Europe and dont be thinking this is all about nazi zombies its modern zombies, and also its more gentlemen like if you say euros (Europian money) instead of dollars (American money)  because every time you kill a zombie you get euros so stop saying its dollars.
