This game was greatly anticipated when it was announced and we all waited in anticipation for the release.\nThe game was not a disappointment, the developers brought us back to Aperture Laboratories and put us to work on new and innovative puzzles, Portal1 and 2 will always be one of my most favorite puzzle games, period.\n\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b] [spoiler]You wake up in a strange hotel-looking room, after awakening you discover you're actually still inside Aperture Laboratories and the whole place is falling apart! You need to find a way out and escape before the whole lab falls down around your ears![/spoiler]\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] The whole game is based on the core concepts of two portals [i](an Orange/red and Blue Portal)[/i], be it moving objects through these portals, moving yourself between these portals, or jumping off high objects to reach hard to reach places, the game is a brainteaser in such a wonderful way. As the catchphrase goes “prepare to think with portals”.\nThere are a number of features in Portal2, there are Single player, Co-op, Community Test Chambers/Workshop, Steam Achievements, and challenge modes where you can compete against your friends for fastest times, least portals used, steps, and more. \n\n[b]Achievements:[/b] There are 51 Achievements for Portal2, Most of the single player achievements are straightforward fun and challenging to get... There are also Co-op achievements, so it would be best to make or get a friend to help you out.\n\n[b]Price:[/b] Portal2 is priced at $19.99 that will be the best 20 dollars you spend. But if you're on a tight budget like me you might want to wait for a 75% off sale, since the game was released in 2011 there's a very good chance that there will be sale for it.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] I really can't sum up how great Portal2 is without saying “look, if you're even remotely interested in trying it out, you don't grasp just what an outstanding puzzle game it is. I highly recommend Portal2 to everyone and anyone.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update September 13, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/400] Portal[/url]","timestamp_created":1342806291,"timestamp_updated":1442172126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566473960876464844","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5441687","author":{"steamid":"76561198049821196","num_games_owned":292,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":344,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1558729911},"language":"english","review":"SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!
