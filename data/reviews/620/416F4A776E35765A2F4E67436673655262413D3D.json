Every puzzle is designed to challange your mind and your patience. It is a worthy sequel to Portal 1, and has been improved in almost every way.\n\n[h1]Postitives[/h1]\n- Solid story that is intriguing and interesting\n- The lore has been given tons of depth. You learn much more about GLaDOs and Chell, the main protagonist. You also learn more about Aperture Science and it's creater, Cave Johnson.\n- The characters are more fleshed out and more interesting.\n- All the puzzles are great, and some are much harder than anything in Portal 1.\n- Much more detail in the enviorments compared to Portal 1, along with improved graphics and engine.\n- Challange Mode makes a return, combining Fewest portals and Lowest Time together.\n- Co-op mode is introduced, which is genius! It's been masterfully crafted and it's been given lots of thought. There's tons of useful tools like seeing what your partner sees using TAB, using F to set a waypoint on where you want your partner to look, and other useful stuff like timers and different symbols for the waypoint.\n- There is Steam Workshop support, where there are singleplayer and co-op maps created by the community. This gives the game infinite life and so much content.\n- This game runs on the Source engine, which can run on almost any computer within reason. A 5 year old GPU can most likely run this game at reasonable resolution and settings.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n- I can't think of any, but if I was to be forced to put one, it would be that it would be nice if the story was a bit longer. 5-6 hours is great for a type of game like Portal, but something like 8 or even 10 hours would've been fantastic.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nPortal 2 is a legendary puzzle game. It's nearly perfect in every way, from story, gameplay, setting, atmosphere, lore, depth, and many more things. It's worth every penny!\n\nShould you buy it? [b]YES![/b] I would recommend getting the Portal bundle as the first game is also really good.\n\nMake Portal 3 happen, Valve.
