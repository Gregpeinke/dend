The graphics have not held up that well over the years, but all the same it's still lightyears ahead of it's contemporaries. The visual style is gritty, dirty and lived in, and the whole game has this unique industrial feel. The gameplay, the puzzles, the pace and style of the game are all masterwork quality. If you've never had the pleasure, or are just coming back for some nostalgia, Half-Life is one of the indispensable must-haves of any retro pc gaming collection.

is definitely a game-changing FPS, inspired by the classics but also genre-breaking. The levels are linear but it follows a coherent story, there's puzzles to solve outside of the shooting - sometimes optional to get some ammos and/or health but usually they are actually needed to continue onto the next area or level!\n\nSo gameplay-wise it's your standard FPS. You have a full set of various weapons - everything from a regular 9mm to an RPG. There's also some experimental weapons you get later on. The enemies are... I'd say kinda hard. Health is generated by either health packs or health stations, so no re-gen here. Ammo are in certain areas scarce and there's several enemy types that are bullet sponges, especially later on in the game.\n\nHas it aged well? I don't know, it's playable but at the same time it's quite rough around the edges. Perhaps Black Mesa is the better version these days?\n\nIt's overall good tho and I had a fun time with it, although I do have to admit that in certain areas... I had to \"turn off\" my health.

It starts in 1998, most of the popular games at the time were Quake and Doom. In those games you play as super soldiers. Super hero-like characters with powerful strength. When Half-Life came out, you literally spawned playing as “man on his way to work”. It was a new concept compared to any other game, and even more relatable to the player. You didn't have super-strength, you didn't have mind-control. You were a normal scientist with a hazard suit. The suit, named HEV suit or Hazardous Environment Suit. It was the only real power that the main character, Gordon Freeman had at his disposal. It's a suit that's not meant for war, simply working in hazardous environments.\n\nWhen you start the game, you are greeted with a long train ride to your workplace. You are Gordon Freeman, a man with a PhD in Theoretical Physics. Along the train ride, you witness the advanced AI. You see NPCs (Non Playable Characters) at work, at break and interacting with each other. Having normal human conversations, such as “Do you know who ate all the doughnuts?” And generally complaining about work environments or equipment failures.\n\nYou work at Black Mesa Research Facility, a government facility located in the New Mexico desert. It's a top secret facility working on all sorts of super cool futuristic technologies. A massive underground facility with housing, amenities and even their own TV and news entertainment. They have a small security force that works all over the facility to protect it from any failed Frankenstein-like experiments.\n\nWhen you arrive at your train stop, you are greeted by a friendly security guard who lets you out of your train and warns you that you are late to work and they are soon going to start a big experiment. Once freed from the train car, you enter the lobby of Sector C. You are then greeted by NPCs who tell you that you are late and must go to the test chamber. Once you have put on the HEV Suit and arrived at the test chamber, you begin the experiment. As predicted, it goes very wrong. You unintentionally create a portal to another planet prompting the native species to invade earth.\n\nFighting your way through the facility, you learn that the military has been ordered to cover up everything. They do this by eliminating everyone associated with the failed experiment. When the military fails, the CIA special forces are there to do the same thing. They are even ordered to eliminate the leftover military forces who originally failed. All while this is happening, the player is mysteriously stalked by a man known as The G-Man. A tall pale man in a blue suit carrying a black leather briefcase. Nothing is really known about him and how he relates to the main game, but it's speculated that he plays a major role.\n\nI rate Half-Life 10/10. It is an absolute perfect RPG with an engaging story. Although at the time it took them 6 years to release Half-Life 2, I was not born yet so it did not affect me! I got to play the half life series back to back and I enjoyed every bit of it! I’ve bonded with many friends over the Half-Life series and even the games based off of Half-Life such as the Counter-Strike series, HL Deathmatch, Ricochet, Day Of Defeat and Gary’s Mod. All great games that originally started with Half-Life, a game about a man who had a bad day at work.","timestamp_created":1621964304,"timestamp_updated":1621964304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92580685","author":{"steamid":"76561199041008273","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1225,"last_played":1640809489},"language":"english","review":"Its a great game","timestamp_created":1621963331,"timestamp_updated":1621963331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92576565","author":{"steamid":"76561198183071042","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1359,"last_played":1621957657},"language":"english","review":"come on you already know its good","timestamp_created":1621957821,"timestamp_updated":1621957821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92576079","author":{"steamid":"76561198166997093","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":465,"last_played":1656991802},"language":"english","review":"бхоп","timestamp_created":1621957140,"timestamp_updated":1621957140,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92575891","author":{"steamid":"76561198274165899","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":427,"last_played":1621823456},"language":"english","review":"mr freeman","timestamp_created":1621956920,"timestamp_updated":1621956920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92574012","author":{"steamid":"76561198162240281","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1562188266},"language":"english","review":"2019 -

shoutout to the game designers for this one, they really did good here. My favorite part is easily the shitty part where you have to fucking run through land mines in a corridor and there is a fucking sniper nest above you while you do it and there is also barbed wire and the sniper won't fucking die from the 12 grenades I threw at him so I have to do a bullshit ass garbage MLG jump and noscope him with the crossbow to kill him and then progress, only to realize that I still don't know where to go because of this libtard generation and there Tik tok.
