Комплексы Aperture Science заброшены и представляют из себя жалкое зрелище, до тех пор пока главную героиню не поднимает из анабиоза (прямо таки «Проснитесь и пойте, мистер Фримен…») модуль персональности по имени Уитли…\nТак же, как мне понравилась первая часть «веселых» приключений Челл в лабораториях Aperture, понравилась мне и Portal 2. Сюжет игры стал еще интереснее, дизайн – богаче во сто крат. Были разрешены некоторые старые загадки, но появились и новые.\n\nИгровой процесс остался верен своему девизу - \"Мысли порталами\". Механика осталась во многом прежней, но добавление новых тестовых элементов – гелей, прыжковых панелей, лазеров и много другого делает игру в разы многообразнее и интереснее.\n\nИгра стала гораздо  дольше предшественника – причина тому – более глубокий сюжет, большее число тестовых камер, новые окружения. Теперь нет легкого разочарования в конце игры из-за того, что игра слишком быстро закончилась.\n\nКроме того, если вам наскучит играть одному, предусмотрена отдельная сюжетная линия для кооперативного прохождения. На сей раз она продолжает сюжет из одиночной кампании. Кооператив задорный, интересный, захватывающий, а GLADOS будет постоянно подтрунивать над вами и вашим напарником по игре. Можно сыграть с кем-нибудь из друзей в Стиме или на разделенном экране в домашней обстановке (если друзья, конечно же, у вас есть). Если друзей у вас нет, то можно найти случайного игрока, и будет все так же весело и интересно, поскольку прохождение станет более непредсказуемым.\n\nНу а вишенкой на торте является встроенный редактор карт, тесно интегрированный с Мастерской. Тысячи игроков выкладывают свои пазлы разной степени сложности в общий доступ, и этому нет конца. Если вы изучили тесты из синглплеера вдоль и поперек, то это послужит вам отдушиной.\n\nВсе это позволяет притягивать к себе внимание игроков даже спустя 5 лет. И так будет еще очень долго - это игра на века. Пожалуй, лучшая игра Valve со времен второго Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1461082071,"timestamp_updated":1542910084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.698991835117340088","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22517785","author":{"steamid":"76561198076304472","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":18877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13329,"last_played":1654896364},"language":"english","review":"Right just Get it!

When he saw it on winter holiday sale he \"made me\" buy it for both of us.\nI finished single player first and I just love quotes, both Wheatley's and GladOS's. Single player felt longer then first game's and that sudden fall and change of surrounding is great. Cherry on cake is credit song which I only saw on Portal games and  make these games so special.\nI also like fun that doing these achievements brings, from throwing yourself into pit to breaking screens that results with some funny Wheatley's quotes.\n\nI think many people will agree with me when I say that co op is equaly good but even more fun the single player.\nThat is the element of game that I spent most of my in-game time on. Playing standard co op levels seperated into 5 groups of courses (not counting bonus courses) is great way to first learn game basics (in case you didn't play single player) but also to realize how good is your partner (how good reflexes he/she has, how much time is he/she willing to spend thinking, is he/she too stubborn to be played with, can you two understand eachother and how good host he/she is). I can say I played with at least 10 different partners I met online and finding few that I really enjoy playing with was not easy task.\n\nI also love the fact it has option to design your own test chamber and publish it on Steam Workshop pretty easily. Thanks to that you can, while in game, browse for the test chamber that is on your level (to be honest probably everyone after playing standard co op or/and single player for few times gets better on understanding game rules so he/she can solve harder tests more easily), subscribe and play it. There are whole collections of tests, some even with custom graphics and voices used to tell you original story through testing. You can choose from racing test to very complex one that require thinking.\n  \nPlaying this game you can very easily catch yourself asking how did time pass by so quickly. One of my co op partners and I spent over and hour playing just one test, but I don't regret a second because it was so much fun :).\n\nI am going to finish this with conclusion that this game connects different people which all have one thing in common- they are ready to do some testing :)\n\nI really hope I didn't fail form and this review helped someone decide to buy this game and be satisfied with it like I am.","timestamp_created":1461078744,"timestamp_updated":1461078744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623061001300811768","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22516949","author":{"steamid":"76561198126183156","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":112,"last_played":1481723355},"language":"russian","review":"Плюсы :\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nМинусы :\n-\n-\n-\n-","timestamp_created":1461078227,"timestamp_updated":1461078227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22516724","author":{"steamid":"76561198086173801","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1561,"last_played":1648692752},"language":"french","review":"Ce jeu est le meilleur jeux d'emocratique du congo :p","timestamp_created":1461077354,"timestamp_updated":1461077354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22516406","author":{"steamid":"76561198094403312","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":935,"last_played":1457042410},"language":"english","review":"Its a pretty cool game until that part you finish the storyline and go to play coop and you realise you have no friends ;_;.\n10/10 would cry again.","timestamp_created":1461076114,"timestamp_updated":1461076114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525842726230621338","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22516339","author":{"steamid":"76561198250944256","num_games_owned":471,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":710,"last_played":1448182855},"language":"japanese","review":"ギミックが増えタイミングとアクションが重要に\n解法に気づけないステージはホントにわからなく・・・\n２作目も素晴らしい出来なので２作合わせて遊んでほしい","timestamp_created":1461075827,"timestamp_updated":1461075827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498084276914596558","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22512845","author":{"steamid":"76561198272609334","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":976,"last_played":1595873787},"language":"english","review":"Surprising and amazing game.","timestamp_created":1461058013,"timestamp_updated":1461058013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22512559","author":{"steamid":"76561198124061132","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":706,"last_played":1620504328},"language":"koreana","review":"buy this sh1t 'cause It's awsome","timestamp_created":1461056045,"timestamp_updated":1461056045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22510791","author":{"steamid":"76561198156007081","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2713,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1393,"last_played":1507561055},"language":"german","review":"Der lang ersehnte Nachfolger des Spieles Portal, das mit seinem Neuartigen Spielkonzept begeistert hat, ist, wie sein Vorgänger, den man unbedingt zuerst gespielt haben muss, ein first-person-puzzlespiel entwickelt von Valve.\nDas spiel punktet mit sehr guter Grafik(2715x1920P) und läuft trotz hoher Grafikeinstellungen auf den meisten PCs flüssig.

Nach dem Spielen es ersten Teils war ich mir etwas unsicher, ob man diesen riesigen Erfolg noch toppen kann; und ja, man kann.\nSo ist das Spiel Portal 2 nicht nur deutlich umfangreicher (Teil 1 ~ 3 Stunden, Teil 2 ~ 7 Stunden), sondern knüpft an die Story aus dem ersten Teil perfekt an, wobei der Humor ebenso gut ist wie im ersten Teil. Des Weiteren erhöht sich in diesem Teil die Schwierigkeit um ein ganzes Level, sodass die Rätsel nie unschaffbar, aber auch selten zu leicht sind. Insgesamt ein extrem gelungenes Spiel, bei welchem sich die Investition auf jeden Fall lohnt.","timestamp_created":1461009375,"timestamp_updated":1461009375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22504080","author":{"steamid":"76561198258109614","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":417,"last_played":1599589818},"language":"french","review":"Indispensable, tout comme le premier opus (plus court, mais tout aussi bon).","timestamp_created":1461007307,"timestamp_updated":1461007307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22503417","author":{"steamid":"76561198243847092","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":778,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1652206909},"language":"russian","review":"отличная игра)","timestamp_created":1461004867,"timestamp_updated":1461004867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22502444","author":{"steamid":"76561198147223044","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":531,"last_played":1597270543},"language":"polish","review":"+ Można się pobawić ze znajomym\n\n- Bez niego to nie to samo","timestamp_created":1461001730,"timestamp_updated":1461001730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22500320","author":{"steamid":"76561198117606780","num_games_owned":515,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":593,"last_played":1460993924},"language":"russian","review":"Gaben, Portal 3 please!!!","timestamp_created":1460994180,"timestamp_updated":1460994180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.632764995098114014","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwusCCldQCcL7qVQ=="}
