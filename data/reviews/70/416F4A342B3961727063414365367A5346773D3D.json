There isn't much of a focus on the multiplayer, but the singleplayer campaign/story mode is great. You play as a theoretical physicist named Dr. Gordon Freeman, a badass nerd who loves kickin' ass and bashing crates. But he's all out of crates. He works at Black Mesa, a facility-science-company-thing where people do stuff. A lot of the work is with the military, so because of that they build devices such as turrets, weapons, etc. However, they also have a large focus on science and physics, and they are big competitors with Aperture Science (from Portal). Anyways, one day shit goes down and Freeman is right smack in the middle of it.\n\nThe Half-Life series as a whole is a great FPS experience. A lot of it involves taking advantage of your environments against your enemies. There's also a lot involving physics, especially in the second game with the Source engine.\n\nSpeaking of the Source engine, there's also another version of this game which runs on Source. It's mostly just a direct port, but if you play Garry's Mod, it's nice to have it so you can use it's resources in-game. However, this version (the original) has support for standalone mods, which HL:S doesn't.\n\nIf you're considering getting into the Half-Life series, the second game stands well on it's on without having to have played the first game to understand, but the original is still a great game and fun to play, so I highly recommend it. If you plan on getting this and aren't sure which one to get, then I recommend the Source version simply because it looks a little nicer and is a little more up to date, as long as you understand you can't get mods for it.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, well, the series doesn't have much of a focus on that, and since this runs on the GoldSrc engine (heavily modified version of the Quake engine), the multiplayer feels and plays very similar to Quake multiplayer, in terms of pace and gameplay. If you're mainly interested in the multiplayer, I recommend getting Quake III Arena, a multiplayer-only version of Quake which is pretty cool.\n\nAlso, if you're not a fan of FPS's and are very skeptical about this game, I'd like to go ahead and say that this game is amazing even if you're not that big of a fan of modern first-person shooters. I recommended this game to my friend Pokaymon, who played a lot of Portal, and even though he didn't have much interest in FPS's, he grew to like and enjoy this game. Speaking of Portal, this game takes place in the same universe as it. Portal initially started as a side-game to Half-Life when it launched with the Orange Box, but then it gained a lot of popularity so they made a sequel.\n\nAll in all:\n\nIf you aren't a fan of FPS's, I recommend trying this game or HL:S anyways if you're feeling open-minded.\n\nIf you're a fan of FPS's and are okay with a singleplayer experience with a lesser focus in multiplayer, I also recommend trying this game.\n\nIf you're a fan of multiplayer FPS's and don't care for singleplayer campaign, I recommend Quake III Arena or Half-Life Deathmatch: Source.\n\nIn general....\n\nI rate this game 10 bouncing Gmen out of 10.","timestamp_created":1381449693,"timestamp_updated":1381449693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7354804","author":{"steamid":"76561198097848741","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":37,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1396037442},"language":"russian","review":"Классическая история про всеми любимого молчуна :)","timestamp_created":1381434862,"timestamp_updated":1381434862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502982079982757568","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7353529","author":{"steamid":"76561198017110485","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":76911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":50,"playtime_at_review":56816,"last_played":1660492583},"language":"english","review":"The greatest classic competitive Arena FPS of all time, combined with an amazing storyline and gameplay mechanics, such as bunnyhopping, gauss-boosting and others.","timestamp_created":1381423661,"timestamp_updated":1511377650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.727077186107635498","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7348991","author":{"steamid":"76561197970216292","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1528097693},"language":"english","review":"The game that started everything for me, and more than half the world.

E esse sucesso todo começou a partir da popularização deste jogo de tiro e seus divertidíssimos Mods, como o popular Counter Strike e o genial Team Fortress. Half-Life foi considerado em 1998 como melhor jogo do ano por diversas revistas e outras mídias especializadas em games da época. Ao jogá-lo em pleno ano de 2012, praticamente 15 anos após sua data de lançamento original, senti exatamente tudo o que havia sido descrito por aquelas revistas. O jogo consiste em um FPS (Jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa) que mistura um clima de survival horror com um enredo de ficção científica muito rico e detalhado, que é inteligentemente apresentado ao jogador em meio a todos aqueles combates frenéticos e explosões alucinantes, o que torna toda a experiência muito mais imersiva e realista (algo que simplesmente não existia nos jogos de tiro da época, diga-se de passagem).\n\nVocê controla Gordon Freeman, um cientista com Ph.D em Física Teórica em seu primeiro dia de trabalho na Black Mesa, um laboratório secreto onde o protagonista fará uma experiência com materiais anômalos. O jogo começa dentro de uma cabine sobre trilhos com uma voz feminina que apresenta e descreve o laboratório. Tudo aquilo é tão novo e fantástico para o jogador quanto é para Gordon, que é um sujeito silencioso, quieto, míope, alguém que não aparenta ter nada de especial, e é justamente isso que faz com que você se identifique com ele. Seu silêncio, que dura até o fim do jogo, é uma característica meio clichê oriunda de jogos como Legend of Zelda, mas é também um recurso que possibilita ao jogador dar personalidade a Gordon, personalidade esta que vai sendo transformada em uma imagem a ser seguida, um símbolo de herói. Quando você perceber, aquele sujeito que aparentava ser apenas um nerdão azarado se mostra um homem inspirador e corajoso, características que só poderiam ser acentuadas devido às grandes provações que o Sr. Freeman passa ao longo da aventura.\n\nO dia do nosso amigo “barbudo” começa como um tormento e termina como um inferno. Gordon chega atrasado, mexe onde não deve, é tratado com apatia pelos outros cientistas e ainda destrói o micro-ondas da empresa. Após vestir-se com sua armadura que o protege de impactos, radiações e grandes alturas, Gordon manipula um cristal desconhecido em uma experiência que acaba destruindo todo o laboratório e abrindo um portal que traz alienígenas capazes de desmembrar pessoas em poucos segundos e parasitá-los a ponto de tomar seus corpos por completo.\n\nPara piorar, o governo estadunidense toma nota do acidente e, como sempre, decide “ajudar” enviando seu exército para eliminar todas as possíveis evidências do ocorrido, incluindo os sobreviventes que são mortos com muito sangue frio e sadismo pelos soldados, é claro. E para lutar por sua sobrevivência, Gordon enfrenta todos esses desafios… e não apenas sobrevive, como também se infiltra no planeta dos alienígenas e os liberta do controle de uma criatura superior com grande intelecto e poder. Entretanto, um misterioso homem com uma maleta é uma peça fundamental de todo o intrigante mistério de Half-Life, e ele fará uma oferta irrecusável ao já exausto Gordon Freeman.\n\nBem, isso é só parte do complexo enredo contido em Half-Life. Tudo isso pode estar parecendo uma viagem muito louca, mas tenha a certeza de que ao longo da jogatina, todas as situações apresentadas se mostrarão bastante convincentes.\n\nUm dos pontos fortes de Half-Life com toda a certeza são os cenários, que são muito ricos de detalhes para o padrão do final dos anos 90, e até mesmo para os dias de hoje. Talvez muitos discordem, mas eu enxergo claras e inegáveis influências do clássico Super Metroid aqui e ali, principalmente no level design dos capítulos, que fazem o jogador explorar, saltar e matar aliens tal qual Samus Aran faz, e nos próprios gráficos, que lembram bastante algumas etapas do planeta Zebes. Em teoria, Half-Life foi influenciado por Super Metroid, e posteriormente influenciou Metroid Prime (primeiro jogo em 3D da série, em FPS).\n\nJá os modelos poligonais dos personagens envelheceram um pouco mal, principalmente os modelos dos cientistas, que apresentam por exemplo, cabelos simples demais que rapidamente seriam superados por outros jogos no ano seguinte. Os alienígenas, entretanto, são bem detalhados e aproveitam muito bem as formas mais quadradonas da época para adquirirem um aspecto bizarro, assustador e ao mesmo tempo… nojento e diferenciado. Sério, se deparar com um cientista que tem um alienígena acoplado a sua cabeça, com garras cheias de sangue de suas vítimas e um abdômen aberto que se movimenta como uma boca com todos os seus órgãos expostos não é o tipo de coisa que eu imaginaria encontrar em meu primeiro dia de trabalho.\n\nA Jogabilidade é uma mistura com boas doses de ação, exploração e tensão, tudo isso colocado na medida certa. O protagonista mata aliens com um pé de cabra, explode barris de gasolina, rouba metralhadoras e espingardas dos soldados e os mata escondendo-se atrás de caixas e pilares… mas também destrói a entrada de dutos de ventilação, dá saltos sobre-humanos, sobe grandes alturas e toma grande sustos quando um Alien pula em sua direção em locais mal iluminados. Aliás, um grande diferencial é a lanterna da armadura, um dos primeiros efeitos de iluminação dinâmica feitos em um videogame, que além de colaborar para o clima de suspense, também é importantíssimo para a jogabilidade e a exploração dos caminhos. O jogo não possui mapas, mas o excelente level design sempre conduz o jogador aos caminhos corretos e itens importantes.\n\nA Trilha sonora de Half-Life deve ser analisada com muito cuidado. O jogo é bastante silencioso, e na maior parte do tempo ouviremos apenas os sons dos alienígenas, como seus barulhos de ataque e grunhidos bizarros. As músicas surgem em momentos específicos, geralmente acompanhando trechos muito importantes deste FPS, e mesmo sendo poucos, os temas são de altíssima qualidade. Tenho predileção pela excelente Nuclear Mission Jam e pela Música tema do Menu principal.\n\nO silêncio da maior parte do game colabora para a tensão e os sustos causados pelos aliens, além de nos guiar e nos alertar dos perigos. Acredite ou não, Half-Life é um jogo que deve ser jogado também com a nossa audição, pois é possível evitar muitos danos ao ouvir os movimentos dos inimigos. Parece loucura, mas o jogador poderá até identificar inimigos próximos através de alguns sons característicos, já que a maior parte dos alienígenas não são lá muito discretos.\n\nHalf-Life é um FPS muito a frente de seu tempo e é também uma proeza técnica inimaginável para o seu ano de lançamento. A Valve e a  Sierra Games conseguiram construir uma aventura incrivelmente alucinante e imersiva, sendo um verdadeiro bálsamo para o meu conturbado período de estudos.\n\nPara aqueles que se interessaram pelo jogo, é possível adquiri-lo pelo Steam por algo próximo de 17 reais (ou puxar pelo torrent… igual o meu chefe safado vai fazer com Half Life 2, que ganhou neste final de semana na VGA 2012, nada mais que o prêmio de melhor jogo da década). Caso você não tenha gostado dos modelos poligonais mais arcaicos do game, é possível ativar o Hi-def model pack que dá uma boa melhorada nos personagens clicando AQUI ou comprar o Half-Life: Source, uma versão mais atualizada do jogo original feita na engine Source, totalmente remasterizada digitalmente.\n\nPara aqueles que querem uma mudança mais radical, existe um remake feito por fãs chamado Black Mesa. O jogo é fantástico, uma versão totalmente reimaginada do incidente. Entretanto, se você for um jogador mais cri-cri que deseja ter a mesma experiência do jogo original, lembre-se de que este Mod apresenta mudanças significativas no level design, além de uma trilha sonora feita por Joel Nielsen e a jogabilidade atual.","timestamp_created":1381006308,"timestamp_updated":1659009399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7310955","author":{"steamid":"76561198052818701","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1202,"last_played":1407861279},"language":"german","review":"Half-Life ist ein toller Ego- Shooter  er ist zwar schon etwas älter aber das macht vielen anscheinend nichts aus. Mir ist es auch egal das Half-Life schon etwas älter ist das hindert mich nicht daran es zu spielen. Ich finde Half-Life ist eines der wenigen spiele die nach meiner Meinung nach jeder haben sollte. Da es einfach nur toll ist. Die Story ist einfach nur genial gemacht und ich finde das Spiel baut durch das ganze Spiel durch eine unbeschreibliche Spannung auf die nicht mehr nach lässt. So spielt man vor sich hin und fragt sich immer wieder was passiert hinter der nächsten Ecke oder was kommt auf mich zu wenn ich mit dem Fahrstuhl unten ankomme.

Half-Life is a classic.\nYou are a scientist called Gordon Freeman. One day you are involved in a critical test which goes terribly wrong and opens portals to the boarderland Xen. From that moment on, aliens invade earth and you find yourself in chaos and try to get out alive.\n\nThe singleplayer was revolutionary at the time because it has a continious story without cutscenes. I also like that there are a lot of enemy-types. The weapons are all really balanced (except gluongun) and fun to use. The story develops as you proceed in the game. It gets more and more mysterious and suspense.\nIn Half-Life you are mostly on your own and travel through many interessting environments. Sometimes the maps can be a bit confusing but in the end you will have a nice final and it feels great to finish the game.\n\nIn my opinion Half-Life's multiplayer is very very good. I played it a very long time and it has a great learning-curve. In Half-Life you have very dynamic gameplay with fast movement, air-control, excessive wallbanging and spawnkilling. It can be a really great feel to dominate and control the whole map. In Half-Life you can play many styles.. aggressive like a berserker but also slow and silent. It's possible to break the enemies advantage by clever ambushing and by hitting well aimed headshots. Since there are many different weapons you can always find different ways to deal with your enemy. Each weapon is very different and good in special situations. Also the maps are all very different to each other. Each map has it's own great design and unique gameplay.\n\nConclusion:\nI recommend you to try Half-Life on LAN with friends, because it's a lot of fun to play against enemies of equal skill. Since it has a great learning-curve you have to get into the game a bit.\nIf you want to play online I recommend you to edit your config-file so you can have a field of view of 110 degrees and direct weapon-bindings. On most servers (Adrenaline Gamer Mod) you can use bunnyhop. Since they patched Half-Life you are no longer able to code bunnyhop-scripts in your config. So if you want a working bhop you have to use a macro programm like autohotkey or maybe your keyboard-driver. The other easier way to use bhop is to disable automatic updates and patch back half-life to an older version (still works online).\nHalf-Life has a lot of mods and there is a lot of custom content (player and weapon-models, maps, effects and hud-elements). I recommend you to install good visible custom crosshairs and use simple explosion sprites.\nRegarding mods I can recommend you Adrenaline Gamer, Sven-Coop 3.0 (because it has the original Half-Life weapons and basicly is a coop mod for Half-Life), The Specialists (a Matrix-styled mod) and Frontline Force.\nThere are also a lot great singleplayer mods. I can recommend you Half-Life Invasion, Escape from the Darkness, Paranoia, Todesangst, ETC 1 and 2, Sweet Half-Life and a lot more.\nSeriously there are a lot good mods out there..\nAll in all for me this game is a must have. So if you don't mind the old graphics and take some time to understand the game.. I think you will like it!","timestamp_created":1376384135,"timestamp_updated":1396032213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592717468738555908","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6412331","author":{"steamid":"76561198065740324","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":146,"last_played":1501002143},"language":"english","review":"The best FPS game of it's time, and still one of the best today.","timestamp_created":1376265733,"timestamp_updated":1376265733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6658268","author":{"steamid":"76561198071653175","num_games_owned":332,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":1058,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":864,"last_played":1376210699},"language":"english","review":"Ok, real talk, how does Gordon even know how guns work?

But even if I didn't have that frame of reference, Half-Life would still be a solid action game and brilliant shooter.\n\nWhile it initially seems like a cookie-cutter FPS, it seems to do everything right; the AI holds up well; every gun feels satisfying to use; the map design is phenomenal, being interesting and encouraging exploration without ever getting you lost; the pacing of the gameplay is absolutely perfect, knowing when you're about to get bored and when you need to relax after some heavy action (and so on and so forth, I can go on forever).\n\nThere is one weakpoint. I notice that the Half-Life series is quite well known for its story. While the setting is brilliantly original and the game is very immersive as a whole, I think its story is well overrated. What the hell is up with the G-Man? It feels like he is someone they can drop in and out of the story whenever they like; he seems to have unlimited powers to change the game universe and that really erodes away the supernatural mechanics of the game's narrative. Furthermore, the story mostly consists of you going from point A to B, without really knowing what's going on. They could have dropped in a bit more characterisation to say the least.\n\nBut you know what? I will give it a pass on that point. They carried the setting very well and everything else fit well. Story is not the key draw of this game, and it taught me that you don't need a good story to make a highly immersive, sweeping adventure. So while it was less-than-satisfactory in this regard, I am willing to ignore it as it achieved the results of a good story without having a very good one at all; namely, a great deal of player immersion into the game's universe.\n\nI admit I was sceptical coming to Half-Life, but by the end of it I realise why it was seen as a watershed for the FPS genre and a landmark for the history of video games at large. If there were one amazing FPS to define a genre, it would be Half-Life. Even today, it is still a good example of what we expect from a first-person shooter; and deservedly so.","timestamp_created":1375924706,"timestamp_updated":1375924706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491139233112335205","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6669687","author":{"steamid":"76561198071955492","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":3235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1704,"last_played":1375931865},"language":"english","review":"Wow.

Althougth these games are not comparable, the experience I had playing them was fenomenal, beautiful and I just can't express it in words. \nYou have got to play Half Life. It starts to get a little tedious and nerve wrecking during the middle of the game making you having to force yourself to beat it. That is the hardest part of this game. Trying to convince yourself that after that hole game you will recieve a compensation. That's why people don't like this game. If you aren't strong enought to force yourself into it, you aren't gonna get the same experience so, you are gonna quit the game. You see, Gordon Freeman is forcing himself to do his mission, it's obvious that if he could, he would just not do the mission and don't care (just like alot of people do to this game). That's why you gotta force yourself. And after doing that you get the feeling that you are Gordon and that YOU have to save the world and force yourself into it. You feel imersed in a game like never before. Probably one of the most imersive games ever created. \nBut the ending just... Wow. It blew my mind.
