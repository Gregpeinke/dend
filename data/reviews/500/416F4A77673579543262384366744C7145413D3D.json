Well developed, straight-forward gameplay, L4D features everything that you would expect from a zombie shooter. The game is focused on its multiplayer aspect, but also includes single player campaign. L4D does have some shortcomings such as a limited selection of weapons and predictable enemy spawning. Still, L4D has become a sensation and a standard for zombie-styled co-op.","timestamp_created":1380526583,"timestamp_updated":1385409566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":60,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.713352560997009277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7251241","author":{"steamid":"76561198097043394","num_games_owned":1068,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":205394,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189792,"last_played":1653159650},"language":"brazilian","review":"O_O","timestamp_created":1380499824,"timestamp_updated":1542861831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557046949863433838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7286568","author":{"steamid":"76561198105904644","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":9499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2933,"last_played":1564363287},"language":"portuguese","review":"Jogo muito bom e não cansa de jogar\nPARABENS PELO JOGO VALVE :D","timestamp_created":1380487433,"timestamp_updated":1380487433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7217837","author":{"steamid":"76561198093494721","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1444909501},"language":"english","review":"it's cool game.

Убиватель...нет-нет-нет...уничтожитель времени в квадрате. Игра, подарившая мне тысячи часов приятного времени в компании верных и иногда чокнутых товарищей, которые готовы были умереть за меня, но спасти, а где потроллить, запульнув метко коктейль молотова. Это игра абсурда, бесконечного рэйджа, столь же эпичного фэйла, сколь и вина. Там где нужна была тактика мы бросали все нахуй и старались прыгнуть на заветные 25 самым тупым и очевидным способом а-ля \"а вдруг прокатит)))\". Там где надо было действовать осторожно мы тупо агрили ведьму и ржали над тем как тиммейт-неудачник, патается спасти свою жопу, спрыгивая от нее с крыши дома. Там где надо было высирать кирпичи мы, улюлюкая, ломились вперед на танка с пистолетом и тут же ложились от его метко подкинутой машины. Там где надо было продержаться хоть чуток мы, послав все нахуй в потоке бесконечного рейджа, прыгали в шахту лифта. Там где надо было держась за руки идти вперед по неизведанной территории мы тупо писали в чат \"мне похуй я рашу\" и убегали прочь, агря всё и вся для своих любимых товарищей. Там где надо было зайти в убежище и закрыть дверь на железный засов, мы блять выебывались и старались показыть скилл выходя с 1 хп, умирая от прилетевшего хуй згнает откуда хантера на 25 (роооооооок).  Кооператив здесь не просто фича, это амфетамин вызывающий зависимость. Эта игра подарила мне больше чем развлечение, она открыла двери в бескрайний мир игрового комьюнити, где я нашел таких же единомышленников, готовых на все ради не только игры, но и фана.

Командный сурвайвл подразумевал не просто войну стенка на стенку, а именно командную игру, так как есть возможность поднимать упавшего товарища а также лечение напарников, играя за выживших и монстров тактика была абсолютно разной, скилл набивался как за выживших так и за монстров. Сам игровой процесс подразумевает команде выживших дойти от пункта А в пункт Б, а команде монстров задача не дать им дойти до этого самого пункта Б. В целом всё просто но за счёт именно реальных игроков и создаётся атмосфера, тактика, приколы итд. \n\nНа данный момент игра слегка постарела в ней нет Full HD\nЯ воспринимаю её как Альфа версию в серии L4D\nЭта игра должна быть в коллекции у уважающих себя геймеров.

This game right here. You know before I start playing this masterpiece I played lots and lots of Gmod  and all Half Life games so I would be familiar what a game made with source engine looks like. So when I played this game I was absolutely shocked. It looks and feels nothing like a source game would do, and that’s a good thing! It feels so fresh, realistic and unique. \n\nLeft 4 Dead remains one of my favorite games ever in the top 5 of all time.\nWhat I like about the game:\n\n+Well written characters, and IMO the only zombie game/movie has the best characters fit for that genre\n+Beautiful atmosphere\n+Rich made maps. IMO better than the sequel\n+Moddable, just not workshop :(\n+Mature/serious theme setting. IMO WAAAAAY BETTER than L4D2 setting. The sequel is present at Southern America so expect hillbilly themed crap (no offense). The first game (this) have mature setting, night setting and serious, and very fitting for a horror zombie game imo. I’m really upset the developers went to that direction for the sequel\n+Zoey's voice actor! A legend who voiced Cortana from Halo and Peach from Super Mario.\n+Spine-chilling soundtracks and ambience \n+Fun and intense gameplay\n+Endless replay value\n+Fun Co-op. I usually play with bots because I'm a loser and it's better this way, the immersion is just there. Wanna play offline? You could. With friends? Sure. But completely SOLO?? Well it requires few steps but it's so challenging and immersive. And unbalanced.\n+The zombies\\infected are satisfying to kill because of their dismemberment\n\nWhat I dislike about the game:\n\n-The special zombies are too over powered for solo. Okay, I understand the series is meant for co-op, but ATLEAST on solo modes they should redesign special zombies, like to repeatedly mash buttons to bash them while they're attacking you (for example when hunter pouncing on you) or something.\n-The maps are very lacking. They should do more work more than just 5 maps. Yes, 5 official campaign maps! But it's acceptable for me.\n\n10/10\nIt's not perfect but it might as well be a masterpiece for me","timestamp_created":1375126674,"timestamp_updated":1636792753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1853045","author":{"steamid":"76561197998870434","num_games_owned":696,"num_reviews":134,"playtime_forever":1144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1144,"last_played":86400},"language":"spanish","review":"JORGE JAVIER VÁZQUEZ PRACTICA PARKOUR EN LA CIUDAD PROHIBIDA","timestamp_created":1375113186,"timestamp_updated":1495753456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568965494632720947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5488865","author":{"steamid":"76561198050627298","num_games_owned":311,"num_reviews":200,"playtime_forever":1135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1135,"last_played":1428712470},"language":"english","review":"Fun to play, specially with friends.
