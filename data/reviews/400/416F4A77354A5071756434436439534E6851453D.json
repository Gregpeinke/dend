As a test subject, Chell will be put through a series of puzzles and tests as she reaches the end of the course. She uses a portal gun, the main mechanic of the game, that allows her to place portals, a kind of wormhole system, on certain types of walls allowing instantaneous transportation from different parts of a single room. Along the way she is harassed by GLaDOS, Aperture's artificial intelligence that seems to control the whole operation.\n\nThis is mainly a puzzle game. During play you are exposed to a series of different levels and have to figure out how to get through each one. You have the aforementioned portal gun that you must use and understand how it works to be effective. Physics also play a part as well, such as timing of jumps and so on.\n\nThe game is on the shorter side. The first play-through will likely take at least a few hours considering the amount of time it takes to figure out the puzzles. But the shorter length of the game actually turns out to be one of its strengths. It is definitely not the type of game that feels like it overstays its welcome. Every level you go through introduces something new to do, so there is no feeling of repetitiveness or getting bored. The puzzles themselves are challenging enough to be fun, but not too challenging as to frustrate the player.\n\nBeing a 10 year-old game, the graphics may not be up to par with what one would expect by today's standards. However, this actually turns out to be a strength of the game as well. The environments in the game are typically clean-cut test chambers, so it is never anything graphic-intensive. This is especially helpful for me as I do not have a souped-up gaming machine, but [i]Portal[/i] runs perfectly smoothly on my more standard-fare laptop.\n\nThe writing is also a surprisingly strong aspect of this game, despite it primarily being a puzzle game. There are only two real characters, Chell and GLaDOS, with Chell being a silent protagonist. However, GLaDOS, portrayed by Ellen McLain, adds a certain black humor to the game with her often sarcastic comments. It is certainly a great addition to the game and really helps make it much more memorable than a standard puzzle game would have been.\n\n[i]Portal[/i] is a true classic video game from Valve. It is a must play for anyone that likes puzzle games. Its short length makes it easy enough to get through in a day, or even less, but the achievements available do allow for some replayability.","timestamp_created":1505514093,"timestamp_updated":1591150479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34980031","author":{"steamid":"76561198098049145","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":153,"last_played":1524942420},"language":"english","review":"What a great game!

I loved the cute and yet bloodthirsty gunbots with their somewhat odd remarks when defeated and GLADOS's awkward humour added to the experience. I found the the graphics a bit off but then for ten years ago they are amazing! There is a real moral to the story though, GLADOS only has one thing in mind, get it done, with no concern for how Chell feels about this. This is what the world would be like without ethics.

That was it?\"\n\nMy second thought was, \"... That... I guess that was it.\"\n\nMy third thought was, \"Holy shit, they have Portal 2. I have to buy that NOW.\"\n\nThe first installment of Valve's Portal was surprisingly short. I played perhaps 3 hours of it prior to finishing the game. However, in these 3 hours, I have experienced something so damn refreshing in video games, I almost willed myself to forget everything simply so I could play it again: its originality.\n\nNo one has ever concieved such a weapon as a portal gun prior to Valve, and if they had, no one has heard of it. It's such a remarkable tool, on such interesting maps; I quite loved it. You were given a story, a ton of puzzles, and a brilliant concept that I have no doubt was fleshed more fully out in Portal 2.\n\nI feel that the first Portal was an experiment with the overall concept. The story is simply too short, and what I expected to be the prologue was the entire game itself.\n\nDon't get me wrong; the story is fascinating. It's all simply... too short.\n\nBut, it's still a good run for your money. You have to complete 19 puzzles in all, including some extras. The graphics are nothing to boast about, but they are high quality enough for you to still be completely immersed inside the game.
