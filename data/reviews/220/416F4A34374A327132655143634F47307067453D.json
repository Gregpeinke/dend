Recommended, but it's a very close call.\n\nI've somehow missed all Half Life games, except from Half Life 1 demo, which I played as a kid years ago, so now I am trying to catch up with this legend. Half Life 1 was like a time trip, very satysfying old school game, but this one, I don't know. There is hughe improvement in certain aspects of the game, mainly characters and their backstories. First Half Life wasn't really about characters, it was \"shoot all you see\" most of the time. In this one I really enjoyed Alyx, Eli and others (mostly Alyx to be honest). Graphics is another improvement and it still looks okay in 2018 (well, if you are not 10 year old kid who has never seen anything older than Cry Engine 4). Also I like idea of world which turned into dystopian big brother something. What else? Vehicles were nice little addition to the game.\nWhat brings this game down is terrible gunplay. Honestly, guns are so imbalanced, shotgun is your best friend here, SMG is way too weak, on longer ranges pistol is more accurate than anything else, you can only aim from hip, grenades are joke, explosion physics is another joke (it's funny how stuff after explosion is flying across the room like a crazy and bouncing numerous times hurting you), using grenade launcher or RPG from behind cover is epic fail cause it seems it doesn't matter how you aim, launched grenade or rocket will always explode immediatly so you will end up killing yourself etc... \nThe biggest issue of HL 2 is artificial difficulty. In review of HL 1 I mentioned that enemies are occasionally spawning to your back, well HL2 is all about spawning enemies around you on whatever place you can't see at the moment. Spawn based system of enemies was literaly ruining whole game for me, I checked room and was like \"okay, nobody there\", then turned around and I was suddenly under fire from very same place I just checked. On some places spawn of enemies is infinite so it's just waste of ammo until you'll figure out that only way how to move on is run. They can hit you under insane angles with turret machine gun, while you have limited field of aim after mounting it. They can aim on you instantly through numerous obstacles and hit you even if tiny piece of you is not covered. On the other hand, you are recieving a lot of supplies, health and ammo everywhere you are so it's security break from game being too unfair and frustrating, however I still see this as poor game design. I can't say good things about AI either, after you'll get to part of game when you can command squad of rebels you'll find they are completely useles and they are just running around you, randomly shouting \"follow the Freeman\" or \"I am reloading\" (even though no single shot was fired) and having difficulty to aim on enemies, its just clueless running around and dying miserably most of the time. \n\nSo, considering the fact this game is supposed to be a shooter, it does really poor job with guns. I guess Valve tried to make it challenging, but they couldn't think about anything different than putting the player into serious disadvantage. And after all of that, ending is ridiculously easy comparing to other parts of game. It's not that bad really, but HL 1 is whole another dimension, despite all characters and graphics in this one.","timestamp_created":1532379700,"timestamp_updated":1532379724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43704704","author":{"steamid":"76561198829044173","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":752,"last_played":1545593889},"language":"english","review":"My first PC game, very good and fun.

They are very good by today's standards, and excellent by the standards of its time. The ability to choose difficulty makes it easier for casual players and more challenging for experts. The Combine are very unique, because they use human soldiers rather than alien soldiers despite being from another universe. They also use synths, which are alien creatures modified by technology. Previous Xen creatures including headcrabs and Vortigaunts return. However, this time, the Vortigaunts are on our side. The lore is more in-depth than the previous game as well. While Half-Life was a good game that was slightly below average, Half-Life 2 is a great game far above average. It clears up the story of the other game and tells what happened in between the games.

Me gusta cómo se van generando sentimientos hacia los personajes que se presentan en la historia, llegándoles a agarrar cariño o desprecio. La ambientación está bien lograda y los gráficos son comunes, no esperen los del GTA 5 o algo así, son comunes.\nLas físicas son buenas y están bien hechas, buena jugabilidad y controles (sencillos y comunes), tiene puzles entretenidos, bastantes horas de juego, y batallas interesantes contra enemigos de todo tipo.\n\nSinceramente no pensé que este juego estaría tan bueno, me cerró la boca, y eso se merece mucho reconocimiento.
