They often bring the games into a more modern state that make them run better on newer computers and work better on exotic setups. GoldSrc is proprietary and does not offer any of this, and it's also still using the old Vert- FOV BS that games have been using for the past 20+ years. This poses a serious problem when playing at any aspect ratio above 4:3. Additionally, Deathmatch Classic does not offer anything significant over the original Quake 1 deathmatch. All it is is a lazy port of Quake to the outdated GoldSrc engine. It doesn't even have the fun bhopping physics of the original. \n\nIn conclusion, while it is worth more than the $5 asking price, it's only when not considering it's superior competitors which you can get [b][i]free of charge[/i][/b]. This isn't Valve's creation and the id Software fanbase is already offering a better experience. You can literally download the nQuake source port and be playing online in seconds without paying a single penny and it comes with the Team Fortress mod included for servers that support it, rendering Deathmatch Classic 100% obsolete. Fan-made idTech source ports being FOSS means that they offer unmatched levels of customization. The original shareware releases of Quake, plus the HD modpacks etc, already contain all the assets you need to play online.\n\nThere is absolutely zero reason to invest money in DMC, and unless you're trying to get the entire Valve collection for bragging rights, you are wasting your money.","timestamp_created":1627610923,"timestamp_updated":1650916749,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571322381496429443","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96306856","author":{"steamid":"76561198396491731","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":102,"playtime_forever":8,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1535672495},"language":"english","review":"You

game saved my life.\n\nI am 38.\n\nMy ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realise that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1625281147,"timestamp_updated":1625281147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421112656593322754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94876752","author":{"steamid":"76561198191394987","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1622977964},"language":"turkish","review":"broken

So, Half-Life is based on a tweaked version of the idTech engine used for Quake, and Deathmatch Classic is literally Valve's take on Quake. I say take, but it's literally just Half-Life mechanics with Quake maps. Quite frankly, it doesn't work, just because it didn't feel like they accounted for the map designs and Quake's original mechanics when adding in the Half-Life mechanics. Not to mention, many people aren't playing this game anymore, while you'll see more people playing Quake these days. Overall, get Quake and get a multiplayer source port, and not this.","timestamp_created":1622499770,"timestamp_updated":1622499770,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498108536005020142","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92868824","author":{"steamid":"76561198869442525","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":258,"last_played":1609660973},"language":"russian","review":"–í–µ—Å–µ–ª–∞—è –∏ –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏—á–Ω–∞—è –∏–≥—Ä–∞. –ú–∏–Ω—É—Å —Ç—É—Ç –æ–¥–∏–Ω –∂–∏—Ä–Ω—ã–π –¥–ª—è –º—É–ª—å—Ç–∏–ø–ª–µ–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π –∏–≥—Ä—ã, –æ—Ç—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –ª—é–¥–µ–π –≤ –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–º –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ. –° –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è–º–∏ –ø–æ–≥–æ–Ω—è—Ç—å –≤–µ—Å–µ–ª–æ. –ù–æ –≤–æ–∑–≤—Ä–∞—â–∞—Ç—å—Å—è —á–∞—Å—Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Ö–æ—á–µ—Ç—Å—è. –ù–∞ –≤–µ—á–µ—Ä–æ–∫ –ø–æ–±–∞–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è.","timestamp_created":1622381706,"timestamp_updated":1622381706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92767942","author":{"steamid":"76561198861582365","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2310,"last_played":1576757470},"language":"russian","review":"–ù—É —Å –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è–º–∏ –ø–æ–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ç—å –µ—â–µ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ, –≤–æ—Ç —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –±—ã–ª–∏ –±—ã...","timestamp_created":1622255913,"timestamp_updated":1622255913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92423661","author":{"steamid":"76561198326674272","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":45,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1518961201},"language":"finnish","review":"10/10 better than tf2!","timestamp_created":1621705906,"timestamp_updated":1621705906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92416449","author":{"steamid":"76561197992490524","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1621946211},"language":"english","review":"Make no mistake; this game is definitely dead.
