Valves großer Durchbruch und die Mutter der modernen Ego-Shooter. Kaum ein anderes Spiel hatte einen so großen Einfluss auf die Spieleszene, wie dieser Titel. Selbst im Jahre 2016 macht es unglaublich viel Spaß, sich als Dr. Gordon Freeman durch das Firmengelände der Black Mesa zu kämpfen und die Welt zu retten. \n\n[u] Gameplay [/u]\n\nAls junger, ambitionierter Wissenschaftler beginnt man seine gewohnte Morgenroutine und muss direkt als Versuchskaninchen ein gefährliches Experiment mit unerforschten Mineralen durchführen. Man selbst spielt Dr. Gordon Freeman, der sich trotz seiner akademischen Bildung noch am unteren Ende der Firmenhierarchie der Black Mesa Facility befindet. Das an diesem Tag durchgeführte Experiment wird fatale Folgen haben. Aliens können durch eine Art Portal in die Institution eindringen und versuchen die Überhand zu gewinnen. Im Verlauf des Spieles muss man nicht nur gegen diese Außerirdischen durchsetzen, sondern auch gegen das Militär, welches versucht Alles und Jeden daran zu hindern, das Firmengelände zu verlassen. Mr. Freeman kann sich durch neue Waffen und seine Rüstung, den HEV, durchsetzen und bewahrt die Welt zu guter Letzt vor dem Untergang. \n\n[u] Retro durch und durch [/u]\n\nAlles, was Dr. Freeman braucht, ist sein HEVsuit und seine Pistole. Eine 4k Grafik ist für den Spielspaß und die Story besonders hier nicht von Nöten, sondern eher Kontraproduktiv. Bei der erzählten Geschichte sind ebenfalls klassische Elemente aufzufinden. So ist zum Beispiel der Spieler der Einzige, der in der Lage ist die Apokalypse abzuwenden. \nDie Optik des Spiels mag zwar itzund eher belächelt werden, aber gerade sie verleiht Half-Life seinen Charme.\n\n[u] Herausforderung, Action und Spaß zugleich [/u]\n\nDiesen Spagat haben bis jetzt nur wenige Spiele bewältigen können. Die Ausgewogenheit von Half-Life hinsichtlich der bereits genannten Punkte ist beachtenswert und für den Spieler deutlich fühlbar. Selbst wenn ein Level nicht absolviert werden konnte, man schon zum fünften Mal an der selben Stelle gescheitert ist oder der Boss unbesiegbar scheinen mag, kann der Spieler nicht aufgeben. Dabei färben Ehrgeiz und Ausdauer des Protagonisten auf den Spielenden ab. Daran ist deutlich zu erkennen, wie gut sich die Mehrheit der Spieler mit Gordon identifizieren können, was das Spiel noch sympathischer und realer erscheinen lässt.\nNichts kommt bei Half-Life zu kurz und Jeder kommt bei diesem Titel auf seine Kosten.\n\n[u] Klassikerbonus [/u]\n\nIch habe bereits erwähnt, dass Half-Life als Klassiker und Meilenstein bezeichnet und in den siebten Himmel gelobt wird. Dies ist jedoch nicht der Klassikerbonus, den viele andere Spiele erhalten. Lob und Anerkennung sind bei dem ersten Auftritt von Dr. Freeman auf jeden Fall angebracht und verdient. Viele Spieler (inklusive meiner Wenigkeit) sind der Meinung, dass Jeder, der von sich behauptet ein Gamer zu sein, die Half-Life-Reihe gespielt haben sollte. Dieser Gedanke ist aufgrund der vorhergegangenen Punkte weder unbegründet, noch übertrieben. \n\n[u]Wertung[/u]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Stroy[/b][u] 97/100[/u]\nVon Anfang bis Ende wird die Geschichte um die Black-Mesa-Facility ohne Unstimmigkeiten anschaulich erzählt.\n[*] [b] Grafik [/b][u] 90/100[/u]\nIm Vergleich zu damaligen Standards war die Grafik atemberaubend. Es ist klar, dass ein 18 Jahre altes Spiel mit der Optik moderner Bestseller nicht mithalten kann. Dennoch ist die Grafik stimmig und verleiht Half-Life Atmosphäre und Charme.\n[*] [b] Sound [/b] [u]98/100[/u]\nDer Sound macht genau das, was er machen soll. Er erzeugt in jeder Situation die passende Stimmung.\n[*] [b] Atmosphäre[/b] [u]97/100[/u]\nWie bereits angesprochen ist die Atmosphäre durch den perfekten Einsatz von Sound und Optik einmalig und auch in der heutigen Zeit ein Maßstab.\n[*] [b] Map [/b] [u] 96/100 [/u]\nWeitreichend und dennoch nicht unübersichtlich. \n[*][b] Spaß [/b] [u]100/100 [/u]\nEgal, wie oft man es durchgespielt hat, macht Half-Life durchgehend Spaß.\n[/list]\n[b] Gesamt[/b] [u] 96/100[/u]\n\n[u] Fazit [/u]\n\nAnhand der aufgezählten Eigenschaften von Half-Life muss ich zum Ende meiner Rezension eine klare [b]Kaufempfehlung[/b] aussprechen. Seiner nicht mehr zeitgemäßen Grafik zum Trotz ist dieser Titel auch heutzutage noch spielenswert und ein Muss. Die abstruse Story und die innovativen, schier unbegrenzten Möglichkeiten machen HL zu einem der besten Spiele aller Zeiten. \nNicht zuletzt verdanken wir alle diesem Spiel andere heißgeliebte Spiele, wie zum Beispiel \"CounterStrike\" oder \"Day of Defeat\".\n\n[spoiler]ACHTUNG: In Deutschland ist auf Steam nur die geschnittene Fassung erhältlich. Durch Communitymods kann aber auch in der BRD die volle Bandbreite an Unterhaltung genossen werden.

There is a lot I have to say, and while most of it will seem a bit negative, I wish to start this review with the preface that I throughly enjoyed the game. While I don't think it is the best thing in the world, it doesn't stray away from the fact that I had a lot of fun.\n\n\nI'll start with what I loved about it. I lovcd the characters, the guns, the Sci-Fi elements (by that i mean it feels actually Sci-Fi and not science fantasy). The level designs in general were pretty great, and a lot of it had me thinking as to where I should be going next.\n\n\nI will go on to what I really didn't like. There seemed to be really no personality with the scientists and security guards (while I understand this is an old game, this is coming from someone using a modern perspective and not a nostalgic one). I have not played Black Mesa yet, but I hope they addressed this issue. I also didn't like some parts of the level design, like for example, in one of the later levels, the only way to progress to the next section is a very difficult hole to spot which from the players perspective doesn't look like you would fit through. I had to look up a video walkthrough to get past that section. The last boss fight was hard, and not in the fun way, but more tedious than anything, but I think it was because I wasn't thinking in the right mind set. And something I absolutely dispised was that ALL THE TIME IT FELT LIKE I WAS WALKING ON ICE AND I ALWAYS SOMEHOW MANAGED TO MISS MY JUMPS!!!\n\nBut other than that I was honestly just nit picking. \n\nOverall, this game is fast, fun, and I'm very excited to start Half-Life 2 here in a few days.","timestamp_created":1462006871,"timestamp_updated":1462006871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459459453821182251","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22716764","author":{"steamid":"76561198012004369","num_games_owned":452,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":156,"last_played":1588715035},"language":"english","review":"I've seen better","timestamp_created":1461994938,"timestamp_updated":1461994938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22716305","author":{"steamid":"76561198298164560","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":416,"last_played":1461626213},"language":"english","review":"Nostalgia overload!
