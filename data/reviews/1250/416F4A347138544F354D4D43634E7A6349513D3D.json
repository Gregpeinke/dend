Это ошибочное сравнение! \"L4D вышла раньше\", \"В Killing Floor такие же зомби, как и в Left 4 Dead\" и т.д. - эти высказывания были ооочень популярны в рецензиях данной игры в периоде 2009-2010 года. \n\nKilling Floor - это командный шутер с элементами хоррора. Игра сначала появилась в качестве мода для Unreal Tournament 2004 в 2005 году (сильный удар по яйцам фанатам Left 4 Dead). Процесс игры заключается в выживание n-ое количество волн. Для того чтобы выжить, нужна командная работа и тактика на карте. \n\n●Поговорим о командной работе: в игре присутсвует 7 классов, так называемые \"перки\", которые имеют свои \"фишки\". Выбор каждого перка должен быть обдуман для любой карты, так как карты разные по строению.\n\n●Пушек для каждого перка предостаточно. Существуют оружия, которые серьезно помогут в выживании или просто чтобы повеселиться\n\n●Замедление времени под названием \"Z.E.D.Time\", который дает вам увидеть всю изумительность разлитающих конечностей монстров. Также под действием \"Z.E.D.Time'а\" вы можете оценить ситуацию, когда вас окружили. Это дает вам шанс выжить\n\n●Большое количество карт, сделанная сообществом KF. Самодельных карт насчитывается больше 1000!\n\n●Благодаря модификациям, именнуя \"мутаторами\", можно изменять геймплей игры. А именно: поставить новых монстров, новых пушек и т.д.\n\n●Если вам надоела \"классическая игра\", то вы сможете поиграть на разных \"пабликах\", на которых добавлено все вышеперечисленное. К тому же, на таких серверах переработан баланс и имеет свой уровень сложности. Обычно он выше \"Ад На Земле\".\n\nЭто были полюсы игры, а теперь минусы: \n●DLC, DLC и еще раз DLC. Загружаемый контент испортил игру. Пушки и Скины, которые не имеют ничего общего с игрой. Грубо говоря - дополнительный контент испортил игру (именно для меня это минус)\n\n\nРекомендую ли я эту игру? Не смотря на то, что Tripwire испортили ее со своими DLC, дабы нарубить бабла, ее стоит купить. Во время скидок она стоит 75 рублей, а со сборником со всеми DLC - 125 рублей. Это маленькие деньги! В эту игру поиграть стоит.

This is my special Favorite game since 2010. Bought this game on january 2010 and thought that this should be a normal Zombie game like L4D. All in one i was right. BUT i missed the teamplay on L4D so much that i decided to do not play this game again. So i came to Killing Floor. I was somehow kinda enchanted from the beginning of the first few hours i played this game. So much investigated potential. This game is absolutly worth its price. Definetly. I never saw a better one. Believe me! 7300 hours playing time and more cant be wrong.  And if you get bored, try some mutators, mods, other maps, mosnters, other modded servers. I played so much mutators and i still dont know every mutator which is playable. There´s so many workshop stuff. In short form: BUY THIS GAME!
