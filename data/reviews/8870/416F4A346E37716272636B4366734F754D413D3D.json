Without a doubt, one of the most intelligent, thought-provoking, thrill inducing, tear-jerking, mind-blowing game of recent times. \nThe story of Bioshock Infinite is the best written, most spectacularly executed and refreshingly original I have come across in an extremely long time as a gamer. Every time the plot throws an huge twist at you, you think \"Surely nothing could top that, surely it can't get better...\" and then it does. \nEvery main character is expertly written and has motivations which may not be easy to comprehend, but when you realise them, you have to appreciate the depth and time that has been put into them. Keep an eye out for a certain character named Lutece....I won't give any spoilers but they are not quite what they appear to be, yet provide more genuine comedic moments than most other games.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent, following the Bioshock tradition of taking tunes and styles we know and twisting them so they are just recognisable but still create atmosphere.\nThe gameplay is consistent with the Bioshock series, with the added factor of Skyhook combat; it can feel a little clunky and basic at times but the sheer fun, speed and immersion make you forget it completely. \n\nThe attention to detail is superb, particularly with the collectible audio logs, giving both mundane and plot-important info, but all of them are worth finding and hearing! Here and there you'll find an audio log, or a note, or overhear some NPCs talking and you'll find a joke so funny you giggle to yourself while you play.\n\nAll in all, Infinite is an ambitiously aimed and grandly accomplished game, definitely worth playing no matter what your preferred genre is (FPS, shoot em up, RPG, story-driven, steampunkish, it's got the lot). \nIt's on sale now. Do yourself a favour, spend a little money, and fall in love with a whole lot of game.","timestamp_created":1414620485,"timestamp_updated":1416347170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12687129","author":{"steamid":"76561198062282148","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1883,"last_played":1655693988},"language":"japanese","review":"今までやってきたシングルプレイゲームの中で最高傑作です。\nストーリーがとても凝っていて、ストーリーを進めたいがために、時間を忘れて夢中でプレイしました。\nプレイ初めはディズニーランドに紛れ込んだような感覚でしたが、そこから一気にシリアスな展開へと変わっていき、もうプレイを止めることが出来ませんでした。\nここから個人的なレビューになりますが、総評として是非他の人にお勧めしたいゲームです。\nまずとても良かった点からレビューしていきます。\n\n・前作同様に、一つの世界が完成されている。住人の会話や、建物の細かい造形から、この世界の文化や規律、そして政治的なところまで細かく読み取れる。\n・エリザベスというヒロインが常にプレイヤーと行動する。ストーリーと密接に関わってくるのは言うまでありませんが、ＮＰＣとしてここまで豪華にするのかと思うぐらいアニメーションから全て丁寧に作られています。エリザベス自身とても魅力的な存在ですが、ゲームをプレイしていくのに比例してどんどん魅力的な存在になっていきます。\n・上に記した通り素晴らしいストーリー。とても明るいコロンビアの町から物語はスタートし、こんなエンディングで終わるとは、、、\n\n次に残念だった点をレビューします。\n\n・中盤以降、戦闘がストーリーを進めるためのミニゲームになってしまう。武器は一部かぶる性能のものがあり、もっと個性的なコロンビアにしかない武器を出せば面白かったと思う。\n戦闘は特に戦略性がなく、特殊能力の存在を忘れてしまうほど単調。特殊能力を使いましょうというヒントが表示され思い出しました。\nどのゲームにもいえることですが、世界観にあいまって、最初はどんな単調な戦闘でも面白いものです。\nもう少し戦闘が面白ければ、個人的には完璧なゲームでした。\n\nＦＰＳよりはアクションRPGといった方がよいかもしれません。\nばりばりＦＰＳやりたいという人にはあまりお勧めできませんが、セール中なので是非プレイしてみて下さい。\nプレイ後、すげーなこのゲームと思うはずです。５年間かけて製作されたこのゲームを「すげーな」の一言で終わらせてしまうのには惜しいくらいスタッフの愛を感じたゲームでした。わりとマジで。","timestamp_created":1414618634,"timestamp_updated":1414688822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.744436800479888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12686966","author":{"steamid":"76561198028109502","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":17,"playtime_at_review":716,"last_played":1660036061},"language":"koreana","review":"역대 유래가 없을 정도로 훌륭한 스토리, 독특하고 매력적인 세계관이 훌륭하다. 거기에 전투의 타격감과 박진감도 부족함이 없다. 완벽한 게임.","timestamp_created":1414617786,"timestamp_updated":1414617786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12686892","author":{"steamid":"76561198096077773","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":137,"last_played":1477746180},"language":"bulgarian","review":"","timestamp_created":1414617388,"timestamp_updated":1414617388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12686832","author":{"steamid":"76561197976441140","num_games_owned":517,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":4546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3964,"last_played":1621562217},"language":"english","review":"Believe the hype... the combat is occassionally repetitive and the story a bit too linear compared to the sandbox style we're all used to these days, but the level design, artwork and soundtrack are superb - and you can play it how you want, there's no sure-fire way to win  a level.","timestamp_created":1414617008,"timestamp_updated":1414617008,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12686794","author":{"steamid":"76561198000788475","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1477949093},"language":"english","review":"Nutshell: Lopsided and ambitious storytelling pays off, but only in some areas\n\nThe gameplay may be fantastic (and almost constantly is), but you come to a BioShock game for the story.

The controls play smoothly, and a decent amount of the fights are fun.\n\nUnfortunately, Infinite is a dumbed down shoot em up version of the games that gave it it's name. It felt more like I was playing a call of duty campaign, not the gritty tactical masterpiece that was the first Bioshock. It was a very linear experience unlike the first Bioshock. In infinite you follow the path the game has laid out for you, you fight a horde of enemies, and you move onto the next area. There's very little room for variety or experementation like in games such as Bioshock 1 or Dishonored. \n\nOverall I'd rate the game a 7/10.

Its story just HAS to be its selling point as it is one of the best stories ever conceived in gaming history... HOWEVER... that doesn't go to say that it is perfect. The game has a habit of leaving gaping holes in the plot and escaped a lot of responsibility by making certain characters omniscient.\n\nGameplay wise, pretty average. A mix between gunplay and vigors makes for a mildly interesting combat experience. If you play games for pure gameplay and not story - Bioshock probably is not for you.\n\nFor the DLC... Clash in the Clouds is entirely combat oriented. Because it focuses on the weakest part of the game - the gameplay (Weird, huh?) - the DLC sucks as a result.\n\nBurial at Sea Episode one has terrible gameplay but a fantastic ending... While the second episode has amazing gameplay (Stealth is fun) but the story seems contrived at times.\n\nOverall... Well worth the experience if just for the story (So long as you can overlook a few plot holes). But I would not buy this game on gameplay alone. If you can, pick up both Burial at Sea episodes, but feel free to skip Clash in the Clouds.","timestamp_created":1414602562,"timestamp_updated":1414602562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12683907","author":{"steamid":"76561198030481306","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":5074,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5074,"last_played":1444226323},"language":"japanese","review":"この世界観を体験するだけでもやる価値はある！\n華麗に作りこまれた街並みの壁へと屋根へと跳び回り、スカイラインを駆け抜けながらのアクションはこれでしか味わえません。\nビガー（数種ある特殊能力）は使いこなせばかなり強力です、積極的に活用していきましょう。\nシナリオは賛否両論ですが、購入対象年齢以上の方なら性別問わず楽しめる内容だと思うので、主人公やヒロインの謎を追いかけながら是非プレイしてみてください。","timestamp_created":1414601711,"timestamp_updated":1487443680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553320407867431641","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12683848","author":{"steamid":"76561198111932269","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1433519547},"language":"german","review":"Tolles Spiel.

I mean if you somehow get frustrated with the controls, which is unlikely at least for me, the story will always keep you going. As I've never played the previous games in the series, I really shouldn't say whether you should or should not play them first. However, that didn't affect my experience with this game at all.

It's a hallway shooter. Don't expect much else. The ending is like a convoluted version of the Donnie Darko plot, except everything is spelled out five times. There are a few really decent segments, but for the most part, the game requires you not to think about the story and just go ahead and shoot the things that are in your way. The world also lacks life from the first hour or so on. \nThe reason I don't recommend this is that both of the first two Bioshock games are superior - you got a feeling for the place you were in, you could follow the plot at every point and there were no unfair enemies with Mega Man-like boss weaknesses (try using the Raven power against Handymen and you'll see what I mean).","timestamp_created":1414566385,"timestamp_updated":1414566385,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":32,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.40670311450958252","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12678571","author":{"steamid":"76561198088166176","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1119,"last_played":1395030559},"language":"english","review":"The story is excellent, the gameplay not so much, sometimes the arena fights are tedious and way too easy and just get in the way of the story.","timestamp_created":1414565287,"timestamp_updated":1414565287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496389895677566528","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12678547","author":{"steamid":"76561197964615133","num_games_owned":291,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":898,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":898,"last_played":1413882856},"language":"english","review":"Great game.
