Атмосфера Полураспада присутствует не наполовину, а в полной степени. Куча скриптовых сцен, съедаемых ученых, убиваемых охранников, взрываемых вертолетов, зданий и коммуникаций - все это сделано настолько кинематографично, что хочется просто расцеловать дорогих сердцу Gearbox’овцев, а заодно и Valve’вцев, которые консультировали создателей аддона на всем протяжении его изготовления. По-прежнему играть страшно. Постоянно из темноты кто-то выскакивает, постоянно не хватает патронов и прочих энергетических батарей, постоянно убивают твоих товарищей... А потом вдруг правительственные агенты из BlackOps начинают охоту уже на вас, а не на Фримена! Предательство? Может быть...\nЧто касается дизайна уровней, то в целом он очень похож на тот, что мы могли наблюдать в Half-Life. Смесь открытых пространств, техногенных зон, кислотных бассейнов и темнющих туннелей. Запутаться невозможно, хотя к цели не обязательно ведет единственный путь. Короче, если вам нравились уровни в HL, то и в OF они вам понравятся - новые текстурки, объекты и прочие развлечения этому помогут. Жаль, что мир Opposing Force не очень большой - всего 6 уровней и по 3-6 загружаемых подуровня в каждом.
