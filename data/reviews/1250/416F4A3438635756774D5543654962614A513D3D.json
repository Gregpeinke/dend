Up to 6 players in online co-op mode, or just you, on your own, playing the Solo mode. The aim - cleanse each area of zombies, in waves, until you get to the last one. The Big One. The Patriarch. Then exterminate him, too. Actually, they aren’t \"zombies\". They are the left-over \"specimens\" from a cheap and dirty government program to clone soldier-monsters. The basic ones will just munch on your arm and try to disembowel you. The bigger ones were the first ones they tried arming. Nothing much. Just a chainsaw or a blade for starters. They had just got on to the chain gun and rockets when the government tried to secretly shut down their secret program. But, in the typical way these things go, the program didn’t want to be shut down. The specimens got loose. No-one was left alive to turn off the specimen-cloning equipment. And now they are running amok. Well, some of them are running amok. Others are shambling amok or even jumping amok, but you get the idea. The police were sent in, but that wasn't even a challenge for the specimens. The first army units hadn't been warned what to expect. The screams of its got a bloody chainsaw!\" over the radios probably didn’t do much for morale, as whole units were chewed up. Quite literally, in some cases, of course. And now, there is just you. And a few friends. The few survivors from the first police and army units thrown in. Of course, you can’t tell anyone anything, because that would be a breach of the Official Secrets Act 1911, 1920, 1989. And that would be a disciplinary offense. So just get in there and do your bit for Queen and Country. Zombies. Lots of them. Big ones, little ones.

(Auto/Semi machine guns)\n- Different holiday skins (Hillybilly, X-mas, Circus)\n- Tons of maps, and some people create their own, with different play styles required\n- Perks that you can level up, that offer some progression in the game\n- Challenging enemies, that require you to work with your team\n- Even in death, allies can spectate and call out nearby enemies (it's a team game of course)\n- High replay value, highly addivtive with friends\n\nCons:\n- Decent Graphics, but on the bright side, even low end computers can run this with no problem, and no lag.\n- You're supposed to work together, but allies can troll by welding doors (which can be unwelded at a faster speed)\n- Not much fun alone, but you can play with randoms and friends\n- Can be very challenging to complete all rounds/kill the Patriarch (Final Boss) at low perk levels\n\n\nMost of the cons have bright sides to them, and I recommend this game highly.

Gráficos são medianos, mas a trilha sonora e os efeitos na jogabilidade são o forte do jogo. Muito louco pra jogar coop, mas se for jogar single ele não tem modo historia e se torna chato e enjoativo.","timestamp_created":1398129191,"timestamp_updated":1398129191,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9894843","author":{"steamid":"76561198098517931","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73,"last_played":1440174716},"language":"french","review":"super jeu","timestamp_created":1398115129,"timestamp_updated":1398115129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9893627","author":{"steamid":"76561198023723065","num_games_owned":424,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":9929,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9329,"last_played":1422665929},"language":"english","review":"One of the funniest horror shooters I ever playied, the weapons are fun to use and the developer still work on this game.\n\n+awsome weopons\n+many classes\n+many zombies/mutants\n+developer still work on this game\n\n-no real singleplayer\n\nwhat I mean with no real singleplayer is there is no campain whatsoever you can play it solo but it gets boring really fast\n\nI reccomd to play it multiplayer","timestamp_created":1398104509,"timestamp_updated":1398104509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9893268","author":{"steamid":"76561197989273274","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3022,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":129,"last_played":1485389687},"language":"russian","review":"мд","timestamp_created":1398102211,"timestamp_updated":1398102211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9890573","author":{"steamid":"76561198075354610","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1465,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1210,"last_played":1433983650},"language":"italian","review":"Ricordo, che, quando acquistai Killing floor, c'erano gli sconti di Halloween, e che, per tre euro mi aggiudicai la beta di questo gioco, non ci giocai molto, dopotutto ancora non avevo amici che possedevano KF, ma dopo qualche tempo, riesco a convincere il mio gruppetto ad acquistarlo seppur, quel poco che avevo giocato non mi aveva convinto, ma rigiocandolo in compagnia e con la versione non più in beta, sono riuscito ad apprezzare al massimo questo gioco che ti può dare parecchie ore di divertimento con amici, quindi, lo consiglio vivamente a tutti coloro che amano il genere fps con nemici che arrivano ad ondate, isomma, un bel gioco nato come mod che poi diventa indipendente, non può essere che un ottimo acquisto!
