Portal 2 is, what you would have already guessed by the title, is a sequel to Portal (One that takes place an incredibly long time after. So long, that no one knows HOW long). But unlike Portal, it has much more content such as the different types of gell. And if you have claustrophobia and can't stand those horrible, small test chambers, be prepared for an adventure as you run your way between the walls of chambers and find yourself in a whole different part of Aperture Laboratories, where you get to hear pre-recorded messages from Cave Johnson and play in ancient testing chambers that were once done by other test subjects. On your way through the story, you will find many things, such as humor, mysteries (with sometimes shocking conclusions), the \"I'm Different\" turret, and other easter eggs scattered throughout the game. You will experience a great storyline and challenging puzzles that are made for geniuses like you. If you eventually get bored of the main story, try some co-op mode that has its own array of puzzles especially made for cooperative play, or community test chambers, where you can create, play, and upload your own testing chamber creations, or play what others have made!\n\n     Lastly, once you own Portal 2, you can download and play a completely free, fan-made mod that is an \"alternate ending+sequel\" to Portal 2 named [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/286080/]Thinking with Time Machine[/url]. It uses most of Portal 2's content and mechanics, but focuses more around an incredible custom gameplay mechanic that has to do with time manipulation. This allows very difficult levels to create that offer great challenge. I would highly recommend buying Portal 2 and getting this if you are interested in this mod.\n\n     Overall, Portal 2 is a great improvement of Portal. It has full controler support and was made using great creativity, logic, and talent.\n\nGet Portal 2.\nYou'll miss out on a lot of stuff if you don't.","timestamp_created":1422405190,"timestamp_updated":1422405190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14200592","author":{"steamid":"76561198021445833","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":1879,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1313,"last_played":1657827507},"language":"english","review":"Game is on sale, there are 2 games and this has the number 2 in it, 2+2-1=3.
