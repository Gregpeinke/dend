I don't think I've ever enjoyed co-op sessions as much as I did when working through the MP portion of this game. The mental challenge and timing required to solve the two-person puzzles provides a good balance between difficulty and accomplishment. On top of that, the single player game is also a ton of fun, and the story is both intriguing and absolutely hilarious. I recommend this game to ANYONE who enjoys games.

The premise is difficult to describe but so simple and enjoyable you'll be flinging yourself around the cold, clinical chambers in no time.\nThe unique and unnerving tie between Chell and GlaDOS, the quirky puzzle-***-shooter nature of the game and the cute yet dangerous claustrophobia of the environment have made Portal an instant success and has allowed to companion cube to replace the hearts of many now hardened fans of the game.\nPortals success comes mainly from its unique perspective and gameplay, its quirky and lovable characters (if you don't feel a minor pang as a turret dies and confesses \"I don't blame you\" then you may very well be an android) and it's surprisingly immersive storyline - which at little over four hours of solid play time - claims a fuller and more thoughtful plot than most Hollywood movies.\nFans of Half-life with spot the odd minor nod and essentially Chell plays like a pacifistic Gordan Freeman, both being dropped into bizarre scenarios and plowing through their environments uncovering their own story as they go.\nCouple all this with the loving dedication of fans who have provided us with a myriad of mods to extend the Portal game life and the imminent arrival of Portal 2, you really need to get aboard this game as soon as soon as is humanly possible and get ready to fffling yourself...fling into space.","timestamp_created":1445131342,"timestamp_updated":1519241984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18537035","author":{"steamid":"76561198123294336","num_games_owned":401,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":1474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1085,"last_played":1645570276},"language":"english","review":"An excellent Co-op and Single Player game!\n\n🎮 7.7/10 🎮","timestamp_created":1445122265,"timestamp_updated":1514854236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18536719","author":{"steamid":"76561198063807235","num_games_owned":394,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2058,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2036,"last_played":1460954835},"language":"english","review":"A very good game with a great story and kick-ass music.","timestamp_created":1445120918,"timestamp_updated":1445120918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18536655","author":{"steamid":"76561198224210140","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1445437016},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1445120682,"timestamp_updated":1445120682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18536364","author":{"steamid":"76561198057172907","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":678,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":677,"last_played":1485221279},"language":"german","review":"Sehr gutes Game!\nKann man sich mal kaufen!","timestamp_created":1445119713,"timestamp_updated":1445119713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18536122","author":{"steamid":"76561198148202526","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1447606345},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un juego con unos puzzles (relativamente) sencillos y con unas dosis de humor bastante altos.
