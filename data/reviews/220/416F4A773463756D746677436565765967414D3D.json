sonra bir daha oynadığımda bu oyunun neden mükemmel ve kusursuz olduğunu bir kez daha ve daha derin sebeplerle anladım. şimdi oyunun bu kusursuzluklarını konuşalım;\n\n- hikaye cok iyi ve sizi sürekli oyunda tutuyor. nereye gideceğiz, bizi nereye yönlendirecekler, g-man kim, aradaki kayıp senelerde ne oldu vb derken sürekli bir merak ve heyecan var oyunda. hiçbir zaman ''offf bitse de gitsek'' demiyorsunuz.\n\n- oyunda boş bir an yok. bakın bu cümleyi gerçekleştirmek ya da yapabilmek cok zor. milyar dolarlık oyun firmaları bunu yapamıyor. oyunu oynarken sanki bir f1 arabası içerisinde gibi hissediyorsunuz. sürekli bir aksiyon, tempo, gerilim, dialog. bir an bile durmuyor. yok insanıydı, zombisiydi, böceğiydi derken şöyle bir kutu ardına geçeyim de iki sigara yakayim dediğiniz bir an yok.\n\n- ravenholm bölümü. sadece bu chapterdan tek başına korku oyunu cıkar. 2004 yılında cıkmasına rağmen hala bu bölümü gerilmeden oynayacak babayiğit azdır. dışardaki o rahatsız ses, garip şekillerde ölmüş yaratıklar vb. sizi inanılmaz bir şekilde gerer. ne zaman rahibin sesini duysanız bir oh dersiniz. yalnızlığın bu kadar güzel verildiği oyun sayısı cok azdır.\n\n-yalnızlık hissiyatı. yukarda dediğim şeyin devamı aslında bu. oyunda ne zaman bir dialog olsa mutlu oluyorum çünkü oyun size yalnızlık hissiyatını o kadar güzel hissettiriyor ki ne zaman bir insan görseniz ''aga bu cok iyi oldu be'' modunda geziyorsunuz.\n\n- eskimeyen source motoru. bir oyun düşünün 2004 yılında cıksın ve hala hiç sırıtmadan oynanabilir olsun. gerçekten cok enteresan. oyun motorundaki o gerçeklik, akıcılık yıllar boyunca hiç ama hiç eskimemiş.\n\n- oyunun hiçbir zaman tekrara düşmemesi. her bölüme ayrı ayrı özenilmiş ve hiçbir şekilde kolay yola kaçılmamış. botla gittiğimiz uzun bir sekans, ravenholm bölümü gibi birbirinden cok bağımsız iki bölüm bu oyuna cok güzel bir şekilde empoze edilebilmiş.\n\n- oyuncunun yanında olan checkpoint sistemi. half-life bunu 98 yılında bile başarmıştı gerçi. o zamanlar oyunlarda save almak (hatırlayan hatırlar) çoğu oyunda zulümdü. dolaşırdın, aynı yeri bir daha oynardın, re serisi gibi kayıt odaları arardın vb. half-life seni öyle bir yerde başlatıyor ki nefes daha alamadan bir daha kendinizi aksiyonda buluyorsunuz.\n\nhalf-life 2 gerçekten hala ve hala çağının ötesinde bir oyun. bazen diyorum 3 gelmese de böyle bir kusursuzluk içinde mi vedalaşsak bu oyunla. her şeyi zaman gösterecek.\n\nbirgün yolunuz ravenholm'a düşerse minik bir bahçe olacak. oraya gidin ve rahibe benim için dua edin.","timestamp_created":1634106602,"timestamp_updated":1634106602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100975437","author":{"steamid":"76561198992657363","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1442,"last_played":1654270520},"language":"english","review":"I

hard to follow up the greatest game of all time, but Half-Life 2 truly rises to the occasion. It's difficult to pit them against each other and say which is better. Both of them set the standard for story driven FPS games upon their respective releases. Even 17 years later, I can't say too many games rival this. I understand that it might have its flaws, like the story is a bit of a disconnected mess, but overall this is still a polished and timeless effort. The facial capture mechanics and the attention to details on the in-game physics continue to blow me away. Though the original might feel dated to those who were born around the time of it's release, I think this title holds it's own against any of the blockbuster releases in our current times. We didn't wait for months of patches to clear the myriad of bugs that plague this multi-million dollar games. I know the size and scope doesn't compare, but this is a good example that quality over quantity will forever reign supreme. This is less of a review and more of a rant, so I'll end it by saying: This game can't be measured by a number scale, or stars, or thumbs. It's an absolute masterpiece, and fully immersive work of art, and I must implore anyone who is capable to experience this game for yourself. You couldn't possibly be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1634102952,"timestamp_updated":1634102952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100969372","author":{"steamid":"76561199086131243","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":860,"last_played":1656652712},"language":"english","review":"I just beat Half Life 2 for the first time, and it was one hell of a great ride.

Set 20 years after the events of the original Half-Life, the sequel takes place in an Earth taken over by an interdimensional alien empire called the Combine. Earth's resources are being seized, the clean air in result gets toxicated, the oceans dried out, and humans, enslaved and are taken away the ability to procreate, are the last of their generation. It is up to you to don your H.E.V. and crowbar again to fight for humanity's survival. Apart from its miracle physics engine and unique gameplay, Half-Life 2's story is not something you see every day and the world building is written brilliantly. City 17 is a true dystopia and people who live there reflect that. The story takes inspirations from books like \"1984\" (not clickbait owo) or \"We\" and applies the feeling of oppression and isolation in its own special way.

But for some reason I haven't touched it until now that is. And if i'm going to be perfectly honest with you, it was a mixed bag for me. Don't get me wrong I still immensly enjoyed playing through it but for a few reasons it didn't feel as enjoyable to me as the first one. I can't be nostalgic for the first one since I only played that for the first time a few months ago but this still didn't connect as much as the first one did. I am going to rate this one higher than the original one, but that doesn't mean anything since I can absolutely love a game but still give it a 6/10 for example.\nI'll go over some pros and cons now\n\nPositives:\n+ Decent combat, while it is really dry, it still didn't feel 'lackluster' or boring to shoot enemies. But yeah not all that great, so maybe i could say I'm neutral on it.\n+ A lot of visual storytelling. Just like the first one, it doesn't tell you what happened or happening through text, instead of that it encourages you to think about what happened and look for cues in the enviroment.\n+ Amazing soundtrack, there's some nice techno tunes to emphasize exciting moments.\n+ Smart AI. Not as smart as F.E.A.R. for example but still really smart compared to a lot of modern AAA shooters.\n+Better facial animations than Far Cry 6. That's it, f*ck ubisoft.\n+One sequence makes you burn zombies, and then they scream so horrifying that I can still remember it vividly, f*cking horror material that is.\n+Keeps your interest peaked by switching up a lot of the mechanics. And almost none of them feel gimmicky until maybe the last switch up.\n\nNegatives:\n-I did find myself only playing for 1-2 hours each session because after that I got bored with it. Probably just a me problem.\n-Loading a new area could take up to 10-12 seconds even with an SSD.\n-There's certain points where it stalls a lot, especially when you need to wait on Alyx.\n-Like I said in my last positive, the last switch up or simply ending levels are really lackluster, gameplay wise.\n\nSummary:\nA really good game, while for me not as good as the first one, I still enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it to anyone who likes shooters, great enviroments, good story, amazing soundtrack and people who are bored with modern AAA games (because they f*cking suck as of late).\n\nRating:\n9/10","timestamp_created":1633980139,"timestamp_updated":1633980293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100907991","author":{"steamid":"76561197984807357","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1094,"last_played":1634669731},"language":"russian","review":"классика)\n","timestamp_created":1633978869,"timestamp_updated":1633978869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100906112","author":{"steamid":"76561199160529107","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1034,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":300,"last_played":1649013200},"language":"brazilian","review":"com certeza um dos jogos j[a feitos.","timestamp_created":1633976279,"timestamp_updated":1633976279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100905545","author":{"steamid":"76561198964243317","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1658239262},"language":"english","review":"⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠛⠛⠛⠋⠉⠈⠉⠉⠉⠉⠛⠻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⢏⣴⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣟⣾⣿⡟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⢢⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣟⠀⡴⠄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⠟⠻⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠶⢴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿\n⣿⣁⡀⠀⠀⢰⢠⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣼⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠀⣴⣶⣿⡄⣿\n⣿⡋⠀⠀⠀⠎⢸⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠗⢘⣿⣟⠛⠿⣼\n⣿⣿⠋⢀⡌⢰⣿⡿⢿⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⢸⣿⣿⣧⢀⣼\n⣿⣿⣷⢻⠄⠘⠛⠋⠛⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣧⠈⠉⠙⠛⠋⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣧⠀⠈⢸⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠟⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⢃⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⡿⠀⠴⢗⣠⣤⣴⡶⠶⠖⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡸⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⡀⢠⣾⣿⠏⠀⠠⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠛⠉⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣧⠈⢹⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⡄⠈⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣴⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣄⣀⣀⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⡄⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⠙⣿⣿⡟⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇⠀⠁⠀⠀⠹⣿⠃⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠛⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢐⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠛⠉⠉⠁⠀⢻⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⠈⣿⣿⡿⠉⠛⠛⠛⠉⠉\n⣿⡿⠋⠁⠀⠀⢀⣀⣠⡴⣸⣿⣇⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡿⠄⠙⠛⠀⣀⣠⣤⣤⠄\n","timestamp_created":1633975470,"timestamp_updated":1633975470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496183186769485474","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100904337","author":{"steamid":"76561199069838209","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1635603953},"language":"russian","review":".","timestamp_created":1633973795,"timestamp_updated":1633973795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100902279","author":{"steamid":"76561198168401397","num_games_owned":680,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1816,"last_played":1651098387},"language":"portuguese","review":"Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman.

Что меня очень порадовало-это соблюдение баланса сложности контента по времени игры, для меня идеальна та игра, где в начале тебе несложно, дают понять механики игры, в середине игры тебя по максимуму напрягают по этим механикам, а под конец игры дают расслабиться и посмотреть на плоды своих трудов. Вот тут все точно также, под конец игры, разработчики сделали изменение в механике в сторону упрощения, и играть стало веселее и проще, при этом ты поглощал информацию концовки игры.\n\nАтмосфера\n\nПосле мрачных исследовательских лабораторий Черной Мезы, тут мы видим хоть и находящийся под тоталитарным гнетом, но все же город Восточной Европы, довольно светлый. Что касается графики, здесь у вас точно уже глаза болеть не будут, так игры выглядит довольно бодро даже сейчас, музыка как и в первой части, когда включается,то радует. Множество технологий, которые сегодня нам кажутся обыденными, впервые появлялись в Half-Life 2.\n\nСюжет\n\nВ самом начале нас встречает наш старый знакомый по ДЛС Blue Shift - Барни, который собственно и помогает нам найти сопротивление, основной задачей которого свергнуть бывшего руководителя Черной Мезы Брина, который находится на побегушках у Альянса враждебной фракцией, которая и захватила нашу планету.
