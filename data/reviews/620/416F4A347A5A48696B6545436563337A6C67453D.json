Great characters with hints of really good comedy here and there. The story and characters is definitely the best part of Portal 2. Tons of easter eggs that hint to a deeper story, leaving many things for the fans and player to figure out and discover over time. \n\nExtremely smooth gameplay with super fun controls and physics. Not only does it have an amazing story but the whole premise of solving puzzles using the portal gun is awesome in itself and this sequel introduces so many more things to toy with. Multiplayer is amazing to play with friends, even after years of having the game, and makes for some funny moments of vaporizing your friends or aiming turrets at them.\n\nIn general a really great game and will always be my favorite Valve game.

It is the sequel to Portal (2007) and was released on April 19, 2011 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The retail versions of the game were published by Electronic Arts, while online distribution of the PC versions is handled by Valve's content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced in March 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. Before the game's release on Steam, the company released the Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.\nThe game retains Portal's gameplay elements, and adds new features, including tractor beams, laser redirection, bridges made of light, and paint-like 'gels' accelerating the player's speed, allowing the player-character to jump higher or place portals on any surface. In the single-player campaign, the player controls protagonist Chell, awoken from suspended animation after many years, who must navigate the now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the reactivated GLaDOS, a powerful supercomputer. The storyline introduces new characters, including Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The National each produced a song for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player cooperative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body (both voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) are each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve puzzles. Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others.\nAlthough some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor. The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative mode. Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011, and several named it their Game of the Year.

Les éléments de gameplay dans les niveaux se révéleront au déroulement du jeu, que se soit [spoiler]les \"rayons tracteurs\", les \"ponts de lumière tangible\" ou les différents types de gels[/spoiler]. Ils devronts être manipulés avec les portails pour résoudre certaines énigmes, ce qui laisse un grand potentiel de création de niveau. On ne retrouve cependant pas les boules d'énergie du premier jeu, dont les énigmes étaient principalement basées sur ceux-ci. La difficulté est bien dosée, assez progressive (le boss de fin peut-être un peu simple...).\n\nLa durée de vie de l'histoire principale est au minimum 5x plus longue que dans le 1, avec des décors beaucoup plus variés et réalistes dans l'ambiance de l'univers de Portal. Valve a également intégré la fonctionnalité de créer ses propres niveaux et de les partager sur le workshop de Portal 2. Je me permet donc de considérer que la durée de ce jeu est en réalité infinie, grâce à tout le potentiel des éléments de gameplay du jeu et de la créativité des joueurs.\n\nLes musiques de ce jeu s'intègrent bien dans l'univers de Portal et du centre immense d'Aperture. Les musiques seront angoissantes quand les niveaux seront angoissants, elles seront stressantes quand les niveaux le seront. La BO a été composé par Mike Morasky, comme la majorité des jeux Valve (Half Life, Team Forteresse 2, CS:GO, Left 4 Dead, ...). De plus, vous n'aurez aucun problème pour la télécharger légalement car elle est gratuite sur Steam, et disponible sur vos fichiers locaux et sur: [i]https://www.thinkwithportals.com/music.php[/i].

(See caveat below)\n\nThe co-op portion of this game is the best game I have ever played.  I have played almost every triple A MMO out there, many for extended (years) of time, and this game provides the most fun and challenging experience out of any multiplayer game.  I don't think that there is a single negative thing I could say about it.  \n\nMy wife and I did take longer than expected (this was our first time, no Portal experience), to complete the co-op, and neither of us ran the campaign (single player) mode on Portal 2.  That was fine.  I wish we could have dragged it out longer, but unfortunately once we ran out of content that was it.  \n\nThis was a good game to grab some food and just look around, eat a few bites and contemplate how we could work a puzzle.  Several times we were completely stumped and just kept working at it until the mission was complete.  Not once did we look up a guide to see how things were supposed to be done, although I am curious now if a few of the ways we completed missions were not the \"correct\" ways.  \n\nI played through the single player version of the game and it was great.  The first stages of it were extremely easy as expected because they teach the mechanics that you also learn in the multiplayer version.  The end-game chambers were still challenging and I had a lot of fun, albeit not quite as much fun in multiplayer.  If the game was strictly single player I would still recommend it, but only if it had many more maps.  For multiplayer I recommend the game hands down, and since it has both, this should be the easiest purchase you ever make on Steam.  \n\nPortal 2 is the BEST co-op game you can purchase.  Get through your first few chambers and understand how the mechanics work.  You will love it.\n\nedit:  There is some replayability with player created content, but I generally do not use unofficial content, so use at your own risk.  Even at that point, it is one chamber at a time.","timestamp_created":1516751717,"timestamp_updated":1516752403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39569402","author":{"steamid":"76561198178602175","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3002,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2114,"last_played":1579370480},"language":"spanish","review":"Sin duda, en mi opinión, uno de los mejores juegos de la historia, tanto por su jugabilidad como por su historia.

However the single player game will introduce you to the concept of using portals gradually and will have you feel like a mastermind before too long.\n\nIt's the game we play when we're bored or don't have a lot of other games in common. It's a game that you can keep coming back to. Portal 2 has an unlimited amount of levels to play and I would go as far as claiming that this game will be timeless -remembered for many years to come.\n\nIf you tend to play alone, this game has a great story which will amuse you the whole way through. When you're done you can create your own levels for others to beat or play someone elses (they're not all good, but soo many are).\n\nIf you're not sure if you should get this game or not. Get it. You won't regret it. It a cheap price for endless hours of amusement.","timestamp_created":1516741834,"timestamp_updated":1541037087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39565028","author":{"steamid":"76561198144357973","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1517148144},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра если вы хотите расслабиться и просто поиграть!","timestamp_created":1516736826,"timestamp_updated":1516736826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39564753","author":{"steamid":"76561198095544965","num_games_owned":507,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1069,"last_played":1593724709},"language":"german","review":"Das spiel ist ziemlich cool.
