The game stands out, for me though, because of its set pieces, the amazing moments in the game that shock you, scare you or even make you totally not tear up. This and excellent gameplay is what Half-Life is all about and Episode 2 manages to rekindle this after losing it somewhat in Episode 1.\n\n[b]Full review below if you want to check it out:[/b]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QP1SajzHdo","timestamp_created":1487284729,"timestamp_updated":1487284729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29963036","author":{"steamid":"76561198043935615","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":4732,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4715,"last_played":1487177316},"language":"schinese","review":"^ ^ 现在是 2017 年 , << Half-Life 2: Episode Two >> 上市已过去 10 年 , 而在 \" 开发者注释 \" 中多次提到的 Episode 3 依然没有任何消息 , 但我永远不会放弃等待 , 因为 << Half-Life 2: Episode Two >> 留下了太多悬念 ; 北极光号 , 光圈科技 , 匆匆离去的 朱迪斯 · 莫斯曼 , 神秘的 G-Man , 伊莱 · 凡斯 有意避开 爱丽克斯 · 凡斯 单独和 戈登 · 弗里曼 说的那些话等等 , Half-Life 的故事绝对还没完 ...","timestamp_created":1487253970,"timestamp_updated":1487253970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29960554","author":{"steamid":"76561198099557827","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":122,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":588,"last_played":1549159707},"language":"schinese","review":"玩到这里~一直期待新作~就像期待诺兰导演的新电影一样","timestamp_created":1487245942,"timestamp_updated":1487245942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29932443","author":{"steamid":"76561198079610188","num_games_owned":616,"num_reviews":116,"playtime_forever":3237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3234,"last_played":1625285379},"language":"english","review":"episode 2 fixes almost every place where hl2 falls short. the environments look more modern, the combat is actually fun, maps are huge and expansive, and it's still, in every corner and niche, true valve quality.","timestamp_created":1487122751,"timestamp_updated":1614240576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29931955","author":{"steamid":"76561198069723419","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":89,"playtime_forever":200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":139,"last_played":1487156133},"language":"russian","review":"ШЕДЕВРАЛЬНЕНЬКО","timestamp_created":1487120801,"timestamp_updated":1487120801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497605264186859131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29923262","author":{"steamid":"76561198146304873","num_games_owned":348,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1487086863},"language":"russian","review":"Игра заканчивает легендарную серию игр Half-Life.

L'histoire de HL2:Ep2 est beaucoup plus epique comme me l'a précisé el famoso junko et j'ai pas été décu.[spoiler]C'est le combat final, l'attaque pour detruire le portail une bonne fois pour toute, l'enjeu est très important, les BO accompagne bien ce sentiment jusqu'a la victoire[/spoiler]\nCom d'hab j'ai enive de vous dire que HL2:Ep2 peauniffie les idées de ses antécédent ect, mais je préfére parler ici de half life:qu'est ce qui fait de half life une serie remarquable selon moi? Pourquoi je ferai parti de ceux qui prendront au plus vite HL/Portal 3 comme Gabe Newell l'a annoncé?\nLe gameplay de la serie est d'une simplicité incroyable, les inputes etant rare: zqsd, e, clic gauche, r, la molette de la souris et defois clic droit, c'est tout pour moi perso. Cela fait de half life un jeu simple, on peut avancer, appuyer sur des bouton, tirer, recharger, changer d'arme, zommer. Mais avec si peu de commande, la serie a su nous ammener dans differentes phases de gameplay, du tir au puzzle en passant par la conduite qui necessite 2 touche de plus seulement, la gestion d'escouade ect.\nL'histoire est interessante, prenante et très cool. J'en parlerai pas trop pour pas spoiler, j'aimerai juste dire que la transistion entre le 1 et le 2 est très boen menée car même si on est pas dans black mesa, on se sent directement en tant que gordon freeman avec l'intro, et ca c'est cool.\nLes IA sont d'une humanité. Je vais surement exagerer sur cette partie mais ca fait du bien de se sentir proche de personnages dans un jeu sans qu'on se dise que c'est juste un bot qui execute des script. C'est car y'a aucune cinematique ou on ne fait rien, mais aussi par le background des perso, par les dialogues, l'humour... Tout fait qu'on s'attache aux perso et qu'on ne veut pas les quitter.\nLes jeux (surtout les petits de 3-5h) gerent bien leur durée et leur contenu pour ne pas lasser les joueurs. J'ait fait de fin decembre a ajd tout les half life duramnt mes temps de jeux solo, et j'ai toujour voulu finir tout les half life avant de me lancer dans mes autres jeux solo et ca c'est fort.\nLa bande son est incroyable, melange d'electro et de rock, très bien menée et entrainante.\nLa difficulté est plutot bien gerée, tout comme le game design, qui nous invite très rarement a allez chercher la soluce.\nUn plus pour blue shift et opposing force qui nous emmène dans la peau d'autre perso, mais toujour dans le même univers et a la même timeline que HL. J'aurais aimé une autre expansion de ce genre pour half life 2 (je critique en rien les perso de HL:Ep1&2 haibn ^^)\nBref, c'est a 100% que je vous invite a acheter le half life bundle sur steam et de vous faire comme moi tout les half life.","timestamp_created":1486474425,"timestamp_updated":1486474425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535444974899291992","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29753667","author":{"steamid":"76561198127803128","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":1355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1618918622},"language":"english","review":"2+1=","timestamp_created":1486435744,"timestamp_updated":1486435744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.410270005464553833","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29727118","author":{"steamid":"76561198095549937","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1486322800},"language":"english","review":"Oh boy, oh boy.

Definitely a must regardless, especially if you have come this far. \n\nHave fun!","timestamp_created":1485268985,"timestamp_updated":1485268985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29458154","author":{"steamid":"76561198123110771","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":548,"last_played":1484109299},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏很好，剧情大赞，就是感觉有点制作的粗糙，动不动就是BUG，莫名其妙把人给弹飞出地图了","timestamp_created":1485247554,"timestamp_updated":1485247554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29453910","author":{"steamid":"76561198131227245","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1144,"last_played":1601425438},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor jogo da minha vida jogo este jogo deis dos 9 anos joguei 1 e agora o 2","timestamp_created":1485225438,"timestamp_updated":1485225438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29451592","author":{"steamid":"76561198048040738","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":8238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3902,"last_played":1572299234},"language":"english","review":"do i need to play the other games to understand the plot of this one????!??!? i'm so confused","timestamp_created":1485212616,"timestamp_updated":1485212616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29450266","author":{"steamid":"76561198279580777","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":819,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":819,"last_played":1595776837},"language":"turkish","review":"13 yıl sonra ara oyun Alyx'in gelmesi ümit verici.

This game introduces a whole bunch of new enemies, scenery and story and really adds a lot to the original game. It takes place mostly in beautiful outdoor areas too which creates a lot of unique situations.\n\nGordon and Alex are still together and trying to reach scientists (including Alex's father Eli) at a compound in White Forest. Alex is wounded by a Hunter and Gordon must heal her with the help of the Vortugants. They eventually make it to the compound and try to close a portal to the Combine's world with a rocket.\n\nThis episode has many bends and turns in the story and adds a lot of depth to the whole Half Life experience. There is much more here than in Episode 1 and you can tell as you play through the levels how much everything is pushed forward.\n\nThe combat sequences are just as engaging too, and the end fight is simply exhausting. You really feel like you've saved planet Earth.\n\nHighly recommended, and it ties the whole series up very nicely (though the ending is a real cliff hanger and leaves future Episodes open for exploration)\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1485058314,"timestamp_updated":1485058314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29412589","author":{"steamid":"76561198042519274","num_games_owned":790,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":351,"last_played":1590091349},"language":"spanish","review":"Una maravilla de juego es tan genial el solo recordarlo.","timestamp_created":1485054108,"timestamp_updated":1485054108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29410259","author":{"steamid":"76561198116597856","num_games_owned":555,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":374,"last_played":1476768596},"language":"spanish","review":"English: One of the best episodes.
