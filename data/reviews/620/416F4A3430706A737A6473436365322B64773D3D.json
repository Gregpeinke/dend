It’s also really fun and has a cool concept so you really have no excuse to not play it.. unless you don’t have enough money to afford it. And yes, I am talking about both the first and second. So the question everyone is probably asking if your a fan of portal, Will there be a Portal 3? Can’t say much.. but I do know that if the first and second game are that successful, they will most likely make a third portal game. This game tells a very good and interesting story that will change video game history. So do I agree that Portal is a win? Absolutely! I will undoubtably love to see a Portal 3 in the future. But I will warn valve and here’s why. When making a video game or a movie, people tend to try making it better than the original than actually making a good presentation. That is why sequel’s to movies today are good, just not as good as the first one. Think of it as this way. Your favorite song just got a new cover for it. It’s good but you still like the original better. So I do think Portal is a great game and would love to see a Portal 3 in the future.","timestamp_created":1493331765,"timestamp_updated":1577321748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":23,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61290585994720459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31403219","author":{"steamid":"76561198329337411","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1493332765},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1493331674,"timestamp_updated":1493331674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31402990","author":{"steamid":"76561198116582229","num_games_owned":472,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1668,"last_played":1507614281},"language":"english","review":"+everything\n-valve","timestamp_created":1493330623,"timestamp_updated":1562603629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31402524","author":{"steamid":"76561198095588760","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":104,"last_played":1486397882},"language":"russian","review":"в Игру я поиграл всего навсего 2 часа но уже могу сказать Что игра прикольная и интересная в ней даже есть Нормальный и понятный сюжет продолжения первой части Так еще и Valve Завезли Крутой кооп В котором ты не чуствуеш что ты работаеш не один Где нужна слаженая и комадная работа И скажу Я вам я уже застрял на первом уровне кооп Так как не понял че делать ) Ставлю игре 8-10","timestamp_created":1493328757,"timestamp_updated":1540634541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.451127827167510986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31402049","author":{"steamid":"76561198208785023","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7068,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4379,"last_played":1644176741},"language":"german","review":"Geniales Spiel! \nWer bereits Fan der ebenfalls von Valve entwickelten Spiele \"Half-Life\" und\" Half-Life 2\" ist, dem ist das Spiel nur zu empfehlen.

You can play with a friend, whether online or local, in either the Valve created puzzles or community made, unless you plan to play locally on a community made map, because that, to my knowledge, is not possible. Regardless, I would still recommend this game.\n\nEdit: You can play community maps locally, but you need to use console commands, among other things.

The answer is YES I still can not believe how much better Portal 2 is than its predesescor, it truly is remarkable. The Puzzles, The Story, Graphics, Gameplay and even the general flow of the game all blow the original Portal away. If you enjoyed Portal then you are doing yourself a disservice not playing this and if you've played neither then get them both!\n\nGoing in I didn't think it was going to be as good as it was but Valve truly made something special with this one. Just when you nail down a new obstacle they introduce another keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting. The game has three incredible voices giving you instruction or insulting you the entire game and it's a very entertaining experience.\n\nListen... If you enjoy video games, a good story, puzzles or even neat easter eggs this game IS A MUST BUY!!!\n\n","timestamp_created":1493007420,"timestamp_updated":1493007420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31332665","author":{"steamid":"76561198209957851","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2040,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1001,"last_played":1600122409},"language":"english","review":"Do I really even need to talk about this one?
