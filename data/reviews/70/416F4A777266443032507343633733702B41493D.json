Повествование с использованием NPC и окружения, погружающее игрока в происходящее; отличный на то время ИИ и собственно революция в жанре FPS. Сегодняшние игры сделаны по стандарту старья 98-го года и они мало чем отличаются. Это касается даже тех вещей, о которых и не подумаешь. Задумайтесь, откуда взялась раскладка wasd? Халф лайф популяризовал и привычную всем перезарядку (одного патрона -_-). \nСюжет. Раньше сюжета игры внутри игры толком не было. Либо в руководстве пользователя написано про что там очередная стрелялка, либо в игре иногда были видеовставки и/или катсцены. И здесь мы видим, как (никогда такого не было) дружелюбные NPC, в реальном времени, что-то там вещают прямо во время игрового процесса! Ни одного видео или кат сцены здесь не увидеть, и на новом, неотрывном от геймплея методе посоветуется вся игра. Правда появился «побочный эффект» в виде молчаливости главного героя и о боже, как же долго игровая индустрия это [strike]переваривала[/strike] переваривает. Вообще, до чего все дошло, раньше то говорили, что сюжет вообще не важен, а теперь в том же перезапущенном  Думе, сюжет — отвал башки, геймплей — отвал бошек.\nСоюзные NPC это еще одна инновационная фича, правда пока это лишь ученые и охранники, без конкретных персонажей, (почти без) уникальных диалогов и прочего. Уже в дополнении эта идея будет немного развита, и это только начало, для всего игропрома.   \nМногие старенькие игры  частенько удивляют наличием различных механик, некоторые из которых могут работать даже если их и не внедряли в игру. В HL это механика стелса, которого в игре так то нет, хотя он очень даже неплохо работает. Тут же имеется продвинутый ИИ у тараканов. Тараканов, Карл! У буллсквидов например имеется обоняние, но его код по умолчанию вроде как выключен и много всего другого, обычного, о чем и не задумаешься, потому что эти вещи стали обыденностью. \nИгру хвалят за сюжет, ок, нельзя не согласится. Игру хвалят за атмосферу. Атмосфера происходящего пиздеца, да, класс, а вот карты уже такое себе. Почти вся игра это коридоры лабораторий и вентиляции, которые мало чем отличаются и к тому же чересчур запутаны. Игру еще хвалят за головоломки и сука я не понимаю, какие нахуй головоломки присутствуют в первом халф лайфе блять? Сдвинь ящик? Попрыгай по нужной последовательности порталов? Порой я поражаюсь комьюнити этой замечательной игры. Складывается впечатление, что большинство фанатов халф лайф это быдло, которое играло в компьютерные игры за всю свою жизнь раза два от силы максимум, один из которых был в клубе в начале нулевых. Листаешь обзоры на игру, так большинство из них написаны одним коротким, порой и труднопонимаемым (как речь Gman’а) предложением, в более редких случаях предложений всего четыре. \n\n[h1]Уровень заряда костюма 88% [/h1]\nP.S.

Pourtant, il y a quelque chose de particulier dans ce jeu qui fait accrocher quiconque tente l'aventure.\n\nLe gameplay est très bon, pas étonnant quand on sait que c'est le jeu qui a posé les bases des FPS d'action avec histoire. L'histoire tiens, parlons-en : comme son petit-fils Half Life 2, Half Life narre extrêmement bien son histoire. Pas de texte qui s'affiche à l'écran, pas de codex ou je ne sais quoi, juste une aventure immersive, sans interruption (enfin, une seule en rapport avec l'histoire), où l'on garde toujours le contrôle de Gordon Freeman !\n\nLe level design est très bien fait aussi, tout comme le monde en lui-même. C'est un jeu d'horreur sans en être un : les créatures sont bizarres et les boss sont intimidants, sans parler de l'ambiance glauque, mais cela ne suffit pas à effrayer un joueur armé de tout un arsenal divers et varié : très bon équilibre ambiance/action.\n\nBref, vous vous demandez si vous devez jouer à ce jeu ou non ?

Years later,  and it's still a master piece  sure it has some flaws here and there but this is worth the 7.19 dollars out of your wallet as it's a full blown game for a great price the animation and

like the game.  Gameplay is nice and smooth, but movement is slidey.  So when I'm suddenly under fire, I'll run to hide behind a crate or something, but then I'll slide past it and have to adjust and usually get hit.  sort of annoying.  Another thing: I really, really wish there were more healing items where you could just heal on the spot.  That would be nice.  Other then those 2 things, really like the game.  At the beginning when all the zombie aliens started popping up, I was really jumpy lol.  Like, I'll just be walking around and then I'll hear the creepy skittery noises that the Head Crabs make and I'll be really on edge.  I'll turn a corner and they jump out and you and I'd shoot 5 rounds of my shotgun and miss every shot because I jumped xD.  The game started to settle down with the jump scares when the military showed up tho.  Also, thank the lord that this game has built in save slots because some of the areas can get hard (playing on medium).  Graphics are good?  I think?  Were these good graphics for 1998?  They look good on my new PC tho.  The ending is... kinda weird.  Cuz it's like, \"go into the portal Freemen and fight some aliens!\"  And I'm like, \"why do I have to go into the portal?\"  \"No time just go!\"  \"ok then\".  They don't really explain stuff, y'know?  Also looking forward to seeing more of the guy at the very end, he was interesting.  Overall, good game 8/10.  Looking forward to so called god tier game that's Half-Life 2.","timestamp_created":1630784748,"timestamp_updated":1630784764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98788123","author":{"steamid":"76561198864311073","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1630783931},"language":"russian","review":"очень интересная","timestamp_created":1630783949,"timestamp_updated":1630783949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98788030","author":{"steamid":"76561198189284883","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":865,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":865,"last_played":1595289858},"language":"english","review":"classic","timestamp_created":1630783809,"timestamp_updated":1630783809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98786882","author":{"steamid":"76561198956999086","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1364,"last_played":1650744404},"language":"english","review":"Although i am glad i played this game, it was ass. I have zero clue how this can be considered one of the greatest games of all time. it was good but very below average. 1. The physics were horrible, one slight press of D and you will go flying to the right to a point of uncontrollability. The map design was sheer and utter Tom-Foolery. This game requires the most outlandish and unthinkable shit. either you drop into a room with nothing but a glock and have to fight 60 vortagons or you have to do something with no queue to figure out. Now to be fair there were some great moments, the first 4 hours are incredible and really makes you feel scared and defenceless in this new alien world but the quality goes down very quickly.
