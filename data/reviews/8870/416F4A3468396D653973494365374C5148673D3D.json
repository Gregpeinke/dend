The game also treats the player with an innovative and never-before-seen regenerating shield on top of their standard health bar.\n\nDoes not have the same sense of wonder and discovery of the previous games, mostly because Infinite is, dare I say, a completely different genre from the other BioShock games - it's an action FPS, and as far as I am concerned, the only thing that makes it remotely similar to BioShock is a brief tie-in with Rapture, and \"BIOSHOCK:\" being in the title of the game.\n\nI'd recommend it for a $10 Steam sale, not much more than that.  The Burial at Sea DLC brings you back to Rapture in the most awful way possible - playing with the same terrible, console-treated mechanics that you had to deal with in the main campaign of Infinite.  UPDATE 3/25/14:  BoS Episode 2 does a little better in this regard, forcing the player to adopt a stealthier style of play unlike the running and gunning of Infinite and DLC 1.\n\nI honestly don't get the critical circlejerk about this game.  It is easily the least fun entry in the series.  For reference, I had played the first and second BioShock games within a period of 72 hours prior to playing Infinite.\n\nUpdate 3/25/14:  Burial at Sea Episode 2 fills a lot of holes and ties a lot of plotlines together, almost to the point where it feels like filling plotholes was the only reason this DLC was created.  Nevertheless, playing as Elizabeth is a lot more interesting than Booker's chapter of the Rapture DLC, and the storyline of the second episode is a lot more important than the first.  Considering that the second DLC offers a \"recap\" of Booker's DLC, only purchasing Episode 2 is entirely feasible.","timestamp_created":1387090776,"timestamp_updated":1396026831,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":771,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589647471904754639","comment_count":35,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8051027","author":{"steamid":"76561197978523679","num_games_owned":717,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":483,"last_played":1388531280},"language":"english","review":"BIoshock Infinite... where to begin?\n\nThe story of Bioshock is one that we all have come to love. The first game was memoriable not because of the new gameplay elements it introducted with plasma, but because the story was so gripping. I played that game in ONE SITTING because i was so into the game. It was one of the only games that i have every done that with. \nBioshock 2 takes place 8 years after the first but left a hole in the plot and was almost a copy and paste version of the first.\n\nNow Bioshock Infinite comes out.\nBioshock Infinite may not offer the newest shooting elements, nor will it win any awards for the multiplayer, but this game stands out as a TRUE sequel to the first Bioshock. The characters, the story, the enviroment, everything stands out just like it did in the first Bioshock. \nIt starts with Booker DeWitt and he is searching for a woman named Elizabeth. The reasoning behind this is vague,cloudy and adds to the development of the story. \"Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt\". Columbia feels different than Rapture...yet strangely familiar. You will be impressed looking around just as you did with the first Bioshock.\n\nColumbia's world sucks you straight in and never let's up. I was surprised to see countless themes put into this new world. Racism, Social Class System, Socialism, War, Rebellion, Revolt, everything that was found in the early 20th Century.\nSome people might be turned off because of the \"religious\" theme that is found throughout the story, but believe me it does not turn the story off. \n\ni HIGHELY RECOMMEND that you search for all the VOXOPHONES to get the entire story of Bioshock Infinite.\n\nThe graphics in Bioshock Infinite are right up there with some of the best and  current PC games. Whether it comes to a keyboard or a controller the controls are tight and responsive either way. Take the time to look around and see the detail and hidden secrets that the world of Columbia has to offer. This is probably my GOT for 2013.\n\nI look forward to the newest installment of Bioshock through DLC and maybe a sequel? Who Knows?\n10/10","timestamp_created":1387089651,"timestamp_updated":1387099621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526184558868408203","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8050796","author":{"steamid":"76561198025331382","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":8230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2574,"last_played":1640727921},"language":"english","review":"It was a brilliant story (until the ending), but the gameplay was mediocre.

The concept is mind-blowing, yet executed in the game so smoothly and thoroughly. You will really appreciate the idea once you have finished a second playthrough like I did. Everything just fits, and the ending is just so thought-provoking and satisfying that maybe it sticks in your mind for a few days. If you enjoy movies like Inception or Matrix, I believe you will definitely enjoy this game.\n\nThe game world is phenomenal, set in an extreme nationalistic religious society that somehow reminds me of Animal Farm and the Civil War. It is illustrated in a radiant art style that makes you stop every now and then to contemplate the scenery.\n\nThe gameplay is ok, but it's not the best shooter (I think that VGX award is a joke). It is enjoyable despite a few flaws. You have your guns in one hand and \"magic\" in another, combining them to blow your enemies' heads off. The battle environment is also interesting, allowing variable strategy to tackle the situation. At least it will not feel repetitive unless you are about to run a fifth playthrough.\n\nOh one more thing, you will love Elizabeth like I do. She has a charming character, designed with amazing AI, and gradually you start to really care for her. Her relationship with Booker, depicted in some cutscenes will probably put tears in your eyes.\n\nIn conclusion, B:I has an amazing story with solid (but not ground-breaking) gameplay.

Initial feel was very wrong, but it all turns better once your first skull in. The gore was actually quite suprising after the first steps in this religious utopia.\n\nThe Graphics and special effects in Bioshock Infinite leave no room for complainment and you often find yourself in a glorious battle with lots of fire and lightning blazing around you. The Weapons have a real feel to them. Even the basic pistol really makes a dent in combat as long as you aim between the eyes (unlike in Bioshock 1). Combining a headshot with a salt power makes feel like a Fallout character with the legendary Bloody Mess perk picked.  All of the weapons and your special powers are upgradable and you can even dress up with items that suit your playing style best.\n\nThe movement controls have a great feel to them letting move, run and crawl and jump without any depressing delays. It's better than in FEAR 3 example, which had quite good controls too. The feel of control is only hindered by sight centering when you are jumping on a sky rail, hitting some invisible walls and getting stuck in textures just when you thought you found the perfect shortcut.\n\nMini bosses in the early game are great, but I have to give a huge minus because of the handymen later on. There is nothing more depressing then huge enemies that will only drain your ammo. It's like fighting the super mutants from FarCry 1. The only difference is that you can't skip them in Bioshock Infinite. You simply have to take em out before continuing on.\n\nVoice acting is quite solid, especially by Courtnee Draper (Elizabeth). The Environment is decent enough. If you like Noir, you will propably love it. While you mostly roll in an sky urban setting, you will find yourself fighting in less generic places like a cemetary or a bank vault from time to time. Speaking of Elizabeth, she is perhaps the best FPS ally I have ever seen. Instead of just complaining and dying she actually makes herself usefull by always keeping a lookout for anything you might need. Just as you run out of ammo she is right there ready to toss you a full loaded carbine.\n\nSome would praise Bioshock Infinite for it´s original plot line. At least it tries to be very original.  But if you see the twists miles away, then you will more like be bored with all the drama around it. Bioshock Infinite will give you little choice on any major decisions and the ones you can decide, dont really a matter. It's actually quite disturbing to be able to decide some things and be just a mindless puppet in others.\n\nAll and all Bioshock Infinite is a very solid FPS; easily better than most, but is is not something to get too hyped about. Something like 8,7/10.","timestamp_created":1386957153,"timestamp_updated":1386957153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8030775","author":{"steamid":"76561198042297826","num_games_owned":940,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":570,"last_played":1386956764},"language":"french","review":"Je viens de le finir et Wahou!\nLe gameplay est une fantastique, ils ont réussit à faire mieux que les deux premiers jeux...
