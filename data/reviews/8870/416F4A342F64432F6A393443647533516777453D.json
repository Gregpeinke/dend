What appears to be a peaceful street could be a war-torn battleground in a different version of the world. A person can be alive in one place, dead in another. Male here, female there – or never even born at all. As hero Booker DeWitt confronted these truths through the abilities of his companion, Elizabeth, I toyed with the same ideas in my own mind. If just a few things had happened differently, how would my life change? Could I be smarter? Richer? ﻿Happier? No matter how many parallel realities I ponder, I cannot imagine one in which BioShock Infinite is not among the best games I’ve played. \nIt all begins with Columbia. The floating paradise isn’t just Rapture in the sky; it is divided by its own political problems, and driven by its own ideals. The city is beautifully realized, from the early 1900s-era buildings bobbing on the clouds to the zeppelins soaring by. As Booker walks down the streets, he is surrounded by a living Norman Rockwell painting; kids play in the water from a leaking hydrant, people gawk at technological marvels at the local fair, and a general store sits unattended but for a note about the honor system. Life in Columbia seems perfect, but the real fun comes from discovering the ugly side of the city.\nDealing with themes like religion, racism, and xenophobia, Columbia is a richer and more nuanced setting than even Rapture, and the unveiling of the city’s culture is masterfully executed. Whether you’re looking at a piece of propaganda, listening to an audio log, or participating in a horrifying raffle, almost everything you encounter contributes to your understanding of the floating world. This is one of the ingenious ways Infinite blurs the lines between its component parts; Columbia may be a backdrop for the action, but the setting, narrative, and combat all loop back to reinforce each other.\nBooker wanders Columbia alone at first, but once he saves the young woman named Elizabeth from captivity, the adventure begins in earnest. Elizabeth is with Booker for most of the events that follow, and she is among the best AI companions I’ve ever had. You don’t ever need to worry about protecting her, which prevents the experience from feeling like an escort quest. Not only does Elizabeth stay out of harm’s way, she actively helps Booker by finding ammo and health, making her a valuable ally in gunfights. She can also open doors to alternate realities called “tears,” bringing objects like rocket launchers, automatons, and cover in from other worlds. She can use this ability as often as you want, but can only maintain one object at a time. This means you have a lot of options in any given encounter, but you can still adapt your approach and try new strategies.\n\nBooker’s tools in combat are less mysterious. He plows through enemies using firearms, brute force, and creative powers. I picked off foes with my shotgun as they fought off the murder of crows I summoned. I possessed a robotic George Washington and watched him cut down my Columbian aggressors. I jumped on the roller coaster-like skyline, boarded an airship, and jammed my skyhook into a foe’s throat. The upgradeable weapons and abilities – augmented by the skylines and Elizabeth’s powers – give players plenty of space to develop their own style of play. The encounter design could use more variety (you walk into a lot of wide-open areas full of tears and wait for enemies to pour in), and the meager penalty for death doesn’t keep stakes high unless you’re playing on the brutal-but-rewarding 1999 difficulty. Despite those issues, combat on the whole is fun and satisfying.\nMy favorite aspect of Infinite is the one about which I can say the least: story. The build-up is slow, but it works wonderfully thanks to the small ways other elements flow into the narrative. Elizabeth’s observations help you get to know her, and when she assists you in battle, it strengthens your connection to her. Opening tears keeps you thinking about the possibilities of other realities. Hearing the Beach Boys’ “God Only Knows” being sung in 1912 reminds you that you have a lot of questions that need answers. My only complaint on the narrative front is that the hulking Songbird is under-utilized; for such a cool concept, the beast is relegated to the role of screeching deus ex machina. Otherwise, Irrational ties the remaining story threads together to create one of my favorite game endings in years.\nReplicating the achievements of the original BioShock is a challenging goal (as 2K Marin’s sequel demonstrated), but series creator Irrational Games returns with a fresh vision and redefines what the BioShock name means. Infinite is more than a new setting, story, and characters; those elements are seamlessly integrated with complex themes, a mysterious plot, and entertaining combat to create an amazing experience from beginning to end. Familiar threads run through it – a lighthouse, a strange city, a charismatic antagonist – but they are homages to the past rather than attempts to recycle it. The core of Infinite is unlike anything else on land, sea, or air.","timestamp_created":1503857629,"timestamp_updated":1503857629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486196935176849365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34535035","author":{"steamid":"76561198007771234","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2072,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1131,"last_played":1560852325},"language":"russian","review":"Завораживающая Колумбия со своей историей, раскрывающейся по мере прохождения игры.\nБоевая система, с различными комбинациями снаряжения, способностей и оружия.\nНеожиданный и трагичный финал.\nНу и разумеется, Элизабет, в которую я влюбился по уши к середине игры :)\nБраво, мистер Девитт!\nБраво, мистер Левин!","timestamp_created":1503855635,"timestamp_updated":1503855635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34534691","author":{"steamid":"76561198066011175","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":586,"last_played":1374324910},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego, buena historia, gran juganilidad y gran apartado tecnico.

Ale to sa dokaze ocenit az neskor a hlavne u nas starsich hracov. :)\n\nEpicka jazda aku rozbehol herny vizionar Ken Levine (otec system shock 2) nenajde len tak lahko konkurenciu. Prave duchovny nastupca Bioshock dokazal vyjst z tiena system shocku a prekonat ho. V historií herneho sveta sa to podarilo len MALOKTOREJ hre. Ked prave v roku 2007 vysiel prvy Bioshock tak ten urobil mensiu hernu evoluciu ked skombinoval fantasticky hororovy pribeh s jedinecnym \"futuristickym\" podvodnym mestom Rapture ktore malo sluzit ako archa pre ludsku elitu celeho sveta ktora by nebola zavisla na vlade, nabozenstve alebo ideologií - \"No Gods or Kings, only Man\"\nNaproti tomu Bioshock infinite to berie cele z ineho uhla kedy uplne meni kulisy a z hlbin mora sa presuva daleko do oblakov resp. do nebies. Zatial co Andrew Ryan bol vizionar ktory veril v potencial cloveka a vedu, tak Zachary Hale Comstock bol jeho pravy opak tj. nabozensky/sfanatizovany clovek ktory sam seba povazoval za proroka a kladol si za ciel vyviest svoje ovecky z novodobej Sodomy za ktoru povazoval novovzniknutu uniu spojenych statov americkych. Dej sa odohrava priblizne 48 rokov pred udalostami v Rapture. Vladne rasova segregacia a dominancia nabozenskeho fanatizmu inak povedane Americky juzansky styl zivota. Vasa uloha v tomto pribehu je najst stratene dievca, kedy ako investigativny detektiv (resp. lovec ludi) musite vziat tento kontrakt aj vdaka dlhom, lenze ono to nakoniec bude predsa len inak. Kto by ale cakal klasicke cliché, tak bude celkom (ne)milo prekvapeny. Viac uz hra...\n\nHodnotenie DLC:\n\nClash in the Clouds - samostatny mod zamerany len na suboje bez pribehu. Nieco na styl Areny. Skvele na vyblbnutie\n\nBurial at Sea part.1 - prva cast pribehoveho DLC ktora nas zavedie opat do podvodneho mesta Rapture este pred udalostami prveho Bioschocku kedy mate moznost vidiet mesto pred katastrofou v neznicenych kulisach. V pribehu vystupujete opat ako detektiv Booker DeWitt a musite vypatrat stratenu Sally, samozrejme tento kontrakt dostanete od zahadnej krasky Elizabeth. Pribeh tak posobi Noir dojmom poctivych oldschool detektivok. Bohuzial pridavok je pomerne kratky tj. asi 2-3h herneho casu.\n\nBurial at Sea part.2 - V druhom pridavku uz pokracujete ako Elizabeth a snazite sa najst Sally, ktora bola unesena. Hratelnost sa vyrazne preniesla z akcneho do stealth stylu. Pribudli nove zbrane a plazmidy a tiez zazijete mensi comeback do veternej Columbie. Tato cast je zaroven aj rozlucka zo svetom Bioschoku a uzavrie tak jednu skvelu sagu.\n\nHodnotenie: 10/10 = V dnesnej zaplave srackoidnych hier s MMO/F2P titulmi kde je vsade nasilne narvany openworld a mikrotransakcie posobi tato saga ako klenot. O to viac zamrzi zanik studia ktore za znackou Bioshock stalo (Irrational Games) kedy prave single pribehove hry su na ustupe a predavaju stafetu generickym MP titulom s nulovou hodnotou ale zato s kopec platenym obsahom na ktorom sa da aj po rokoch uspesne nadalej ryzovat.

5/5 - Superb\n\nFor the past years, I have been fairly dedicated to playing racing games and RPG's. FPS games have never been on my radar, but when I first saw videos and read the premise of the story, I knew I had plenty of expectation. I can confidently say that, this game goes above my expectations.\n\nWhat I liked:\nThe game is very forgiving for first time FPS gamers. I enjoyed the difficulty during combat. It was intense, but nothing beyond impossible (depending on what difficulty you find comfortable). In this game, combat isn't the main focal point. \n\nThe main thing you will enjoy, is the amazing story behind this game. I won't say anything, since this game packs so much, but as you progress throughout the game, you will care less about the combat, and more of what will could happen in the game. The story kept me at my toes, and in my opinion, it has so many twists and turns, that you will find it difficult to stay away from this game ( and yes. Yes, I took an all-nighter to finish this game).\n\nI plan to replay this game again, since this game has objectives I have not completed in some levels, and there are many parts throughout the game, that help you understand the plot more. Your task is, to find out where to look.\n\nWhat I Disliked:\nSince it was my first FPS, the only thing I regretted was not having enough practice. I died around 10 times throughout the whole game, but it wasn't too much.\n\nMy Conclusion:\nI'M LOVING IT! I hope the devs could make a new game, that hopefully is a continuation of this story.","timestamp_created":1503785213,"timestamp_updated":1503785213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34514954","author":{"steamid":"76561198042999863","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":716,"last_played":1503783661},"language":"french","review":"La Fin c'est de la grosse M.erde !!!\nUne  m.erde COLOSSALE !!!\n\nLa fin est telment à CHIER que je regrette d'avoir acheter le jeux !!!\nj'aurai du me contenter des 2 autres Bioshock !\n\nSérieux ne l'acheter pas surtout si il coute + de 5€\nAttender des réduction sinon sa vaul vraiment pas le coup à cause de la fin minable, pitoyable et vraiment débile !!!","timestamp_created":1503783979,"timestamp_updated":1503784013,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.369127511978149414","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34514708","author":{"steamid":"76561198257992720","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1574810466},"language":"schinese","review":"当我把画面对准看不懂的信息或是标牌看到左上角出现的中文时我就决定来点赞了  如此贴心的设定居然是我第一次见识到  心中有句mmp  别的不说  这游戏用五分钟就让我感动到了并且唤醒了我的羞耻心  是时候补习一下English了.....","timestamp_created":1503783162,"timestamp_updated":1503783162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34514216","author":{"steamid":"76561198174771343","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":917,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1534958083},"language":"italian","review":"Beh che dire, Bioshock è un gioco spettacolare, uno dei migliori ai quai abbia mai giocato.

Story-Rich ที่สุดยอดที่สุดเท่าที่ผมเคยเล่นมา ตอนเล่นจบใหม่ๆ(ก่อนพิมพ์ไม่กี่ชั่วโมง)ก็มึนๆว่าเกิดไรขึ้นบ้างวะแต่พอไปนั่งอ่านสรุปแล้วจับใจความก็ได้ว่า\nเนื้อเรื่องมีความเกี่ยวข้องกับประวัติศาสตร์ของอเมริกาเป็นอย่างมากจริงควรมีความรู้ในประวัติศาสตร์ของอเมริการะดับหนึ่งหรือไปอ่านสรุปที่อธิบายถึงเหตุการณ์จริงก็ได้ หากนำมาปะติดปะต่อกับเนื้อเรื่องภายในเกมได้แล้วจะทำให้มีความรู้สึกว่าเนื้อเรื่องของเกมนี้มันเกินระดับพระเจ้าไปแล้ว\nGameplay ดีมากในระดับหนึ่ง หักออกนิดนึงตรงกระสุนหมดแล้วต้องเปลี่ยนปืนบ่อยๆ(ต้องอัพเกรดปืนหลากหลาย)และดำเนินเกมเป็นเส้นตรงมาก  อารมณ์ประมาณอ่านนิยายคือเกมมันบังคับเล่าเรื่องจนจบ มีsub questบ้างแต่ไม่มีทางเลือกที่มีผลต่อเกมเลย เนื้อหาที่เหลือต้องไปตามในDLCต่อไป\nภาพสวยมากที่สุด ภาพแนวAntiqueมากๆๆสมกับเวลาในเกมคือช่วงยุค1900 ส่วนบรรยากาศน่ากลัวคิดว่าเป็นเอกลักษณ์ของเกมเครือBioShock ภาพนี่ขนาดเกมออกมาได้เกือบ5ปีแล้วยังถือว่าอลังการงานสร้างมากๆ ซื้อราคาแพงกว่าราคาเต็ม2เท่าก็ยังไม่เสียดาย\nไม่เคยเล่นBioShockมาก่อนจึงไม่ทราบว่าความน่ากลัวจะต่างกับภาคแรกมากแค่ไหน แต่ส่วนตัวเล่นแล้วกลัวมากบางช่วงเลยเปิดเพลงตามด้วยลดเสียงประกอบเลยจบเกมได้ ฮ่าๆ :p\nส่วนตัวให้ 9/10 ลบจากการเล่นครั้งแรกเพราะต้องเชื่อมโยงเนื้อหาได้หลังเล่นจบและจำเป็นต้องผูกเรื่องจากรายละเอียดเล็กน้อยอีกมาก จึงควรหาข้อมูลที่สรุปให้ดีๆก่อนถึงจะอินมากๆ และเล่นครั้งที่สองเพื่อซึมซับเนื้อเรื่องทั้งหมด ที่เหลือเล่นเอาสนุกก็ยังคุ้ม แนะนำให้ใช้Vigorsให้ครบทุกอย่าง คาดว่าจะซื้อDLCต่อเลยเพื่อปะติดปะต่อเนื้อหา\nEdit:ลืมเพิ่มให้เพราะBOT Elizabethฉลาดมากๆๆๆๆๆ เดินเก่ง ไม่ติดบัคเหมือนบอทเกมทั่วไป มีประโยชน์มากๆส่งของให้เมื่อถึงคราวจำเป็น และที่สำคัญElizabethน่ารักมากกกกกกกก ทั้งจากเนื้อหาและนิสัยส่วนตัว รักกกกกกกกกกกนาง

the very strong customer reviews of this game, I was really looking forward to playing. It was kind of a let down. It was good enough for me to play through once, though I doubt I'll ever touch the game again. It's a fair shooter and the design clearly pushes the vigor system on the player, but I hardly used it. Maybe you can't get away with that on Hard mode, but on Normal it was easy enough. Combat was extremely repetitive and, with a regenative shield, is pretty trivial as long as you don't stray too far from cover.\n\nThe story of the game... it's a complete mess. The story has a bit of an Emperor's New Clothes thing going on. It seems deep and complicated, but it's just simply incoherent and either relies on action or handwaving to distract its audience from questioning the story too closely.\n\nIf you liked the previous Bioshocks, like FPS, and can get the game on sale, go for it. But, for the uninitiated to the series who don't really like shooters -- take a pass.","timestamp_created":1503764138,"timestamp_updated":1503764138,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485025674104690552","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34507846","author":{"steamid":"76561198161367756","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":454,"last_played":1504183534},"language":"english","review":"+ Great Story\n+ Great Graphics \n\nIf you have Framerate stutter/drops, try this:\n1.
