There isn't much variation in the game, you just shoot various types of monsters, and can choose between different maps and perks which provide you with a different set of skills/weapons depending on levels. Now in case that was confusing to read I shall bullet point the rest:\n\n[list]\n    [*][b]Different monsters[/b] which I find a hella lot more terrifying than zombies, especially when they sneak up on you, you're weaker than them, and your teammates aren't around to have your back (or you decided you'd play 'hell on earth' difficulty on solo with a level 1 perk...\n    [*]A [b]different set of perks[/b] like sharpshooter, commando, beserker, demolitionist and more; each have their own set of weapons and fighting styles (explosives, melee, assault rifles etc.) and [b]none seem overpowered[/b] to me - it all depends on the players' level.\n    [*]Each perk can be leveled up by completing actions [b]specific to that perk[/b] i.e. medic can level up by healing players a certain amount of points.\n[*] You don't level up quickly, which can be seen as a good or bad point depending on whether you're a completionist, a grinder, or someone who just enjoys the game! As I enjoy the game, I am perfectly happy to keep playing until I've topped up all the possible perks (that is because I am a little bit of a completionist too).\n[*] [b]Different difficulty levels[/b]. I personally found trying to start my first few games on normal were just too damn hard. It kind of forces you to progress through the difficulties, which I personally like. Of course if you can find teamates that are a higher level than you then this may help.\n[*] [b]No crosshairs[/b], which I really like, it adds a bit of realism. Although there may be a crosshairs option in the settings but tbh the menu is a bit shonky...\n[*] The [b]guns and gun mechanisms[/b] are great in my opinion. They don't reload super quick, which can be stressful when you have a heard of specimens in front of you. That just adds to my enjoyment.\n[*] [b]No pay to win.[/b] You can purchase guns and outfits in game but it's for customisation.\n[*] There are a set of [b]waves[/b], the amount depends on what game mode you're playing; each wave has more specimens, with the final wave having a boss.\n[*] There is something called [b]'zed time'[/b], where time slows down. This can be annoying when it happens multiple times in a short space of time, but since I like the gun mechanisms and blowing of specimen's heads it gives me that extra time to enjoy it... seriously, it's so satisfying seeing each bullet leave your pistol and then watching your person reload the weapon!\n[*] Despite there being a KF2, there are [b]still enough players to enjoy multiplayer co-op[/b], and I believe there are enough differences to enjoy the two games separately. Most of the people I've encountered have been really good to play with. Playing on harder difficulties, and not playing as a team just don't really work in the game. \n[*] If you die in later waves, you can be pretty screwed as you need money to buy more powerful weapons, but like I've said, most players are helpful and will throw their dosh at you to help you purchase weapons.\n[*] In game character voices are English with mostly cockney (spelt correctly? :S) accents, which is enjoyable. \n[*] Personally, I think the game has aged well. To me I think the graphics are still great and the detail on the weapons and specimens are great. \n[/list]\n\nMy review is biased but when you can buy the game and now have the option of refunding it if it's not for you, why not just give it a go and see for yourself? It's not perfect, but it has loads of replay value and is great fun to play, especially with others.","timestamp_created":1461821496,"timestamp_updated":1461821584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22680949","author":{"steamid":"76561198192768586","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":747,"last_played":1483899563},"language":"english","review":"This game is wonderfull because there is a workshop\n","timestamp_created":1461803173,"timestamp_updated":1461803173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22663922","author":{"steamid":"76561198117930717","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":115,"playtime_forever":1414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1275,"last_played":1586294382},"language":"russian","review":"В далеком 2010 я играл в эту игру еще на пиратке, я нашел однажды сервер и около трёх часов я сидел не отрываясь.

And after you've become tired of the base game weapons, you can purchase more weapons via dlc packs. And the dlc weapons are either reskins or whole new weapons, so it adds even more variety. I've been playing with just the base game weapons, if I want to use the dlc weapons, I can trade them off someone and paying them dosh for it (in-game currency). So, no real money is really needed to use dlc weapons as long as you play with someone who has them!\n\nZeds are interesting and challenging, it will take practice to understand various strategies on killing them. It's not always as simple as shooting them, some bigger zeds might require specific strategies to kill effectively. And if you get bored of base game zeds, you can play against 3 reskinned themes including halloween, hillbilly, and christmas zeds. If that's not enough, there are custom mod servers out there with brand new zeds and weapons. You need only join these custom servers and the game will do the rest for you (downloading them and such).\n\nThe music is metal and it's nice to listen to. Personally, I turn the music off when I play because it's easier to hear zeds behind you without screaming metal blasting in the background.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Lots of weapons\n[*]Challenging enemies\n[*]Fun teamplay elements\n[*]Money management\n[*]Chat commands are often funny or informative (i.e. Insult Players)\n[*]You can get dlc weapons off other players (no purchase of dlc required)\n[*]No sprint (some people say this is a con but I think it's a pro because it adds desperation and challenge to a given situation. I think sprint in KF2 ruined the experience.)\n[*]High recoil on weapons\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Metal music can be distracting if you're not watching your back\n[*]Lobby ads can get really annoying (there are mods to change/disable them)\n[*]Menu buttons are sometimes a little wonky (requiring a second or third click)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Dark filter makes colours seem dull but it increases the gritty atmosphere\n[*]Trader dialogue gets on my nerves sometimes (personal preference so not a con)\n[*]Modding sounds or music will change it for singleplayer but not online\n[*]Only one boss but his diologue is funny\n[*]Some strategies are kind of cheesy but fun to do yourself (i.e. blowing up boss with a few dozen demo charges)\n[/list]\n\nI can't think of anything else to add but it's definately a golden title of a game, I highly recommend it.
