Ne bekleriz yeni bir oyun aldığımızda?\nÖzgün olsun, oynanışı keyifli olsun; keyfini kaçıracak kadar zor, keyifsiz hâle getirecek kadar kolay olmasın, senaryosu doyurucu olsun, grafikler yeterli olsun vesaire vesaire. \nBakalım Portal 2'ye:\nPortal zaten aşırı derecede özgün bir fikir, bunun aksini söyleyemeyiz sanırım. İkinci oyun da bundan yeterince nasibini almış, farklı bir oyun deneyimi sunuyor bize.\nOynanışı keyifli mi? Kesssinlikle! :) Şahsen Fallout gibi, Skyrim gibi RPG'lere düşkün birisi olmama ve hack&slash de sevmeme rağmen portal 2'nin oyun sistemi yaklaşık bir saat oynamamın ardından beni ciddi şekilde etkiledi. O bir saat de sizi portal evrenine alıştırma evresi, portalların ve oyundaki diğer elementlerin kullanışını keşfetme vakti diyelim. Basit meseleleri kavradığınızda, bambaşka bir evrende, farklı bir sistemde olduğunuzu anlayınca oynanışın keyfini farkediyorsunuz zaten. \nKeyif kaçıracak kadar zor olan bölümler var elbette. Neticede bu nereden bakarsanız bakın bir zekâ oyunu olarak görülebilir. Bütün bölümlerde kafayı biraz zorlamak gerekiyor. Bazı bölümlerde ise motoru yakma ihtimaliniz yüksek. Yine de bu -kulağa biraz mazoşistçe gelse de- zekâsını sınamak isteyen, klasik fps'lerden sıkılıp da biraz bulmaca çözmek isteyen herkes için keyifli olacaktır. Tavsiyem, bir bölümde yarım saatten fazla kaldıysanız ''belki'' walktrough videolarına başvurmanız. Her takıldığınızda bakmak oyunun amacına ters düşer zira.\nSenaryo ve karakterlerin işlenişi ise bambaşka bir mevzu. Bunun yaşayıp görülmesi gereken bir olay olduğunu düşünüyor ve ayrıntı vermekten kaçınıyorum :)\nGrafikler de keza nev-i şahsına münhasır diyebileceğimiz nitelikte. Oyunun ilerleyişine uygun, sade gibi görünen ancak görkemli olan efektlerle ve çevre modellemeleriyle oyun üzerindeki emek rahatlıkla okunuyor. \nVelhasılıkelâm, ben bu oyunu uzun zamandır geri planda tutuyordum ama ne kadar büyük bir hata yaptığımı oynamaya başlayınca anladım.

Well what is there to say? This game is like watching a movie (a good movie), only better, SO much better. I like games that make you think, and if you look up some things about how the making of this game and its prequal went about being accomplished, you'll gain a new appreciation for it. There's even a Developer Commentary in-game for even more information on its making.\n\nYou can also make your own maps and play ones that others have created. Granted about 1% of the maps are actually good, but there's over 400,000 maps available, so that's about 4,000 good maps; that's not too bad really. There's even a community made set of race maps called \"Gelocity\" (and a few others) that never get old, they let you race in a few different ways, but all the time thinking with portals. Gelocity 3 has to be my favorite though, its one of (if not THE) best racing activities I've ever played! and I love my racing. ]:)\n\nThe coop mode is pretty great as well, it really changes the way you think with p0rtals and offers a new challenge to anyone who has played the game already (there are also coop maps in the workshop).\n\nAll in all, you'll probably never get tired of this game and all the options it has to offer.\n\nDo I reccomend this game? No. I say it's a must have for anyone who likes puzzles. Don't know why or how they're called puzzles? Get the game, you'll soon find out.
