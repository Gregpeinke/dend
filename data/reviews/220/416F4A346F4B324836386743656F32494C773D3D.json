Whilst the new enviroments are nice to look at, the Vehicle sections feel like too much of ' Lets see how big and far we can make it' and at times you feel genuinely carsick playing especially in the Waterboat chapter.\n\nThe opening Is so goddamn epic, you are in a huge city, awakened after 20 years in stasis, it feels like a huge movie or something. This is probably one of the first games that really gave you that epic cinematic storytelling feel you are used to these days. I feel it never really gets going, like for all the scale and grandeur the opening chapter promises, It never quite comes full circle, most of the weapons feel useless and the Gravity gun is a really fantastic idea and feature, but it is never utilised in a puzzle manner , just grab stuff and fling it at enemies.\n\nHowever whilst I feel it is overhyped, and preferred the original, this is a worthy sequel, you get invested in the characters and story and feel really immersed. I don't think there was anything else like this at the time, not even Halo. Really was the pinnacle of its era.\n\nDon't forget it's follow ups expansions \" Stare at alyx's Ass and its sequel Stare some more at alyx's ass\"\n\n 8.5/10","timestamp_created":1412724674,"timestamp_updated":1412724674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12405115","author":{"steamid":"76561198083974273","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":665,"last_played":1612840364},"language":"english","review":"I think this game should be known by everyone.

My playtime on the steam version is only on the \"Normal-Easy\" setting. I am planning to play on the hardest difficulty soon)\n\nThis game is phenominal.\nBack when the FPS genre was something to look forward to, the Half-Life series was no exception.\nIn this installment of Half-Life, you are the almighty slayer/scientist Gordon Freeman, summoned again to defeat any opposition in your way, trying to take back Earth from the Combine.\n\nThe game itself has a rich story and wonderful lore. Half-Life 2 explaines everything to you without having to play the first one. In fact, in my opinion, Half-Life 2 handled storytelling much better than the first installment.\nEvery character has a personallity, from Alyx, Eli, Barney, Dr. Kliner, Etc. Even some of the \"Single Serving NPS's\" have a bit of personality. Like Father Grigori. Even NPS's that don't say much are well known, like the \"Counsoling Couple\". The dialogue is also a plus, my favorite line is from Barney, we all know what it is! \"And if you see Dr. Breen, tell him I said, 'F*CK YOU'\"! (Srry Barney \"oweing beer\" fans, if any out there lol)\n\nThe gun/game play is also top notch. The game itself has a world that you can interact with where other games don't let you. This promotes thought-provoking \"puzzles\" and makes the Gravity Gun one of the best weapons in Gaming Hsitory. Seriously, two whole levels promotes the Gravity Gun alone. The games design encourages felxable ways to dispatch your foes, and that makes the game much more interesting! Personally, I've played a run with only using the shotgun. (Except in RPG/GG Portions) \n\nGraohics are good for the year 2004, and even today I still promote the graphics.\nThe game length will take you about 10-12 hours if you play on normal. However, this game will sucker you back in for sure. I did, that's why I got the \"Orange Box\" and steam edition. I NEEDED to play the game again. \n\nPractically any PC can run this game, I've played this on a hoopty laptop from 2008 and it ran the game like a YouTube Video.\n\nOverall, Half Life 2 is a great game that you should play at least one time. It's a fun and amazing experience. \nTruly one of the best.","timestamp_created":1412658189,"timestamp_updated":1412658189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12395255","author":{"steamid":"76561198072547775","num_games_owned":554,"num_reviews":94,"playtime_forever":19838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1756,"last_played":1497419223},"language":"german","review":"sehr gutes game!","timestamp_created":1412647724,"timestamp_updated":1412647724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12395052","author":{"steamid":"76561198038827238","num_games_owned":234,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1032,"last_played":1608501020},"language":"english","review":"Do you like games? Do you like amazing atmosphere, a good story, and a creepy undertone on your games? Well, here we are. I'm 6 years late to the party, but Half Life 2 is one of my favorite games ever. I have stated some of the reasons above for why I think this, but the game is all those things crafted together into one very fun package that combines fast-paced action and clever puzzles to create an awesome beacon of awesomeness. If you're thinking about buying the DLC's, Episode 1 sort of sucked and was not very important story wise, but did have a couple cool moments. Episode 2 is on par with or maybe even better than Half Life 2, and is important to story and provides much more fun gameplay compared to Episode 1.

Если Вы раньше в неё не играли, то я НЕ рекомендую начинать!\nДа, я знаю, что [b] [i] это почитаемый многими шедевр и ностальгический идол. Эта игра много сделала для развития игровой индустрии, и у неё всё ещё (спустя 10 лет!) сравнительно приличная графика и физика. В этом плане 5+! Тут я с вами, ребята! Если Вы про то, чтобы поощрить разрабов, то я тоже не против! Я не жадный человек, и у меня есть чувство благодарности. [/i] [/b]\nДа, игра и правда хороша, особенно на фоне того мусора, который частенько выходит в этом жанре. У неё прекрасный движок, и она представляет собой нечто большее, чем просто шутер.\nНо если меня спросят, советую ли я купить её сегодня, чтобы получить удовольствие, мой ответ - нет. Почему? \nПотому что кроме движка и игровой механики существует ещё сюжет, разнообразие игрового процесса и общая логика, связывающая воедино сюжет и игровой процесс. Здесь игра подотстала, и я считаю, что это хорошо, значит игровая индустрия развивается дальше, а не сидит на попе ровно в ожидании третьей Халфы, чтобы тупо её скопировать.\n\n\nВот четыре самых очевидных минуса:\n * Во-первых, наш герой постоянно молчит. На все, что ему говорят, он отвечает гробовым молчанием. Он не здоровается, не благодарит и даже не ругается. Всё, что нам нужно знать  и делать, скажут игровые персонажи. Так что делайте, что Вам говорят.\n * Во-вторых, гвоздодер. Такое впечатление, что докторскую степень наш протагонист получил в каком-то институте физической культуры на факультете по гвоздодёрному бою. Вообще не совсем понятно, почему именно наш протагонист (учёный) спасает мир, ведь для этого нужно всего три вещи: иногда стрелять, постоянно бить всех гвоздодёром и изредка дергать рычаги.\n * В-третьих, мы идём по тропинке. В прямом смысле. Вы будете делать так, как за Вас решили. Или умрёте.\n * В-четвёртых, сюжет. Зубы сводит от всех этих научных катастроф, которые ставят Землю на грань вымирания. И не важно, кто там виноват - зомби, ожившие машины, гоблины, демоны или пришельцы. Почему? Потому что у нас есть гвоздодёр, который разом их всех уфигачит. Потому что против лома нет приёма, и выбора, кроме как спасти этот мир, у нас нет!\nНо есть выбор - покупать ли данную игру?","timestamp_created":1412436606,"timestamp_updated":1458235490,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":43,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.369255661964416504","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12362210","author":{"steamid":"76561198055938972","num_games_owned":404,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1072,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":984,"last_played":1460913803},"language":"french","review":"Magnifique jeu !","timestamp_created":1412434914,"timestamp_updated":1412434914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478723406791687012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12362162","author":{"steamid":"76561198075818540","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1412154719},"language":"russian","review":"Игра довольно увлекательная, захватывающая, приятная и интересная.
