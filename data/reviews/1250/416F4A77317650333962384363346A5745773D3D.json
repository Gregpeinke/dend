Что же в ней такое,что не дает покоя игрокам спать???\n[h1] 1. ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ\t[/h1]\nГеймплей очень прост,есть пространство,есть монстры,есть пушки, и конечно же друзья и просто случайные товарищи по команде и кончно же прокачка своего альтер-эго. Все это смешивается в отличный коктейль игрового действа.Все захоы на карту не будут повторяться,нельзя точно сказать как закончится волна атакующих мутантов,откуда выпрыгнут человекопауки)Каждый раз начиная новую игру,вроде действуешь по отработанной схеме,вроде и двери завариваешь где надо,и деньгами делишься,но что нибудь идет не так и твоих товарищей разрывает разгневанный ФлешПаунд.Это только способствует огромной реиграбельности игры,ты не можешь остановиться,пытаешься пройти идеально каждую волну(количество которых настраивается 4,7 или 10,а с мутаторами и до бесконечности)\n[h1] 2. АРСЕНАЛ\t[/h1]\nЭто наверно единственная игра в которой настолько много оружия(некоторое только из платных DLC),что поначалу глаза разбегаются,и тут для каждого найдется оружие по душе.Тут и огнеметы,арбалеты,меч Эскалибур ,конечно же Автомат Калашникова и еще десятка три отличных пушек.Мутанты будут взрываться, сгорать, разваливаться на части.\n[h1] 3. ЗВУКОВОЕ ОФОРМЛЕНИЕ\t[/h1]\nТут то же все отлично,тяжелая музыка добавляет драйва происходящему месиву на экране,кричащие мутанты и звуки выстрелов смешиваются в отличную песню)Озвучка реплик персонажей тоже хорошая,хотя и немного смешная.\n[h1] 4. ГРАФИКА\t[/h1]\nА вот с графикой тут все не так уж отлично.Из-за возраста движка игры,выжать картинку с бешеной детализацией не вышло.Но все смотрится все на твердую 4,кровь,кишки,дым огонь,дождь,отлетающие куски мутантов,выполнено  хорошо,глаза не режет и геймплею не мешает.Да и вообще это только плюс игре,можно играть даже на компютерах года так 2006,и не боятся,все пойдет.\n[h1]  От себя\t[/h1]\nВ первый раз играл в эту игру в 2007 году,очень не понравилось. Через два года поиграл снова,да еще и с напарником,и тут понеслось...Полтора года,каждый день,по три четыре часа игры,без перерывов на перекуры,выкачаны были все перки и пройдены все карты на всех сложностях,куча модов и карт были опробованы,игра не надоедала...но это была п и р а т к а.Теперь ,имея версию в стиме, не надо заморачиваться с командами в консоли что бы поиграть,найти какой нибудь мод или отличную карту нет проблем.Хотя именно в стиме было наигранно мало часов,так уж сложилось лично у меня.Игра столько лет остается популярной,что пожалуй её можно назвать одной из лучших игр.\n\n\n\n[h1] 9,5 клотов из 10\t[/h1]","timestamp_created":1374409153,"timestamp_updated":1430816510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557909905910491943","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1010361","author":{"steamid":"76561197984310095","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":27329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10948,"last_played":1464514341},"language":"russian","review":"Образец совершенно задротского шутера старой школы.

If the team fails, the 2+ of you can branch off and separate. Anyways, it promotes good communication, teamwork, knowledge, and super satisfying holdouts.\" - 2013\n\nI'm updating this six years later to say that this game isn't even dead yet, despite having a sequel. It definitely retains its charm and intensity; and the core gameplay holds up despite six years of innovations in the industry.

What else could a man wish for? Excactly, meat. Unfortunatly, meat is not included in this game. But the aforementioned are, and that sorta makes up for it. The game is about surviving about 10 waves (this you can adjust) of different types of zombies before facing the Patriarch. He would be the boss. Like in every wave-based game, the time inbetween waves can be used to buy supplies. In this case weapons more than anything, and lots of them too! There are 6 classes, each with unique specialties. For example, the Medic is good with healing shit, has a gun to heal blokes with from afar and can buy dirt cheap armour. For another example, the support specialist has a lot of stat upgrades for shotguns, has more grenades and can carry more shit. You see, 4 shotguns, a grenade launcher and a machine gun is better than the stupid sniper and pistol combo the lame sharpshooters use (we have a history)! But there is one major problem with the perks. You see, leveling is just too slow when it takes you 75 (!) hours to get to lvl 4 with ONE perk. ONE!!! And it only gets worse. I'll probably need another 100 hours to get that perk to the maximum level of 6. And that's be 1/6 of the total amount of classes. It is seriously sick. Other than that, the game is great. I mean, who needs leveling, right? Leveling in this game only upgrades those stat bonuses you get for being that class. You know, you become better at your specialties. That's not really necessary, it's only useful if you want to stand a chance against the Hard, Suicide and Hell on Earth difficulties. But those are retardedly hard and I do not recommend them, it is pure suffering. Suicidal really gives you suicidal thoughts. Moving on, the different mutilated people are awesome too. You have some weak mutilations, small ones, fast ones, ranged ones, really strong ones, absurdly strong ones and absurdly annoying ones. This adds some spice to the mix, and especially the stronger zombie types make this one hard game. That's another nice thing about this game, it's hard. Even with my level 4 perk, it all depends on my team wether we win or not. If we have at least one medic to keep us alive and one sharpshooter to relatively easily take down the bigger baddies and some balanced support to keep those alive and stick together, we will probably make it. If, however, you get stuck in team 'LETS ALL SNIPE YAYAYAYA' or team 'LETS SPLIT UP YAYAYAYAYAYYAA' you are doomed. With a normal team it's an exciting challenge, and honestly, normal teams are the most fun. Team 'we can do this all day with our lvl 6 perks' barely leaves anything for you. Anyway, to the important part: maps and guns! There are also billions of good maps and billions of very nice guns. Altough some guns feel unoriginal, there are a lot of them. For every perk you can count on at least 5 original and fun weapons, and maybe 4-5 lame-o weps that are only slightly different. But hey, the more guns the less problems, right? Having a lot of guns is never a complaint. And every summer/winter/halloween more maps and guns get added, and this summer even a new gamemode! Wow! That really gets you back in the game, if only for a few hours. It's awesome. So I guess that's my review. Pretty brilliant game. It's free every half year during the summer/winter sale, so you can check it out then. If you like it, you can immediatly buy it with a 75% discount.

If you plan on playing the game solo, it is unlikely to prove very entertaining for you, seeing as how the game only offers two gamemodes after years of availability, objective mode (2 maps) and survival mode. If, however, you play the game with friends it can be more fun than most co-op survival games. The gunplay is spot on, the cheezy dialong is entertaining, and the balance is very solid. The game does tend to get stale fairly quickly if you play alone and focus on the progression system though, seeing as the gamemode options are slim and it takes a very long time to maxx out any of the perks.","timestamp_created":1374068405,"timestamp_updated":1385574956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2867088","author":{"steamid":"76561198013803272","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":13519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10803,"last_played":1577028278},"language":"italian","review":"[h1]PRO[/h1]\n\n[b]- DIFFICILE:[/b] Gli amanti delle sfide avranno pane per i loro denti.\n[b]- VARIO:[/b] Tantissime armi, stage, personaggi e obiettivi da sbloccare.\n[b]- SPAVENTOSO:[/b] Il Patriarca vi farà venire la strizza!\n\n[h1]CONTRO[/h1]\n\n[b]- DIFFICILE:[/b] Per alcuni potrebbe risultare troppo impegnativo.\n\n[h1]VOTO: 8/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1374064460,"timestamp_updated":1465252412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1865188","author":{"steamid":"76561197999035159","num_games_owned":970,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":8133,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3354,"last_played":1657335697},"language":"english","review":"Killing floor is called an \"Survival co-op horror game\" it ain't that much horror during events but it sure still is rather creepy. \nThe game is mostly an firstperson shooter which has up to 6 player co-op online (Unless you mod the game, then you can be up to 32 or something) \nThe gameplay is mostly just shoting zeds and buying better wepons, it might not seem like a good game in the begining but it's actuly a rather nice game, even though somethings still needs to get fixed. Like some achivments don't unlock even though you do all the things for the achivment. But to talk more about the game things.\n\nGraphics: 7/10 The graphics of this game is an small bit outdated but they are still quite nice, so that's why it gets 7 out of 10 on that.\n\nMusic: 5/10 The music is sometimes just anoying to have in the backround mostly cause you can sometimes not hear the zeds and you might die cause of it, but you can have the music on low to improve how you hear the zeds. The music is quite nice and adds to the game though, so that's why it gets an 5 out of 10\n\nGameplay: 8/10 The gameplay might feel a bit repedative after a while, so this might not be a game that you would play for like 10 hours in a straight row, but it surely is fun when you play this game with friends, the game adapts to how many players which are playing and makes it harder, and with the 7 diffrent perks you can get some varaiety to the gameplay\n\nOnline: 7/10 The online in this game is mostly rather great except for some small feature are anoying like \"Join while game is in action, no level minimum for each difficulity on some servers, no kicking on some servers\" and that list can go on forever but it does destroy some parts of the online, but not that much if you manage to get a full team of 6 players which you know and you all have mics so that you can comunicate.\n\nSo my final verdict for this game is an 7.5 out of 10, it's a good game if you have friends to play with cause this is a game made for co-op and you will get bored quite easily if you play it solo, but if you find it for a very low price I sudgest that you buy it if you enjoy killing zombies and playing with friends","timestamp_created":1374062908,"timestamp_updated":1374062908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1225611","author":{"steamid":"76561197989603548","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":4442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2184,"last_played":1477859151},"language":"russian","review":"Ненапряжная стрелялка, переросшая из мода в отдельную игру.\n+ зомби! резать зомбей всегда весело\n+ разное оружие и классы\n+ сложность, отсидеться в кустах не получится, найдут и сожрут даже на средней сложности\n+ замедление времени, удобно ставить хедшоты\n+ сезонные ивенты, мелочь, а приятно\n- мало карт, приедаются\n- замедление времени в неудачный момент может раздражать","timestamp_created":1374062111,"timestamp_updated":1374062111,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5156995","author":{"steamid":"76561198045740786","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":291,"last_played":1435211106},"language":"english","review":"\n","timestamp_created":1374051868,"timestamp_updated":1374051868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1vP39b8Cc4jWEw=="}
