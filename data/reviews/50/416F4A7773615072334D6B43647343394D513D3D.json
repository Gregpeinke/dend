See Conclusion[/h1]\n\n[h1]NOTE:[/h1]\nAlso see my: \n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/70/] Half Life (1) Review[/url] \n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/220]Half-Life 2 Review[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/130]Half-Life: Blue Shift Review[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/362890?tscn=1431108183]Black Mesa Review[/url]\n\n[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]\nHalf-Life: Opposing Force (also known as Government Cover-up Simulator 1999 or Call of Half-Life: Black Mesa Warfare) is a first-person action shooter game that serves as the first expansion to the critically acclaimed and award-winning Half-Life by Valve. Unlike Half-Life however, this title was made by Valve alongside Gearbox Software. Interestingly, unlike Half-Life, the player will see the Black Mesa incident through the eyes of a U.S. Marine(the Military enemies in the first game).\n\n[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers)[/h1]\nThe player takes the role of Commander…(I mean)…Corporal Shephard, a U.S. Marine with the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit who were sent to the Black Mesa Complex for an unknown operation. While en route inside an Osprey to the Complex, Shephard and his team are attacked by Xen air-borne units forcing the Osprey to crash knocking him out. Follow Shephard in his trek across the massive Black Mesa Complex in an attempt to escape while uncovering a government cover-up that would pitch Shephard against U.S. Black Operations Units, Xen forces, and a new alien threat called Race X.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n+ New enemy types with unique abilities and weapons (instead of just rehashing the materials of the main game)\n+ Fun and interesting new weapons such as the Displacer Cannon and Shock Roach\n+ Well made action-packed story which shows players a different side of the Black Mesa Incident\n+ Introduction of new game mechanics such as Rope Climbing, Secondary heavy melee attacks, Grappling hooks (Barnacle hook?), Night vision and Portal guns that send you (or your target) to another dimension (See Displacer Cannon above)\n+ Possibly the first FPS game to implement a Military Squad game mechanic\n+ Entertaining Tutorial with cultural references\n+ Story intersects with some important Half-Life 1 events\n+ Good voice acting for its time\n+ Andrian Shephard is possibly a descendant of Jack (protagonist of Bioshock) due to his uncanny ability to wield a Wrench in battle against Black Ops Soldiers and Aliens.\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- Relatively short game with me clocking around 5 hours of game time on hard mode.\n- New squad mechanics is clunky (I can actually forgive this since it’s possibly the first squad mechanic on an FPS game)\n- Puzzles are not that satisfying to solve\n- Final chapter leading to the final boss feels rushed and underdeveloped\n- Unsatisfying and easy final boss\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\nGREAT EXPANSION that I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED specially for those who played the first Half-Life game and I say this because it is littered with several subtle nods from the main game.  \n\n[h1]WORTH IT?[/h1]\nMUST BUY AND MUST HAVE.  I, however, do recommend you purchase the Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 but if you do not have it, get Half-Life Complete.\n\n[h1]FINAL NOTES:[/h1]\nOpposing Force is a good example on how to make an expansion; it introduces new game mechanics, new enemies, new weapons and all the while delivering a new story that still being closely related to the main Half-Life plot.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n[h1]Like my Reviews?

For a splinter game, it can hold it's own pretty well that I feel that I could safely recommend this game. The weapon choice alone pertain to a variation with half of the same weapons from the origin Half-life an other half existing only within this game. \n\nThe title \"Opposing Force\" is a bit misleading in that corporal Shepard may work for the military, but his mission objective never quite reached him. The story development does a good job at providing Shepard with a reasonable excuse to not confront Freeman or have to kill any of the scientist. Similar to Blue shift there was a larger focus on the tactical part of the gameplay, yet intriguing puzzle still pop up at regular intervals.  Thankfully there are not too many cases of if-you-mess-this-up-there-is-no-going-back scenerios, but I've bumped into several mess-ups where loading to my last save was in my best interest. I recommend as you play through that you pay some attention to details around you such as a security guard going for a specail discount with a vending machine, and a scientist discovering the wonders of electricity in a way Benjamin Franklin would highly discourage. \n\nOn another note, I appreciate the detail in adding night vision goggle instead of using a flashlight, but I still prefer the flashlight on the basis that it's easier on my eyes.  Too, you'll soon notice a mysterious set of aliens that never appeared in Half-life before. In fact, I don't think that these alien ever reappear within the Half-life series again. I could be wrong, but for now there's no that I could think of. \n\nImportantly, the game provided a satisfying ending. Don't believe me? Then you're welcome to see for yourself.

Cependant, j’ai beaucoup de remarques.\n\nLe jeu en lui-même est plutôt amusant à jouer. Il est plus orienté action que Half-Life et les puzzles sont beaucoup moins ennuyeux à faire. La plupart du temps on n’a pas à chercher plus de cinq minutes pour comprendre ce qu’il faut faire (c’est une qualité pour moi).\n\nConcernant l’histoire, on incarne un des « spécialistes militaires chargés d’éliminer Gordon Freeman ». Personnellement je n’ai presque rien pigé à l’histoire, pourtant je ne suis pas difficile. De ce que j’ai compris on se retrouve bloqué à Black Mesa après que tous les militaires soient partis. Sur ce débarquent des Black Ops (facilement reconnaissables à leur combinaison latex) qui veulent tout péter et une mystérieuse race d’aliens, la race X qui enlève les humains pour les étudier ou bien veut terraformer la terre (c’est selon).\n\nAu cours du jeu on est baladé un peu à droite à gauche dans Black Mesa sans trop savoir pourquoi. On sent que les gens de Gearbox sont de très gros fans de HL1 étant donné que leur jeu est presque un copié-coller des niveaux de HL1, dans l’ordre. On a même le droit à un passage sur Xen, juste pour la forme. Cependant les environnements sont soignés, plutôt variés, on s’amuse bien, que demande le peuple ?\n\nLes concepteurs ont aussi fait un effort pour introduire de nouveaux éléments de jeu. Par exemple, il est possible de se suspendre à des cordes, mais c’est un élément très rarement utilisé. Il y a de nouvelles armes mais ce sont des espèces de gimmicks — en vrai on ne s’en sert que plutôt rarement, par manque de munitions. Par exemple on a un fusil de sniper avec une poignée de munitions dans tout le jeu et on ne s’en sert qu’une dizaine de fois en tout. C’est vraiment dommage ! Pareil pour le desert eagle. Quelle est l’utilité d’avoir un bon flingue si c’est pour passer son temps à se rationner parce que les munitions sont fournies au compte-goutte ? (environ 1 pack par niveau, j’ai compté)\n\nIl y a aussi une petite partie du jeu qu’on peut faire avec des NPC militaires. C’est une très bonne idée qui change du mode « grunt solitaire qui pète les ennemis avec son pied de biche » d’HL. Le seul problème est que les NPC sont de vraies bidasses : sévèrement stupides et paresseux. On passe plus de temps à les chaperonner pour les faire aller quelque part qu’à se battre à leurs côtés.\n\nLa difficulté est plutôt relevée, ce qui est plutôt cool, hormis le boss final qui est une vaste blague. C’est encore une fois un copié coller de HL1, en beaucoup plus facile.\n\nPour conclure, Opposing Force est recommandé aux grands fans d’Half-Life.

Zcela úmyslně jsem šel s obtížností na easy, aby hra pěkně odsýpala a musím říct, že sem tam je i tato obtížnost docela náročná.

But this isn't this Steam version's fault, these are typical glitches of the original expansion (and original Half Life game too).  You can mostly get out of them by shooting and changing weapons, otherwise you'll have to reload the last savepoint.\n\nThe expansion itself is brilliant!  I played Half Life for the first time only a few weeks ago (a whopping 16 years after it came out) and now count it among my favourite games of all time (along with Amnesia, Portal, FFVII, KOTOR).  It did the remarkable thing of making me enjoy a shooter, whereas normally I get bored of incessant enemy goon encounters: Bioshock, Uncharted & Last Of Us are just a few examples of highly-rated games that dulled me because of the frequent & repetitive enemy encounters.  \n\nMost importantly I really enjoyed the actual shooting gameplay.  It's hugely moreish and perfectly balanced.  Opposing Force is arguably even better as it offers beguiling new weapons and dangerous new aliens, tho' the level design isn't as inspired as the original (and neither is the final boss).  \n\nAs for the story, it isn't essential to the main Half Life plot, but if you're interested in what happened to Black Mesa after Gordon Freeman teleported to Xen then Opposing Force is fully recommended!  The Briefcase Man is very present too, his role recalls that of the Cigarette Smoking Man from X-Files.\n\nThe length of OF is probably less than half the original game, but this is still a nice long experience, with some really tough sections.  \n\n9/10\n\n\nI've heard Blue Shift is the weak link in the Half Life chain but now I'm invested so that will be next :)","timestamp_created":1418340078,"timestamp_updated":1418340599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13309681","author":{"steamid":"76561198094671212","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":51,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1417892742},"language":"russian","review":"ПРОСТО...

This game is armed with better weapons and enemies, and even puzzles. Though it may not compare with the legend Half life 2, it does take its place above Half life 1 with Gordon.
