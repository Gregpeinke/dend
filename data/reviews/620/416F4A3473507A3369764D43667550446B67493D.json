So you may not even notice it. On the other hand, the game's artistic graphics have been improved a lot by the creators. The APRETURE building environment is much more realistic than ever. It has been a long time since the events of Portal 1, which led to the imminent destruction of Glados, and during this time, the appearance of the APRETURE building has many changes. Many parts of it have been destroyed and the vegetation has penetrated into it, making the APRETURE building a tomb.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe main axis and core of the portal are based on its gameplay. Various puzzles with different features and conditions are included in the game. Some of them are simple and after a few minutes, you will find out how to solve them. Some are mediocre and you will need more time to solve them because you have to try several different methods that have come to your mind and you will probably taste the bitterness of death several times. Difficult puzzles also follow the law of intermediate puzzles. With the difference that in order to solve them, you have to carefully observe and examine all the corners and angles and blind spots of the location where you are present. This method can be very useful, especially in the deep and dilapidated areas of the APRETURE building\n\n\nIn portal 2, various items and phenomena can be seen. It is no longer a matter of energy bullets being deflected when hitting a wall and always endangering a player, and red lasers are used instead to do the same thing as energy bullets. And you have to give them a specific direction and direction, direct them to specific pages to provide the energy needed to open a door and be able to go to the next step.\n\nPhysics\n\nUndoubtedly, the creators of an intellectual game such as Portal need something more than PORTAL GUN and other items to design unique puzzles. Having a \"pure and precise physics\" can be their last essential need in this way. Of course, obedience to the laws of physics is more evident in Portal 2 than in the previous version. Because the new game, in addition to more and more varied puzzles, also uses more features. there are countless other cases in which improper and careless use can lead to your failure or even death.\n\nMusic and sound\n\nThe creators of this game have not provided much music. Of course, the fact is that this title does not require a large number of music tracks. Because VALVE's main purpose in making this game is to persuade the player to use his thinking power. The player, of course, urgently needs to be calm and focused in order to achieve such a goal.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the end, I must say that VALVE has definitely managed to correct the weaknesses of PORTAL 1 and make its strengths stronger and wider. Strong storytelling, challenging gameplay, puzzles that tell the story of their designers' ingenuity and taste, memorable characters and extremely professional voice acting with emotion and according to the role and performance of the characters, are among the factors that will bring honor and victory to PORTAL 2 and its creators.","timestamp_created":1593805012,"timestamp_updated":1593859649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":44,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.744961917400360107","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71970854","author":{"steamid":"76561198418473577","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":835,"last_played":1596674605},"language":"english","review":"get this game","timestamp_created":1593804930,"timestamp_updated":1593804930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71970616","author":{"steamid":"76561198440887691","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":243,"last_played":1647895093},"language":"english","review":"fun tbh","timestamp_created":1593804633,"timestamp_updated":1593804633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71970284","author":{"steamid":"76561198321065827","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2653,"last_played":1642252067},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good story and an amazing classic.","timestamp_created":1593804261,"timestamp_updated":1593804261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71970229","author":{"steamid":"76561199062625380","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1309,"last_played":1603479468},"language":"russian","review":"Очень классная игра,как одиночная компания,так и онлайн для игры с другом!\nВсем РЕКОМЕНДУЮ!!!","timestamp_created":1593804206,"timestamp_updated":1593804206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71969920","author":{"steamid":"76561198177938274","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":806,"last_played":1594057140},"language":"turkish","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1593803880,"timestamp_updated":1593803880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71969848","author":{"steamid":"76561198822817347","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":562,"last_played":1593782013},"language":"english","review":"epic","timestamp_created":1593803791,"timestamp_updated":1593803791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71969846","author":{"steamid":"76561199002507648","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1625684619},"language":"english","review":"it is blyatiful its great and awesome\n","timestamp_created":1593803789,"timestamp_updated":1593803789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71969825","author":{"steamid":"76561198873765351","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1443,"last_played":1656437705},"language":"russian","review":"ВСЕ","timestamp_created":1593803772,"timestamp_updated":1593803772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71969820","author":{"steamid":"76561198974553061","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":109,"last_played":1595696889},"language":"russian","review":"                                                                                  РЕКОМЕНДУЮ!!!\nОчень интересная игра!
