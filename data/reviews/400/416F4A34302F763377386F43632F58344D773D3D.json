The game version which is available in Steam was release on 10th October 2007 as a content of Orange Box. There are many other versions of this game. This game concept came from the game \"Narbacular Drop\". When valve designed the game there are many developer from Narbacular Drop developer team. The latest release of this game was an Android port for the NVidia Shield which was released on 12th May 2014. A sequel, Portal 2, was released in 2011.\n\n         This game is designed with several sets of puzzles which are distributed into 19 Test Chambers. The player character Chell have to solve the puzzles using teleporting. At the starting point of every test chamber there is a projector for briefing. Chell have to grab “the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device” also known as portal gun. By using that gun Chell can make two kinds of portals one is blue portal other is orange portal. From game play we come to know that Chell is solving these puzzles as the Aperture Science Enrichment Center promised to give her a cake at the end of all 19 tests. Throughout the game the artificial intelligence GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) will monitor Chell. At the end of last test chamber we come to know that the promise of cake is fake. The main objective of the game is to solve 19 puzzles & rescue herself form that fake promise. At the end of the game if you can destroy GLaDOS you can get that promised cake. Though from the game play we came to know \"The cake is lie\". But as per my point of view it's not a lie. \n         This science fiction game is not as long as valve’s other games, it takes hardly 2-3 hours to complete the 19 puzzles, though till date over four million copies of the game have been sold. The player character Chell is portrayed by Alésia Glidewell & voiced by Mary Kae Lrvin. GLaDOS is voiced by Ellen McLain in English-language version and finally the end credits song “Still Alive” written by Jonathan Coulton also sang by Ellen McLain.\n        Though it’s a short game but still I’ll recommend to purchase & play. I’m sure after playing you will realize why this game is so popular till date. Now I'm waiting for Portal 2","timestamp_created":1419853447,"timestamp_updated":1419853447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13685607","author":{"steamid":"76561198050748117","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":504,"last_played":1395531147},"language":"english","review":"As expected of such a classic.\n\nVery good gameplay, interesting story (but short) and fun puzzles.","timestamp_created":1419852026,"timestamp_updated":1419852026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13683941","author":{"steamid":"76561198140759607","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1529332074},"language":"russian","review":"Portal - игра к которой стоит присмотреться по внимательнее,хотя бы потому,то её сделали Valve, а игры от Valve всегда хорошие.А что же сама Portal?

My first foray into Portal was when I picked up Portal 2 on PS3. I had never even heard of it before, but it looked intruiging. Oh boy, how I was right. I loved Portal 2, and was disappointed to find out I couldn't play Portal 1 on PS3 unless I bought the Orange Box, which I could not do because I was not 17 at the time. Fast forward to Christmas 2014 and I recieved a laptop that I could do some gaming on, which is when I got Steam. Portal was immediately one of the first games I bought for it. Let me tell you, I absolutely loved it. While it's not nearly as meaty/large as it's sequel, Portal is still a tight and enjoyable experience. While my first playthrough (I intend on replaying sometime soon with developer commentary!) was only 2.5 hours, it was a fun and actually unique experience in comparison with Portal 2. The puzzles were different and I still felt like I had to rack my brain a bit to solve them.

Man versucht durch immer komplexer werdende Level durchzukommen. Dabei muss man verschiedene Hindernisse überwinden und mit verschiedenen Objekten aus der Umgebung interagieren. Dabei bietet das Spiel auch eine Story, die einen meiner Meinung nach ganz besonderen Charme hat. Seien es Sprüche von GLaDos oder besondere Objekte. \nEine weitere Besonderheit, die den Wiederspielwert steigert: Die Entwickler haben eine Version mit Entwicklerkommentaren erstellt. Dabei findet man an verschiedenen, sichtbaren Stellen Sprechblasen, mit denen man interagieren kann. Die Entwickler erzählen in englisch, was sie sich bei der Raumkonstellation gedacht haben. Das ist schön zu hören, zumal man mitbekommt, dass sich manche Räume doch ein wenig verändert haben in der Testphase. Auch die Synchronsprecherin für GLaDos berichtet über ihre Eindrücke und Erlebnisse während der Spieleentwicklung. Die Kombination \"Spiele das Spiel und höre, was die Entwickler sich in diesem und diesem Raum gedacht haben\" gibt dem ganzen einen besonderen Flair. \n\nFazit: Jeder, der mal ein neues, innovatives Spiel spielen möchte, sollte sich diesen Titel holen. Meiner Meinung nach haben die Entwickler alles richtig gemacht. Die technische Umsetzung ist meines Erachtens ebenfalls gut gelungen und die Grafik sehr ansehnlich und passend zum Spiel, schlicht gehalten.","timestamp_created":1419697379,"timestamp_updated":1419697379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13639812","author":{"steamid":"76561198126420572","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103,"last_played":1419695947},"language":"german","review":"Ja sehr!
