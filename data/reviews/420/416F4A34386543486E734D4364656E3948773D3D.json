Вторая часть в трилогии эпизодов, продолжающих сюжет компьютерной игры Half-Life 2 в жанре шутера от первого лица.\n\nСледуя идее Valve, что каждый эпизод должен основываться на определённой тематике, Episode Two фокусируется на открытых пространствах, дальних путешествиях и менее линейном геймплее, чем в прошлых играх серии Half-Life. Второй эпизод вышел несколько длиннее первого: в нём 7 глав (уровней), рассчитанных приблизительно на 8 часов игры. Действие игры развивается сразу после Episode One, в лесной местности близ уничтоженного Сити 17. По сюжету Гордон Фримен и Аликс Вэнс должны добраться до Белой Рощи — базы Сопротивления и передать повстанцам захваченные в первом эпизоде секретные данные Альянса.\n Перед выходом Episode Two стал доступен для предварительной загрузки через Steam шестью днями раньше, 4 октября.\n\nНа 7 декабря 2008 года игра имела рейтинг в 91 % на Game Rankings, основанный на 21 обзоре. Дэн Адамс из IGN поставил игре 9,4 и отметил отличную проработку обстановки и визуальных эффектов, но критиковал малую продолжительность (шесть часов).\n\nГлавная особенность второго эпизода — большие открытые пространства; лесная местность даёт игроку свободно путешествовать на новом автомобиле, а геймплей становится менее линейным: согласно задумке, с разнообразной тактикой ведения боя каждая битва будет непохожа на предыдущую. Кроме лесных территорий, игрок пройдёт заброшенные шахты, гнездо муравьиных львов и ракетную базу — все эти локации так же будут отличаться своей масштабностью.\n\nВо втором эпизоде нет такого сосредоточения на кооперативной игре, как в первом: хотя сюжетно игрок проходит всю игру вместе со своей напарницей Аликс Вэнс, во многих игровых событиях она по тем или иным причинам не принимает участия. Кроме Аликс, игроку предстоит сражаться бок о бок с дружественными вортигонтами.\n\nВ Episode Two был немного изменён инвентарь игрока: фонарик теперь работает на независимой от HEV-костюма Фримена батарее. Разработчики расширили круг использования гравипушки: помимо применения её вместе с бомбами для страйдеров, было добавлено множество новых объектов, которые можно запускать во врага.\n\nСюжет эпизода начинается там, где заканчивается Episode One. После взрыва Цитадели поезд, на котором уезжали Гордон Фримен и Аликс Вэнс, попадает под взрывную волну и терпит крушение. Им приходится добираться до главной базы Сопротивления — комплекса «Белая Роща» — своими силами. Главная цель — доставить в Белую Рощу данные, добытые в Цитадели, где содержатся секретные планы руководства Альянса, а также код частоты сверхпортала, образовавшегося над разрушенным Сити 17. Этот портал должен вновь прочно связать Землю и вселенную Альянса, что грозит человечеству приходом подкрепления инопланетных захватчиков и повторением Семичасовой войны («Если он наберёт полную силу то повторится Семичасовая война. Только на этот раз нам не продержаться и семи минут…» — Илай Вэнс). Однако, используя код частоты волны портала, у повстанцев есть возможность закрыть его при помощи ракеты со спутником, на котором установлен «зен-резонатор», запустив его из Белой Рощи. Но все усугубляется тем, что разведка Альянса обнаружила базу и туда уже направляется ударная армия. Фримен и Аликс вынуждены поторопиться, чтобы успеть доставить данные и предупредить повстанцев о надвигающейся угрозе.","timestamp_created":1390392576,"timestamp_updated":1390392576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532012879848480225","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8806435","author":{"steamid":"76561198031467170","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1099,"last_played":1381840558},"language":"swedish","review":"Now garden freezeman has to find the big rocket to shoot at alien portal and also find boat","timestamp_created":1390390495,"timestamp_updated":1390390495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8792569","author":{"steamid":"76561198072806865","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1471809991},"language":"english","review":"Cool expansion to HL2.
