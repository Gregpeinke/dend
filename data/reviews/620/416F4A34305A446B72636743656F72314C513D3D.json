Ces éléments en font probablement l'un des jeux les plus populaires de l'histoire de l'Europe, l'un des jeux de puzzle les plus intéressants et les plus mémorables jamais créés, et l'un des jeux qui à marqué chez beaucoup le jeux vidéo PC.\n\nMais pourquoi Portal nous a-t-il marqué autant ? \nC'est simple, Portal à été fait avec Passion.\nJe vous recommanderais bien de lire \"Portal 2: The Final Hours\" qui résume assez bien qui a le contrôle sur le développement d'un jeu comme celui-ci. Ce n'est pas l'argent, ce n'est pas la popularité ou l'idée de plaire au plus grand nombre... non !\nl'idée générale autour de Portal 2, c'est;\n\"Tenez, on a fait ce jeu, on s'est bien marré à le faire, on a fait des trucs vraiment cool ! on à eu l'idée et on l'a développée, on espère que cela vous plaira !

Nous connaissons les moindres recoins, les mêmes répliques du Jeu, les mêmes musiques. Tout est bien écrit !\nEt qu'est ce qui prouverait que j'ai raison ?\nEt bien, c'est vous.\n\nIl m'a fallu presque 2 ans pour écrire et réécrire cette évaluation tant Portal 2 était important pour moi.

The gameplay has added the new gels in the sequel that canmake for some very fun, challenging puzzles. The original was a puzzle game with a good story, this one feels more like a Narrative game with puzzles in between.Onw thing I didn't like was Cave Johnson, his humor did not fit into the Portal series. His was a slapstick kind of comedy while GLaDoS's was a more dark, teasing you kind of humor. The story is pretty good up until the ending, [SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT] I didn't like that GLaDoS just let us go.Me, personally I felt like GLaDoSwould still want to keep Chell maybe as a backup or something.\n\nTL;DR - Not as good as the original, NEW, Fun gameplay, above average story.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1410307029,"timestamp_updated":1410307029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513423502445220947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12038465","author":{"steamid":"76561198073228379","num_games_owned":271,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1399642545},"language":"russian","review":"Что уж говорить о всеми известной игре?? \nЕсли вы хотите не только поиграть, но и повеселиться с другом - это какраз то, что нужно!
