Fanboys gonna down vote. Look at all the legit negative reviews in English and none of them have a thumbs up. Trust the negative reviews, this game doesn't hold up to the test of time. Anyways\n\n      Half-Life was included in the valve bundle when I got it. The game can be considered a piece of history. However, it doesn't hold up the test of time. When I played this as a child I could barely follow the story, and as an adult I still don't have a grasp of where all the forums gets their info from. The gameplay movement isn't too bad, but, there were times when a section loaded it would get me stuck in the world. Another issue that annoyed me was how long it takes to kill soldiers in the early game. \n\n       As a kid I was probably playing Half-Life on easy difficulty but as an adult playing on hard the soldiers are just sponges until you get good explosives. This leads to gun battles that are just spraying half a magazine, or hiding just out of sight to take them out. The soldiers voices sound like crap! It's like listening to that voice add on to an Atari for those old enough to know what that is. Limited capabilities of the time this game was created are not up to par with today's gamers standards. Friendlies just casually hang around a corner at times after you engage a gun battle to open that door, and that slope headed Neanderthal scientist model is funny to see.\n\n      In conclusion this game is a piece of gaming history and if you're young and interested in gaming history it's worth a play in that sense to see how good the games are today compared to early 2000's. Other then that, this game just doesn't hold up to today's standards. I hear Half-Life Source was pretty badly designed, but I haven't gotten up to that version yet. Personally, I think if Half-Life 3 ever gets announced Valve should take the time to remake/remaster the series to appease today's gamers such as: AI improvements, remove enemy sponges, fix soldier voices, and graphic updates. Until then just read the wiki pages if you want to know the story.","timestamp_created":1488670720,"timestamp_updated":1489701286,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.26953965425491333","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30324521","author":{"steamid":"76561198073612037","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6277,"last_played":1523376184},"language":"spanish","review":"No esta mal, pero era mejor antes, la jugabilidad era impecable en cuanto al movimiento que podias realizar.\nMe pasaba anteriormente muchas horas debido a la adiccion que causaba y risas brutales cuando lo jugaba con colegas.\n\nEn conclusion, ahora con el cambio que mencione, no se me hace muy impresionante.
