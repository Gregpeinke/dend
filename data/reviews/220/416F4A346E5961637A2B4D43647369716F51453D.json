I reccommend getting episodes 1 and 2 as well. The only bad thing about this game is the cliffhanger at the end of episode 2.

То, что я указал как недостатки, кто-то посчитает её достоинствами.\nЯ люблю первую \"халфу\". Её движок очень простенький, можно даже сказать, архаичный по современным меркам, но игра цепляет другим. Есть в ней некий шарм. Всё, что есть в игре, работает на атмосферу происходящего вокруг ГГ маленького апокалипсиса: тишина вокруг и почти полное отсутствие фоновой музыки, пустые - кажется, тоже враждебные - замкнутые пространства, в которых глухо раздаются шаги нашего протеже, а за углом (часто - за спиной, после неожиданного открытия портала из другого измерения) его поджидают недружественные военные или инопланетные чудища. И те, и другие бьют больно. За счёт всего этого игра держит в напряжении и неплохо играет на нервах, особенно при первом прохождении. А ещё - \"умный\" коридорный левел-дизайн, где, с одной стороны, пространство - \"кишка\", т.е. никакого тебе открытого мира, а с другой - коридоры много где ветвятся и пересекают пройденные тобой раньше места, но с другой стороны и с другого ракурса, за счёт чего мир игры воспринимается как открытый и бесшовный. Такую удачную помесь \"кишкового\" и \"песочечного\" дизайна уровней я мало где видел в играх. В Half-Life 2 я ожидал увидеть то, что мне понравилось в Half-Life, но в новом сеттинге и с новыми наворотами нового движка, но, к сожалению, настроение игры отличается от настроения предшественницы. Игра стала более \"доброй\" по отношению к игроку - даже, как говорил актёр Виктор Сухоруков во втором \"Брате\": \"какой-то слащавой, подкрашенной\". Это выражается как в сниженной сложности, - аптечек на уровнях разбросано больше, а оружие сносит суппостатам больше здоровья, - так и в отсутствии крови и расчленёнки. Из-за второго враги-люди стали похожи на резиновых кукол, тем более что теперь они упакованы в скрывающие лица и всё тело защитные костюмы. Врагов-алиенов стало меньше - как по количеству, так и по количеству видов, и представляют они меньшую, чем раньше, опасность - вортигонты больше не бьются током на расстоянии, ползучие фиговины не плюются кислотой, а здоровый инопланетный солдат в броне не досаждает мухами с автонаведением по твоей физиономии. На уровнях нет прикольных \"перекрёстков\", когда ты проходишь по знакомым местам, как в первой части, а холодные хайтековские внутренности исследовательского комплекса и окружающую его пустынную местность заменили на канализации, водные каналы, улицы заброшенного города, пустынные побережья, развалины жилых домов на улицах заброшенного города, ещё какие-то \"заброшки\"... Короче - пост-апокалипсис и опустение. Опять же, дело вкуса, но такие пейзажи мне не по душе, тем более что и за окном на улице их более чем достаточно.\nНо, несмотря на то, что я написал до этого, игру я советую, потому что она отлично оптимизирована и выдаёт приятную картинку даже на не самом игровом железе и не все современные шутеры могут похвастаться таким продвинутым физическим движком и количеством интерактивных предметов на уровнях. В техническом плане вторая \"полужизнь\" сделана действиельно отлично. А ещё - более чем доступная цена по скидке, особенно - в составе Orange Box'а; я купил именно так - по скидке в составе Orange Box'а - и даже стало обидно, что она не стоит дороже, чесслово ;) А ещё - много, очень много кто действительно любит HL 2 именно в таком виде, так что если ты до сих пор не прошёл эту игрушку, то, очень возможно, она понравится и тебе. В любом случае - недовольным после про хождения ты, как и я, не останешься.","timestamp_created":1527711433,"timestamp_updated":1527711519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42390466","author":{"steamid":"76561198186870907","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":2028,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1330,"last_played":1610895400},"language":"polish","review":"prośba do każdego\nKUPCIE TĄ GRE ALBO ODINATALUJCIE STEAMA BO BEZ NIEJ NIE MA STEAMA!!","timestamp_created":1527709257,"timestamp_updated":1527709257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42389935","author":{"steamid":"76561198009100394","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":699,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22,"last_played":1532295671},"language":"russian","review":"[h1]Хит своего времени[/h1]\n\nИгра о которой знают все и играли многие.\nПроект, в котором каждый элемент геймплея работает как часы.\nИстория, которую не забыть и персонажи, которым сложно не сопереживать.\nИ каждый раз начиная заново, чтобы освежить память, кажется, будто играешь впервые.","timestamp_created":1527707376,"timestamp_updated":1527707376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.736811816692352295","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42388659","author":{"steamid":"76561198338299568","num_games_owned":344,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":953,"last_played":1521824935},"language":"russian","review":"«Легенды не умирают!

Let me take you on the wonderful journey that is the Half Life series. Half life started out life as a blatant rip-off of Quake, and later evolved into a blatant rip-off of Quake, but with a story! Released in 1998, head CEO \"Grape\" newell shook the gaming industry forever. Innovative, Fast-paced action, Realistic shooting physics, and even the General man(Formally known as the G-man)! Half life was truly unique and amassed a extremely large fan base. Wanting to innovate and shake up the gaming world once more, Mr.newman summoned his team of experts to make a sequel, Half life 2! Half life 2 (also known as \"Half life 2nd) was a cult classic amongst gamers world wide! Innovating and remastering the previous title by a landslide. In the rough and tumble world of Half life, You (Chell fryman) and your oriental girlfriend Alyx jones, travel the world playing Dayz and fighting characters from metro2033. The story starts off where the previous game left off, You must work your way through apocalyptic russia, all the way to the united states to kill president George bush. Who is plotting to send Americans to a second iraq war and nuke everyone with a big crystal. As you work your way to the big metal spike in the ground with the help of The General(man), you reach the final level, a 1v30 death-match against George bush, his nudist henchmen, and the Neapolitan police force. miraculously coming out unscathed you finally reach George soros, promptly throwing a grenade at him, blowing him to smithereens. Right as this happens, The General cuts to commercial break to sell you car insurance before leaving the stage, and ending the game. Half life 2 was well received among many, so well received that Grape Newell, eager to please his fans, promised 3 (later only able to deliver on 1 of these promises) dlc maps for Half life 2 for the Gameboy Advanced. The first dlc to come was kinda poop lol, but the second dlc lived up to the franchises name. All of this wore down Mr.newell, he became a very tired man. Mr.newell has since won a guiness book of world record title for \"Longest time asleep on a couch\"(7 years). He (Grape newman) now spends his time lounging around in his office watching people spend $400 on skins while jacking off. Half life 2 is still the worlds best videogame forever and ever, easily surpassing methestas \"skyrime\". Half life 3 wont happen, but at least we have hentai vr games.

There's just so much to say. Half-Life 2 is, simply put, the best single-player shooter ever released for the PC. It does so many things right in so many ways that it might be possible to write a thesis on the topic of Half-Life 2 compared to other single player shooters. What Valve has created is simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. And once the initial shock of it all wears off and it becomes possible to peel back the polished layers of sight and sound, there is an excellent shooter here. Half-Life 2 doesn't do anything particularly new; it doesn't really innovate in many ways. But what it does is set a new height for all other designers of first-person shooters to reach. It still isn't exactly perfect, but it's about as close as I've seen in my tenure here.\n\nBefore I really get into the review, you should know the background of how this game was reviewed. Valve did not want to send out copies of their game (for fairly obvious reasons) before it was released to the public. In order to play the game, I, and several of my colleagues throughout the industry, took a trip up to Seattle to visit Valve in order to have some private time with the title. I was given a little room to myself where I could close the door, turn off the lights, click my little red slippers, and pretend that I was sitting at home. It worked for the most part, largely because I was so engrossed with the game that when I came out of my trance I often had to take a moment to get my bearings. Obviously, Valve was happy to bring me into a controlled environment for ideal playing conditions.","timestamp_created":1527614038,"timestamp_updated":1527614038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42364196","author":{"steamid":"76561198258445335","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":1429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":789,"last_played":1634472104},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite FPSes surely, and I actually prefer this over HL1, though if asked Black Mesa vs HL2, I might have trouble deciding which I like better. But HL1 vs 2? I like 2 better.\n\nThe good:\n\nAtmosphere. Premise is a post-apocalyptic dystopian oppressive regime, run by an alien Cyborg race that loots planets for resources. Fantastic mood this game got. Police brutality, a small bastion of mankind alive fighting desperately against the Combine, decayed scenery, etc.\n\nGunplay. I've heard people bash HL2 gunplay for not being enough over-the-top beefy or whatever. But I can't say it's weak nor unsatisfying? Weapons shake your view in a smooth, non-robotic and sharp manner. Sounds are nice, I love rampaging with the MP7 for example, lovely shot sound. Crossbow makes a nice low-pitch twang. Combines' Pulse Rifle has a nice bass-heavy sound. And this time around, the shotgun all in all truly feels proper.\n\nVehicle manned sequences. You get to drive an airboat and a dune buggy, both which are armed, and you'll get to war in vehicular combat against the Combine.\n\nThe new weapons. Play the game to find out..!\n\nYou get to command squads of human soldiers.\n\nNew enemies.\n\nThe Gravity Gun. Just dammit, what an awesome weapon, not only is it's one purpose to return a tipped-over Buggy back to it's wheels, it can also be used to grab and launch any light-enough object as a projectile, to either save ammo or just have sadistic fun.\n\nThe bad:\n\nCombines' AI kind of feels to be a bit lacking.\n\n","timestamp_created":1527610958,"timestamp_updated":1527610958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514610588550567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42363384","author":{"steamid":"76561198173194733","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":1716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1716,"last_played":1527612529},"language":"turkish","review":" Güzel grafik,oynanış,hikaye kısaca efsane oyun.","timestamp_created":1527607989,"timestamp_updated":1527607989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42362998","author":{"steamid":"76561198386924794","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":884,"last_played":1645656303},"language":"english","review":"6/5","timestamp_created":1527606662,"timestamp_updated":1599490455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42357126","author":{"steamid":"76561198826876052","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1656432809},"language":"russian","review":"прошёл 8 раз","timestamp_created":1527585390,"timestamp_updated":1648467770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42352084","author":{"steamid":"76561198121860367","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":836,"last_played":1527705838},"language":"russian","review":"Игра пушка \nКупил сборку по скидки и оно того стоит","timestamp_created":1527559726,"timestamp_updated":1527559726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42349615","author":{"steamid":"76561198204165792","num_games_owned":322,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1124,"last_played":1575022827},"language":"russian","review":"Возраст: 23\nОсобые приметы: до сих пор считает HL2 современной игрой с хорошей графикой.","timestamp_created":1527547386,"timestamp_updated":1527547386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":62,"votes_funny":31,"weighted_vote_score":"0.807411313056945801","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42348768","author":{"steamid":"76561198179772653","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2169,"last_played":1524791273},"language":"english","review":"The beat sequel to half life I could ever ask for.","timestamp_created":1527544059,"timestamp_updated":1527544059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42345500","author":{"steamid":"76561198136437293","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":422,"last_played":1520109672},"language":"german","review":"Da ich mit Half-Life 1 so viel Spaß hatte habe ich mir endlich den 2ten Teil gekauft.

Weapons are nice, although I found that the revolver wasn't really as good as I thought it was previously. It has a low ammo count with ammo for it being generally uncommon and the crossbow just replaces it as the token long range power weapon. Or short range power weapon. The crossbow's pretty strong.\n\nAnyway, yeah. Really nice game. If you haven't played it before, I'd say check it out.

Also a quick tip, Dog's ball can be used as an easier way to get the Ravenholm gravity gun only achievement (It can crush headcrabs, distract enemies, and can be shot at enemies for a kill).","timestamp_created":1527513751,"timestamp_updated":1587791841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42335406","author":{"steamid":"76561198100016001","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1535771597},"language":"schinese","review":"经典","timestamp_created":1527507278,"timestamp_updated":1527507278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42332530","author":{"steamid":"76561198257188266","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":484,"last_played":1588603773},"language":"russian","review":"найс игра всем советую!","timestamp_created":1527496754,"timestamp_updated":1527496754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529591619968414307","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42331960","author":{"steamid":"76561198820312950","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":145,"last_played":1552068766},"language":"english","review":"Игра века.","timestamp_created":1527494334,"timestamp_updated":1527494334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42331174","author":{"steamid":"76561198799912988","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":97,"last_played":1607011662},"language":"russian","review":"Игра прикольная,советую всем хоть она и давно давно вышла но для токой старой игры графика норм,но если качать еше garrys mod и half life 2 и half life 2 episode 2 то будет класс\n","timestamp_created":1527490766,"timestamp_updated":1527490766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42331042","author":{"steamid":"76561198272090599","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1055,"last_played":1575780797},"language":"english","review":"One of my favourites for sure.
