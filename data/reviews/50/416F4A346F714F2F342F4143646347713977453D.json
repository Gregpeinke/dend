Второе для меня по счету дополнение к оригинальной Half-Life. По итогу, оно зашло мне чуть-чуть меньше, чем Blue Shift - возможно, за счет милитаристской атмосферы, которая, несмотря на всю свою придурковатую очаровательность, явно нравится мне меньше, чем та же очаровательная придурковатость научного персонала «Черной Мезы».\n\nВ целом, сама история несется куда-то непонятно куда и везде творится постоянный пиздец (особенно на тяжелом уровне сложности) — Шепард несется от одной горячей точки к другой, в попытке то ли выбраться, то ли забраться куда поглубже. Стараясь в иммерсивное прохождение, я рвался между этими двумя инь и ян - должен ли я как истинный Шепард остаться и помочь собратьям по оружию (раз такая пьянка пошла и на свой спасительный вертолет я уже не попал), либо должен драпать когти со всех сил.\n\nВозможно, в подобной интерпретации — противопоставления долга и собственного благополучия, тревожащего меня, как игрока, которому нужна четкая мотивация «налево или направо», и Шепарда, который в контексте сюжета так или иначе может задаваться этой же дилеммой — и кроется специфика сторителлинга данного дополнения. И, несмотря на то, что она оставляла меня без толики явного понимания, зачем я делаю то, что делаю, в процессе игры,  по окончанию, с позиции полного прохождения DLC, я готов оценить ее скорее как плюс. Может, это и излишний СПГС и попытка углядеть контексты там, где их нет, но экспириенс есть экспириенс и я не прочь против подобного интегрированного в гейм- и левел-дизайн повествования.\n\nЧто до геймплея, то тут все практически так же, как и в оригинальной Half-Life. Может, даже еще сложнее, с учетом добавления новых противников — вортигонтов-мутантов (не знаток лора, не ругайте) с синими жуками, блюющими плазмой (которые, кстати, по совместительству являются и новым ксено-оружием), больших жирных личинок, кастующих шаровую молнию и две злобных страшных ебаки в качестве мини-босса и финального босса. С другой стороны, в помощь вам поднакинут и новых пушек, вроде BFG из DOOM (своего рода, портальная/дезинтегрирующая пушка), знаменитый Desert Eagle (или что-то сопоставимое по мощности), инопланетную рыбину, блюющую ядерными горошинами (своего рода ракетница) и персональная ебака-присосака (та самая, которая обычно имеет тенденцию свисать с потолка). \n\nЧто по поводу загадок и левел-дизайна, то, лично для меня, все то же самое, что и в Blue Shift, что и в оригинальной Half Life — порой легко и элементарно, а порой сложно и «твою-мать-как-я-на-этом-полчаса-потерял-какой-убогий-дизайн». Тем не менее, тупил я явно меньше, чем в Blue Shift, а если где и тупил, то преимущественно из-за внутренних скриптов игры. Для меня показателен момент с взрывом забора из миномета, который нельзя подорвать, если пустить снаряд прямо в него. Необходимо целиться в область за забором, и только тогда игра расценит это как точечное попадание. Почему?..\n\nПо итогу, четыре часа мучительного прохождения (а на тяжелом уровне сложности игра чуть ли не превращается в Survival Horror, впрочем, как и вся первая Half-Life) я остался доволен. Ебаки побеждены, история Шепарда пройдена, долг в виде так и непройденной Half-Life, висевший на мне мертвым грузом, наконец-то исчез. Тем не менее, атмосферы Half-Life в этом DLC для меня было мало, и по большому счету, Opposing Force больше воспринимается мной как один из достаточно проходных шутеров конца 90-х, нежели как часть именитой серии.","timestamp_created":1584978318,"timestamp_updated":1585471952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65634447","author":{"steamid":"76561198325828061","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1636825802},"language":"english","review":"Probably the best expansion pack ever released.","timestamp_created":1584976200,"timestamp_updated":1584976200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65581974","author":{"steamid":"76561198119565811","num_games_owned":371,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":247,"last_played":1584911340},"language":"english","review":"Paced even better than the base game, even if the narrative isn't as engaging.\nMore weapons, more creatures and, most importantly, MORE HALF-LIFE.\n\nPlay it.","timestamp_created":1584912173,"timestamp_updated":1584912173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65579413","author":{"steamid":"76561198015142701","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":384,"last_played":1584909234},"language":"english","review":"If you're nostalgic for HL content then this is great, but there are better FPS games out there.","timestamp_created":1584909341,"timestamp_updated":1584909341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65572156","author":{"steamid":"76561198993492936","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":986,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":857,"last_played":1622099559},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая Half-Life на движке голдсурс\nПлюсы:\nКуча оружия (очень много, прям океан пушек)\nНовые враги\nНовые союзники (вместо охранников с пистолетиками теперь бравые вояки)\nНовые механики (например веревки на которых можно лазить)\nМинусы:\nИх нет","timestamp_created":1584902120,"timestamp_updated":1584902120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65538948","author":{"steamid":"76561198066473243","num_games_owned":702,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":447,"last_played":1618748877},"language":"schinese","review":"经常会在电梯和升降梯被卡在地上，得经常存档……从通风管道进入 PIT WORM'S NEST 时，切换地图后还被卡在通道里两次，后来第三次才正常滑了出去……\n\n存读档的时候很容易闪退，就算是英文输入法。有个存档居然一读取就闪退了，死档了……幸好我不久前独立存了一个档，不然就炸了。OF的BUG好多啊……","timestamp_created":1584870544,"timestamp_updated":1618735708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527186751365661621","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65487272","author":{"steamid":"76561198352419585","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":436,"last_played":1625337597},"language":"turkish","review":"Half-Life Oyunu'nun genişleme paketi olan Half-Life: Opposing Force Gordon Freeman yerine Adrian Shephard adlı bir HECU (Tehlikeli Çevre Savaş Birimi) askeri'nin hikayesini anlatmaktadır.

Definitely play it after finishing the original Half-life.\n\nI found this expansion pack greatly enjoyable. It takes the base game and adds new weapons, enemies and mechanics that I thought added a lot of fun to the game. Also, I like that the game doesn't force you to kill any scientists or guards, which is what I expected it to do(I clearly had no idea what the game is like). I should also mention that I enjoyed the final boss of Opposing Force just as much as -if not more than- Nihilanth. All in all, this is a must-play for Half-life fans, or anyone looking for a good time. It adds a lot to the base game, making it quite a unique experience. \n\nPros(In my humble opinion):\nNew mechanics, enemies and weapons that greatly add to the experience.\nBarnacle grappling-hook(It's just such a lovely idea that I have to mention it seperately).\nGameplay that, while keeping the basic Half-life formula as it is, offers a unique experience to those who have played the original.\nVery interesting final boss that isn't very hard after you understand it.\n\nCons(In my humble opinion): \nIt was a little bit glitchy for me. Mainly, when I entered a loading zone while pressing W and it bugged out, making me move forward constantly until I pressed W again.\nTrying to keep your squad-mates alive is a little inconvenient.","timestamp_created":1584641497,"timestamp_updated":1585345911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65341481","author":{"steamid":"76561198441933447","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":626,"last_played":1584717479},"language":"french","review":"Valve nous avons besoin d une suite pour Opposing Force c est dommage si ça s arrete la","timestamp_created":1584638982,"timestamp_updated":1584638982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65331425","author":{"steamid":"76561198030920671","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":212,"playtime_forever":478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":478,"last_played":1478540958},"language":"czech","review":"Perfektní volba, pokud se Vám líbil původní Half-Life a máte už dost zachraňování světa a Black Mesy.

The game has unfortunately aged abysmally. Originally, I had thought that my issues were coming from the fact that I was playing on Hard mode. Lord knows \"Hard\" meant something different in the 90s than it does now, but the further in I went, the more I realized that it wasn't me, it was the game. Weapons that I had picked up and appeared in my hotbar failed to actually register as weapons I had. This was a major problem for several portions of the game, as my rocket launcher, xen portal gun, and machine gun were all effectively missing from my inventory despite the fact that I had them and ammo for them. The second major issue I had was an unavoidable crash near the end of the game. In the parking garage, I would crash every single time I attempted to turn a corner down a ramp, effectively forcing me to use cheats just to finish the game.\nNext off, the gameplay itself, while being Half-Lifey, is honestly broken in its own right. Enemies appear to be able to damage the player more than the player can damage them with the same weapon when playing on Hard mode. I know I'm going to be told to just \"get good\" over this, but a fundamental element of singleplayer, story driven games is that the player feels like their in control. Sure, for things like giant aliens, I can see the reasoning behind why I'm not stronger than them, but Adrian Shephard isn't supposed to be a regular soldier, either, he's supposed to be a Corporal that's equipped with a new, experimental suit of armor akin to the soldier version of the HEV suit. Attacks from Shock Troopers take a minimum of 10 hp off Adrian if he doesn't have any suit power, and believe me, suit power is few and far between in this game. Things like the rope gameplay and use of a night vision instead of flashlight seem arbitrary and unnecessary to me. The rope gameplay itself seems to fail to do its job properly in every place it's in during gameplay, especially during the final boss. Night Vision, on the other hand, is weak and doesn't go out far enough for the player to see in some dark areas of the game where it's an absolute necessity.\n\n\n[h1] SPOILERS FOR THE STORY BELOW [/h1] \n\nOpposing Force sees you as Corporal Adrian Shephard, an HECU Commander equipped with an experimental Military vest called the \"PCV\" or \"Powered Combat Vest.\" Shephard and his squad are brought in early on during the Black Mesa incident, but Shephard is knocked out after their heli crashes. Because of this, you witness the end of Half-Life early on in the campaign, and see what happens after Gordon has already defeated the Nihilinth afterwards. After initial containment by the HECU is deemed a failure, the black ops are brought in to take out everyone through the use of a warhead. Shephard disarms the warhead, but it later detonates after the end of the game anyway. After fighting through hoards of Race X aliens and Black ops, Shephard finds himself in the depths of the industrial section of Black Mesa. Here, he encounters the Gene Worm, a giant Race X alien capable of processing and converting the entire planet into a habitat fit for Race X. Shephard kills it and is captured by the Gman, who keeps him in stasis, leaving the player to wonder what might happen to him next.\n\nThe story and gameplay tell a very different tale than that of Half-Life. You're not a super scientist saving the world in a big orange suit, you're a soldier on the losing side of a war fighting desperately to survive, knowing that the only way to win is to sacrifice Black Mesa and everyone in it. Opposing Force feels a lot like the Halo Reach of Half-Life. You don't feel anywhere near as Strong as Gordon Freeman, and you have to abandon and sacrifice your own squad members throughout the campaign just to keep going. With Opposing Force starting near the end of Half-Life, you can get a proper perspective of what's going on with the invasion outside of Gordon Freeman's point of view, and just how much damage is being dealt to the whole world. By the time you're fighting the gene worm, you don't feel like a hero, you feel like a tired soldier moments away from falling apart, just wanting it all to be over with. When the game ends, after the credit sequence, you aren't booted out into the main menu, you're given a black screen with the low whistling of wind, continuing on into eternity. The game's story is poetic, it puts you in the shoes of a member of the bad guys suffering the same fate as the good guys, and ends with an immense loss, especially considering what happens to humanity next. One can argue that Gordon Freeman's battle in Half-Life is the same, struggling to fight the oncoming invasion and somewhat losing at the end, but in Half-Life, you know what you did saved the world from the Xen invasion, whereas in Opposing Force, you don't have any orders being given to you by scientists or commanders, you're a lost soldier just doing what he can do to survive.\n\nSTORY SPOILERS END HERE.\n\nWith a story like that, usually I could give a raving 5 star review, but the gameplay is just too broken in the modern day for me to grace it with such. I would say \"I hope Valve or Gearbox go back to fix these\" but we both know they won't. It's 2020. With all that said and done, though, here's to Half-Life Alyx coming out in just a few days, and here's to Tripmine Studios for their Operation: Black Mesa and Guard Duty mods that they're developing!\n\n[h1] DECEMBER 2020 UPDATE [/h1]\nYeah the game's still shit. I was genuinely glad when it finally crashed on me again so I could have a good excuse to stop playing. Wait for Operation: Black Mesa to come out or get it as part of the Valve complete pack. Don't get Op Force on its own, it's not worth it.","timestamp_created":1584315992,"timestamp_updated":1609234393,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483597874641418457","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65099642","author":{"steamid":"76561198812661012","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1657296881},"language":"romanian","review":"so many memories","timestamp_created":1584291814,"timestamp_updated":1584291814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65099570","author":{"steamid":"76561198847902900","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":669,"last_played":1641264326},"language":"english","review":"do","timestamp_created":1584291742,"timestamp_updated":1584291742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65095550","author":{"steamid":"76561197993023804","num_games_owned":866,"num_reviews":517,"playtime_forever":84,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1584287025},"language":"english","review":"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#314 out of 612)... it's time for Half Life: Opposing Force.\n\nThe other big Half Life expansion next to Blue Shift, Opposing Force shakes things up by having you play through the events of the original game (again) as one of the enemy soldiers.

I mean, officially authorized third-party expansions are rarely good. But what we have here? It's a pretty neat exception. Sure, [b]Gearbox[/b] (yes, the same [b]Gearbox[/b], which co-founder calls [b]Steam[/b] “[i]dying store[/i]” nowadays) didn't make the [b]Opposing Force[/b] from scratch, but they also didn't just give us more of the same. They seriously tried to create a new experience. And succeeded. A lot.\n\nThe idea to let us see the original [b]Half-Life[/b] events from a different point of view alone was kind of brilliant. In [b]Opposing Force[/b] we're playing as [b]Adrian Shephard[/b], a young US Marine Corporal, who was just assigned to the [b]Hazardous Environment Combat Unit[/b] from the [b]Santego Military Base[/b]. In other words, we'll control one of those guys who tried to hunt down [b]Gordon Freeman[/b] for more than a half of the original [b]Half-Life[/b] (that's a lot of halves for one sentence, huh?). We'll do the proper military training, we'll learn more about how things work between the marines and the [b]Black Ops[/b], we'll see how some orders from the original [b]Half-Life[/b] were given (“[i]Forget about [b]Freeman[/b][/i]!”), we'll actually see some events from the original game as different character, etc, etc, etc. Even though there won't be any choice at the end of this expansion, it's still a pretty neat stuff for all [b]Half-Life[/b] fans.\n\nAnd gameplay-wise? It's also pretty cool. Sure, level design became a little bit more dumb, but it's not nearly as dumb as in some other games [b]Gearbox[/b] will produce after this, and it's also less rough than in the original game. Which is a good thing, since some parts in [b]Valve[/b]'s game were just... [i]UGH![/i] It's kind of sad that the best parts of level design here are copy / pasted from [b]Valve[/b]'s work, but still, I can't say that levels in the [b]Opposing Force[/b] are bad. Quite the opposite, most of the time I totally enjoyed them.\n\nThe best thing about gameplay, though, is that there's heck of a lot of the new features here. [b]Gearbox[/b] didn't just change the point of view, they gave us the proper military experience here. We've got quite a lot of new weapons (from regular ones, like sniper rifle and combat knife, to alien), we've got laser sight, we've got the ability to use ropes, we've got night vision, we've got medics and engineers to command (medics can heal both you and nearby [b]NPC[/b]s, while engineers will help you to force open closed doors) and, the best of all, we'll be able to use [b]Barnacle[/b] (one of those things that live on ceilings) as a tool. Remember hookshot from [b]The Legend of Zelda[/b] games? That's pretty much what we've got here. For real. [b]Gearbox[/b] literally added the hookshot to [b]Half-Life[/b]. [i]BOOM![/i] Mind blown.\n\nSo, yes, I do recommend this expansion and I do hope it'll get more attention nowadays. I mean, come on! The original [b]Half-Life[/b] still has a life (now it's a sentence with too much “life”...). It got [b]Source[/b] remaster, it got awesome remake called [b]Black Mesa[/b] (go check it out), etc, etc, etc. But [b]Gerbox[/b]'s expansions? Those just stayed in the past. Even though there's a lot of great and unique stuff in them. The [b]Opposing Force[/b] is more than just the expansion. It's a whole new experience. And it doesn't deserve becoming obsolete. [b]21[/b] year later, I totally enjoyed re-playing it. Hope you'll do to.
