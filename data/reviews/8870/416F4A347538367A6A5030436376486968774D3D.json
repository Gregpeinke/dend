There have been games for which the answer was more complicated than a Yes or No, but this is the first time I have no clue what I should say.\n\nLet's put the obvious out of the way. Great art direction, the game can be absolutely gorgeous to look at times, skyline combat is incredibly fun, Elizabeth is a great character and her AI is very solidly built, the soundtrack is good but nothing spectacular in my opinion. One bug I encountered more times than necessary was the game freezing my computer when I clicked exit to desktop after a longer session (90+ mins).\n\n\nAll that said, this is how I describe my experience with the game.\n\n\nGameplay - Absolutely horrendous. Bioshock Infinite is just another first person shooter from it's time period but set in a city in the clouds. The sky hook is a great addition, but the game fails to make use of it as often as I'd like. That could be excusable if the movement mechanics would be any good. You can't sprint sideways or backwards in this game, and there is not a perk to unlock it. The combat encounters are long ranged enough to warrant that sort of fast omni-directional movement instead of the default sluggish one. I want to play this game as a movement shooter because it's fun that way. The walking/running feels lifted straight out of CoD and I don't feel it's a fit for this kind of game. The AI is dumber than Bioshock 1, I played on hard and I straight up cheesed every human enemy by just smacking them in the face for funny. Possessing enemies was where the AI really shined. Possessed enemies would stand next to other enemies and just look at them awkwardly until the spell expired then either killed themselves or corrected the direction of their gaze (depending upon their type) more times than I can remember. All this to say without even mentioning the absurd 2 weapon limit which serves no purpose other than declining you the right gun when you need it. Vigors range from mostly useless to \"I guess this can be considered cool\" with no explanation for their existence provided until the story DLCs (an afterthought?). Which reminds me the weapon wheel is really badly implemented in the DLC. I couldn't even map it to my preferred button correctly for some weird reason. Also navigating any menu is cumbersome.\n(Quick edit: No manual saves, all my homies hate when no manual saves).\n\n\nStory - Either the game does a really bad job at explaining itself or there really are gaping plot-tears (see what I did there :P) in the story. Or I'm simply plain too dumb to get it. It is kinda cool though. If this wasn't a Bioshock game, I wouldn't have recommended it. The story is great from the parts I can actually understand but it can be really badly presented at certain times. I'll give an example, all Bioshock games convey a significant chunk of story via recorded voice diaries, hence these important bits and pieces of dialogue should be subtitled when I turn dialogue subs on. Except in Infinite they're not and every time Liz or a random enemy/NPC start to talk (or scream) while I'm listening to an audio diary I just picked up, the game makes the voxophone volume really low to prioritise NPC dialog and scripted SFX, as a result I miss half the diary. Then I replay it, stand still for the duration while praying to God nothing happens. It was annoying and I gave up looking for them halfway. Then there are the characters. Liz is the only one that stands out because of her writing, Luteces are fun because of their importance to the story and less because of the quality of their writing. Fink is okay for the most part, the crazed colonel in the Hall of Heroes is forgettable because I can't remember his name, Lady Comstock is straight up cringe, Daisy is boring, Comstock and Booker are boring outside of plot significance. Their is little to no nuance in most of the characters, something I dearly missed from the denizens of Rapture in Bioshock 1. In spite of all this the plot itself is pretty interesting, and quite endearing especially with how they bring it full circle with Burial at Sea 2. I may not know exactly how to feel about it personally, but it's not objectively bad, it's good but I can't say how good.\n\n\nMy experience with this game has been less than ideal, but a lot of people like this game so there is a high chance you'll like it too. I prolly won't play this game again, but I'd still recommend playing through it once and deciding how you feel about it yourself.

Отрицательным моментом предоставляется  то, что места во время битв в первых двух частях происходили в более открытых помещениях с множество разных подходов к ним, здесь  же представляют  собой более закрытые аренные локации, что выглядит довольно скудно. Также геймплей очень ограничивается из-за отмены стандартного «большого» инвентаря с оружием, то, что привычно видеть в любых шутерах, игроку предстоит использовать только 2  на его выбор. Но именно из-за чего стоит обратить на это внимание, так это из-за сюжета, это наверное одна из лучших работ Кена Левина. Написанная им история выделяет саму игру как в отдельное самостоятельное произведение на уровне хороших книг в жанре научной фантастики 50-60ых годов. Если вам по нраву произведения подобные писателям Олдоса Хаксли, Джорджа Оруэлла, Рэйя Брэдбери и др., то Bioshock Infinity способен оставить после себя очень хорошие впечатления. Особо дополняют и продолжают историю два таких дополнения как «Burial at Sea: episode one/episode two», которые объясняют довольно интересную связь между Восторгом и Колумбией. \n\nТакже хочется отметить прекрасную актерскую игру Троя Бейкера и Кортни Дрейпер исполняющих роль главных героев, из-за чего в игру стоит играть в оригинальной озвучке.","timestamp_created":1636817884,"timestamp_updated":1636967959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511834323406219482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102716729","author":{"steamid":"76561198882799062","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1636893622},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏剧情很棒，就是玩的有点晕","timestamp_created":1636817608,"timestamp_updated":1636817608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102715031","author":{"steamid":"76561198144032407","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1640674499},"language":"schinese","review":"我居然晕了3D，鼠标灵敏降到最低才稍微好了点，实在顶不住了，游戏初感不错，但不敢再继续了","timestamp_created":1636815776,"timestamp_updated":1636815776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102714378","author":{"steamid":"76561198291531110","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":423,"last_played":1637483444},"language":"schinese","review":"我还没玩完，但我从三点多玩到十一点，就是最好的证明","timestamp_created":1636815052,"timestamp_updated":1636815052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102711278","author":{"steamid":"76561198882864098","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":456,"last_played":1637494256},"language":"schinese","review":"还记得第一次看到这个游戏的时候，那时我刚上初中，是看UP主做的视频，觉得很喜欢，可惜并没有后续\n直到前两天，我无聊的逛着STEAM，突然发现了这款游戏，这款我童年时期便念念不忘的游戏，于是我买了下来\n还好，我还记得它，但通关之后，我却宁可我并不记得它\n悲情的结局，在游戏里也是家常便饭，但童年加上喜爱，却让我无法释怀\n为了拯救自己的女儿，伯克选择了在洗礼之地将自己溺毙，这样也就不会有康姆斯托克，更不会有伊丽莎白，有的只是安娜，又或者安娜也不会存在，这是一个充满了扭曲的时间循环\n他爱着安娜，爱着伊丽莎白，无论是曾经的女儿还是现在的女儿，他想要赎罪，于是他最后做到了，可惜付出的是生命\n他悔恨了20年，于是他在看到了真相后，选择在伤膝河结束这一切\n最后，1893年10月8日，伯克听到了摇篮曲的声音，他推开门，一切结束了，又或者，一切都开始了\n我很难过结局不是伯克和女儿继续生活下去，但我也庆幸这一切的结束，不再痛苦\n我需要些时间去消化这结局","timestamp_created":1636811746,"timestamp_updated":1636811746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102707896","author":{"steamid":"76561198326342145","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":496,"last_played":1636799945},"language":"schinese","review":"——布克，你害怕上帝嘛？\n——不，我害怕的是你。","timestamp_created":1636807858,"timestamp_updated":1636807858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102706659","author":{"steamid":"76561198878953469","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1637551087},"language":"brazilian","review":"parou de crashar, agora sim\n\njogo bão","timestamp_created":1636806299,"timestamp_updated":1636869314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102706524","author":{"steamid":"76561198836944685","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":760,"last_played":1637048066},"language":"english","review":"","timestamp_created":1636806113,"timestamp_updated":1636806113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102706256","author":{"steamid":"76561199107457120","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":621,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":621,"last_played":1635605187},"language":"russian","review":"Здравствуйте, игра супер, но много обсуждений про продолжении.
