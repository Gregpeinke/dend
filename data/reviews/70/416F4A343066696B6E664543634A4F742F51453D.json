The gameplay might not have aged that well and there are some bugs (if there is a level transition in a vent, you won't be able to move at all). Surface Tension and Xen are by far the weakest parts of this game that just drag on, and the boss is just a simple \"shoot until it's dead\" type (which is something that this series really relies on). The combat is a double-edged sword, as it gives you fast movement and enemies that try to push forward. It's definitely a lot better than Half Life 2's mindless drones, but it doesn't allow you to reload at all, which can lead to many deaths. The HECU (I think that's their name) Soldiers are by far the most frustrating enemy to fight as they shoot you from any distance and lob grenades whenever they want. Now the grenade part wouldn't be as bad if you were fighting in a large space, but you mainly fight them in tight areas with barely any room to move around, so you end up getting hit anyway. They also spawn in groups of 3 or more, which makes it worse. Whenever you kill an enemy, their corpse still has collision for 3 seconds which creates even less room. Block pushing/pulling in this game sucks as pressing E on any block causes it to fly around the room. Autosaving isn't as frequent as it should be. Xen is extremely plain looking and doesn't feel like the end game area. I recommend playing on Easy to enjoy the game, Normal for a slightly harder experience, and Hard if you are into punishment. I recommend this game, but if you want to have a much more enjoyable experience just get Black Mesa.","timestamp_created":1585929310,"timestamp_updated":1586298737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66509749","author":{"steamid":"76561198085578524","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":620,"last_played":1586100797},"language":"english","review":"big gord","timestamp_created":1585928081,"timestamp_updated":1585928081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66508724","author":{"steamid":"76561198332107215","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1644,"last_played":1586108827},"language":"english","review":"Orange suit man goes in orange room and puts orange crystal in orange laser.

Even up against modern games I was still blown away by this game(played in 4K) so I can't even imagine what it must have been like to play this back when it originally released...(obviously not in 4K)\nThe gameplay was solid, the story was solid even despite there being obvious limitations on the in-game dialogue and cutscenes in that time of making games and overall it was just one hell of a game that, for obvious reasons, sent a huge ripple in the world of gaming and evolved into what it is today and the fandom that surrounds it.\n\nI did encounter one or two bugs though, the main one when Gordon [spoiler] is being thrown into the trash [/spoiler] compactor, the game fades to black after being dragged and then I'm 'sitting' there in front of a conveyor in a dark room, I thought this was supposed to happen but a quick Google told me that it's not. So, I reloaded my save just before entering [i] that [/i] room and just mashed Space the entire time which worked and I fell into the spot I was meant to.\n\nAnyway 10/10.
