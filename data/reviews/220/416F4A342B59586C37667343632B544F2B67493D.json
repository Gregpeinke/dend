I bought this about a year ago, because  Steam was practically giving it away, and I thought that at some point I would give it a try between play more modern games and see what all the hype was about. On the surface it looks like an old first person shooter involving Aliens... Cool, never seen that before. *Sarcasm* But then I transported myself back to 2004. A time when getting a college degree meant something, a time when you didn't need to be a millionaire to own a regular 3 bedroom, and a time when all the good video games really only came out on consoles. While the graphics aren't amazing by today's standards, they are better than some games that came out much later, and in some areas hold up very well, especially in the Citadel where it felt comparable the Mass Effect trilogy. The mechanics work very well and make the game very fun. As the game progressed, i started seeing what made this such a big deal and how future games of the genre took so much influence from this. Everything starts out with you as the player having really no idea what is going on, and then you begin understanding the stakes at hand, and then you make it into the Citadel... that was a very rewarding holy hell moment. The game takes  on a completely different feel, almost uncanny and disturbing, but you also feel like a god with the upgraded gravity gun. While I felt chills at the end of this game (maybe from the brownie I ate), I can imagine how much more rewarding this game was back in 2004 when players made it to the end credits. For me, as the credits rolled, I forgot that Half-Life 2 was an old game, which is very high praise. Most older games that make me nostalgic are terrible such as Oblivion, or unplayable like Goldeneye on the N64.  My only true gripe is how the Xbox controller would sometimes have a mind of its own, leading to me to disconnect and reconnect and reset the controller functions or sometimes just restart the game entirely. Examples, are the trigger buttons being stuck on constant fire and the joysticks no longer working, and no its not the controller, it works fine on everything else. If you're a heretic like me and do not like keyboard and mouse, that can be quite annoying. Other than that small grip I highly recommend Half-Life 2.","timestamp_created":1631755355,"timestamp_updated":1631755355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542143583297729492","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99416686","author":{"steamid":"76561199135078408","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1653936574},"language":"english","review":"fewfewr4gytr6rehsh5ttiutrdtfyghuijkl","timestamp_created":1631746380,"timestamp_updated":1631746380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99416435","author":{"steamid":"76561199169970928","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":51,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51,"last_played":1658617018},"language":"english","review":"alyx shut the fuck up damn","timestamp_created":1631745880,"timestamp_updated":1631745880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99416289","author":{"steamid":"76561198847210948","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1904,"last_played":1635125815},"language":"spanish","review":"Review (English):\n\nAwesome story, great gameplay, extremely advanced graphics and physics for it's release date... 10/10\n\n\n\nReseña (español):\n\nHistoria impresionante, gran jugabilidad, gráficos y física extremadamente avanzados para su fecha de lanzamiento ... 10/10\n\n\n\n评论 (中文)：\n\n令人敬畏的故事，出色的游戏玩法，极其先进的图形和物理特性，适用于它的发布日期...... 10/10","timestamp_created":1631745578,"timestamp_updated":1631745578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99413260","author":{"steamid":"76561198924860890","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":738,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":738,"last_played":1628501311},"language":"russian","review":"Half-life 2 - одна из лучших игр в которую мне удалось поиграть.

Üniversite yıllarımda bir daha dönüp Half-Life serisine başlayayım dedim. Half-Life'ı zar zor bitirince, sonlara doğru biraz baymıştı, Half-Life 2'ye başladım ve bugün itibariyle bitirdim. \n  \n  Hikaye konusundan giriş yapacak olursak, oyun Half-Life'ın hikayesinin üstüne baya eklemiş. Malum, Half-Life oyununda etrafta gördüklerinizin ve NPC'lerin konuşmalarının dışında hikayeyi takip etmek o kadar kolay değildi. Bu hikayede ise Alyx, Barney, Eli Vance ve Isaac Kleiner gibi karakterler arka plan hikayelerini bir şekilde açıklıyor. \n  \n  Oynanış kısmına gelecek olursak oynanışını rahat buldum. FPS tür oyunlarda çok tecrübem olmamasına rağmen rahatça oynayabildim. Vuruş hissi ortalama, vurduğunuzda bir tepki alamıyorsunuz ancak çıkan kanlar biraz olsun vuruş hissi hissettiriyor. Aynı zamanda shotgun ile combine/zombi vurmak çok zevkli. :) Ancak çerezlik, adam vurayım çıkayım niyetine oynayabilecek bir oyun değil. Bazı kısımlarda çözmesi çok zor olmasa da dikkat gerektiren bulmacalar ya da gerçekten görmesi kolay olmayan geçitler var. Biraz dikkatinizi ayırmanız gerekebiliyor. \n  \n  Oyun aynı zamanda akıcı, bölüm dizaynları hoşuma gitti. Ravenholm kısmında gerginliği iliklerime kadar hissettim. Aynı zamanda yeni gelen hızlı/toksik headcrabler bi ''Noluyo ya?'' dedirtti. \n  \n  Sonuç olarak, bu efsaneyi hala oynamadıysanız en yakın indirimde birinci ve ikinci oyunu alıp oynamanızı tavsiye ederim.","timestamp_created":1631532446,"timestamp_updated":1631532446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99280566","author":{"steamid":"76561198148701752","num_games_owned":2571,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":1016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1016,"last_played":1631526192},"language":"schinese","review":"20年前的游戏了，但是剧情，画质，重力引擎还有玩法，放在今天依然是一款优秀的游戏。","timestamp_created":1631526704,"timestamp_updated":1631526704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.632693171501159668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99280055","author":{"steamid":"76561199019092165","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":565,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":565,"last_played":1631525509},"language":"russian","review":"good\n","timestamp_created":1631525567,"timestamp_updated":1631525567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99278534","author":{"steamid":"76561198979544876","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1641275492},"language":"russian","review":"Очень качественная игра даже для своего времени","timestamp_created":1631522725,"timestamp_updated":1631522725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99277114","author":{"steamid":"76561198121628046","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1658459025},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1631519706,"timestamp_updated":1631519706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99275284","author":{"steamid":"76561199142393265","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":751,"last_played":1636663427},"language":"russian","review":"Игра полна разнообразия, поддерживается на многих языках и сюжет прост и понятен даже если не играть в первую часть \n","timestamp_created":1631516194,"timestamp_updated":1631516194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99274486","author":{"steamid":"76561197961998740","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1426,"last_played":1631442000},"language":"english","review":"What.
