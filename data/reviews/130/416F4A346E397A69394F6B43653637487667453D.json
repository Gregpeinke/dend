The game is also a lot shorter, leading to a bit of a faster, punchier experience.  Like the last, the game has a heavier take on combat.  And though this may be a negative for some, the lack of any real final boss feels refreshing, as the story simply wraps up saving people.\n\nCONS: Some of the 'puzzles' in the game can cause one to get a little stuck from time to time.  You need to pay attention to your environment to find some walls that can be broken down, or think to move crates across a room to jump into a seemingly destroyed air vent.\n\nFINAL: As the final supplement (released for the PC, anyway) for the original Half-Life, it does a fine job wrapping things up.  It's a short, fun little game that leaves Black Mesa behind.  Even though it's just that, I'd still recommend giving it a shot.","timestamp_created":1561312369,"timestamp_updated":1561312369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51406710","author":{"steamid":"76561198006815603","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1039,"last_played":1635012618},"language":"english","review":"game crashes when i die lol","timestamp_created":1561308196,"timestamp_updated":1561308196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476374596357345581","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51362472","author":{"steamid":"76561198401489027","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":138,"playtime_forever":522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":344,"last_played":1592317694},"language":"english","review":"If you want to know how Barney lands in Half Life 2 or play another Half Life game buy it.
