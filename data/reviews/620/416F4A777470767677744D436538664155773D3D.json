É um jogo que te prende de um jeito, não tem como explicar, ele vem com vários testes diferentes e sempre com o seu humor que faz você gostar demais dos personagens, tanto os mocinhos, quanto os vilões, uma história misteriosa e com surpresas inesperáveis. O gráfico bonito, jogabilidade simples e muito boa, e a trilha sonora engraçada demais combinando 100% com o jogo. Na minha opinião o único contra que eu tive em relação a ele foi que a legenda do meu jogo funcionava quando queria, as vezes aparecia, as vezes não, não sei se foi bug apenas no meu jogo ou a valve pecou nesse aspecto, mas deu para entender a história direitinho e se divertir com ela normalmente.\n\nHistória 10/10\nGráfico 10/10\nTrilha Sonora 10/10\nJogabilidade 10/10","timestamp_created":1458436782,"timestamp_updated":1458519545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493680745363235474","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21935394","author":{"steamid":"76561198216416648","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1502850283},"language":"english","review":"noice gmae","timestamp_created":1458435927,"timestamp_updated":1458435927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21933915","author":{"steamid":"76561198079740667","num_games_owned":541,"num_reviews":219,"playtime_forever":817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":434,"last_played":1547950739},"language":"english","review":"the best puzzle game.","timestamp_created":1458428968,"timestamp_updated":1458428968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493055552244186401","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21932563","author":{"steamid":"76561198262344613","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2681,"last_played":1459991414},"language":"french","review":"J'aime surtout les salles de test communautaires !
