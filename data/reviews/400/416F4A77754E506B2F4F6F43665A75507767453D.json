Donde el paso del tiempo (ya con 12 años) casi no le afectaron, envejeciendo muy bien al día de hoy. Lo que mas llama la atención, que a pesar de ser un juego totalmente diferente y con otra ambientación, los echos trascurran en el mismo universo que el de Half life. \n-El juego trata basicamente sobre una serie de puzzle  que deben ser resueltos teletransportando al personaje y objetos simples usando el \"Arma de portales\", un dispositivo que puede crear portales interespaciales entre dos superficies planas.  Chell la protagonista , es desafiada por llamada GLaDOS (Una I.A ) para completar cada desafió.  La trama se llevara acabo en las instalaciones de \"Aperture Science\" , la contra parte de \"Black mesa\" .\n-A pesar que su campaña principal es algo corta, su ingeniosa jugabilidad te invitan a continuar con los desafíos extras .

Игра была сделана в году в который все хотят вернуть. И представляет собой довольно занятную головоломку от разработчика который не знает цифру 3.\nА теперь по подробнее:\n   Картинка: Хоть игра и вышла во времена царя, но графику сделали здесь чуть более, чем похвально. Хоть локации и крайне похожи друг на друга [spoiler] Логично ведь мы всю игру находимся в одном научном комплексе [/spoiler] но наскучить, или уж тем более надоесть они не смогут. Текстуры все чёткие, и  щипать вам глаза мыльцом не будут.\n   Процесс игры: gameplay прост, как винтовка мосина, но от того не перестаёт быть интересным. Ваша цель пойти комнату и добрать до двери, но чтобы это сделать вам придётся проходить различные испытания с помощью портальной пушки, работающей по принципы соседа с дрелью по утрам, делаешь две портальные дыры в стене, в одну входишь из другой выходишь и наоборот и так можно до бесконечности. Но возможность самому создавать сразу два портала вы получите только в середине игры. Головоломки в игре не очень сложные, лично я прошел игру за 1 час.\n   История: Сюжет в игре средний. Вы просыпаетесь с похмелья в неизвестном месте [spoiler] признавайтесь у кого было так? [/spoiler] и слышите голос лучшего и единственного персонажа [spoiler] не считая турели и лучшего друга - куба F[/spoiler] Гладос. Это ИИ который устроил геноцид учёных в этом комплексе, а также она будет радовать нас своими шутками [spoiler] Ну и пытаться убить[/spoiler] всю игру. Наша цель проста свалить побыстрей, как школьник с физры.\n   Звучание: Оно есть. Я не знаю, что ещё можно сказать про звук здесь. Разве что озвучка Гладос великолепная.\n   Итог: Портал это простая и интересная головоломка и коли вы до сих пор её не прошли, то я советую вам сделать это на ближайшей распродаже.\n9.2 не съеденных тортиков/10\nP.s. в игре есть дополнительные уровни, для прохождения которых вам придётся пораскинуть мозгами словно вы один из учёных этого комплекса.

I went back to it again for the first time after playing Portal 2 (which seemed to me at first to be bigger and better in every way) but really they’re just different; each is good in their own way.  The biggest difference is their tone: Portal is cold and mysterious.  We get this impression both from the visuals (test chambers are much more sterile and bleak than they are in the sequel) and from GLaDOS, the only ‘character’ in the game, who, in contrast to Portal 2, is less of a dry comic relief element and is more sinister and enigmatic, a presence whose only moments of humour come from her hopeless ignorance of human nature. Compare this to the GLaDOS of Portal 2, who is far more sarcastic and self-aware: more human and less computer.  \n\n\tAlso, the first Portal is far more compressed than its sequel.  It’s just as long as it needs to be, there’s no fluff here; all its fat has been trimmed out, and it’s all the better for it.  Portal 2 is of course longer, funnier, more light-hearted, and contains more characters than its predecessor.  I think Valve were right to change the tone in Portal 2.  The first game was so perfect and had explored everything it needed to explore, a big change was absolutely necessary.  I could never say that one is better than the other.  I think both games have their merits.\n\n\tFinally, I just want to gush about my favourite part of Portal.  There are mild spoilers here so you might want to play the game first before reading (but really who hasn’t played Portal at this point? If you haven’t, hurry up and buy it!).\n\n\tMy favourite part of the game has to be near the end, after completing the ‘last’ chamber.  Up until this point everything has been so regimented, so orderly: you settle into the feeling the test chambers give you, you’ve become used to the rhyme of using whatever tools you are given to open the exit door of the test chamber to get to the elevator, and then it’s on to the next chamber.  Then all of a sudden GLaDOS tries to dispose of you, you escape her clutches, and this replicated pattern you have grown used to is ripped away from you.  You step ‘outside’ the chambers, and you feel that you’re somewhere you’re not supposed to be (even GLaDOS tells you as much), and that’s exhilarating.  It starts feeling less of a puzzle game with clearly delineated levels and more like an exploration adventure with puzzle elements.  It’s just genius.\n\n\tThe writer Neil Gaiman says that great fiction is taking the reader by the hand, promising them that you will never let go of that hand, leading them into a room pitch black with darkness, and then letting go of that hand.  This is exactly what Portal does so well.","timestamp_created":1559649162,"timestamp_updated":1559649162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51042603","author":{"steamid":"76561198399067043","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":805,"last_played":1654661834},"language":"english","review":"This game is fun and one of the best games I have I recommend this game if you like puzzle/adventure type games since this game is both.","timestamp_created":1559630390,"timestamp_updated":1559630390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51042578","author":{"steamid":"76561198167865910","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":179,"last_played":1601098108},"language":"english","review":"Do you like cake?","timestamp_created":1559630290,"timestamp_updated":1559630290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51040945","author":{"steamid":"76561198320719954","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1559619302},"language":"japanese","review":"名作","timestamp_created":1559619317,"timestamp_updated":1559619317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51038687","author":{"steamid":"76561198307067740","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":156,"last_played":1597456392},"language":"spanish","review":"Me trajo nostalgia de cuando Valve aún hacía juegos :') Si tienes Steam y no tienes este juegazo mátate xd","timestamp_created":1559603589,"timestamp_updated":1559603589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51036042","author":{"steamid":"76561198009405342","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":122,"playtime_forever":616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1520814162},"language":"english","review":"This was a triumph (for Valve).","timestamp_created":1559589989,"timestamp_updated":1559589989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51034805","author":{"steamid":"76561198827189509","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1541642294},"language":"english","review":"~ GRAPHICS ~\n🔲 You forget what reality is\n🔲 Beautiful\n✅ Good\n🔲 Decent\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 Don‘t look too long at it\n🔲 MS-DOS\n\n~ GAMEPLAY ~\n✅ Very good\n🔲 Good\n🔲 It's just gameplay\n🔲 Mehh\n🔲 Watch paint dry instead\n🔲 Just don't\n🔲 Visual Novel\n\n~ AUDIO ~\n🔲 Eargasm\n✅ Very good\n🔲 Good\n🔲 Not too bad\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 I'm now deaf\n\n~ AUDIENCE ~\n🔲 Kids\n✅ Teens\n✅ Adults\n🔲 Grandma\n\n~ PC REQUIREMENTS ~\n🔲 Check if you can run paint\n✅ Potato\n🔲 Decent\n🔲 Fast\n🔲 Rich boi\n🔲 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n~ DIFFICULTY ~\n🔲 Just press 'W'\n🔲 Easy\n🔲 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n🔲 Significant brain usage\n✅ Difficult\n🔲 Dark Souls\n\n~ GRIND ~\n✅ Nothing to grind\n🔲 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n🔲 Isn't necessary to progress\n🔲 Average grind level\n🔲 Too much grind\n🔲 You'll need a second live for grinding\n\n~ STORY ~\n🔲 No Story\n🔲 Some lore\n✅ Average\n🔲 Good\n🔲 Lovely\n🔲 It'll replace your life\n\n~ GAME TIME ~\n🔲 Long enough for a cup of coffee (<1 hour)\n✅ Short (1-5 hours)\n🔲 Average (5-10 hours)\n🔲 Long (10-20 hours)\n🔲 To infinity and beyond (30+ hours)\n🔲 Sandbox game (Any hours)\n\n~ REPLAYABILITY ~\n🔲 A one-time experience\n✅ Only for achievements\n🔲 If you wait a few months/years (or with mods)\n🔲 Definitely\n🔲 Infinitely replayable (or almost)\n\n~ PRICE ~\n🔲 It's free!\n🔲 Worth the price\n✅ If it's on sale\n🔲 If u have some spare money left\n🔲 Not recommended\n🔲 You could also just burn your money\n\n~ DLC ~\n✅ Free DLC\n✅ Soundtrack (free)\n🔲 Art, wallpapers, etc.\n🔲 In-game skins, costumes, etc.\n🔲 Gamemodes, extra levels, etc.\n🔲 The game is incomplete without DLC\n\n~ BUGS ~\n✅ Never heard of\n🔲 Minor bugs\n🔲 Can get annoying\n🔲 ARK: Survival Evolved\n🔲 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n~ ?
