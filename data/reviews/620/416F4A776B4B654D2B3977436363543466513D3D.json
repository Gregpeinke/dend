It is rare that a sequel can top an original, whether it be a movie, game, or anything for that matter. This game literally has 100 times more content than the original, has great graphics for a 2011 computer game, and unlike some games, has a complex and well set up storyline. I didn't get this for $20, but it is completely worth the $20. At first I thought it was gonna be just more levels but when the testing facility was falling apart (as evident by the preview images above), but it became so much more than that.\n\n\n\nThe gameplay mechanics perhaps quadrupled from the last game. If you played the original, you know you played with cubes, companion cubes, buttons, momentum, turrets, rocket launchers, and deadly goo, not to mention moving platforms and of course the iconic portal gun. Now take all these things and add laser grids, \"discouragement redicrection cubes\" that direct lasers, light walls, vortexes (excursion funnels), crushers, and cube-turret combos known as frakenturrets. But the most interesting mechanic is the goo. Four types of goo lead you to some interesting level solutions.\n\nThe levels are unique as well. Some mimic the environment of the original game, while others play more into the storyline and feel less like levels and more like \"open world\" environments though they certainly aren't open world.\n\nThe voice acting is on point. The characters can get you to hate them, laugh at them, pity them, etc. Minor spoiler: One of the funniest parts was when Wheatley asked the player to say apple. You respond by pressing space and jumping, which of course confuses Wheatley.\n\nThe storyline is a good combination of mystery, adventure and action. There are a few plot twists as well.\n\nNot really into storylines? Then buy the game for the level creator so you can make challenging puzzles for the entire Steam community. Want to play with someone else. Use the Co-op mode and play unique levels designed just for two people.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?
