Es ist ein Co-Op Spiel: Einzelkämpfer kommen (gerade bei höheren Stufen) nicht weit.\n\n2. Durch das Perk-System wird das Spiel bei gleich bleibendem Schwierigkeitsgrad leichter,\numso höher der Perk \"gelevelt\" wird. \nMöchte man trotzdem noch in's Schwitzen kommen, kann man den Schwierigkeitsgrad erhöhen.\nAllerdings finde ich bei 5 Stufen den Unterschied zwischen \"leicht\" und \"normal\" schon sehr krass.\nDie Entwickler hätten gut daran getan, z.B. einen Schieber mit 10-tel Schritten für den Schwierigkeitsgrad zu implementieren.\n\n3. Eingebaute Zeitlupe: Es gibt vielleicht Leute, die das nervt, aber ich persönlich finde es  nützlich, wenn man einen kritischen Treffer landet und dadurch sogenannte ZED-Zeit bekommt,\nin der man für einen kurzen Augenblick ein Monster nach dem anderen gezielt treffen kann.\n\n\nWas mir nicht so gut gefällt:\n\n1. Die Grafik ist von den Details her okay, aber für heutige Verhältnisse etwas veraltet.\nEs gibt z.B. keine richtigen HDR-Effekte (nur eine Art Bloom), was die Belichtungs-Berechnung (z.B. an den Wänden) betrifft, da ist heute mehr drin.\nDas muss aber kein Nachteil sein: Das Spiel müsste heutzutage mit jeder Onboard-Grafikkarte (vielleicht auch auf einem Laptop) laufen, die Framerate ist auf jeden Fall stabil.\n\n2. Abgesehen von den verschiedenen Arten, wie es die Monster erwischen kann, gibt es nur wenige physikalische Interaktionen mit der Umgebung:\nMan kann zwar Scheiben zerbrechen, aber  Kratzer an Türen etc. bleiben nicht lange dort.\nDie Einrichtung ist im Boden bzw. an der Wand \"verankert\", man bleibt auch an kleinen Objekten (wie z.B. Stühlen) hängen, statt dass man sie verschieben oder umstoßen kann.\nDas nervt manchmal etwas.\nTeller bleiben in Regalen und auch die Regale selber bleiben ganz, selbst wenn man Granaten drauf abfeuert oder ein riesiges Ungeheuer in dem Raum Amok läuft.\n\n3. Die erledigten Monster bzw deren Überbleibsel (sofern man Gore durch eine Änderung der .ini-Datei aktiviert hat) verschwinden schnell.\n\n4. Der Netzwerk-Code hat eine Macke.\nWenn ich ein Spiel aufmache (hoste), stürzt es gerne mal in der Lobby beim Warten auf Mitspieler ab, bevor der Kampf überhaupt losgeht.\n\n\nNoch ein Paar speziellere Tipps / Erfahrungen:\n\nNetzwerk:\nWenn man hosten will, müssen die Ports auf jeden Fall freigegeben werden, sonst erhalten die Clients \"Server antwortet nicht\".\nFindet ein Client den Host nicht, kann der Host ihm über das Steam-Interface eine Einladung zum Spielen schicken.\nNimmt man die Einladung an, kann man in einem Popup-Fenster die IP sehen, die der Host hat und muss das Passwort eingeben (was der Host vergeben hat).\n\nWird nicht danach gefragt oder kommt man immer noch nicht ins Spiel, kann man die dort gesehene IP nutzen:\nIm Hauptmenü von KF auf \"Mehrspieler\", dann \"Internet\", dann Rechtsklick auf \"Servername\", dann im Pulldown-Menü \"offene IP\" auswählen und eben die IP eingeben.\n\nWaffen & Munition:\nDas, was im Spiel auf dem Gelände an Gratis-Waffen und -Munition herumliegt, geht in der Regel nicht verloren.\nSpätestens wenn eine Zombie-Welle beginnt oder endet, verwandelt es sich höchstens in etwas anderes oder taucht an einem anderen Ort (in anderer Form) wieder auf.\n\nWenn also dort etwas liegt, was zu schwer ist, sollte man kurz aus dem Bild gehen und kurze Zeit später wieder kommen, vielleicht ist es dann etwas anderes, was sich besser tragen lässt ;)\n\nIch persönlich munitioniere auch nur voll auf, wenn ich nicht mehr so viel Zeit beim Händler habe, der Endgegener kommt oder Kameraden etwas brauchen.\nAnsonsten lasse ich meist 1 Magazin und 1 Granate aus.\nSowas findet man bis Stufe \"schwer\" (dann wird's weniger) immer wieder mal auf dem Gelände, man kann also ruhig mal eine Granate werfen, wenn deren Trage-Limit erreicht ist.\n\nAnsonsten kosten Granaten viel Geld (Muni vom kleinen Granatwerfer ist billiger und es geht auch mehr rein),\nman sollte sie nur im Notfall werfen oder z.B. vorm Nachladen, wenn es sich lohnt (d.h. man erwischt mehrere Monster).\n\nA propos Granaten: Übrigens zählt es beim Feldsanitäter als \"Heilung eines Teammitglieds\", wenn man durch seine eigene Heilgranate läuft.\nDas beschleunigt das Leveln ;)\n\n\nPerks Leveln:\nAuch auf Stufe \"Schwierig\" müssen Clots erst die Schutzweste durchdringen, bevor sie Schaden anrichten können.\nWenn also ein einzelner Clot herumsteht, auch mal mit dem Messer auf seinem Kopf zielen, um Munition zu sparen.\nDie Axt (gerade Sekundärfunktion \"Holz hacken\") erweist sich auch beim säurespeienden Bloat als sehr hilfreich.\n\nEs wird im Spiel gesagt \"Es ist eine gute Idee auf den Kopf zu zielen [...]\"\nGerade bei bei niedrigen Perk-Stufen ist es auch hilfreich, die Monster durch gezielte Kopftreffer schneller auszuschalten.\nDie Monster (variiert je nach Art) haben am Kopf etwa nur 1/4 der HP wie am Rest des Körpers.\n\nDa also deren Körper mehr HP als ihr Kopf hat, sollte man sich (wenn es gerade nicht ZU viele Gegner sind) die Zeit nehmen und mit Nahkampf- oder Feuer-Waffen auf Torso, mit Explosionswaffen auf deren Beine zielen, um so mehr Schaden anzurichten, bevor sie erledigt sind.\n\nWenn man das konsequent durchzieht, hat man nach ca. 20 Wellen ungefähr 100K Schaden zusammen.\n\nAm besten ein langes Spiel aufmachen (dann kommen länger die kleineren Gegner),\ndafür die Schwierigkeit eine Stufe höher einstellen, dass man es bis zu Welle 5-7 schafft.\n\nIst m.E. weniger stressig, ich persönlich habe zum Leveln gar nicht drauf abgezielt, zum Endgegner zu kommen.","timestamp_created":1418392110,"timestamp_updated":1418393137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13329302","author":{"steamid":"76561198079685094","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":784,"last_played":1635426016},"language":"russian","review":"Ваще огонь !!!\nне надоедает\nвесёлая\nмного мяса)","timestamp_created":1418391817,"timestamp_updated":1418391817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13328993","author":{"steamid":"76561198107847795","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1564,"last_played":1616993068},"language":"english","review":"I can't wait for Killing Floor 2!

Killing Floor was originally a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004. Did you also know it was made by the same team who made Red Orchestra, another UT2004 Mod?\n\nTripwire Interactive's track record is pretty good when it comes to mods to games and Killing Floor is extremely good. \n\nYou are part of a small 6 man team of varying perks to try and overcome the Zed Horde, from the simple Clot, the loud and proud Siren, the scary Fleshpound and the big bad Patriarch.  Fighting through waves, you must survive by getting mad amounts of dosh and buying bigger and badder weapons from the Trader.\n\nGameplay is pretty good when solo or with a group of friends, it can get frantic at times, but it's still a fun ride along the way. And if you get tired of the base game, Killing Floor can be customized like it's parent, UT2004. Though with the Workshop function, it's a whole lot easier to install mods (I recommend subscribing to the Weapons Workshop Mod for having custom weapons to work).\n\nMap are generally ranged from close quarters to rare big and large maps, and the visuals are pretty decent.\n\nMy major gripe is with the music, a lot of it's heavy metal stuff, but over time the music just becomes grating and uninteresting. There's stuff in the Workshop to change the music, but MP3 support would be nice.\n\nAnd after a while Killing Floor does become wholely reptitve, even the objective mode gets tedious because there's not a lot of maps for it. But it's still a good dame throughout and I whole-heartedly reccommend it for those who like zombie games.\n\n","timestamp_created":1418247831,"timestamp_updated":1418247831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560094237327575684","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13309638","author":{"steamid":"76561198045339259","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":19787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16104,"last_played":1616903694},"language":"spanish","review":"increible juego nada que decir muy buena musica gore al maximo personajes  que de verdad pueden asustarte mucho y buenos Dlc para comprar, este juego deja la bara alta para cualquier juego co-op survival mode.","timestamp_created":1418244594,"timestamp_updated":1418244594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13309481","author":{"steamid":"76561198065343564","num_games_owned":314,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":224,"last_played":1478311856},"language":"english","review":"i love it, i have yet to buy it (i'm broke) but it is one awesome game. buy it or become a nobody.","timestamp_created":1418243678,"timestamp_updated":1418243678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13309380","author":{"steamid":"76561198142058890","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":243,"last_played":1561514193},"language":"spanish","review":"Es muy bueno Uno de los grandes clasicos , su jugbilidad esta bastante bien y muy buenos mapas","timestamp_created":1418243176,"timestamp_updated":1418243176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13307492","author":{"steamid":"76561198118918848","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1122,"last_played":1509127470},"language":"russian","review":"Хороший такой кооперативный шутер, в котором придется попотеть убивая самых разных зомбо-ведьмо-зверья.","timestamp_created":1418232644,"timestamp_updated":1418232644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13306920","author":{"steamid":"76561198110492824","num_games_owned":437,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":48,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48,"last_played":1418235890},"language":"english","review":"Best coop zombie :D","timestamp_created":1418229500,"timestamp_updated":1418229500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500653266906738281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13306807","author":{"steamid":"76561198121245591","num_games_owned":316,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":3444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1431258277},"language":"russian","review":"Крутое волновое выживание !!! 9/10","timestamp_created":1418228727,"timestamp_updated":1418228727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529865086078643799","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13306756","author":{"steamid":"76561198137296181","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1418053871},"language":"russian","review":"КРУТО","timestamp_created":1418228474,"timestamp_updated":1418228474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13306611","author":{"steamid":"76561198059150483","num_games_owned":693,"num_reviews":208,"playtime_forever":804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":339,"last_played":1536666176},"language":"russian","review":"Круто выдерживать волну за волной зомбей и прочих уродов... если ребята которые играют с тобой не ракалы. \n\nНадо отметить, что можно выбрать класс свего перса и прокачиваться в этом направлении.

I can't say much about it since I just got it myself, but I can already tell I will be throwing all my hours into this game.","timestamp_created":1418187248,"timestamp_updated":1418187248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13301342","author":{"steamid":"76561198140255662","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":720,"last_played":1449576930},"language":"thai","review":"ก็ดีนะแต่ทำไมไม่มีเซิฟเลยอะ","timestamp_created":1418182365,"timestamp_updated":1418182365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13300600","author":{"steamid":"76561198057146283","num_games_owned":439,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":990,"last_played":1542351810},"language":"english","review":"Wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this.

Killing Floor is a pretty basic concept, like with L4D2. Unlike L4D2, however, which had you and your allies running from area to area escaping from the infected plaguing whatever area you're in, here you and your allies are special forces that have been sent in to find and destroy them, being locked inside an area filled with the beasts as you try to kill as many as you can without dying. The more you kill, the more you're paid, and the more you're paid, the more you can buy from the Trader. So, quite simply, your job is to fight and survive.\n\nPros: This is definitely a very fun game to play with friends if you have the chance. Unlike L4D2, you are specifically trained soldiers, and that comes into play. Here, you actually have special classes and can get helpful abilities to make fighting easier, such as Sharpshooter, that makes using pistols and scoped rifles, or FIeld Medic, which makes healing more effective. Also, like with L4D2, you have several different types of undead to deal with, such as the Sirens, who's shrieks can kill you with enhanced soundwaves, the Scrake, a horrifying, chainsaw wielding beast that will evicerate you with a sick smile plastered on its face, and the Stalker, a silent, deadly foe that can turn invisible to take their victims by surprise. There's also a good amount of weapons that are used by different classes, such as different pistols, machine guns, explosives, and the like. However, rather than just allowing you to grab anything and everything with the money you earn, you have a maximum carry weight of 15 pounds, meaning you have to really have a good idea of what you want, then be able to know what you should sell, if you need to, before the time limit is up and the next wave comes. Oh yeah, did I mention that you only have a limited amount of time to buy weapons, armor and grenades? Well you do. Oh, and even better, the Trader won't always be near you. Their location changes whenever a wave finishes, meaning if you're not close enough, you'll have to run just to get to them on time, meaning even LESS time to consider what weapons you want to use. All of this allows for an interesting, tactical game that's fun to play with your friends. They also have a number of missions for you to complete and a solo mode, allowing for all sorts of fun.\n\nCons: Of the cons I can consider, one is the simple fact that this can be a difficult game to play at first. If you don't get how it works, you'll probably get killed. Also, you get money based on how many zombies you kill, meaning if you aren't used to the game or others are faster or more experienced than you, then you might not be able to make a lot of cash quickly, forcing you to focus on buying ammo refills. Also, during the times you aren't near the Trader, you only have a minutes worth of time to get to where she is. If you don't get there in time, tough luck. If you start buying stuff only for time to run out while you're inside, you get kicked out in the middle of buying. This, while keeping the gameplay flowing, can be a pain to deal with for the simple reason that it means if you happen to be unlucky or on a team that isn't as good, you may end up running out of bullets and have to rely on your knife and grenades to save you, which is NOT fun. Also, some of the DLC can get expensive, with individual characters being sold for upwards of $4.99.\n\nAll in all, I enjoy this game quite a bit. It's a great game for getting friends together and putting a lot of bullets in zombies because reasons. Some things may irritate gamers and, like most survival horror, it's not for everyone. However, if you enjoy games like L4D2, I have a feeling you'll enjoy this game.","timestamp_created":1418172453,"timestamp_updated":1418172453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535714268684387207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13299874","author":{"steamid":"76561198024704277","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":8272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6881,"last_played":1485911252},"language":"english","review":"I'm trying to tickle you not bloody heal you..","timestamp_created":1418170245,"timestamp_updated":1418170245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13299644","author":{"steamid":"76561198073179428","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1898,"last_played":1500720662},"language":"russian","review":"По-скорее бы уже KF 2!","timestamp_created":1418168688,"timestamp_updated":1418168688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13299221","author":{"steamid":"76561198119094122","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75,"last_played":1534250141},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game!\nAwesome soundtracks!\nWorth its money!","timestamp_created":1418164287,"timestamp_updated":1418164287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474683523178100586","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13299027","author":{"steamid":"76561198122916291","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2879,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1507934505},"language":"spanish","review":"un buen juego, \nesos tipicos juegos de comprar armas, desbloquear kits, obtener experiencia, etc\n\npero este, al igual de todos es de zombis, escojes la dificultad, y ademas tiene workchop, con la que puedes crear mods\n\npara mi opinion un muy buen juego, y lo que mas me gusta es que se puede jugar multiplayer.","timestamp_created":1418163041,"timestamp_updated":1418163041,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13299013","author":{"steamid":"76561198141585323","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1336,"last_played":1603665781},"language":"english","review":"awesome game ! its just that for some reason i cant play it any more and when i try to play it , it says run time error all the time","timestamp_created":1418162968,"timestamp_updated":1418162968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13298609","author":{"steamid":"76561198078317791","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":182829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":36197,"last_played":1659414918},"language":"english","review":"it's a very good game, if you play with friends","timestamp_created":1418160699,"timestamp_updated":1418160699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13298068","author":{"steamid":"76561198084186275","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1430419642},"language":"english","review":"metal as fuck. 422/666","timestamp_created":1418157476,"timestamp_updated":1418157476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13297827","author":{"steamid":"76561198054853750","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":7311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5686,"last_played":1444304066},"language":"russian","review":"Один из лучших саундреков в игровой индустрии.
