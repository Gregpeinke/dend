The puzzles make you think and perform tricks you might not even know that were possible by using various things to proceed. Such things include: Lasers, Cubes, Buttons, various gels, Light Bridges, and more. Plus once you complete the main story you can try your luck with the multiplayer story. This doesn't have as much story as single player but the puzzles are better since you need 4 portals for all puzzles and there is comical dialouge throughout the 5 main courses.
