La dificultad de los niveles ha mejorado con respecto al primero y a pesar de que haya alguno que otro que te tome bastantes intentos aún asi te dan ganas de seguir intentando hasta lograrlo, los personajes están perfectamente bien hechos, cada uno de los pocos con un carisma y forma de ser única que te harán tanto reir como querer asesinarlos lenta y dolorosamente, lo recomiendo más que nada porque es un juego bastante fluido que te hará pasar unas buenas horas de juego entretenidas que valdrán la pena. La historia bastante desarrollada siempre te dejara con un hambre de una secuela, cosa que para VALVe siempre le fue muy dificil de hacer en caso de terceras partes... Aún asi, te cuentan las cosas de tal forma que te dejan a ti crear la historia y averiguar lo que esta pasando, es una aventura desafiante y entretenida pero para nada confusa o difícil, algo que es un gran atributo para este título. En fin, para resumir una larga lista de cosas que hacen a este juego una obra de arte serían su profuna y gran historia, y su capacidad para hacer funcionar tu cerebro y hacerte pensar de mejor manera como hacer las cosas para poder hacerlas bien. Su jugabilidad es bastante buena y simple, te adaptas rápidamente a los controles, en especial si has jugado su antecesor, y aunque no sea su particularidad más importante, su visualidad gráfica tambien es bastante buena.","timestamp_created":1385854653,"timestamp_updated":1385854653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7853477","author":{"steamid":"76561198024011084","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":743,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":419,"last_played":1645902993},"language":"danish","review":"A very fun game, if you like puzzels this is one of the best out there.","timestamp_created":1385853362,"timestamp_updated":1385853672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7852515","author":{"steamid":"76561198087175729","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":722,"last_played":1391622827},"language":"czech","review":"MindF**k for your brain !! :)","timestamp_created":1385849352,"timestamp_updated":1385849352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7852285","author":{"steamid":"76561198070448589","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1606656176},"language":"russian","review":"круто","timestamp_created":1385848427,"timestamp_updated":1385848427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7852252","author":{"steamid":"76561198092625808","num_games_owned":370,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":414,"last_played":1627186342},"language":"english","review":"This Game is one of the best games ever made, its well coded, well designed, the sound effects are great, the story is a masterpiece, and the cooperative mode is so great, much better than any coop game i have ever played...\nwhat else to say? its valve, they make the best of the best","timestamp_created":1385848278,"timestamp_updated":1385848278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7852193","author":{"steamid":"76561197991130013","num_games_owned":921,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":363,"last_played":1385900357},"language":"czech","review":"Ze zacatku bomba, pak uz jsem se jen modlil at je konec jaka to byla nuda, jedine v cem je lepsi jak jednicka je grafika, ani ten super humor si to nedokazalo udrzet, rekl bych ze to delala stejna parta lameru co episode 2 ...\n\nabych tomu nekrivdil konec byl dost dobry, ale jen se tam prokousat pres milion, stale stejnych nudnych puzzlu\n\njen pro puzzle masochisty co si vyhraji ve steamworks","timestamp_created":1385848076,"timestamp_updated":1385900320,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.199601456522941589","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7852057","author":{"steamid":"76561197976768739","num_games_owned":4146,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":16057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2065,"last_played":1636725185},"language":"german","review":"1000 Rätsel später und das Spiel macht immer noch Spass.

The level design is very typical of Valve, very well executed and detailed with careful attention to even the littlest bits of foliage. The ending is apparently very easy to misinterpret, as I've seen quite a few people posting about how a sequel is inevitable but I really can't see that happening. Portal 2 actually wraps up the Aperture storyline quite nicely in my opinion, but we'll see.\n\nThe game is definitely pretty lengthy compared to the first one, sporting two separate campaigns; Valve has publicly stated that the single player campaign is three times the length of the original, while the campaign for the co-op times at about twice the length of the original; having five times the content at a little over double the price seems like a very fair and generous trade off to me :)\n\nGreat game. Love the music and sound effects, the storyline, the voice acting, the environments.","timestamp_created":1385798981,"timestamp_updated":1386154894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518716573715209961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7839237","author":{"steamid":"76561198071460112","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":429,"last_played":1386192090},"language":"english","review":"Just....wow","timestamp_created":1385798383,"timestamp_updated":1385798383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7838881","author":{"steamid":"76561198104519759","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":417,"last_played":1392168025},"language":"english","review":"an amazing game if you love puzzling yourself. or cake","timestamp_created":1385796224,"timestamp_updated":1385796224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7838707","author":{"steamid":"76561198027660605","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":847,"last_played":1543496585},"language":"koreana","review":"다좋은데 한국사람이 없어서 멀티하기가 힐드네..ㅠㅠ같이하실분 대화주세요","timestamp_created":1385795255,"timestamp_updated":1385795255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7838358","author":{"steamid":"76561198080352800","num_games_owned":270,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1461918339},"language":"english","review":"Plyd custum lvls and it rokz browizno","timestamp_created":1385792963,"timestamp_updated":1385792963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7838200","author":{"steamid":"76561198059727547","num_games_owned":567,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1609213520},"language":"english","review":"In this update to the franchise, they finally correct the typo the made when titling the first one.

Speaking about the tests they've also become way more interesting and challenging than in the first game. There have been added lots of new things to make the game more interesting like gels and lasers. Besides that the game also has a co-op mode, which is extremely fun to play with your freinds, especially when you're just trolling each other.
