Вот и создатели BioShock Infinite использовали классические сюжетные заготовки (принцесса в башне, герой с темным прошлым, город на пороге катастрофы), но создали из этого нечто совершенно новое, а возможно, даже гениальное. Взяли старую концепцию игрового процесса, очистили от лишнего, чуть подправили на манер Dishonored визуальный ряд и отдали игроку на попечение милую и очень настоящую девушку, обученную помогать в бою. И вроде бы новизны минимум — но свежеуложенные кусочки мозаики отчего-то собираются в картину невиданной красоты. ----Вы когда-нибудь пробовали писать диссертацию после великолепного путешествия по экзотической стране? Примерно такая же задача стоит перед любым обозревателем BioShock Infinite. Чувство блаженной счастливой усталости переполняет тебя после прохождения, хочется спокойно возродить в памяти лучшие моменты прошедшего дня или повторить празднование. Ведь именно таково творение Irrational Games. BioShock Infinite — геймерский праздник, вызывающий буйство эмоций и мыслей. После подобного меньше всего хочется заниматься сухой аналитикой и объективным оцениванием. Сложно удержаться на позиции холодного рецензента и не войти в роль воспевателя хвалебных од.

Очень жаль что придется еще потерпеть пока сделают озвучку к DLC, не хочется менять атмосферу, теплоту и душевность русской озвучки и хотелось бы выразить благодарность всем тем людям кто над ней работал. Да, у игры есть минусы, кое где видны недочеты графики, по ходу игры немного напрягает рыться в каждом углу и в каждой урне, но что бы облазать все и посмотреть каждый уголок локаций и послушать каждую аудио запись - приходится и этим заниматься, ведь в сюжет погружаешься полностью. Игра оказалось не короткой и не длинной, я бы сказал - в самый раз. А учитывая что я еще и не трогал DLC, то в скором времени растяну удовольствие еще на несколько часов. Локации проработаны впечатляюще, куча скриншотов из игры - тому подтверждение. Звуковая составляющая выполнена в тематике, не могу оценить оригинальные голоса персонажей, да и к чему это, если есть великолепная русская локализация! Ведение боя в целом оценил бы на троечку, обилие скиллов, к которым привыкаешь только к концу игры, а пользуешься вообще парой тройкой за весь геймплей - по моему упущение. 2 ствола в арсенале вроде бы и реалистично, но их постоянно не хватает, стандартный набор из 3х стволов на близкую, среднюю и дальнюю дистанцию добавил бы больше динамики в перестрелки, а так приходится либо под пулями пробираться к врагу что бы убить его из дробовика, либо в упор пытаться застрелить из снайперки. Очень порадовал тот факт что тут нет консольного мусора в заставках, типа \"нажмите Е что бы сделать то\", то есть во время просмотра заставки можно расслабиться и отдохнуть. Не особо понравилась таргет система, которая показывает куда идти, я почти что стер эту кнопку за всю игру)) Мелочи конечно, но все же. Хотелось бы отметить работу сценаристов, незабываемые впечатления от завязок и интриг сюжета, а так же крайне интересной концовки - ваш конек! Может Биошок и не вышел идеальным, но сыграть в него определенно стоит, это все равно что прочитать хорошую книгу, есть о чем подумать, благо посылов о человеке как о злом, добром, жадном, глупом и умном существе там хватает.

Due to the game's unbelievable total storage usage at the time [31.17 GB !!!], and the fact that my MacBook Air has a small amount of storage on it's hard drive [120.47 GB] - as well as the space the rest of my Steam games occupied - I was unable to play Bioshock Infinite for a while on my computer {Because you can't play until you update for some reason…}. After several months (About 6-10 months) it now says I have to RE-INSTALL THE ENTIRE GAME! Not only that, but the space that it previously occupied is still taken up. Now I have to install another 30 GB {to be exact it's 42.154 GB}.\n\n    What I want to know is what happened to the 31 Gigabytes this application previously (and still) occupied/occupies. If it was deleted, I would of had 31 Gigs of space available upon it's deletion, but I never got that storage back. This means that the application and it's saved data still exist on my computer. This has only happened on 1 other Steam-purchased application I own, Out of the Park Baseball 2014 (that only requires a few Megabytes, so I'm not as concerned with that) and the conditions regarding the re-installment requirement are the same with both. I would prefer to update the game using the old files loaded on my computer, and not have to reinstall a completely new & updated version. I have not attempted to download the game, considering my computer doesn't have the space available, and I don't want my old data deleted, considering it took 150+ hours of solid gameplay to complete.\n\n\n    Other Notable Issues & (Possibly) Useful Information\n\n--My time played was reset (this was PRIOR to the update & re-installment requirements, so I could still open the application; no data seemed to be missing). This glitch has occurred with almost every application I own on Steam and with both of the games requiring re-installments\n\n--Other games I own such as Rust and Portal still update with ease, and do not require me to re-install them\n\n--I own a MacBook Air Running OS X 10.8.5 (the very last version prior to OS X Mavericks)\n\n--This is the second oldest Steam-purchased application on my computer","timestamp_created":1418935115,"timestamp_updated":1418935115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13433806","author":{"steamid":"76561198040558890","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":790,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":790,"last_played":1416449230},"language":"english","review":"Loved this game, but replay value is low.","timestamp_created":1418930512,"timestamp_updated":1418930512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13433718","author":{"steamid":"76561198159334699","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1042,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":589,"last_played":1577424059},"language":"english","review":"By far one of the best story driven games i've ever played.

Świetnie nakreśleni bohaterowie (cudowna Elizabeth) i duża różnorodoność arsenału sprawiają, że gra się naprawdę przyjemnie. Muszę też wspomnieć, że gra jest świetnie zoptymalizowana i śmiga na wysokich ustawieniach na moim Ideapadzie Z510 - jestem pod wrażeniem! \n\nDrażnią mnie niepotrzebne kalki z poprzednich części Bioshocka, które nie mają racji bytu w przypadku Infinite - to przecież zupełnie inna historia. Mam tu na myśli np. Złote Rączki, które są oczywistym nawiązaniem do Big Daddies (i które tę nieoficjalną konfrontację przegrywają dość solidnie) i Sole - kopia znanych z Rupture Plasmidów. Kolejnym minusem jest liniowość, która jednak aż tak bardzo nie drażni, bo przedstawiona w grze historia jest cholernie intrygująca. Mam również wrażenie, że ilość Soli nie przekłada się na ich użyteczność. Wiele z nich działa w sposób bardzo do siebie zbliżony, przez co - siłą rzeczy - i tak korzysta się z kilku \"Plasmidów\" na krzyż (chyba że komuś zależy na steamowych osiągnięciach i gra w sposób jak najbardziej urozmaicony). \n\nPodsumowując, mimo że miasto w chmurach przegrywa moją subiektywną walkę z podwodnym Rupture, nowy Bioshock to na pewno gra warta polecenia. Solidna ósemka.","timestamp_created":1418774691,"timestamp_updated":1418774691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57034766674041748","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13409162","author":{"steamid":"76561198015590793","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1388173130},"language":"english","review":"If you are one of those people who loves to binge series on Netflix; That is exactly what you'll do if you start playing this game. You won't be able to put it down until you've seen the credits roll! From world immersion to the amazing characters to the handling of the great and incredibly creative weapons and abilities, this is hands down one of the best  games ever created. The game can be incredibly gory but it never feels like it's just there for shock-value, the game really has a lot of depth and it mirrors our society and history with enough (dark) humor to actually take it seriously (if that makes any sense at all). \n\nThe artificial intelligence in this game is very impressive and Elizabeth is very likeable and a great companion. Remember trying to keep Natalia alive in Goldeneye N64? No such stress here! Just like Rocksteady's Batman franchise, this game nails mobility and fighting in it's own unique way and the setpieces are stunning. \n\nIf you've always had any interest in this game, just go for it. It's worth every penny and it just might be one of the best games you've played it a long time.","timestamp_created":1418772255,"timestamp_updated":1418772369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13408896","author":{"steamid":"76561198032536288","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":90,"playtime_forever":292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1374944618},"language":"english","review":"I enjoyed what I played, but the story was just not quite enough to keep me going to the end, I never did finish it.
