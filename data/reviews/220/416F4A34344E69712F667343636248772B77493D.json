I physically cannot express my love for this series, and this game in specific. At every corner, there is a puzzle, a fight, and an ominous mystery no one can solve. No words can express the fun you have playing Half-Life. I would go as far as to say you shouldn't play Garry's Mod if you haven't played the entire Half-Life series. I could go on and on, but I want to make this short. Play, I ask. Play, and have more fun playing this single game than you have ever had over the course of your life.","timestamp_created":1632170588,"timestamp_updated":1632170588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99699931","author":{"steamid":"76561199003830622","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1093,"last_played":1649775840},"language":"russian","review":"Эта игра настолько самостоятельная, что можно забить на первую часть и 2 эпизода. Прикол геймплея сохранился еще с первой части: иди из точки А в точку Б убивая все что движется, но за счет нового движка и механик для меня халф лайф 2 лучшая из всех игр этой франшизы, которую я прошел ещё в 2017 на древнем ноутбуке. Сюжет этой игры меня не зацепил, НО если учитывать приквел и сиквелы этой части, то можно по истине влюбиться в эту историю, которая судя по концовке халф лайф алекс продолжается. Из запоминающихся моментов могу отметить главу с шоссе, рейвенхольмом и цитаделем. Впринципе вы можете познакомиться со вселенной пройдя вторую часть перед первой, но это на любителя. В первой части 90% геймплея это беготня по лаборатории, изредка выходя на поверхность чтобы найти новый спуск в катакомбы, но вот во второй части гордону приходится бегать по улицам, заброшкам и канализациях сити 17, и это

This game is nothing short of amazing, there's not even a word to say how awesome this game is.\n\n- Favorite Chapters -\n\nRoute Kanal - It's a good chapter, it's also the chapter where you get the SMG and a pistol. The SMG is by far the most useful weapon, long range, short range, medium range. It becomes less damaging when it's at long range though. But at that point just use the crossbow or a pulse rifle when you get it later.\n\nDark Energy - The last chapter. It's a perfect one, the fact that you have to stop Dr. Breen before the singularity collapses is worrying, it brings you into a state where you feel you need to hurry. But also, you need to be careful. As one mis-step could lead to you falling to your death.\n\nBlack Mesa East - It's where we get the gravity gun, the gravity gun by far is one of the best weapons. And it's made even better in \"Our Benefactors\" before we meet Dr. Breen. It's truely a work of art, it's also where we meet Dog. A robot that acts like a dog, manufactured by Eli Vance to protect Alyx when she was a young girl.\n\n- Less Favorite Chapters - \n\nWe Dont Go to Ravenholm - This chapter screams annoying. In this chapter, there is multiple areas where you may find it challenging to succeed. This is diminished a bit after you get the shotgun, but it doesn't help much. I don't blame you if you found this annoying too. There's also fast zombies, headcrabs, but that's not even the quarter of it. The poison zombies and headcrabs are the worst. The poison headcrabs can drain your health to 1%, and your suit then administers some sort of morphine to regen your health. It's a neat feature, but still. Annoying.\n\n- Notable Weapons -\n\nCrowbar - The first weapon you get. Trusty, sturdy, and good for breaking stuff.\n\nUSP (Pistol) - It's a good weapon, but it gets dwarfed by the Overwatch Standard Issue, as well as the SMG, and also the magnum.\n\nSMG - This is one of the best weapons you use, it's very common to find ammo for this weapon.\n\nOverwatch Standard Issue (Pulse Rifle) - The primary fire is good for long range when you don't wanna use the crossbow. The secondary fire should only be used for emergencies, like when there is 5 shotgunners and 4 soldiers in a small hallway.\n\nGravity Gun - Do I even need to explain?\n\n- Overall Review -\n\nX = Chosen\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nPotato |\nLow Spec | X\nAverage |\nHigh Spec |\nAsk Tony Stark for his PC |\n\nStory:\n\nThere is no Story |\nThe story isn't good, not memorable |\nThe story is average, not memorable |\nThe story is good, kind of memorable |\nThe story is a masterpiece, very memorable | X\n\nDifficulty:\n\nThe game is hard, annoying, can't even play it |\nThe game is challenging, very hard, I can hardly play it without sweating |\nThe game is an average challenge, it provides a lot of stuff to help | X\nThe game is easy, not a challenge really |\nJust press W man |\n\nWhole Story Completion Time:\n\nGrab a coffee and you'll be done by the time you get back |\nShort |\nAverage |\nLong | X\nInfinite |\n\nPrice:\n\nIt's free, bruh. |\nWorth the price | X\nWait for it to be on sale |\nNot worth |\nSuper not worth |\n\nThat's it for my review, I'm giving this game a positive rating.
