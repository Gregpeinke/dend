The plot and character development are very immersing and intricately blended together. It is evident that the gameplay, although innovative by paralleling the original Bioshock style, is rather repetitive and drags on at times. In saying that, however, the sheer genius of Ken Levine and Irrational Games' writing department have countered this minor element ('minor' as the gameplay is not in itself boring or disfunctional, just a tad repetative) with the distraction of the unique complexity of the story line. Visually, Bioshock Inifinite is stunning. Realism has been sacrificed for a beautifully vibrant art style making the game an absolute pleasure to play! This game is a must for all original Bioshock fans with subtle (and not so subtle) throw-backs.

There are a few things to keep in mind when deciding if you want to buy this game however.\n\nFirst is that as a FPS game it is very much lacking. The AI is passable only as exceptional if you went and opened a tear back to 2004. Ontop of this easily duped and poor pathing AI we have what amounts overall to a console port to PC with all the shoddy controls you would expect from such.  Unless you have triple jointed fingers or a couple extra thumbs you will find yourself remapping over half the keys like I did just to make the game playable. \n\nNow ontop of all this we have a rather unoriginal core plot that you could figuratively say is copy and pasted from the now dated title Singularity, all the way down to the ending revelations.  Plot twists are rather obvious and seen coming several load screens away.\n\nNow with all there are a number of redeeming qualities to the game.  First and most noticable for me is that it does away with the constant repetative \"tunnel\" rooms from the first two installments where in every enemy, spawn method, and environment was just a reconfiguration of the previous room with pointless grinding through enemies because killing the same three things in the same three ways for no reward is fun nonesense.  Which is a very obious plus for the game, really its almost a neutral point as in 2013 we should and often do expect games not to have cookie cutter enemies and areas.\n\nNext is the Vigor system, while very limited each Vigor offers two modes of use, and can be used in conjunction with other vigors if you are fast enough making for some unique results and clever ways to kill.\n\nThen we have the true 1910's visual style, it really captures the old world feel of the last century and even includes a number of \"modern\" songs played/sung out on old instruments and in older styles. Pay particular attention for the rather well done rendition of \"girls just want to have fun.\" \n\nNow finally, and the one true saving grace for the game is the companion system.\n\nElizabeth is done with such detail from her posture, to her fidgeting fingers, her facial expressions, tone of voice, and scripted reactions to even your own actions in game and in fluff pieces that she really feels alive, you'll find yourself developing a emotional attachment to her early on.  In fact I found myself rather provoked at the deal revelations involving her late in the game.  She is done so perfectly infact while I would rate this game a 5/10 as a decent FPS I would go so far as to move it up to a 6/10 or even 7/10 solely because of her. She is the central facit of the game after all, give us the girl, erase the debt.\n\nI hope Elizabeth will be a example to all developers of how to do companions in any game in the future. This is certainly the one thing they have gotten absolutely right with this game!","timestamp_created":1386133081,"timestamp_updated":1386149750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7905928","author":{"steamid":"76561198062914293","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1377,"last_played":1455987654},"language":"english","review":"an amazing plot and story line, the only thing is that ending of the story which confused me.

Something that most games have been very bad at lately, instead focusing on having the most bonerific graphics and saturating all of the colors to various shades of shit brown and gun metal grey. Bioshock infinite manages to have both beautiful graphics and a plot with actual substance. Elizabeth represents a significant step forward for female characters in videogames especially since players will be able to play as her in burial at sea part 2. The gameplay in Infinite is more akin to a modern shooter, the levels are more linear, there is less exploration, fights are more scripted, and the combat system only lets you equip two weapons and two vigors at a time. While the violence and fighting is a key point of the game's story and gameplay the combat is quite lacking. I rarely used the vigors and even then I only found a few to be useful, the enemies take way too much damage, and there is a lack of variety especially with the heavy hitters. Most of the time you rarely see the heavy hitters, and they are few and far between. The only heavy hitter that appears a lot is the motorized patriot and there are too many of those. Also the enemy encounters seem less organic. In the original Bioshock you stumbled upon enemies and proceeded to fight them, in infinite not so much. A lot of the game is just walking across a relatively dead city as many parts of it are deserted and you cannot really interact with NPCs besides Elizabeth who always creepily stands right behind you silently when you turn around after walking and losing sight of her. The NPC interaction is sort of like Final Fantasy XIII in which you walk next to them and they might say something to you. The other major plot problem aside from the alternate timelines, which actually is handled better than most is a lack of presence of the antagonist. In the original Bioshock the antagonist would constantly try and harrass you over your radio, giving you the feeling that they are omnipresent and omnipotent. Here Both Major antagonists sort of say \"come at me bro\" to you and then you never hear from them again until you go kill them. I personally thought that the ending was appropriate. If I were to rate the base game I would give it an 8/10 but then burial at sea came out. I don't know about you but every hardcore bioshock fan such as myself shit their pants when they learned about burial at sea. Finally the ONE thing that we all wanted to see from bioshock finally arrived. It only took six years three games and a DLC, but we finally got it. Most of the major problems with game play are addressed. The enemy encounters are organic, the combat is balanced, and the final fight with the big daddy is climactic.","timestamp_created":1386127359,"timestamp_updated":1386127359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7905179","author":{"steamid":"76561197970483094","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":1158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1085,"last_played":1381537481},"language":"english","review":"If you need one more person to recommend this game to you, you've been living in a cave under a rock on another planet.

This is really incredible. I never really had any interest in any of the BioShock games. I didn't really like the design, sort of reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode that looked vibrant but had a pale story by comparison. I saw the trailer for infinite that caught my interest. My first thought was \"Oh a floating city, cool.\" So I waited untill a few days ago to get it finally. Didn't know a thing about the story, all I knew was that Troy Baker voiced Booker. That motivated me to get it even more. \nSo, let's start with the most important part of any game... the gameplay... yeah. I heard that the gameplay was really boring and repeatative, I was a little worried at first but warmed up to the salts and vigors system. So I really enjoyed the combat. the opponents always kept me on my toes, and the first Handyman encounter made me scream. Even with all the vibrant colors and designs, the game still has this creepy atmosphere that you can really appreciate. The only thing that I think should've been included are puzzles based on the elemental vigors. But one missed oppurtunity doesn't make a horrible game.\nNext we have the second most important part: (for me the most important part but eh) the story. I won't even go into any detail because I would be giving away too many great fleshed out characters, twists and turns and of course AI's. This game sort of reminds me of the visual style of the old Wild Wild West games. Booker Dewitt being a drunken James West. It has a steampunk feel to it all and it doesn't feel dated or pretentious at all. So perfect story, and to quickly summarize; the graphics look great, that's the end of it. \nThis is not my favorite game of all time, but I truly think it is a perfect experience and a wonderful story of choice, race, religion and of course the multiverse theory.

The story was amazing and mind blowing it kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole thing. It was so deep and complex. By the end my head was pounding I loved it though it wasn’t a normal headache but one that made me feel like my mind had expanded. The characters were very complex and very well voiced.

Das hätte Steam erwähnen müssen. Dann hätte ich das Spiel überhaupt nicht gekauft.\n\nAußerdem ist es traurig, dass ich Steam nicht mehr direkt anschreiben kann. Es sind nur vorgefasste Antworten zu dem Spiel vorhanden. Also kann ich das Spiel nicht empfehlen, da ich es nicht spielen kann. \n\nUnd man sollte genau aufpassen was man runterlädt, da es wohl häufiger zu Problemen kommt und man dann alleine gelassen wird.

There's nothing like being surrounded by bushels of apples and only being able to eat two; and this situation is relatively common -- instead you are picking candy bars out of trash cans to give yourself health (even when you are in a store filled with food). \n\nMany objects might as well have the mass of a sun and be made out of titanium, they can't be moved and you can't effect them at all. Except for being visible, it is like they don't even exist. This & not being able to go to obvious places like a wall is in your path, are two of my pet peaves; and Bioshock is guilty of both of them, at times. \n\nI also find it frustrating that you can't carry multiple health packs.\n\nFlat textures and/or low res texturing is another issue that plaques the game. It can certainly take away from the otherwise beautiful environments. They reuse a lot of assets as well, especially faces and voices. Sometimes it has a creepy feel like some sort of genetic experiment gone wrong. People in the game sometimes act very creepy and unhuman in the way they move and interact - very distracting.\n\nThe save system is a mess, I thought developers had moved past having waypoints you had to reach to save your progress, but that is what they use. It is irritating when you have to exit the game, just to find out later that you have to replay fifteen minutes of game time to get back to where you were. I wish they would fix it.\n\nThere is some beautiful stuff in the game and they do a good job on the action, but it isn't revolutinoary by any means. Honestly, Bioshock Infinite doesn't push into any unexplored areas; it has a lot of hunt and peck type looting, with a very linear story line: Go to point A, shoot everybody, - dialogue - go to point B, shoot everybody - dialogue. Repeat. \n\nIn this respect, it is very much similar to the original. But they do it in a very entertaining way that is guranteed to keep your attention...\n\nBioshock Infinty represents a wonderful example of modern gaming. The makers have made a few mistakes, but otherwise, they have made a great game using tried and true techniques, nothing new, but still excellent.","timestamp_created":1386054751,"timestamp_updated":1386055476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7892469","author":{"steamid":"76561198037734694","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":719,"last_played":1425720074},"language":"english","review":"Absolutey beautiful game.

However I'd still say that the original BioShock was alot more entertaining.\n\nI was slightly disappointed that BioShock Infinite didn't live up to expectation set by developers in early production. Even elements shown in the Beta game-play seemed to be non-existent: such as being fired at with artillery weapons and having a telekinesis power to stop the shells, sandbox level design, larger and more open areas and the random collapse of buildings as well as random weather events. However due to time, story and technology restraints many of these features were unrealistic so many of this is excusable - yet still leaves me mildly disspointed.\n\nAlso I found the ending to be a bit weak, but enjoyable none-the-less. The re-playability is also somewhat non-existent do to the linear level design that isn't present in the previous BioShock games that would have left you searching through every corner of the map in the hope that you may have missed something.
