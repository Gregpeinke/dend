However, that's not to say that this is a bad game by any means. I thought it was pretty good.\n\nLike the first game, the level design is really good. What differentiates the levels in this game from the ones in Half-Life though is its usage of gimmicks. Many of the levels contain gimmicks such as the vehicle sections, the ability to control the antlions, using the citizens of City 17 to help you fight the Combine, and the supercharged gravity gun. These gimmicks made for many great moments in the levels as it felt rewarding to destroy the helicopter in the riverboat section, to pick up and throw Combine soldiers with the Gravity Gun, to watch as an infinite number of antlions took care of the Combine, and to have the City 17 citizens aid you in your fight (even though they weren't that strong). My only issue with gimmicks though is that the extra enjoyment they bring to the game doesn't last long. As I progressed in these levels, some of the gimmicks grew a bit boring, and I felt inclined to skip by some of them, even the ones which made combat easier. Also, I felt like the vehicle sections went on for a bit too long. Regardless, however, I still feel like the gimmicks I mentioned add a lot to this game and they often make playing it feel like a blast.\n\nIf there's one section I liked more than any of the other chapters though, it's definitely Ravenholm. Putting its eerie atmosphere, the creative and helpful traps, and the ability to attack the zombies with anything you could pick up with the Gravity Gun aside, I was intrigued by the character of Father Grigori. He seemed like an insane character who, by his refusal to leave the town, was stuck in a prison of his own demise. As weird as it sounds, I think he might be the most interesting character in the game despite the fact that he only appears in a single section of it. If I had to pick one section to revisit, it would definitely be this one.\n\nWhile we didn't get the same variety of alien weapons in this game that we got in the original Half-Life, I didn't mind this that much, because I felt like the Gravity Gun, while technically a gimmick, made up for this absence. It had multiple functions as you got to use it in combat, to solve various puzzles, and to destroy obstacles blocking your path. It was a very simple concept, but as Valve showed with the Portal games, even the simplest concepts can be the most impressive. It definitely had more uses than many of the weapons in the original Half-Life did such as the Gluon Gun, the Hive-Hand, and the Snarks (even though I loved using those weapons).\n\nThe only other reason for why I prefer the original game over this one is that all the characters in this game (Alex Vance, Eli Vance, Barney Calhoun, Dr. Kleiner, Dr. Breen, etc.) are hardly in this game at all. Throughout the game, you're with these characters for very short periods of time before you're separated from them in, to be honest, very contrived ways only to have to fight through several long chapters to get back to them for more brief periods of time. After I finished this game (even chapters 1 and 2), I didn't feel like I was onscreen with all the characters in this game long enough for them to make any meaningful impacts on me. I liked how Gordon Freeman was the only main character in the original Half-Life, because, even though I don't think his character is as interesting as many other people do, I liked how this drove home the fact that he was the only one brave enough to attempt to get stuff done and escape the facility as everyone else was too afraid to do the difficult tasks which Gordon did (this also justified the G-Man's interest in Gordon as opposed to any of the other people in Black Mesa).\n\nIn conclusion, while I liked this game quite a bit, and while I had my moments with many of the levels and the various, unique gimmicks given to many of them, I feel like the few flaws I mentioned prevent it from topping Half-Life. Still, this is a very good game on its own, and I'd definitely recommend it.","timestamp_created":1531019544,"timestamp_updated":1531113589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43389504","author":{"steamid":"76561198322534340","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1624386267},"language":"english","review":"Truly as amazing as everyone describes, \"A must play.\"","timestamp_created":1531012908,"timestamp_updated":1531012908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43388603","author":{"steamid":"76561198335979846","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":5270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1895,"last_played":1655873056},"language":"english","review":"My childhood is this game. 10/10","timestamp_created":1531008913,"timestamp_updated":1599983864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43387817","author":{"steamid":"76561198354705926","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1451,"last_played":1618876936},"language":"english","review":"I like this anime a lot.

It looks very good for a 2004 anime, I'd say better than Fullmetal Alchemist which was released around that time. The fightscenes for the anime are bomb and the plot is amazing and on a much larger scope. I's say the 'plot' is bigger than the last series as well, although that's expected for an anime.
