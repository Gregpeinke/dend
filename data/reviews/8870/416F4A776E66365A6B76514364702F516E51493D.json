Now let's go to the review.[/u]\n\n[h1]I'll divide the review in 3 parts \n[list]\n    [*]The story\n    [*]The characters\n    [*]The gameplay & mechanics\n[/list][/h1]\n\n[hr]                                                                                                                                                                                            [/hr]\n\n[h1]Before I start the review l'd like to talk a bit about the \"Bioshock\" series.[/h1] Bioshock is a single-player FPS series. The 1st 2 installments were incredibly good, one of the best single-player games I've ever played. Continuing the legacy Bioshock Infinite gives a simillar experience as the previous versions but with a completely world, new environment & new characters. The 1st 2 games gave off a horror style, thriller & claustrophobic vibe but this one is the complete opposite. It's open, fresh & vibrant. When you 1st enter the game, just from the menu you'll understand what I'm trying to say.\n\n[hr]                                                                                                                                                                                            [/hr]\n\nThe [h1]characters[/h1] I won't say much about them as it may ruin your experience in exploring them on your own. Basically the whole game revolves around 3 characters i.e, our protagonist [b]Booker Dewitt[/b], the 'heroine' [b]Elizabeth[/b] & the 'villain' [b]Zachary Comstock[/b]. There are several more important characters like the [b]Mr&Mrs.Lutece[/b]. Dewitt is a man with a past which we will discover more about as we progress in the game. He is strong, stubborn, will go to any length for his mission & sometimes a bit too mean. Elizabeth is like a princess with mysterious power. She knows her things but is careful enough to not get overconfident. Comstock is like your usual villain, wants more power to rule over the world. Keeps his daughter in a tower to protect her from outside influences. You won't get to meet with him that much in the game but you will discover about his evil 'works' as the story progresses. Mr&Mrs.Lutece are a couple shrouded with mystery. You will meet them at random times in the game to help the story to progress. The enemies this time were different ( as the world this time was different ) but just on the surface levels. There were some side charcaters which help in the better understanding of the story & the world. \n[b]8.5/10[/b]\n\n[hr]                                                                                                                                                                                            [/hr]\n\nThe [h1]story[/h1] is I'd say the most wierdest part of the game. I loved it & didn't liked it at the same time. There were certain things if removed wouldn't make much of an impact but other than that I loved every part of the story. I'll again refrain from saying certain things so as to not give spoilers. The way the mysteries were handled, the flashbacks, the plot twists were just amazing. The story really helped in reaching a better understanding of the characters & the world itself. I'd even like to argue that story & characters are really intertwined with each other which in turn makes the game really feel alive & enjoyable.\n[b]8.5[/b]\n\n[hr]                                                                                                                                                                                            [/hr]\n\nThe [h1]gameplay & mechanics[/h1] is the place where you can say it's not much different from the previous Bioshock installments. Everything was pretty much the same but with just a different name. The powers & enemies were different from the outside but from the gameplay pov it was the same. It was good, really enjoyable as the controls felt much firmer & easy to use. There's the grappling hook that you can use to travel between certain areas ( tbh every now & then I'd get lost while using it but still the experience was enjoyable ). Elizabeth will help you out a lot in the game. She will use her lockpicking skills to open locked doors & lockers. I never felt I was short on lockpicks too so there's that. She will give you ammo & health while fighting & money while exploring regions. The graphics is a strong part of the game. Even after 7 years it looks really good, it really aged well. The vibrancy, the colour palette, the environment all gave a really [b]pleasurable playing experience[/b]. The art was kind of unique I'd say but definitely good. Overall gameplay & mechanics were good. \n[b]8.5/10[/b]\n\n[hr]                                                                                                                                                                                            [/hr]\n\nOverally I'd say that Bioshock Infinite is heck of a game that every Bioshock fan should play. For ones who have never played a Bioshock game I'd say the experience will be a okay~ish as you will miss out on important things that's related to the previous games. I still like the 1st Bioshock more than Infinite but that's just my personal opinion.\n\n[b]Rating - 8.5/10 REALLY REALLY

Сюжет занимателен, концовка  потрясает! Из минусов: тониками можно и не пользоватся (я сам пол игры пробежал исключительно с автоматом), враги не запяменаются и не вызывают эмоций (вспомните те ощущения когда видете первый раз большого папочку в первой части, и последующие встречи к бою с ним готовишся весь уровень) ну и в целом игра стала проще ( я играя на средней сложности умер 2 раза, против 10-12 того же bioshock 1 & 2).

Im a huge fan of the Bioshock series ever since it came out, and this game still surprises me since the Xbox 360 days. Infinite is rather different than the other two Bioshock games, but the story follows the same path, and the fighting is still the same, though you don't have 'infinite' pockets to hold your guns anymore, ironic. This is by far one of my favorite games, and my favorite in the Bioshock series. Something about the NPCs, the new Columbia characters, and Booker and Elizabeth's synergy is incredible, and a huge step forward in the Bioshock series.\nLike i said, the fighting is the same, but it doesn't mean that you have the same tools for the job too. The weapons feel less DIY with tons of weird upgrades, and more realistic, reminding you of old World War weapons and such, and the Plasmids (now Vigors) are so unique, with remakes of the classic ones like Incinerate and Devil's Kiss, and Insect Swarm and Murder of Crows.\nThe game is impecable, the story is great, the guns are fun to use and the plasmids, well, wreck everything, it is definitely worth buying.\n\nAnd if you're looking to buy Burial at Sea, do it, but after you fully understand the Bioshock lore, trust me, it hits hard like a truck, but it is worth for the different gameplay and scenery.\n\n11/10","timestamp_created":1598363542,"timestamp_updated":1598363542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522010564804077148","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74888493","author":{"steamid":"76561198176289482","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":322,"last_played":1598420875},"language":"russian","review":"ya gauy","timestamp_created":1598361867,"timestamp_updated":1598361867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74888434","author":{"steamid":"76561198122392573","num_games_owned":919,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":968,"last_played":1479406218},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock infinite is one the best game I've ever played before.
