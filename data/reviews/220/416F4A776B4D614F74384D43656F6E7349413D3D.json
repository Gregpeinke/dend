Well, if you've already played the first Half-LIfe, this is basically the same except a hundred times better in every field. More immersive story, new weapons, new minor and major characters, and HUUUGE graphic improvements with bugs and glitches few and far between. My only problem is that the lighting tends to glitch out at random intervals and requires you to restart the game to [i]maybe[/i] fix it.\nIf you haven't? Well, I guess you'll have to trust me that you're in for one hell of a story for this one. Even (mostly) during the cinematic parts, you still have minor control over the game. Practically everything else is left for you to do.\n\nThe story starts with Gordon Freeman, a Theoretical Physicist and former Black Mesa employee, newly arriving in a mysterious place called City Seventeen. Eventually after wandering around in the train station you meet an old friend Barney Calhoun, also a former Black Mesa Employee. Before you know it, you're running around in an apartment building being chased by the police.\nThe rest of the story is for you to experience.\n\nTrust me, this game is worth your ten bucks.","timestamp_created":1389411839,"timestamp_updated":1389411989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505978107452392578","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8655085","author":{"steamid":"76561198070412155","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":7313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1441,"last_played":1588812638},"language":"english","review":"The game maintains its value as a fun, functioning game even a decade after its release.

Вышли продолжения многих ожидаемых проектов. Среди таких и была Half-Life 2.\nНовый движок Source позволил воплотить разработчикам все идеи в данной игре. Графика была потясающей. Многие игровые издания отмечали очень реалистичную воду и физику всего в этом удивительном мире.\nИменно начиная с этой игры Valve начали активно продвигать сервис Steam. На диске с игрой присутствовала эта программа. И ставилась вместе халвой. У многих возникали с ней проблемы. Потому что обновления качались именно через стим, а в то время интернет у всех был слабенький.\nОзвучка. Оригинальная озвучка выполнена восхитительно, чего не скажешь о первоначальной русской. Сейчас ситуация более-менее исправилась.\nСюжет. После первой части, когда загадочный G-Man поместил Гордона в стазис, он его пробуждает и говорит, что время доктора пришло. Пробуждается доктор в поезде и видит последствия каскадного резонанса из первой игры - планета Земля захвачена неким Альянсом, каждый человек теперь имеет порядковый номер и служит как раб для инопланетян, работая в буквальном смысле за еду.

Удивительная и захватывающая дух атмосфера восточной Европы, знакомая и приятная архитектура. Пугающая атмосфера всеобщего угнетения и тоталитаризма. Постсоветский город, оккупированный комбайнами. К сожалению, большинство разработчиков покинуло valve, которые дали игре душу - Марк Лэйдлоу, Антонов, Бейли. Угнетающая музыка только больше добавляет эффект подавления. Проработанная физика и реалтаймовое освещение в 2004 заставляли людей раскрывать рты от изумления. Про сюжет, что-либо писать не буду, он прост, но в тоже время заставляет задуматься о некоторых вещях в реальной жизни, да, есть минусы в основном это несоответствие с 1 часть. В игре мало действующих героев, но каждый из них обладает харизмой, что заставляет запомнить этих героев надолго. Великолепная игра, но до идеала все равно не дотянула.

Half-Life 2. It's been long renowned as the definitive PC gaming experience, and not only does it meet the hype, it exceeds it. Still over 4 years old, Half-Life 2 holds its own as one of the greatest games of all time, seamlessly blending story, action, and emotion into an experience that I can nearly guarantee you won't find a trace of in modern games. Everything from the slick controls to the arsenal of individualistic weapons makes this game into the masterpiece it so very well is. The whole game is pefectly paced. Not only is it an amazing shooter, but there's so much more to be experienced. It is an inexplainable journey that every gamer who likes to shoot and beat foes with a crow bar should embarq upon.","timestamp_created":1389170732,"timestamp_updated":1389170732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8615323","author":{"steamid":"76561197987179758","num_games_owned":499,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":636,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":624,"last_played":1498805813},"language":"english","review":"Pourquoi jouer à ce jeu ?
