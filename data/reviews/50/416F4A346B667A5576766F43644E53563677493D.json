在基地里渡过了又一个枯燥而无聊的日子。在完结之际我很高兴，而我终于可以被分配一个任务。这里来了一个相当神秘的平民徘回在基地内。谣传他来自政府的部门，来这里吸纳雇员；别的说他与一些秘密的研究小组一起来。因为这个参与的机会我变得很兴奋。改变和冒险将会很棒。\n3月3日\n\n今天我终于见到了那个来自政府的人。我不肯定他是一个政府官员，但他穿着一套相当拘谨的衣服，还携带着一个公事包。在我看来他更像一个律师或是一个保验经纪。我注意到他打量着我。这天有好几次在训练的时候，我都发现他恰好观察着我。我很疑惑他到底想怎么样……\n\n9月9日 好几周以来，日复一日我们的训练都同样是小菜一碟。今天我们在早晨练跑集合时，我们的教练告诉我们有一周的时间去成为室内战斗的专家。本周我们所有的时间都会在模拟战斗场所中渡过。至今我知道这是一项专门的训练，而且正常是不会在基地中教授。我想知道的这是否用来测试我们的适应能力，或者测试我们是否已准备好去参与特殊任务？时间会证明一切……\n\n3月12日 自我们的室内战斗训练开始以来，谣言便已经满天飞。大部份我的战友都深信我们已准备好去参与任务。但对于这项任务的内容我们没有取得一致的意见。我到处都听到黑山研究基地这一个名字，但对于这个地方我一点资料都没有。谣言指有些高度机密的研究在那里进行。对我来说，这听来并不是很令人兴奋……\n\n3月15日 那项谣言已经得到确认。我们的训练是为了在一个叫做黑山基地的科研基地进行的任务而设。我唯一知道的是那个地方是被一些科学家用作某种新型的研究。我不能想像我们需要些什么。今天我们被告知我们要准备好，并设想它将在明天发生。我不知道“它”是什么，但整件事情有点奇怪。这令我感到不安，我希望它不要发生；那项任务看来没有任何潜在且令人兴奋的因素。我颇期待某些更有可能发生战斗的东西。","timestamp_created":1626025103,"timestamp_updated":1626025103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95550552","author":{"steamid":"76561199087673418","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":165,"last_played":1639702617},"language":"brazilian","review":"praticamente

It's great in the same way that it made the original amazing, it does not change the main gameplay tropes the main one follows nor does it improve anything. But it does add some new things like weapons and enemies.\nSo if you want some pros and cons then keep on reading, keep in mind almost all pros and cons remain the same so i won't go over them anymore.\n\nPros:\n+ The prologue isn't as drawn out, it recognizes that you probably already know how the Black Mesa facility looks like and what it is so they don't show that anymore.\n+ New weapons that were are fun to use and felt like they had some purpose. In total it adds 10 new weapons, it does also remove weapons but those get replaced by the new ones so to be honest that was perfectly fine to me.\n+ A lot of new enemy types.\n+ The last part of the game doesn't feel as annoying to play through. In the main game the last 20% was a slog to get through meanwhile in here it didn't feel annoying at all.\n+ Story is unique and it's really fun to watch the main plot through someone else's eyes .\n\nCons:\n- The same bugs/glitches that the main game suffered from are still here (mainly getting stuck in terrain and not closing properly).\n- Instead of the flashlight you get a nightvission wich is really ugly and gave me a mild headache at times.\n- When i closed the game and reopened it for later, my keybinds and mouse settings were reset.\n- Some of the new enemy types are bulletsponges.\n\nSummary:\nI'd recommend this game to everyone that liked the main game since you're also going to love this. Honestly for 4€ i don't think you can go wrong so it's priced perfectly. Could be a controversial thing to say but this might be one of the best spin off games ever made.\n\nRating:\n8.5/10","timestamp_created":1625936355,"timestamp_updated":1625936355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95482987","author":{"steamid":"76561198120734975","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":680,"last_played":1659020828},"language":"italian","review":"Uno dei migliori Half Life.
