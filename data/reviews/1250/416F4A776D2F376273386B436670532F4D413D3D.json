But why is it still so awesome?\n\n1. Simplistic gameplay: Originated from a UT mod, KF didnt relied on a fancy campaign, cutscenes and great story. It wanted to be a game about silly creatures and how you kill them and it does that really fine. Grabbing a weapon, looking for a good camping spot and waiting for the ZEDs...or just charging into them, screaming like an idiot.\nYou dont have abilitys, (real) classes or upgrades, you just choose a weapon type and a strategy and try to kill them all and stay alive. Maybe too simple for many people, but still a challenging good game concept.\n2. The game is hard: Not hard in \"you need a few trys or lower the difficulty\", its \"oh you just joined? Let me grab you by your balls and throw you around the room!\". Having beginner as the easiest difficulty, the next one \"normal\" is already bonecrushing for new players. You can easily see that on free weekends. A lobby spawns full of lvl 0 - 3, the game starts, they rush in and die, next round, repeat. Every weapon seems to be weak until you understand it, perks like the berserker, a suicide for beginners, is the ultimate cheat perk for experienced players. Beside the leveling, that truely increases your strengh, you really can tell the difference between a new guy and a veteran.\nYou have to understand the concept, understand the rules of the game and learn the tactics, to survive.\nIt is not about getting the most kills, its about being the last one standing. If you start to care for being the one with the most kills, go for the next higher difficulty\n3. A lot of different enemys: Having quite a lot of cannon fodder, every enemy, even the small ones have their purpose. The clots slow you down and block your escape routes, the reds slash you in the back, if you run like a fool, the crawlers are just like ninjas from hell (you have to experience the pain yourself) and the stalkers make demoltions blow up themselves.\nThe big ones seperate the newbs from the veterans. A lot of new guys die from the ZED with the chainsaw. Why? There is something in the brain of new players, that tells them, they are kings and can gun everything down, that moves. The scrake is maybe the first enemy, that teaches them, to rely on tactics and teammates. He will follow you slowly and swing his chainsaw, but still is no real danger, as long as you are not cornered. Still he kills a lot of newbis. Why? Because if he gets under 50% he will get mad as hell and will charge at you until one of you is dead. So, having a lot of hitpoints, he is the perfect deathtrap for players who arent used to tactics.\nEvery enemy is a custom thread and has to be countered with caution and thinking.\n4. The atmosphere: The levels, the lights, the weapons, the sounds, the ZEDs...everything feels \"right\" in this game. You feel threatend by the dark environment, satisfied by the gun sounds and not starting to talk about the hilarious ragdolls, combined with the slow motion effect. If you are fighting in a dark lab, it will feel like a dark lab. A old dusty building will look like an old dusty building. Every gun sound, the look of the gun recoil, every effect of this game feels so satisfying. Unlike many games, it makes you feel, that someone took effort to make it look that cool.\n5. The big community and events: Since 2009 there are still 1-4k people daily, events every year and always some new things added. The counter of guns and maps nearly doubled. With the coming release of KF2 it feels like KF is coming to an end, but still the last event was awesome (I think it was called \"End of the road\") and still a lot of people are playing it.\n\n\nThe cons: Still the game has some issues I never could look over:\n1. inferior game engine: Everything in this game is a wall. Jumping on a railing? Nope! Getting on that car? Also nope! At least I can jump on those crates...nope... This game has so many invisible walls, to block unfair camping spots, that sometimes you forget to have a crawling and jumping key. It is nothing like Half Life, where you would climb into every vent and on every roof. You will stay on the ground, no matter what. And if you find a good spot, the ZEDs will levitate over every obstacle and without harm falling down every height.\n2. Unlike other games no local hosting without port forwarding\n3. No worldwide leaderboard (stats are awesome!)\n4. AI going full retard (ever seen a epileptic gorefast charging at you with the movement of a drunken pedestrian? Moonwalking Scrakes?) Also sometimes very idiotic hitboxes\n5. Totally static gameplay: While in a lot of other horde shooter games your player and not your character skills deside for your victory, a commando WILL mostly loose against a fleshpound. Having a big skill gap between veterans and newbs, you still can tell, when a survivor group will die. No special moves can save you. In certain situations you WILL die. In other games like Space Marine and Dino Horde (especially Dino Horde) you can pull a shitload of evasive maneuvers, tricks and abilitys, to save even the darkest situation. A good Dino Horde player dies, when he makes a mistake. It will never have the situation of \"He ran out of ammo. Too many enemys. Wrong class\". These things can get you killed, but you can save yourself out of every situation. It just will be more difficult.\nIf a sharpshooter is the last survivor, he still can kill everything, no matter what. Also a medic or a berserker, but a commando or a demolition? Yeah, they also could pull of some tricks, but you can easily spot the moment, when they will be dead. A game, you can predict, is a game with too simple rules.\n\nI hope for better gameplay in Killing Floor 2 and will continue playing KF1 until the new game is released. You ask if you still should buy the first one? If you like a simple, classic, challenging, unforgiving action survival game? Buy it!","timestamp_created":1414866772,"timestamp_updated":1447021995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469798654317855835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12728559","author":{"steamid":"76561198088501571","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":178,"last_played":1468233201},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая альтернатива LFD2","timestamp_created":1414865377,"timestamp_updated":1414865377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12728086","author":{"steamid":"76561197993536580","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1414785509},"language":"french","review":"Ce jeu est une pure daube, aucun contenu, des arènes répétitives et aucun sentiment de défouraillage...\nLes hit-markers sont anecdotiques et on a l'impression de cracher des boulettes de papier sur un mur tellement c'est frustrant...\nFuyez ce jeu, c'est mou, c'est mal fait, c'est même pas oppréssant...\nFUYEZ PAUVRES FOUS !","timestamp_created":1414863592,"timestamp_updated":1414863592,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.279099792242050171","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12727157","author":{"steamid":"76561198066608597","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":146,"last_played":1603237463},"language":"english","review":"How does a floor kill one?","timestamp_created":1414860057,"timestamp_updated":1414860057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12726883","author":{"steamid":"76561198008313387","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1449329100},"language":"english","review":"Holy Crap this game is awesome!

There is still a fairly active community in this game, so you'll be able to enjoy it even if you pick it up so long after release.[/td]\n [/tr]\n [tr]\n  [td][b]Replayability[/b][/td]\n  [td][h1]7[/h1][/td]\n  [td]Killing Floor has plenty of maps to play through, with tons more added by the community. Having owned the game for several years now, I've found that I do keep coming back to this one to have a solid good time with friends. That being said, despite the plethora of maps you are given, Killing Floor can end up feeling very repetitive at times. All in all, you'll keep coming back to play Killing Floor, but it won't be every day or week.[/td]\n [/tr]\n [tr]\n  [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n  [td][h1]7.6/10[/h1][/td]\n  [td]Killing Floor is certainly one of the best zombie shooters out there, and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a solid FPS. If you're looking to capture the feeling of \"surviving,\" Killing Floor can do the trick for you for awhile. Eventually it boils down to be an FPS with the enemies skinned as Zombies. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you see this one on sale, pick it up. They are constantly updating it with fun new maps and reskinned enemies. It's not a purchase you will regret.[/td]\n [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[i]If you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7035284-The-Tipster/]The Tipster[/url]\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/The_Tipster]The Tipster[/url][/i]","timestamp_created":1414858832,"timestamp_updated":1415673576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":235,"votes_funny":14,"weighted_vote_score":"0.749403595924377441","comment_count":18,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12726517","author":{"steamid":"76561198151094744","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":449,"last_played":1593241763},"language":"english","review":"cant stop playing it","timestamp_created":1414857697,"timestamp_updated":1414857697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12725747","author":{"steamid":"76561197970500071","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":247,"last_played":1618624471},"language":"english","review":"In killing floor you fight limited waves of zombies to earn money and experience, and after each wave must visit the trader to refuel for the next wave.\n\nThis game is a little difficult to start with (coming from a L4D's background), but as you and your character gain experience at it, it will become easier. there's lots of weapons to choose from and categories of proficiencies to level up in different ways.\n\nthe default maps are very well done and most of them very big and detailed (but you dont have to use the whole map, you can stay in one place if that works for you).\n\nLOTS of fun in co-op, and glad it supports six players in co-op instead of just 4 (yey!) !!\n\nSO GLAD it supports local LAN play!!!!!!!!!! and you can configure map order, game style, etc easily.\n\ni dont like the in-game bullet time much and wish you could turn it off (although, it is a tiny bit helpful when you are impossibly surrounded, but that is not often enough to like it). it dirupts the flow of the game for all players.\n\nthere are a few small bugs in the game that are minorly annoying and end up being the death of me sometimes, but I wont go into those.\n\nFor the most part this game grew on me and I like it a LOT for now.
