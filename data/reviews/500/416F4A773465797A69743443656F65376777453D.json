It can also get really intense, especially the first few times, when you are suddenly swarmed by zombies or assaulted out of nowhere! A lot of fun :)\n\nIf I should mention one big problem with the game, it's that when you aren't playing 4 co-op, the AI that controls the remaining survivors are stupid as hell. It can stand in a room with zombies, but unless the zombies attack the survivors or the real players shoot at it, it will just ignore the zombies. The AI never picks up or use bombs or molotovcocktails. It never uses the machine guns. You can't really tactical plan with it. And it is even worse. I just lost an AI driven survivor because it stood in the middle of a fire and never moved out of it. Just kept getting revived and kept standing in the flames... No self-preservation. I mean, that's just lousy programming. It does in fact make single-player a whole lot more difficult because you can only expect limited backup and always have to go first into any situation. A better AI and an order-system, like in Star Wars Republic Commandos, would definitely improve the game-play for play modes for less than 4 players.","timestamp_created":1505063392,"timestamp_updated":1505217040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34862775","author":{"steamid":"76561198304714155","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":330,"last_played":1506493478},"language":"russian","review":"зомби. зомби. зомби. нет еще есть ведьмы. ну как сказать. бежишь до контрольной точки по пути ебашишь зомбей. прибежал, сохранился. беги до другой точки. и так всю игру. единственное что тут охуенно это когда бензопилой всех пилишь н.а.х.у.й что весь монитор в крови.","timestamp_created":1505052360,"timestamp_updated":1505052360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34861787","author":{"steamid":"76561198032734581","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":286,"last_played":1640386223},"language":"english","review":"Great game!

Great plots, good storylines.\n\nSeriously. Let me re-iterate LEGENDARY CLASSIC. If you don't play this game ever, here's a knife.

The complete lack of ANY communication for TEN YEARS is completly disgusting, It is disrepectful to the fans who supported valve for years. Its sad that valve doesnt even have the courtesy to tell their fans that half life is dead. It is clear that we will never get a satisfying ending to an amazing story. I personally am not interested in anything valve has released since Episode 2, and if the single player story driven masterpieces of recent years are anything to go by, its that valve only cares about its games as service titles, and not their narative driven campaigns. I am deeply upset that we will never get to explore the atmospheric and exciting universe of half life again. Valve prides themselves on their independance and flat workplace structure, but its clear there is a lack of focus. Valve, like too many companies in the video games industry, seem to be too blinded on following the money, they have left behind those that got them there in the first place...","timestamp_created":1504583301,"timestamp_updated":1504583301,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.387306451797485352","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34743166","author":{"steamid":"76561198222736384","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":842,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1646445577},"language":"english","review":"Amazingly fun game challenging Left 4 Dead 2. its simply less chaotic and stressful, with the AMAZING perk of ragdolls","timestamp_created":1504556267,"timestamp_updated":1504556267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34742005","author":{"steamid":"76561198338367840","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":232,"last_played":1482964550},"language":"english","review":":|","timestamp_created":1504552474,"timestamp_updated":1504552474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49773755669593811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34741182","author":{"steamid":"76561198143667714","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3300,"last_played":1508342293},"language":"english","review":"[Bill Death Scream]\n[Francis Death Scream]\n[Bill Death Scream]\n[Francis Death Scream]\nBill:HELP ME!

  上高中后，我偶尔会独自过去，一个人坐在屏幕前，开一杯喝的，默默地用手柄玩着一代，最后通关。我看看窗外，想起当年我们很多人坐在这里，聊着有的，没的，现在以及未来。\n   高考完后的暑假，我创建了steam账号，浏览商店时，无意间找到了这款游戏，惊喜间并果断地买了下来。下载，打开，我看着开场动画，仿佛又回到了多年前，一切历历在目。因为这款游戏，我认识了一位知心益友。我明白了友谊的难能可贵，我也非常后悔自己当年愚蠢的行为。可惜没有如果，一切都过去了，现在我想再去说一声对不起，却没有机会了。\n   廖一梅曾说过“每个人都很孤独。在我们的一生中，遇到爱，遇到性，都不稀罕，稀罕的是遇到了解。”（咳咳，其实遇到X还是很稀罕的，尤其是对我这种死肥宅来说）\n   还想说什么，却不知如何下笔，脑子乱糟糟的。\n
