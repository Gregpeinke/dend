I'm kinda a \"smart guy\". I like to solve lots of puzzles. Portal brings it to the next level with some physics puzzles, complete with hazards and multiplayer. the actual game is longer and more replay-able than the original game, Portal. This game is the ultimate puzzle. the game is a First person character game, so when you are in a room, you don't get all the information immediately, which adds another layer of depth and mystery. you can't just have all the info to solve a puzzle, you have to move around and observe to get all the puzzle pieces. Only THEN can you get all the pieces and solve the puzzle. We can't just forget about the portal gun either, its the prime puzzle solver. like I said before, You use the portal gun to solve physics puzzles as well as hazardous ones. it can be used to explore the room and find missing info. Overall, its not complicated unless you look at it hard enough. Its a good puzzle game, alone in single player. With the addition of multiplayer, its a better game. its more complex in it's ability to make more puzzles and keep the game interesting, like giving the multi player characters axel and P-body cosmetics for multiplayer play. Its very detailed. If you have money, you should buy it if your into puzzle games.","timestamp_created":1454804346,"timestamp_updated":1454804346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21011073","author":{"steamid":"76561198016896836","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1263,"last_played":1434752187},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de los juegos cooperativos mas divertidos y complicados que he jugado.

Wyższy poziom trudności, dłuższy czas rozgrywki i choć drugiej części brakuje prostoty i świeżości oryginału, to chyba żaden z fanów nie spodziewał się, że cokolwiek podobnego mogłoby się udać, choćby byli to nawet geniusze z Valve. Nowe elementy, jak różnokolorowe płyny, promienie ściągające czy laserowe mosty dały programistów ogromne pole do popisu, które skrzętnie wykorzystali. Nie wolno zapominać o prawdopodobnie najgenialniejszej obsadzie głosowej w historii branży gier.\n\nCzy P2 jest idealny? Oczywiście nie: na tle bardzo wysokiej jakości całości nieco odstaje środkowy akt, rozgrywający się w środowisku bardziej kojarzącym się z Half-Life 2 niż z uniwersum Portala. Nie zawsze egzamin zdaje również humor, wciskany niekiedy na siłę w praktycznie każdą kwestię dialogową, a baza, na której opiera się lwia część żartów, to dobrze znane z poprzednika kompletnie poważanie, w jakim Aperture Science ma bezpieczeństwo swoich królików doświadczalnych - formuła ta dość szybko zaczyna irytować. Podejrzewam, że gra zyskałaby na dynamizmie, gdyby z ostatecznej wersji usunięto około 20% dialogów.\n\nNie zmienia to faktu, że w tytuł obowiązkowo trzeba się zaopatrzyć, aczkolwiek tym, którzy nie mieli okazji zapoznać się z jedynką, radziłbym w pierwszej kolejności nadrobić zaległości (nie zajmie Wam to dużo czasu).\n\nPS: \"I am NOT a moron!\"","timestamp_created":1454761368,"timestamp_updated":1454761368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20994282","author":{"steamid":"76561198147598935","num_games_owned":316,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1104,"last_played":1655198128},"language":"english","review":"This is a game you simply must own and play at some point in time.

However Portal 2 is definitely above our regular expectations.\nJust on a side note, I've only done the story mode to this game however Multiplayer looks excellent from what I've seen.\n\nI got this game with the valve complete pack, It's probably one of the other games from the valve complete pack that is for everyone, It's a short game, Child freindly, User freindly and most importantly Enjoyable. You don't need to be good at it to complete the levels. If you really do get stuck there are so many people out there who own this game who can help you, Walkthroughs on the internet ect ect.\n\nThe controls are fine. I had a arse of a time getting used to going through portals and judging when I should Jump for certain things but this generally happens to me because I'm definitely a stratagey gamer. The only downside I can see to the controls is The zoom function really doesn't help on quite a few levels where you'd think you'd need it, This downside is INCREDIBLY small so don't even bother letting this deter you from buying the game.\n\nGraphics are spot on, They may not be from a blur trailer but they definitely give a nicer vibe than the origional portal did. They really make the characters like wheatley and Glados Pop out from the background and the standard black/white contrast from the first portal is still there. Sometimes the high contrast effect isn't that high and can prove difficult for certain people. But there isn't anything really wrong with that.\n\nIn general gameplay it's hard to hate Glados or Wheatley, Both attempt to kill you in this game and glados has been trying since the first portal. But wheatleys Idiocity really gives me the feel that he's harmless, and We'll be fine no matter what he does. Glados may be a little on the lack of sanity side. But In the end glados respects you. I mean how many games pull this off this well?\n\nTo conclude this rather rough review, I'd like to say I most definitely Reccomend this game and to anyone looking for a quick game that does have Mp Co/op and isn't too tricky. This is definitely for you. I rate this game 9.8/10, the only 0.2 being those extremely minor things that I would've liked to seen improved on, but hell it's hard to make a perfect game so good job to the team at Valve for making Portal 2 what it is today.\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1454712343,"timestamp_updated":1454712343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502679169178009033","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20979741","author":{"steamid":"76561198056039198","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1588768318},"language":"english","review":"SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE","timestamp_created":1454709819,"timestamp_updated":1454709819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20979399","author":{"steamid":"76561198108001888","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1609807189},"language":"english","review":"99/100.
