It's kinda like Left 4 Dead, but your team is made of 1-6 people with automatically adjusted enemy spawns, and takes place on a closed map where you defend certain locations when the enemies come, instead of running through levels to reach a goal. \n\nHas one of those leveling systems where you earn xp for doing class specific things and your level sticks to your account if that makes any sense. Don't start playing on Hard, even if you're good with shooters! You need to grind a level or two and learn how the game works or you'll just be in the way. \n\nFeatures lots of maps, genuinely different roles, satisfying guns, extremely tough enemies and a very high skill cap. Seriously, after 190 hours on the clock I'm godlike compared to beginners, but still in awe of what real veterans can do. The voice acting is weird at first, but you'll learn to love it.

Among the trials and tribulation brought by game and its given technological advances in the Unreal Engine, I will be truly delving into the pros and cons of what I personally have come to love as a game that I would recommend fit for any challenge seeking co-op fanatic.\n\nPROS -\n_servers running in some of the most remote parts of the world, giving ping balance to almost any friend you could partner up with given both internet connections are immaculate. Ping can also be a downside as well, which will be explained further along.\n_difficulty can range from anywhere from 'my 4 year old could beat this with his eyes closed' to painstaking microsecond turnarounds or death.\n_mod community not only in the sense of different game modes and firearms, but downloadable content to where you can put 'fakedplayers' into games and give yourself as a solo player on the hardest difficulty the challenge and healthspan of a 4+ player match, and thensome.\n_economy is very punishing on top of hard game, making some cases near impossible to recover and survive past wave 6 if your team can't compensate what weapons and $ you lost throwing your life to a clot sticking you in place.\n_Weld the doors you muppets! very interactable voice command prompt with all the british people.. and featuring robots and exclusive characters alike. DLC on another point.\n_IT RUNS! game can run fairly well on laptops at some 30 fps even on higher settings for even the trashiest of mobile laptop joints. but you'll still get frame spikes from a firebug with 1080's and all that.\n\nBETWEEN THIS AND THE KILLING FLOOR 2 - \n_The first game is without a doubt far more challenging to any given player than the second game. While the second game is without a doubt more polished and favored toward and given player who likes more casual co-op games, the steeper of a challenge ramp lies in Killing Floor 1 due to its sheer unpolished, mechanic based gameplay which can either be gruelingly slow in the case of kite players who run around the map killing clots with a flare revolver or a support specialist holding a corner with an aa12. Solo Hell on Earth is very possible in both games, but the first game proposes that you have to have good map knowledge and know where to hold or you will get overrun easily and killed if you do not know exactly what youre doing kiting and end up with a superspawn in your face bodyblocking. \n_Field Medic is especially different and frankly the elephant in the room that separates the games as their own. Field Medic in KF2 (Killing Floor 2 from here) is far more forgiving and easier going than the KF1 Field Medic. Not only are darts homing to the target in the second game, they give buffs to damage resistance and speed, making it easy to not only out tank a fleshpound, but outrun a raging one even! Field Medic in KF1 had no buffs to stats for medic darts, and half the time even with a heal sound the darts would refuse to register cause ya didn't hit the bloke right. In any case, you as a medic with your improved armor, are the prime source for taking fleshpound and scrake damage late into a KF1 Long game. KF1 fleshpounds will one shot you at 100% HP with no armor, but armor will only melt off and doesnt matter anyways in the second game because your medic tanks you through any threatening hits if hes even halfway good.\n_ARMOR. holy fuck ARMOR in KF1 is FAR MORE IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY than armor in KF2. as I said KF2 armor just melts off! KF1 armor has to be preserved on HoE (Hell on Earth) or you're quite literally one shot killed as anyone except a berserker from a fleshpound, not to mention the DPS coming to your face from surrounding gorefasts, husks, sirens, and you name the rest. \n_MECHANICS. the difference is huge ofcourse, but KF2's mechanics are so much more forgiving with stuns and speed versus damage taken to the face. Hitboxes are way more exact in the second game to where half the time map knowledge isn't really necessary if you're flooded with heals.\n\nTHE KILLING FLOOR 1 MECHANIC BOARD - \n_Hitboxes. hitboxes in this game as an unreal engine game are infinitely challenging and will never cease to turn something nonthreatening into a wave wipe. if you shoot a clot wrong youre mag dumping instead of 2 bullets max. There are a lot of satisfying hitboxes to memorize, from the headbox to nade splash damage and stackability in AoE. \n_Nades. grenades aren't necessarily used as much for damage as an ai pathing throw off. you can save the life of your teammates by throwing a grenade or two at their feet if theyre swarmed, as they will start to move away from the area of the nades as infinitely sentient ai.\n_Perks. knowing perk prices and being able to swap between them and drop for eachother as seperate classes saves the economy and the game frankly. do it for  your bros or something.\n\nDLC - \n_Guys... if you play the game and don't think DLC deserves it's own hybrid pro and con section... you don't play the game. iunno. some of the dlc is the game is included to cosmetic bandings such as characters and lovely weapons that are shiny and plated, while others single handedly define the meta floor and just how much DPS can be thrown out at one instance. Let's only take the Scythe and the Zed Gun Mk2 for example.\n_Scythe has the furthest melee range of all the other melee weapons and if you disagree you've never downloaded a testmap in your lifetime. \n_Zed Gun mk2 for a Medic of all players not only helps the true utility of the Field Medic, as the majority of the time you find use bodyblocking and tanking... but has an area of effect to where you could stun an assortment of scrakes and fleshpounds with two alternate fires and make it an absolete threat with a team that knows their works... granted a tight corner changes all this no matter what. Reload I dare you\n\nCONS - \n_New Players. the perk leveling in the game alone makes it almost impossible for even some well experienced game player to get into a given map and know exactly what to do survive every wave and the boss. This being frustrating for new players with slow leveling for their favorite perk, often times you'll come to find people do not want to play the game because the hardest difficulty costs too much with unleveled perks and it takes way too long to level in a leveling map even.\n_Community. Idk man I've been a part of the KF1 and KF2 community both for a minute and throughout both trial and tribulations I have not met many more elitists in any other community ever. KF2 is ridiculous but for veteran KF1 players, it really can be so obnoxious to get a new player next to you who wipes within 5 minutes cause theyre wandering and fucks you cause your class or you as a player cant handle 1 faked player. I myself am trying to SPREAD MAP KNOWLEDGE because 3/4 of the fun of playing the game REQUIRES you to know damn well exactly where to hold and what angles to peak without getting annihaliated by an aimbot husk fireball. That and this elitist span of people has sparked the exact opposite to rise in the community some, including doxers, ddosers, and plenty of internet piraters or whatever they may know to be or bring to someones house over a bodyblock.\n_Ping. some servers have horrible tickrate and really set up players for immediate failure, given that internet connection makes the game about an uncountable amount of times harder as headboxes will be placed different and rubber banding will pretty much give zeds extended reach on your tendons\n\n\nTHIS IS ALL THE REVIEW WOULD LET ME FIT so thanks for reading in. there's also mods to give you max perks so download those and learn pipebomb mechanics","timestamp_created":1338342358,"timestamp_updated":1647629729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5322603","author":{"steamid":"76561198047917612","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4724,"last_played":1424663961},"language":"english","review":"LOHDS OHF EMONEH!!!!!","timestamp_created":1338277494,"timestamp_updated":1338277494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2846512","author":{"steamid":"76561198013505806","num_games_owned":688,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":7811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5644,"last_played":1486571126},"language":"english","review":"Did you ever feel that when you shoot a zombie in the head, that it just doesn't EXPLODE into enough chunks?\n\nKilling Floor fixed that problem and threw in a nicely detailed brain to boot.\n\nEver wanted to shoot a zombie with a shotgun and have more than one limb fall off?\n\nKilling Floor takes off 2 for the price of 1.\n\nEver want a zombie game that doesn't kill your graphics or your wallet?\n\nKilling Floor is easy on graphics and Dosh, so you can have your fun and save loads of money.","timestamp_created":1338231934,"timestamp_updated":1338231934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6238048","author":{"steamid":"76561198061869848","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":12217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12162,"last_played":1489299479},"language":"english","review":"Even a few years later, Its still a great game to come back to.
