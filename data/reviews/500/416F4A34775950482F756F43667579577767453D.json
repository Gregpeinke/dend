Уровни отличаются друг от друга только картами. [spoiler] Единственный хороший уровень это жертвоприношение или как там его, он норм, потому что там добавлена новая механика. [/spoiler] А теперь перейдем к плюсам и минусам.\nПлюсы:\nРазнообразные оружия. В игре довольно много оружий с которых можно пострелять по зомбям, это довольно весело. Было бы весело если бы их не было так много.\nРазнообразные враги. Есть охотник, танк, толстяк, ведьма и курильщик. Правда появляются они в каждом уровне в один и тот же момент и совсем не удивляют, но так как их много я засчитаю это за плюс.\nБольше плюсов я, к сожалению, найти не смог. Теперь к минусам.\nОднотипность и отсутствие разнообразия. Каждый уровень - одно и тоже. Где разнообразие? \nДа, минусов конечно меньше чем плюсов, но этот один минус намного больше этих плюсов.

Режим режиссера выполнен достаточно неплохо, (по крайней мере, он лучше чем во второй части) стрельба приятная, атмосфера уютная, хоть и темно-мрачная.  Имеет ли смысл брать первую? Только если вы придирчивый к мелочам, как я, (но у меня обе игры куплены, потому что я додик.) из-за чего не желаете играть в кривую вторую часть. В остальном вторая лучше. За те же 250 рублей вы получаете набор из кампаний второй и первой части вместе, улучшенную графику, больше зомби, больше режимов и все в таком вот духе.  Если у вас есть друзья, можете опробовать. Без друзей сюда идти гибло, хотя бы в силу минусового онлайна и просто глуповатых игроков, большинство из которых - новички.(однако комьюнити в любом случае здесь лучше чем во второй лефте kekw) \n\nСравнивать вторую часть с первой особо смысла нет. От первой и второй вы получите равное удовольствие, если вы обычный игрок, однако копая глубже в второй части (Разные режимы, реализмы и т.д) вы непременно найдете кучу проблем, коих отродясь не было в первой.","timestamp_created":1559143635,"timestamp_updated":1642840899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586263895034790039","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50930291","author":{"steamid":"76561198445201401","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":22,"playtime_at_review":279,"last_played":1660261229},"language":"brazilian","review":"um clássico de zumbi, da pau em muitos hj em dia","timestamp_created":1559143092,"timestamp_updated":1559143092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50929816","author":{"steamid":"76561198836059111","num_games_owned":336,"num_reviews":372,"playtime_forever":205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1543379886},"language":"schinese","review":"看什么看，反正我去玩2代了","timestamp_created":1559141237,"timestamp_updated":1559141237,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.420000016689300537","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50922119","author":{"steamid":"76561198352181486","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1616056547},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game","timestamp_created":1559103641,"timestamp_updated":1559103641,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50920308","author":{"steamid":"76561198062188136","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":86,"last_played":1646186296},"language":"brazilian","review":"gostei do jogo, comecei faz poucos dias a jogar.","timestamp_created":1559093259,"timestamp_updated":1559093259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50920133","author":{"steamid":"76561198179677999","num_games_owned":335,"num_reviews":157,"playtime_forever":994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":994,"last_played":1559029081},"language":"english","review":"Pretty fun ig. \n\n5/10","timestamp_created":1559092357,"timestamp_updated":1559092357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52854311466217041","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50917523","author":{"steamid":"76561198842619104","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1641656475},"language":"english","review":"Pretty dope.
