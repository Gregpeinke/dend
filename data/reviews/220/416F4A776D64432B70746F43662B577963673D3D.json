2 is a blockbuster addition to the HL franchise which really propelled the series into modern gaming.

Much like the first game the plot is left open to interpretation and assumption due to a lack of lore material, which in my opinion leaves quite a hole in the general story. \n\nIn otherwords, the only downside to this game is that there is not more of it to immerse yourself in, which is a problem that can be fixed by the additional episodes 1 & 2.

It's a linear game but in my opinion it does it right.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe guns all feel really good and satisfying. Each gun has its strengths and its weaknesses so you'll be using pretty much all of them throughout the game. There's also the gravity gun but that's a different story. The game uses the engine's physics for combat, platforming and puzzles. What I really appreciated is that the game doesn't tell you what to do, and leaves you to figure out your way through the game on your own. This is not to say that it doesn't teach you the mechanics of the game, it just doesn't hold your hand at every step. The game is challenging enough, especially when it comes to some of the puzzles, however some of the enemy AI isn't always that smart rendering them fairly easy to fight.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nThe story is just above average, but the way it's delivered is superb. There are scripted events but no cutscenes, you're always in control which is more immersive. There are no story exposition moments and the story is not told directly, but rather shown and implied. The characters all feel real due to excellent voice acting and animations.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nWhile it is a 16 year old game at the time I'm writing this, some of the scenery makes that hard to believe. I would confidently say it still holds up very well today.

Świat, w którym równoległość wymiarów zostaje naruszona i zaczynają się one przecinać ze sobą i przenikać w dramatyczny sposób. W drugiej części gry gracz wkracza weń ponownie w osobie doktora Gordona Freemana, znowu dane mu jest sięgnąć wzrokiem poza barierę czasu i miejsca, i tak samo zmuszony zostaje odłożyć na półkę laboratoryjny fartuch, a do ręki wziąć broń. I walczyć o życie ze wszystkim, co się rusza albo i udaje, że się nie rusza. Absolutnie ze wszystkim, gdyż potwory, które autorzy Half-Life’a 2 zaczerpnęli z nie-wiadomo-których wymiarów przerastają bodaj wszystko, z czym mogliśmy się zmierzyć minionymi laty w przeróżnych grach. Nie stajemy jednak oko w oko z niczym przerażającym ani chociażby dziwacznym ot, tak, na wejściu. Half-Life 2, identycznie jak jego poprzednik, z wolna, precyzyjnie dawkuje graczowi i adrenalinę, i zachwyty. Tu nic się nie dzieje na siłę i nawet jeśli gracz nie posiada wielkiej swobody w poruszaniu się po smutnym a fascynującym świecie przyszłości, wydaje się, że naprawdę rozwój sytuacji zależy od jego poczynań.","timestamp_created":1487350886,"timestamp_updated":1487350886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55962759256362915","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29988447","author":{"steamid":"76561198244078362","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1575635687},"language":"schinese","review":"很不错","timestamp_created":1487350170,"timestamp_updated":1487350170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmdC+ptoCf+Wycg=="}
