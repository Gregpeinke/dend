Better puzzles, better environments, more storytelling, more game. I might maybe love GLaDOS now too. Lots more music that straight up bangs (faith plate I'm looking at you) and all around more cool stuff to look at and mess with. If you liked Portal you'll love Portal 2, and if you haven't played Portal, this is better in every way.\n\nThere is a ton of character in this game. Everywhere you visit feels real and detailed, taking a departure from that sterile test chamber feel that was 80% of Portal to get behind the curtain. Portal 2 uses that to its advantage. There is a ton of dialogue (maybe a little too much?), GLaDOS herself somehow got even better. I don't know what they did but she's more than the voice informing you of this next test.\n\nMoving on to the actual puzzles and stuff, there's a lot more of them, and new things to do, but there's a surprising amount of \"walk from here to there but you need portals once or twice\". It's a great opportunity to fit in some visuals, when you're not busy figuring out a puzzle, but sometimes I didn't even look around since I was busy trying to get to the next area. I got lost more than a few times, as in, I literally didn't know where to put my portal. The zoom feature is very nice but doesn't always make up for portal surfaces being teeny tiny. That and I just didn't see obvious stuff right away, which didn't always sting! Most of the tricky maneuvers you need come up again later on instead of being a one-time solution, so finally getting it stays satisfying instead of frustrating.\n\nI loved the parts where I was on my own, no exit sign, no Wheatley, no prompts to interact with the only thing in the room. Getting to do it on my own was probably the most fun part in this game. I wish more was like that, honestly, because that's what I feel like a Portal game should be all about. Unfortunately, even when you're all alone, the game doesn't give you any time to figure it out before putting a big pop-up that says \"USE [E] HERE\", which really breaks that \"hey look I'm doing it!\" feeling. If it's not that, it's Wheatley literally telling you what to do.\n\nSpeaking of, Wheatley wouldn't shut up AT ALL EVER. Literally everywhere he could talk to you he had two or three MINUTES of dialogue where he just kept going on and on, and in that style of dialogue that's all \"look at me I'm so witty and funny anyway here's exactly what you need to do and it's very obvious but I'm just making sure you know but maybe you're stupid so I just wanted to spell it out for you\" that I got very tired of very quickly. They kept GLaDOS mostly the same from Portal, where she would speak like she wasn't chasing a reaction with every word. I much prefer that kind of dialogue, and it's a shame such a major character had none of it.\n\nI haven't tried co-op yet, but I'm sure it's fun. I've played other co-op games so it doesn't really matter how good it is, since they're always fun with friends, but yeah. Just watch someone like Grayfruit play it.","timestamp_created":1641971176,"timestamp_updated":1641971176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107836484","author":{"steamid":"76561199065116910","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":754,"last_played":1643252856},"language":"spanish","review":"Portal 2 es simple y sencillamente uno de los mejores juegos de PC que he jugado, su simpatía, su variedad y sus puzzles lo hacen un titulo excepcional.","timestamp_created":1641966578,"timestamp_updated":1641966578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107836140","author":{"steamid":"76561199061166898","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":542,"last_played":1643806173},"language":"english","review":"good game,  make a sequel\n","timestamp_created":1641966029,"timestamp_updated":1641966029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107835772","author":{"steamid":"76561199179698913","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":578,"last_played":1642820963},"language":"russian","review":"Поставил портал сверху и вниз, теперь я обречен на скучную, тупую смерть, но меня спасла турелька, тем что убила меня.

Fly out other end. Wheeeeeeeeeeeee.\n\nActual review: It took me probably about 10 hours to finish the game. The levels range from very hard to very easy. The levels do not require much skill (no super fast reaction times required), but do require you to think (with portals).The last level, however, is time limited, but most levels and interactions are not time limited at all. This is not, however, the type of game that you play a few minutes at a time. It takes anywhere from 5 minutes to 1 hour to complete a level, and after you complete a level, you will want to do more. The story is very good (funny, interesting, unexpected). Also, since its an older game, it gets put on sale, and it'll (probably - not tested) run on integrated graphics just fine.","timestamp_created":1641939944,"timestamp_updated":1641939944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107819652","author":{"steamid":"76561198359537880","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":471,"last_played":1641939412},"language":"english","review":"holy shit what an experience! as someone who doesn't play puzzle games, i got my ass whooped but what an amazing game. valve please come back back to making some great shit like this instead of just putting new skins in CS:GO.","timestamp_created":1641939678,"timestamp_updated":1641939678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107819607","author":{"steamid":"76561199060210559","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1647010458},"language":"russian","review":"zxcvzxcvzxcv","timestamp_created":1641939624,"timestamp_updated":1641939624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107819124","author":{"steamid":"76561198388454630","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1658782025},"language":"english","review":"it good","timestamp_created":1641938935,"timestamp_updated":1641938935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107818078","author":{"steamid":"76561198045223940","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":5530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1859,"last_played":1648244796},"language":"dutch","review":"Why are you reading the reviews?
