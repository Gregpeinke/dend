Half-Life has a great way of making the filler moments, when you don't have any weapons or you're not blowing things away, feel almost as fun as the action. Although I do not like the convenient G-Man sequences, and how HL2 started in comparison to how HL1 ended, I think the overall mood is definitely defined.\n\nGameplay:\nPretty standard FPS, but feels so liquid and smooth on the Source engine. Can be fast-paced and millitant as well as slow-paced and camperish. It feels good, but what I did dislike is Valve showing off their physics capabilities. I do appreciate that it's pretty good, but it's not perfect enough yet for usage (too often did I get snagged by a unhinged door on the floor, or a piece of crate), but there were some fun physics puzzles.\n\nGraphics:\nConsidering the game is 11yrs old, it has aged beatifully. Runs way above 30 FPS on any of today's standard gaming rigs. Only once did I look at something and think: \"That looks like crap\". Environment, to lighting to particle effects are all really nice to look at, and I suspect it will still look beautiful in another 10yrs.\n\nMusic/Sound:\nSound effects are great and nostalgic (loading up HUV's armour from wall-mounts). The music is a weird nerd-electro mix, but fits weirdly well in what I imagine Gordon Freeman's persona to be.","timestamp_created":1452885952,"timestamp_updated":1452885952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20544649","author":{"steamid":"76561198219637589","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":772,"last_played":1587609127},"language":"spanish","review":"Subes escaleras con tu mentón.\n 10/10","timestamp_created":1452883381,"timestamp_updated":1452883381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20541197","author":{"steamid":"76561198011166342","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":612,"last_played":1514720646},"language":"english","review":"Never have i wanted a third game so bad. after playing through this and the episodes i feel withdrawls. 10/10 valve has never made a game to top this yet","timestamp_created":1452871045,"timestamp_updated":1452871045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20540892","author":{"steamid":"76561198015006339","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1155,"last_played":1464018456},"language":"french","review":"Sublime.","timestamp_created":1452869908,"timestamp_updated":1452869908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20539721","author":{"steamid":"76561198190072687","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52,"last_played":1457185197},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая, интересная и не требовательная (Для слабых пк) игра","timestamp_created":1452865373,"timestamp_updated":1452865373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20539518","author":{"steamid":"76561198148397208","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1490481557},"language":"english","review":"This game is sucks 10/10","timestamp_created":1452864596,"timestamp_updated":1452864596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458265155553817749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20538789","author":{"steamid":"76561198112505843","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1526,"last_played":1594735105},"language":"english","review":"yeet","timestamp_created":1452861140,"timestamp_updated":1547992464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20536734","author":{"steamid":"76561198170773617","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":491,"last_played":1622285014},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра.

И даже больше...\t[/h1]\n[b] Краткая информация и пересказ геймплея.\t[/b]\n\n[quote=NightGEN © ] Цитата: [b]\" Я к своему большому стыду не видел игры лучше чем эта.\t[/b]\t\"[/quote]\n\nОбъясню почему дело в том что были игры, и игры сейчас разные, но большинство так навязчивы и так утомляют сюжетом, что я даже и не знаю что уже лучше, сюжет или графика.\n\n[b] Вернёмся к самой игре...\t[/b]\n Основные игры сейчас выходят как посредники, то есть существует то что мы обычно называем: \"Каноничность\", но игр \"канон\" на самом деле не так уж много... Именно эта игры считается той самой что вызывает бурю восторга, восторжения у её фанато, да и просто у игроков которые в неё поиграли.\n\nОсновы сюжета не навязываются игроку, они дествительно проходятся с интересом, интерес вырабатывается в том что - вы, то есть Главный герой, полностью поддерживаете только одну сторону, но именно из за вас решается всё, вы так называемый \"Инициатор\" всего и вся в игре, но естественно не обошлось и без участия друзей, если бы не они, вы бы мало что сделали, хотя по сути этот герой может всё! :)\n\nТак что если вы решите купить эту игру (А если вы поклонник Экшена) то вы обязанны её пройти, иначе просто жить дальше не имеет смысла (Шучу). Но вот на самом деле моя оценка 10\\10 за все мои годы.","timestamp_created":1452793418,"timestamp_updated":1452793482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20525095","author":{"steamid":"76561198081638393","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":827,"last_played":1558918128},"language":"english","review":"I guess 2 Half-Lifes make a full one?","timestamp_created":1452791727,"timestamp_updated":1452791727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20524685","author":{"steamid":"76561198240012442","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1613739979},"language":"russian","review":"Очень понравилась.

The journey of our beloved doctor Freeman continues, and it's even more intense than in the first game. \n\nLook, maybe what I wrote above doesn't make much sence (or maybe it does), but what I'm trying to say is that Half-Life revolutionized FPS titles and this franchise is by far my favourite of all FPSs. If you haven't played Half-Life 2, I strongly suggest getting the first one and experience the story from the very begining yourselves. After Half-Life 2 come two episodes, which follow it's story even more. And after that... nothing. A simple cliffhanger. An episode which was meant to be released, never got released. And now, we're waiting for the full sequel, Half-Life 3. And slowly, we're losing hope of its release.\n\nWhat I'm TRULY trying to say is that, this is no ordinary game.
