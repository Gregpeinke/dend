I always heard good things about the first one, but never got around to it. Same  for this one. I heard it was amazing, but just didn't care about it. Then I  saw it on sale a while back, and thought to myself: \"everyone says it's such a good game, maybe I should try it.\" Man, am I glad I did. When it comes to FPS games, I never expect  much from the story. They're usually just quick campaigns put in to give players a weak experince when they want to take a break from multiplayer. Ah, multiplayer. After playing this game, I'm now sure that's why campaigns suck in games like CoD and BF. This game has no multiplayer, and honestly, I think it makes the game so much better than other shooters. Instead of a \"One-and-done\" story mode, you get a game that's actually worth another play. I don't want to spoil any of the story, because it's so good that people should experience it for themselves. All you need to know is it's a FPS with tight and responsive gunplay, a bit of magic thrown in (and it's actually usefull), beautiful graphics, and an amazing story.

The two-weaopn limit forces you to discard any good weapons you have once you're running out of ammo use whatever weapon happens to be nearby, even if it sucks.

It wraps up nicely (although this is a story you might need to play twice to understand), and offers a nice amount of replayability, so it's definitely worth the price.","timestamp_created":1425899983,"timestamp_updated":1425899983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14806382","author":{"steamid":"76561198111397381","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2235,"last_played":1420082967},"language":"brazilian","review":"Ótimo jogo, muito boa a história e segue a mesma dedicação dos desenvolvedores ao se atentarem o desenrolar da historia com base nos dois primeiros títulos, mas com uma temática totalmente diferente aos anteriores, mas com muitas surpresas e revelações no final que o torna um jogo muito interessante. \nPara aqueles que jogaram bioshock 1 e 2, recomendo dar uma chance para este jogo, apesar de mudar a temática e a ambientação, ainda assim ira te surpreender no final.\n","timestamp_created":1425895956,"timestamp_updated":1425895956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14805666","author":{"steamid":"76561198037703481","num_games_owned":511,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":703,"last_played":1548668999},"language":"english","review":"If you're a bioshock fan looking for another bioshock game don't bother. They made some choices to gameplay that really make it feel less like a bioshock game and more like a call of duty game. The story is uninteresting and tries to hard to have a big shock towards the end. The enemies are boring and generic. The entire time it tries to shock you by having the game levels thick with old timey racism. We get it, America was racist and not all hunkey dory.\n\nHaving only two weapons available to you at a time really makes it feel like a waste upgrading them. Upgrading them is boring and doesnt make the weapon feel better like it did in the other games. Powers in this game are instead bought with money instead of adam, and are very uninteresting. I played the whole game never using them because they felt so tacky and pointless. Money in this game isnt scarce but you're better off saving it for your 50th bottle of salts and ammo for the one weapon you really liked but dont want to throw it away because you can't find enough ammo for it.\n\nIt's a pretty game and the gameplay is okay I guess. I'd probably like it if it wasnt meant to be a bioshock game honestly. Extremley over rated. I was severly disapointed with this game.\n\nIf you're looking for a generic fps this is pretty good.

Идея города в небесах выглядит еще менее правдоподобной, чем идея города на океанском дне, но в этот заоблачный «диснейленд» веришь практически сразу и безоговорочно.

Небольшой «магический» арсенал позволяет весьма зрелищно оглушать противников, очаровывать их или тупо поджигать; помимо прямого применения есть вариант создания ловушки. «Волшебная» одежда — местный аналог тоников — дает разные пассивные бонусы вроде короткой неуязвимости при пополнении здоровья или, скажем, шанса поджечь врага рукопашной атакой.[/h1]\n\n[h1]В каждой локации залипаешь на несколько минут — не только потому, что есть шанс найти какие-нибудь ценные ресурсы, но и потому, что это такое продуманное пространство, полное бытовых деталей.

O jogo tem uma duração de aproximadamente 9-12 horas de jogo (terminei com 10.6). Como todos os jogos da franquia, Bioshock Infinite é um First Person Shooter com alguns elementos de RPG, uma das coisas que eu mais gostei foi de Elizabeth com sua incrivel Inteligencia Artificial, durante as batalhas quando você está quase morrendo, ela joga pacotes de vida e sais (usados nas \"magias\") e também joga munições, já fora da batalha ela encontra moedas encondidas e lockpicks (gazúas) que vão te ajudar a abrir cofres e portas. A unica coisa que eu não gostei, foi os controles, como todo o jogo da franquia, o botão de mirar é o \"T\" ou o Scroll do Mouse, e o botão que usa as \"magias\" é o botão direito do mouse, mas isso você pode mudar nas configurações dos controles. Enfim, Bioshock Infinite é um jogo excelente, com gráficos lindíssimos, dublagens (em inglês) perfeitas e não é à toa que ganhou mais de 85 pré-lançamento na exibição da E3 de 2011 e uma nota de [url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bioshock-infinite] 94/100 da Metacritic[/url].

It is a hectic first person shooter where the meat of the game is walking into several heavily signposted \"combat arenas\" and activating a high alert state that sees loads of enemies rushing you. It is assumed that you find the stress of these situations fun, so they added subsystems such as the skyrail and dimensional rifts to give you more options when you go into the middle of things. \n\nThe biggest issue with the game is that there is too little incentive to \"go into the middle of things\" if you are not naturally inclined to play the game like that. A large subset of players (myself included) found the arenas stressful and attempted to cheese them with long distance shooting. Obviously, enabling aiming down sights was a misstep. The speed of the combat encounters should probably have been slower, to allow for more strategic thinking about how to apply the special abilities.

They actually implemented one idea of how to force people out of cover, by dropping the almost invulnerable killer robots (Handymen) that chase you five or so times during the game, but it did not seem like the game prepared you enough for these encounters.

Columbia is the opposite of Rapture in more ways than location, because compared to the sometimes depressing and dark setting that is Rapture, Columbia has a bright, full of life, paradise sort of feel to it. And it's just wonderful to look at.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to previous Bioshock games at it's core, but there are some changes in terms of Weapons and a few minor added gameplay mechanics. But overall the game will make you feel at home overall if you've played any other Bioshock games, just be prepared for a couple of different small changes, mostly in terms of weapons, such as the inability to carry all of your weapons at once. Salts also replace Plasmids, but are again pretty similar in terms of gameplay mechanics. \n\nTrust me when I say however that you will love this game, without spoiling anything.

With Infinite the game holds your hand from the beginning to the end to lead you through the linear path that was already placed (by design).","timestamp_created":1425668717,"timestamp_updated":1425668717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487202316522598267","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14762331","author":{"steamid":"76561198016636964","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1115,"last_played":1424815099},"language":"english","review":"Just amazing,","timestamp_created":1425666100,"timestamp_updated":1425666100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14761822","author":{"steamid":"76561198135386409","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":604,"last_played":1523121995},"language":"italian","review":"Gioco, a mio parere, di una bellezza infinita.
