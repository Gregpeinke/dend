Perfect. Captivating. Amazing. Brilliant. Awesome. Fantastic. 10/10.\n\nWords cannot begin to express the sheer power of how great this game is.

The weapons are great fun and half the time you'll find yourself struggling to decide which two guns to carry with you, you'll also be looting the hell out of everywhere you pass looking for money, lockpicks, and secrets! If you don't explore carefully - you could miss something important! \n\nThe game plays out with a satisfying mixture of gameplay and immersive cutscenes that don't bore you to death or drone on for ages. It plays nicely because it's not a constant gunfight, and even if it is in some places, guns are not the only thing to your disposal, you can yield an arsenal of dangerously exciting powers otherwise known as Vigors which grant you supernatural abilities to summon molten fire balls from, electrical shards, or even absorb and throw your enemies bullets back all from your very hands!\n\nA plethora of weaponry and Vigors will keep you fighting through this game and it's many villians such as the guards and police of Columbia to the Handyman, to the Mechanical Patriots that will tear you down with a devestating Crank Gun (OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A MINIGUN!)\n\nThis game has such a captivating storyline and will keep players going for a while, it's not a game you can or should rush through so hastefully, and careful decisions of Elizabeths Tear powers, weapon and vigor upgrades and how you dismiss your foes are entirely down to you and how you wish to experience your time in the majestic world of Columbia!\n\nA must own and play through game!

However, I played it through the main story without extra content in under 12 hours on medium setting. As a fan of the previous titles I can just say it ties in perfectly. The floating city scenario and the the ability to hook on to skyrails for transport within the maps are great and makes fore a more diverse combat than in regular fps games.  It is a fps game - theres not much character customization, you have your guns and your \"spells\" and there's not much you can do to enhanse them but boosting dmg and reload times. A final tip - If you like me, are an experianced fps player I would reccomend not to choose \"Medium\", it's more like \"Easy\". If you can get this game on the cheap it's worth every penny and will  keep you set for a weeknds worth of gameplay at least.","timestamp_created":1395567848,"timestamp_updated":1395567848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9604739","author":{"steamid":"76561197988451944","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":601,"last_played":1397752287},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1395567303,"timestamp_updated":1395567303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9604649","author":{"steamid":"76561198042539375","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":131,"playtime_forever":439,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3,"last_played":1613796834},"language":"french","review":"Tres cool !!!","timestamp_created":1395566606,"timestamp_updated":1395566606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9604631","author":{"steamid":"76561198053050402","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1397155097},"language":"english","review":"Awesome!! :)","timestamp_created":1395566490,"timestamp_updated":1395566490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495175212621688843","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9604619","author":{"steamid":"76561198097549330","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":724,"last_played":1395564841},"language":"english","review":"This game is freakin crazy, it feels like a classic bioshock game but with nifty perks and a new scene.

An awesome successor to the original BioShock. It's not as much of a sequel though. Not saying BioShock 2 wasn't good, and BioShock was amazing, but this game.... It's surpassed my expectations immensly. It plays the same, with the same feel of gameplay. They incorperate Vigors, like the original Plasmid, very well into the game. Columbia and Rapture also have the same-ish creation story, too. Except.... Rapture was 'No Gods, No Kings, Only Man', whereas Columbia was created when an angel came down from heaven and told Comstock to create Columbia (so it's 100% religious). Although there is no 'Little Sister' type character, it does feel good to not have 2 or 3 Big Daddies per section. When you actually get to Columbia, via a rocket in a lighthouse (go figure), it isn't in ruins. It feels good to see that it doesnt start like the other games. It really seems like the polar opposite of Rapture. Not in ruins, and in the sky. It does take place in 1912, yet it still gives the feeling of modern times, given the fact that both cities (Rapture and Columbia), are ahead of their time by at least 20 or 30 years. They do a good job with the light, sort of peaceful atmosphere that Columbia produces. It is very different from Rapture, yet the game still feels like the first and second BioShock. With new weapons, and different types of power-ups (Plasmids and Vigors), this game is excellent. So, get out of the dreary, gloomy, splicer ridden city of Rapture, and move to the happy, safe, splicer free (there is no splicer like enemies either, huh), floating city of Columbia!","timestamp_created":1395561470,"timestamp_updated":1395561470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505747139453887939","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9603985","author":{"steamid":"76561198075428939","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":426,"last_played":1536118814},"language":"english","review":"Rich in story, great graphics, everything a gamer wants.","timestamp_created":1395560985,"timestamp_updated":1395560985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9603893","author":{"steamid":"76561198027977324","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":5901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1597,"last_played":1576306422},"language":"koreana","review":"Good!","timestamp_created":1395560154,"timestamp_updated":1395560154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9603819","author":{"steamid":"76561197967456348","num_games_owned":461,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1772,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":830,"last_played":1468696781},"language":"english","review":"A solid well made shooter.","timestamp_created":1395559396,"timestamp_updated":1395559396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9603730","author":{"steamid":"76561198086923143","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72,"last_played":1525175396},"language":"english","review":"An excellent game!

The stark contrasts of beautiful scenery mixed with shocking violence, grief tinged narratives, and perfectly melancholy music mixed with conclusions you never see coming are only a fraction of what make Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite so remarkable (I don't know if Bioshock 2 counts). Odds are, if you're looking at this game, you already know something about Bioshock or have already played a Bioshock game, and I won't bother repeating what thousands of other people have already said. \n\nAs far as the world goes, I think the original Bioshock was far better. There was much more of a feel of a otherworldy, but somehow still oddly believable, fallen utopian feel to the world of Rapture that I don't think Columbia ever achieves, as beautiful as it is. Also, the actual developing storyline and villians of the original Bioshock definitely trump Inifinite. \n\nBut where Inifinite soars is through it's characters. This is perhaps the first game I've ever played where I honestly could have completely hated the gameplay and still adored this game (and the gameplay is still great, don't worry). The way that Inifite pulls you in, without the starting and stopping and jolting nature of cutscenes or in your face narratives is amazing. You find yourself in the characters, with them in a way that I can't compare to another game, and before you know it, you're pulled in, you feel like you're part of them. I'm sure that many people have remarked about the story, or the ending, etc, but the reason that those things will affect you so much is because of who's eyes you see it through. The intensity and depth of the 2 main characters and the way you get to experience their journey through this game has left me with a hole after I finished this game that I don't think any other game can fill. \n\nSo I'll just join the club and say get the game. Enjoy the game, but fall in love the the story and the people in it. Because I get a sneaking suspicion that was the real goal in the first place.","timestamp_created":1395554721,"timestamp_updated":1395554721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46961328387260437","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9603178","author":{"steamid":"76561198045603581","num_games_owned":535,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":1455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1311,"last_played":1437881199},"language":"english","review":"If you like shooting things, if you like crazy powers, if you like an actually useful video game companion, and if you'd like a story that makes your brain instinctively go OMGWTFBBQ then you should probably get this game already.","timestamp_created":1395553778,"timestamp_updated":1395553778,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586390316486358643","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9603109","author":{"steamid":"76561198037787485","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":952,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":866,"last_played":1498950106},"language":"english","review":"Epic story!!!!

Wow.  Just wow!\nIt lives up to the Bioshock name better than Bioshock 2 ever did.\nThe only qualm I have is that the plasmids (or vigours, as they're called in this game) don't seem as necessary to the gameplay as they were in the original. It feels more like a traditional shooter than the previous entries in the franchise.\nNot that that takes away from the game in the slightest.  I was gripped from the intro until the very end, and I have to say that this is a brilliant entry into the series.  I'll find it hard to go back to Rapture after experiencing Columbia.  And that is definitely not a light thing to say.\nBrilliant game. 9.5 out of 10.
