Gra zostala osadzona w realiach II wojny światowej, na froncie zachodnim. W grze jesteśmy zółnierzem Armi USA albo Państw Osi (Wehrmacht) i postacie są podzielone na klasy takie jak: Strzelec, Szturmowiec, Żołnierz wsparcia, Operator KM, Rakietowiec i Snajper. \n\nStrzelec jest uzbrojony w M1 Garand\\Kar 98, pistolet - colt m1911\\ Walter P38, w nóż\\saperka i posiada nasadkowy granatnik. W M1 Garand i w Kar 98 mamy opjce spojrzenia przez muszkę i szczęrbinkę oraz zaczepienia nasadkowego granatnika. Szturmowiec posiada Thompsona (Tommygun)\\MP 40, pistolet, w nóż/saperka, w granat odłamkomy\\trzonkowy i w granat dymny. w Thompsonie i w MP 40 mamy opcje uderzania ręką. Żołnierz wsparcia posiada BAR\\STG 44, pistolet, nóż\\saperka i 2-3 granaty odłamkowe\\trzonkowe. W BAR i w STG 44 mamy opcję ustawienia strzału pojedynczego lub na automatyczny. Snajper posiada springfield\\Kar 98 z lunetą, pistolet, nóż\\saperka. Operator KM posiada karabin maszynowy 30cal\\Mg 42, pistolet, nóz\\saperka. Rakietowiec posiada Bazookę\\Panzerschreck, M1 carbine\\Mauser C96, nóż\\saperka. \n\nGra działa na silniku Source, więc grafika nadal jest dobra, fizyka jest epicka, zabawne ragdolle (tzw. szmaty), ładna woda. Mapy zostały bardzo dobrze zaprojektowane, są duże, a niektóre są ogromne. Bronie wyglądają bardzo ładnie. Dźwięki broni brzmią bardzo dobrze. Postacie wyglądają dobrze i mają dobrze odzworowane mundury. \n\nW grze mamy takie tryby gry jak: Przejęcie flag, podkładanie bomby (Niemcy atakują, Amerykanie bronią) i jest tryb, w którym Amerykanie i Niemcy podkładają ładunki wybuchowe. Co do graczy, w grze spotkamy dużo niemieckich klanów, gracze gadają ze sobą, śmieją się i naprawdę fajnie się ich słucha. Więc w tej grze szybko nauczymy się j. niemieckiego :) . Gra na pewno wymarła, są serwery, na których jest dużo graczy, ale dużo serwerów stoi pustych. Obecnie w grę gram z dwoma znajomymi i świetnie się bawimy.\n\nCo do minusów to na pewno brak kampanii dla jednego gracza, gdyby ta gra miałaby ten tryb to tą grę każdy zna.\nPodsumowując gra jest wyśmienita, jest WEDŁUG MNIE lepsza od CS'a. Jest to gra dla tych którzy lubią gry o tematyce II wojny światowej. Bardzo polecam tą grę.\nGrafika - 8.5\nGrywalność - 8\nDźwięk - 10\nOcena ogólna - 9","timestamp_created":1434300568,"timestamp_updated":1511384560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":81,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.813279211521148682","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16393086","author":{"steamid":"76561198097269360","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":581,"last_played":1657515465},"language":"english","review":"iz gud","timestamp_created":1434300447,"timestamp_updated":1434300447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16391232","author":{"steamid":"76561198089522614","num_games_owned":717,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":25774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9345,"last_played":1584313776},"language":"english","review":"world at war .","timestamp_created":1434296350,"timestamp_updated":1502738312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.599361956119537354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16391199","author":{"steamid":"76561198075861421","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":73,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73,"last_played":1434295801},"language":"russian","review":"ТРЕШААААААААААААААААААААААК!!!!11111111111111\n░░░░░░░░░░░█████████████\n░░░░░░░░░███░███░░░░░░██\n███░░░░░██░░░░██░██████████\n████████░░░░░░████░░░░░░░██\n████░░░░░░░░░░██░░██████████\n████░░░░░░░░░░░███░░░░░░░░░██\n████░░░░░░░░░░░██░░██████████\n████░░░░░░░░░░░░████░░░░░░░░█\n████░░░░░░░░░░░░░███░░████░░█\n█████████░░░░░░░░░░████░░░░░█\n███░░░░░██░░░░░░░░░░░░░█████\n░░░░░░░░░███░░░░░░░██████\n░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░░░██\n░░░░░░░░░░░░███░░░░░██\n░░░░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░██\n░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░███░░░██\n░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░█\n░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░░█\n░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░██░██\n░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░███","timestamp_created":1434296273,"timestamp_updated":1434306855,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.44774019718170166","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16390356","author":{"steamid":"76561198081637270","num_games_owned":483,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1497451791},"language":"english","review":"Nazi Shovel ......

This game has a heeping helping of class based units on either the Allies (American Army) or the Axis (Nazi Germany's Army). Each unit has a very specific loadout. I enjoy shooting granades with my M1 Grand as a rifleman for Allies. However, equally fun is heaving around a panzshrek on my back while toting my favorite pistol the \"Broom Handle\" (aka the Mauser) as a German. Either way, multiplayer is every bit as fun as you can imagine for a WWII First Person Shooter (FPS). \n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks. Unlike Counter Strike: Source where if you feel more like a relaxed game of practice with some AI bots (computer controlled enemies/teammates) this game does not offer such a thing at all. No bots at all actually! Which is a huge let down when it comes to how many times gamers like to chill after a tough fight, especially if a sniper dominates, yet they still want to play too. A more relaxed offline game with bots often times left me with a built up enough confidence to get back into the fight with human players so I can give my best again. \n\nAlso, the clunky controls for aiming and moving are a little lackluster. Some weapons do not even let you aim down the sights. This is a disappointment too. The game does compensate for such things, like the soldier carrying a Thompson may only fire from the hip, but he carries a pistol, one frag grenade, and one smoke/flash grenade. Each unit actually has there own loadout which in of itself may prove unique not only among their teammates but even between both armies. This does help keep things fresh and provides each character with more of their own advantages. \n\nMachine gunners and snipers seem to be the heaviest of hitters as they both rack up a lot of kills. Though a very skilled marksman in this game with a sniper rifle is the deadliest opponent yet! Rifles are ok and allow aiming down the sights. While smgs are strictly hip fire these pack a wholop at close range, which make them ideal for clearing a room but not good across open space. Bazookas are Bazookas. No shotguns can be found, but they are hardly missed. \n\nThe matches are usually about capturing positions. Whichever team controls all the flag posts wins. Pretty straight forward and fun. Should you spend $9.99 on it? Well honestly if you have no problem with only playing online with people, love FPS games, and love the era of WWII then this is the game for you. If you do not fit into any of those, do not buy this game. \n\nMy opinion is: It is worth checking out, but I would recommend waiting for a Valve publishers sale because it offers little in terms of offline (because no computer opponents/teammates to play with). If that is not a problem, then buy it today. \n\nOverall verdict: 8/10 [Cons: -Clunky controls -No offline (bots not included); Pros: -Good FPS -Brings CS:Source to WWII era -High Replay Value for FPS and/or WWII era fans]","timestamp_created":1431619977,"timestamp_updated":1431619977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15825315","author":{"steamid":"76561198149883319","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2551,"last_played":1639682476},"language":"dutch","review":"awsome game, \nreally nice to play,\nand realistic, in some kind of form.\nbut somethimes frustrating","timestamp_created":1431613534,"timestamp_updated":1431613534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15818426","author":{"steamid":"76561198114456281","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":581,"last_played":1622898043},"language":"english","review":"for fans of WW2 games","timestamp_created":1431561579,"timestamp_updated":1431561579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15808960","author":{"steamid":"76561197960383241","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":7398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7398,"last_played":1428878570},"language":"english","review":"Recommend this game fully, great for a bit of fun with friends.","timestamp_created":1431500102,"timestamp_updated":1431500102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15807164","author":{"steamid":"76561198003685575","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":224,"last_played":1604287798},"language":"english","review":"Fun game, brings back memories!","timestamp_created":1431482723,"timestamp_updated":1431482723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15803431","author":{"steamid":"76561198105458457","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1565770877},"language":"english","review":"A Great WW2 Shooter I have been Searching for a long time\n","timestamp_created":1431457578,"timestamp_updated":1431457578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497287511825561523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15802906","author":{"steamid":"76561198024908605","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":13612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13612,"last_played":1431593554},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Все що я скажу, час проведений в грі говорить сам за себе(226 годин)...

I do like the alt-fire modes on many of the weapons, and the weapons feel nice and punchy like I remember, but compared to some more modern trappings, if you're looking for more realistic weapon behaviour and functionality like in Red Orchestra you may be left wanting. \n\nUltimately, it's still a fun nostalgic romp from a time where you'd be surprised at what you remember if you used to be a player, but you'll also be reminded why a lot of modern FPS innovations are taken for granted these days.

The lack of an official server makes it hard to find a good server, but depending on the way you play, you can find a server fitting to your needs at almost every hour.  The graphics are ok, nothing special but nothing bad either. The class system can vary on different servers, but a lot if times certain classes have only a small amount of players being able to play them. The gameplay varies significantly between classes, for instance the rifle and sniper classes are more for long rang combat (which is not common in the urban style maps the game features, but can sometimes be found in alley ways for instance the \"tank alley\") while the Assualt and support classes offer a more action packed hand to hand combat expeirnce type of gameplay. All in all the game is good, featuring ok gameplay and a nice diversity of gameplay in between classes, do yourself a favor and get this game if you want to have a good WW2 multiplayer game.","timestamp_created":1430793745,"timestamp_updated":1450224285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15663006","author":{"steamid":"76561197999298643","num_games_owned":726,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":3463,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1902,"last_played":1505340358},"language":"english","review":"You know what I realized?\nThis game does reward you for playing, not just for playing well.
