If you've driven Karts before you get a good sense of feeling the limits and every lap can be rewarding from the moment you play. When you come off the throttle or hard accelerate through corners there is some weighty feel to the Karts and the force feedback has been done well without being overwhelming like others. The karts just feel right (unlike the Karts in Automobilista where I felt like you're on a bed of springs under power and braking and then a Jet Ski on water when lifting off, horrible in comparison)\n\nFor me it's worth every penny as I've always missed Karting from my younger days and have never had enough money to start again. The feeling came straight back. I purchased a T150 wheel and Playseat Challenge on a budget and I'm using an old 720P projector so sacrificing graphic quality for the big screen experience, but I wouldn't have been disappointed if I'd paid for more expensive kit. (To hire a 2-stroke Kart you're looking at 100-200 euros per hour!)\n\nUnfortunately there is no AI to race (yet?) there are some online servers where you need to be lucky to find others at the same time. It does have your fastest laps in a Ghost Kart which is an excellent trainer and you will keep improving. \nIf you're serious about wanting to experience the buzz of 2-stroke Karting (where F1 drivers learnt and still use to train in the winter)  then buy this and encourage your friends to get it too.\n\nIf you go to the developer's forum you can find organised online race events with people who seem friendly and helpful who are racing for the buzz of Karting not their egos. There are also links to download extra tracks like Kimbolton in the UK where they hold the Super One finals and Formula TKM festival. \nHaving the three Genk Belgium tracks as standard is a great coup as this has been one of the best Karting facilities in Europe. The small Genk hire Kart circuit encourages so much race craft you'll also see seasoned racers there in real life honing their skills (and probably on this software too). \nMy only wish is for the developers to add the slower and heavier Sodi Kart 390cc 4-stroke to help train the rest of the family as even the Mini  2-stroke Karts are manic!\n\nUPDATE: They have now added a 4-stroke Kart!  A fast one, but still gives the correct feel and sound for people going to hire art
