It was pleasantly surprising how solid the story particularly ended up being, despite developing as the game was being developed, granted I realise the original Portal, didn't have nearly as much in terms of story, outside of GLaDOS' characterisation or the world building, but this game story developed felt so organic and made you want to learn more about the world and it's characters in a way that felt natural. Additionally I really appreciated that a lot of the story telling is via the world building and you putting the pieces together. I liked GLaDOS in the original game, but the further exploration of her character was excellent.\n\nPortal is definitely one of those properties, that really stands out among Valve's catalogue of games, unique concept and gameplay, interesting world, strange and fun characters and a very engaging puzzle game, I feel like a lot of puzzle games fall short in terms of only giving you a puzzle, but then nothing more of substance, but this game made me really have an appreciation for what a puzzle game could be.\n\nIt's so hard to fault this game, yeah it was a childhood classic, but despite that, it holds up excellently. I remember how excited I was seeing the promotional stuff, in anticipation for it's eventual release. I have never had a similar experience since.\n\nDo I recommend this? Without a doubt, absolutely, even if you get motion sick easily, please try and bare through it, this game is so rewarding and deserves all the love it's received. As well as expanding on everything in the first game, additionally it adds a nice bonus story via the multiplayer and also gives you the ability to create your own test chambers.\n\nLast thoughts: You don't necessarily have to have beat the first game to play this one, but I recommend it, because for one, it's not very long and also adds additional context for the events of this game, another reason I would encourage you to play the first, is because this game is an upgrade of the first in every way, so it made feel like a degrade, going from this game to that one, lastly both games have catchy credit songs you should hear.\n\nThat's all my thoughts I hope you try it out, thanks!","timestamp_created":1309955167,"timestamp_updated":1634762123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3411126","author":{"steamid":"76561198022240895","num_games_owned":1102,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2314,"last_played":1373150445},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game :D","timestamp_created":1309954305,"timestamp_updated":1309954305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"700406","author":{"steamid":"76561197975919368","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1901,"last_played":1456912818},"language":"english","review":"Played Portal which was addictive.
