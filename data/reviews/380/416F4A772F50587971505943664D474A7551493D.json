So Episode One follows after the cliffhanger ending of Half-Life 2, which I won't spoil for those who wish to play Half-Life 2 and haven't yet. So once again you're Gordon Freeman and your main goal is to escape City 17 before the place goes Kaboom pretty much, you spend a majority of your journey with Alyx Vance in this game as the 2 of you try to escape the city along with other members of the resistance. So right away it's a slightly more intruiging premise. So imma go over the good and bad about this\n\n\nPros\n\n1. Alyx Vance was already a pretty good character to begin with and thankfully she gets more time to shine here and her personality shines through, she really grows as a character more in this game as she spends much of the runtime in close proximity with you. Her ever so famous Zombine line is here too. Overall I really like this change as I always liked her and felt while she was prominent in HL2, she never really showed up as much as I would've liked and you the player don't get to spend as much time with her in HL2 as you do here. Great addition\n\n\n2. Once again the Gravity Gun is front and center here, however it's more involved in this one as you start out with only the Gravity Gun for a long period of time and you only get a few weapons with limited ammo, having to rely on Objects in the area and Alyx in combat which is a nice touch imo, and it almost brings back the survival horror aspect from Half-Life 1 that was really missing in Half-Life 2, glad to see this here.\n\n\n3. Generally the level design here is fine, there's only about 7 or so locations and none overstay their welcome, so you don't need to worry about being tired of the same area after a while, unless you are just sick of City 17 as a whole.\n\n\n\nThat's really about the only positives here tho, now let's get into the negatives about this expansion\n\n\nCons\n\n\n1. It's way too short, I get that it's supposed to just be an expansion, although Valve seems to treat this as if it were it's own game, which I feel is a bit bad. The game can be beaten in about 4 hours, probably even 2 honestly if you really know what you're doing which is a shame. Gives me some bad callbacks to Blue Shift and how short it is, although at least Episode One has a bigger impact on the story\n\n\n2. The Final Section sucks. The Final Section boils down to a glorified escort mission where you gotta clear out guards and escort resistance members across a battlefield to allow them to escape and after all that you gotta basically run through an onslaught where this boss hammers you until you get the weapon to finish him off at the end, talk about an underwhelming finish.\n\n\n3. Once again the graphics fail to impress, I know it's like beating a dead horse by mentioning it, but really you would think that an expansion would possibly bring something new to the table here, after all this was a year after Lost Coast which had introduced HDR to the Source Engine, so to not really see it shine here is rather disappointing imo.\n\n\n4. While I enjoy the lack of ammo for it bringing back the horror experience, it really can be a pain having to rely soley on Alyx to take out enemies for you as while her AI is certainly improved, it's still not the best, so you're essentially a sitting duck while you wait for her to shoot.\n\n\n5. Once again the AUX meter causes problems, I briefly mentioned it in my HL2 review but I couldn't go into as much detail as I wished because of the review character limit, so now is my oppertunity to explain why this mechanic is bad. So essentially you have an AUX meter which refers to your biohazard suit's power meter, when you sprint, use your flashlight or swim it uses this power. The issue arrises when say you were sprinting a long distance to get around faster, and all of a sudden you need to swim, well the meter will have been drained from your sprinting so when you go in the water, you'll start to drown because you wanted to sprint, which is bad, so it basically forces you to then stay above water while the meter slowly, and I do mean slowly recharges itself so you can go swimming again. The problem also exists when sprinting and you come across a dark area, if your meter is too low and it runs out, your flashlight turns off which is a real issue when some areas are incredibly dark and you can't see without it. This also can occur when just using the flashlight in general as the meter runs out way too fast and thus you're stuck with having to deal with constantly turning your light on and off to preserve battery, and this can lead you to taking unfair hits by enemies you can't see because you just wanted to use your flashlight. This game design really does hurt Half-Life 2 and Episode One, but thankfully Episode 2 would remedy this issue.\n\n\n\nSo overall I think this expansion is an improvement over Half-Life 2 as a whole, but with that being said: it's not very good and honestly I can't really recommend it unless you're planning on playing every single entry in the series, it's certainly not a bad game and I think it's slightly above mediocre, but it's not very good. You should only get this if you want to play every entry or if you want it's materials for Garry's Mod, otherwise pass on this one","timestamp_created":1608411343,"timestamp_updated":1632176996,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82710844","author":{"steamid":"76561199012083696","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":357,"last_played":1608406828},"language":"turkish","review":"Valvenin Tüm Oyunlarını Severim Fakat Half Life Serisi Benim İçin Ayrıdır Çok Güzel Oynamadan Geçmeyin","timestamp_created":1608407915,"timestamp_updated":1608407915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82706171","author":{"steamid":"76561198195940314","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1627999141},"language":"turkish","review":"sarıyoo... sardı.","timestamp_created":1608402634,"timestamp_updated":1608402634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82704681","author":{"steamid":"76561198254890112","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":2175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1889,"last_played":1628455779},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1608401023,"timestamp_updated":1608401023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82692867","author":{"steamid":"76561198055947532","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":108,"playtime_forever":491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":246,"last_played":1644070210},"language":"english","review":"yeah it's great!","timestamp_created":1608388712,"timestamp_updated":1608388712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82689758","author":{"steamid":"76561198437338028","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":348,"last_played":1578144585},"language":"russian","review":"full anal","timestamp_created":1608385327,"timestamp_updated":1608385327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82682628","author":{"steamid":"76561198859903585","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1608376599},"language":"russian","review":".","timestamp_created":1608376633,"timestamp_updated":1608376633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82666607","author":{"steamid":"76561198386237519","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1312,"last_played":1608351879},"language":"latam","review":"los npc según el nivel de dificultad son molestos y otorgan poca ayuda ante el ataque de los enemigos pero es entretenido para pasar el rato","timestamp_created":1608352510,"timestamp_updated":1608352510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82663887","author":{"steamid":"76561198985456339","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":172,"last_played":1585262965},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life never ceases to amaze.

Recomendadisimo.","timestamp_created":1608260358,"timestamp_updated":1608260358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82596090","author":{"steamid":"76561198201039731","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":286,"last_played":1619381975},"language":"brazilian","review":"episodio 1 de half life segue mesmo principio de boa historia e ação, porem muito curto pra ser dividido em 2 partes, poderiam estar incluidos no jogo base half life 2","timestamp_created":1608256575,"timestamp_updated":1608256575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82579701","author":{"steamid":"76561199048683956","num_games_owned":721,"num_reviews":116,"playtime_forever":337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":337,"last_played":1622676974},"language":"turkish","review":"Efsane.","timestamp_created":1608233893,"timestamp_updated":1608233893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82568358","author":{"steamid":"76561198821190749","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":67,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67,"last_played":1609090101},"language":"russian","review":"Великая битва у лифта","timestamp_created":1608221293,"timestamp_updated":1608221293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82552026","author":{"steamid":"76561198993513204","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1608201615},"language":"english","review":"boring","timestamp_created":1608201782,"timestamp_updated":1644321010,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473372787237167358","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82550025","author":{"steamid":"76561198358488477","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1608198893},"language":"german","review":"Short but Gold","timestamp_created":1608198956,"timestamp_updated":1608198956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82548027","author":{"steamid":"76561198320010540","num_games_owned":234,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":246,"last_played":1606720950},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun beklediğimden kısa çıktı bu yüzden mutsuzum umarım episode 2 de bunun gibi kısa değildir onu daha almadım ama bu oyunu da oynayın derim","timestamp_created":1608195828,"timestamp_updated":1608195828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82547385","author":{"steamid":"76561198354190134","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":162,"last_played":1607439938},"language":"spanish","review":"Está bueno","timestamp_created":1608194808,"timestamp_updated":1608194808,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82546108","author":{"steamid":"76561198394781830","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":74,"playtime_forever":232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":232,"last_played":1608174649},"language":"english","review":"the joke's been overused so much but it's true: we can only pray for hl3","timestamp_created":1608192734,"timestamp_updated":1608192734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82543542","author":{"steamid":"76561198346187498","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1623605670},"language":"english","review":"Even if it's not as good as Half-Life 2, it's still Half-life 2.
