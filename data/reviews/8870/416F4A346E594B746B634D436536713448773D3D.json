Astonishing game, with such a beautiful art direction and storytelling. It's the kind of game where you care about the main characters and, like in a good book, each chapter gets you deeper and deeper in the game story.\n\nIt's even hard to describe how good the art direction in this game is. You really feel like you are living in the beggining of the past century. Every detail, from the objects, to the clothes and the enviroment, are made with such care. \n\nThe animation from the characters is outstanding as well. They behave naturally and all the movements are really well done (Elizabeth, the \"damsel in distress\", even lay back on the wall or sit in a bench sometimes, waiting for you to finish searching for ammo or food. These little things, that most people won't even realize, add so much to the reality aspect of the game).\n\nThe only flaw I could find, it's the aim system. It's not bad, it's just kind of weird sometimes (especially if you are used to other fast paced FPS games), making hard to aim at the enemy. But it's just a matter of time and practice until you get used to it. Overall, the gameplay works fine and you learn how to combine the Vigors (powers) with the guns. There are endless strategies that can be used to defeat different enemies.\n\nBioshock Infinite is definitely one of the best games of the year and totally recommended. Like the first Bioshock, every single detail on the game is perfect, especially the beautiful enviroment.  \nI bought it in the Steam Winter Sale for ridiculous 10 dollars, so it was more than worth it.

Han creado una buena historia (aunque en cierta manera parece que abusan del mismo tema.. \"ciudad perfecta\" --> \"revolución\", sólo que a diferencia de los Bio 1 y 2... aquí la  provocamos nosotros).\n\nEso no quita que la ambientación (los 30-60 primeros minutos, según tu ritmo de juego) sea bestial y creas estar en otro tipo de juego. Mas cosas a destacar son ciertos \"guiños\" a los 2 primeros bioshock, cosa que no comentaré porque ya serian spoilers xD\n\nAspectos positivos:\n\nIA: La IA no es de las mejores, pero es aceptable, los enemigos no van a morir, sino que intentan pillarte por la espalda y dispararte desde lejos (que menuda punterian tienen algunos xD).\nSolo 2 Armas: Pues eso.. olvidate de llevar 6-7 armas y usar las que mas te gusten o las mejores para cada enfrentamiento.. aquí sólo puedes llevar 2 y a veces por falta de munición tienes que tirarlas.\nVigorizadores: Han sabido crear nuevos vigorizadores y algunos bastante molones\n\nAspectos negativos:\n\nDificultad: Aún en díficil.. el juego resulta fácil, la mitad de las veces que me han matado ha sido por bajadas de fps debido a mi pobre ordenador :(. El resto.. pq me gusta ir con la pistola.. xD . Eso se arregla con el modo 1999, pero para ello hay q completar el juego primero.\nGanzúas: Al principio vas con las justas, pero luego sobran y sobran.. No digo que no me haya dejado alguna cerradura sin abrir.. pero me he recorrido todas las fases entre 2-3 veces.\nDinero: En díficil termina sobrando y compras mejoras por comprar, gastando lo que te queda en munición para tus armas favoritas. Además la chiquilla no para de darte dinero a cada rato.\n\nLa solución a esto es jugar en modo 1999 sin usar pasta para comprar munición.. .\n\nSobre el final.\nHe leído muchas críticas sobre el final de Infinite.. pero a mi como final me ha gustado, han logrado explicar todo lo sucedido en el juego y darle un sentido a muchas preguntas que se te plantean a lo largo del mismo. ¿Qué no es el final típico de siempre? Pues no.. pero ya era hora de que lo cambiasen un poco :)\n\nNota final 8/10 (No le pongo el 9 , pq no puedes jugar en modo 1999 desde el principio, y eso le quita parte de la gracia al juego)\n\n","timestamp_created":1387883353,"timestamp_updated":1387883353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562312483787536621","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8247816","author":{"steamid":"76561197970409001","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":934,"last_played":1386517655},"language":"italian","review":"Awesome game!
