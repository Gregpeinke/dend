If that wasn't enough, they even added custom maps for your longing Portal needs!

Он является очень простым, но в тоже время очень удобным.\nФизика в этой игре продумана до мельчайших деталей.\nСюжет очень атмосферный и добрый, в который компания Valve мастерски добавила несколько неожиданных поворотов.\nОсновная часть геймплея заточена под разгадование замечательно сделанных головоломок., но и юмор, который очень хорошо сработал вместе с первой частью, никуда не делся. И в этой части юмор идет не только от ГлэдОС, но и от новоиспеченных персонажей таких как модуль Уитли и бывший владелец Аперчер лаб Кейв Джонсон. Также юмор даже стал присутствовать во многих ачивментах.\nВажнейшее добавление к геймплею стало появление на свет кооператива, которого так не хватало в предыдущей части. \nНу вроде бы и все, ведь и так эта игра не даст заскучать ни на секунду, но нет ещё одним важнейшим отличием от приквела этой игры стало добавление Workshop и создание камер пользователями. Ведь, добавив это, разработчики дали возможность тем игрокам, которые не дружат с \"хаммером\" и незнающим сценарного кода, самим сделать парочку уровней и залить их в общий доступ.\nТак, что я сильно жду сиквела этого, не побоюсь этого слова, шедевра.

Вы находились в консервации девять девять девять дев... Это сообщение зачитывается с целью уведомить вас, что все испытуемые должны немедленно покинуть [ЗАТИХАЕТ]\"[/h1] \n\nВот и я находился в консервации, и спустя девять лет с момента первого прохождения решился написать обзор на этот шедевр.\n\nПервое, что можно отметить - это локации. Они стали масштабнее в разы по сравнению с предыдущей частью, а также разнообразнее, что только усложняет процесс и заставляет поднапрячь извилины.\n\nПрисутствует сюжет, что очень кстати, благодаря ему игра не представляет собой однотипное решение головоломок, пусть и существенно отличающихся друг от друга, а также постепенно усложняющихся. К тому же поворот событий в игре в первый раз меня очень удивил и даже в каком-то роде стал уроком, но раскрывать подробности я не буду (вдруг кто-то до сих пор не знаком с игрой, дабы не портить впечатление).\n\nЕсли проходить внимательно, исследуя локации и слушая все диалоги, можно поближе познакомиться с историей лаборатории, её основателем и окружавшими его людьми. На самом деле это очень интересно.\n\nСаундтрек - одно из достоинств игры. Звуковое сопровождение подобрано к каждому игровому моменту на оценку \"отлично\". Песня турелей из прощального ролика - отдельный вид искусства. \n\nЕдинственный минус игры - она довольно-таки короткая, однако есть замечательный кооператив, который позволяет нам насладиться несколькими испытаниями и отлично провести время с напарником.\n\nФинал - то, ради чего стоит преодолеть все испытания и получить самые разные эмоции. От радости, что мы наконец сделали то, что должны были ещё в первой части, до печали, что всё это закончилось.\n\nИтог - сиквел действительно получился на славу. Я играл во многие проекты от Valve, но Portal 2 (равно как и оригинальный Portal) заслуживает отдельное место в моём сердце. До сих пор я теплю надежду, что в будущем увидит свет и третья часть серии, и мы снова очутимся в стенах лаборатории Aperture Science.","timestamp_created":1369715380,"timestamp_updated":1627907702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1533471","author":{"steamid":"76561197994335769","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1767,"last_played":1621650258},"language":"english","review":"If I had to sum up Portal 2 in one word, it would be \"bigger.\"  Everything is bigger than the original:  the levels, the puzzles, and to some extent the comedy.  I was expecting really more of the same from the original: walk into a test chamber, do the puzzle, hear some jokes, repeat.  This is more or less how the game begins, but before you know it you're at the bottom of the veritable bottomless pit using your portaling skills to navigate your way back up.  You only realize after about 2 or 3 \"puzzles\" down there you are actually still playing the game proper, and not some intermission-type side quest.  A perfectly veiled way to make the puzzle mechanic feel fresh in my opinion.\n\nThe writing may be the one thing that I would dare say tops the original.  Where GlaDOS was the center of gravity around which the comedy orbited in Portal, Wheatley comes into Portal 2 and steals the entire show.  HIs changing roles in the game allow him to exhibit different dialogues with the player, and he ends up being the perfect go-between for this game world and the player on the couch.  Add in the returning GlaDOS and Aperture President and CEO Cave Johnson and you have a comedy team that will crack you up from start to finish.  \n\nSpeaking of the couch, I elected to play Portal 2 there with my Xbox 360 controller.  Mostly because I shared playing repsonsibilities when I first played it with a friend, and partially because I was looking to utilize the still fairly new set up I had between my PC and TV.  The game plays almost exactly the same on the TV with one notable exception, there is little or no aim botting software guiding the aiming of the portal gun.  A system pioneered and mastered by the creators of Halo, the aim bot allows the inherently inaccurate and sloppy gamepad controller to partially auto aim FPS guns in-game as opposed to being done solely by the player.  So with the absence of that in this game, the player can immediately notice drastically lower accuracy playing the game.  Thankfully Portal 2 is not about super accurate gameplay, the player choosing to play the way I did simply has to get used to it.\n\nAny modern video game released today seems to be required to come with some sort of multiplayer.  Portal 2 is no different; Valve put together an entire co-op campaign for everyone to play.  As I mentioned earlier, I played this game in its entirety in 2011 with a friend on my couch.  So when we finished the main game and it came time to play this co-op thing, we planned to simply load the game up and play it there.  Inexcusably, this co-op campaign did not feature a split screen option when it was releaseed, you could only play it through an internet connection.  Since I had zero intentions of ever playing this game with anyone else I knew or randomly with someone on the internet, this unincluded feature for co-op rendered this game mode in the never to be played category.  Valve has since added in split screen for the co-op, and maybe one day I'll finally get around to playing it, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\nSo my multiplayer experience for Portal 2 ended up simply being passing the controller back and forth with the main game while sitting on the couch with another Portal aficionado.  I mention this because that experience ended up being the most fun I had playing a video game with a friend in years.  Add in beer and pizza, and we spent several laugh-filled evenings trying to find our way through these puzzles and just enjoying the game.  With this new world we live in with perpetual internet connections, and multiplayer video games being almost exclusively played over that internet, I still find that the best social gaming experiences to be the ones where friends sit together and play together.  For me, my Portal 2 experience essentially rang the deathknell for the internet as the principle driver of multiplayer gaming.  For all its technologies and complexities, the internet is no match for a couch, beer and pizza when it come to having fun playing multiplayer video games with friends.","timestamp_created":1369678417,"timestamp_updated":1369678417,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471383541822433472","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6606211","author":{"steamid":"76561198070297043","num_games_owned":483,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":617,"last_played":1383414410},"language":"english","review":"AW YUS.

No longer feeling like a linear series of puzzle rooms, this time all gameplay elements just fits in beautifully into a well crafted story.\n\nAlthough the sense of novelty using the Portal gun may have been diminished with this sequel, it distinguishes itself now with the excellent story writing that is full of memorable characters, and expertly designed scripted events. The story is now also much more light-hearted compared to the original game.\n\nUsing an enhanced version of the Source Engine, the game looks very nice especially when it showcases its lighting and shadows. There are now more composed music and all of them are suitably atmospheric, although i personally felt that the end credits song \"Want You Gone\" was not as memorable and cute as \"Still Alive\". That said, i felt that the \"Turret Opera\" song was very well made and unique.\n\nCharacter voice work quality are still as exceptional as ever. GLaDOS is now a much more complex and emotional character as compared to the first game. (She's still a homicidal maniac though lol) There are also some newcomers such as the character Wheatly who is downright hilarious and is a great addition to the cast.\n\nHaving a co-op mode definitely adds alot and its really fun to tackle the challenges with a friend. This game works very well indeed with co-op.\n\nDownsides, loading screens are now more frequent and lengthy and i felt that it broke up the momentum of the game. This is probably due to the fact that Portal 2 was also ported to consoles. Newcomers who have not played Portal 1 may not be able to appreciate some of the story elements in Portal 2. Also, some questions remain unanswered. None of these issues however take away from the experience of the game.\n\nOverall Rating: 9 / 10\nAn excellent and worthy sequel that improves on everything that made the original so good. An instant classic.","timestamp_created":1369501552,"timestamp_updated":1591405829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5026425","author":{"steamid":"76561198044315819","num_games_owned":993,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":1434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1434,"last_played":1417467272},"language":"english","review":"Action, riddles, and story.
