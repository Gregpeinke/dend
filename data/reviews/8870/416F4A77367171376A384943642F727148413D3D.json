On one hand it has a beautifully crafted world, interesting characters and a story I was keen to unravel.  It’s just; I personally don’t think that a pure FPS was the proper vehicle to carry it.  I recently completed Human Revolution and when you juxtaposition the two the missing element of choice in Bioshock stands in stark relief.  As Adam Jensen I could choose how I handle situations, either by brute force or moving through the game with stealth and non-lethal means.  As Booker DeWitt, however, I had to essentially murder my way through hundreds of people that I really had no motivation to kill, many of whom you were forced to empathize with via the little recorded messages scattered throughout the world.   Let’s face it, the majority of your opponents are police/security forces, disenfranchised minorities trying to uplift themselves and disabled people stuffed into mechanical bodies.  I had no gripes with any of these folks and left to my druthers I would rather have rather of let the majority of them live.  The shifts between engaging story and discovery and gratuitous violence was simply jarring and out of place in the overall context of the game.\nIt is shame because I really loved the other elements of the game.   It’s just I could have had a little more conversation and a little less action.\n","timestamp_created":1384997371,"timestamp_updated":1384997371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7704695","author":{"steamid":"76561198033667888","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":731,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1444658117},"language":"english","review":"One of the best single player games I've ever played!","timestamp_created":1384973499,"timestamp_updated":1384973499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7703382","author":{"steamid":"76561198030814840","num_games_owned":2008,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":816,"last_played":1375843460},"language":"english","review":"9/10 - Story is amazing.

Скажу лишь свое мнение.\n\nНалицо надуманность сюжета, персонажи шаблонные.По прошествии половины игры лично меня сюжет особо не затягивает, персонажи тем более.\n\nМногие ставят в плюс игре поразительную смену контрастов: например, что в райском небесном городе наблюдается расовая дискриминация и беспрекословное, абсолютное восхваление и подчинение тоталитарному правителю. У меня один вопрос: ну и что? Разве это может кого-то удивить? Либо все настолько тупые, что достаточно лишь показать такую возможность, чтобы все ахнули?! К слову, большая часть  многих обзоров посвящена подобным \"плюсам\".\n\nСтилизация и окружение игры, не спорю, весьма оригинальны, поначалу было интересно исследовать город, но затем все скатилось к банальным однообразным пострелушкам. Имхо, геймплей поразительно скучен и однообразен, механика стрельбы не выдерживает никакой критики - сама стрельба реализована донельзя примитивно. Весь геймплей держится на 3х столпах: примитивная стрельба, энергетики и помощь Элизабет, которая иногда подкидывает тебе патроны и аптечки. Ставить в плюс ей то, что она не мешает - бред высшей мерки. Она и не должна мешать. Если бы еще и мешала, был бы очевидный минус.\nВидов врагов очень мало, а все игровое действие по сути заключается в том, что нужно пройти от точке А к точке Б, зачистив весь путь, уничтожая тонны однообразных врагов однообразными методами. Столкновения с противниками похожи один на другой как две капли, различается лишь окружение. Не знаю как другим, но такой геймплей для меня нереально скучен.\nЭкономическая система донельзя примитивна - собирай монетки, обчищай сундуки и покупай на полученные копейки улучшения на оружие и на сверхъествественные способности. Кто придумает проще, чем \"собирай монетки - покупай\"?

Within myself. For every great thing... There felt like there was a medocre or bad thing..  But what I can say with some conviction is that I really enjoyed the narrative of this game. It has a really interesting story, which is told well through the excellent voice acting, art direction and character animation. This aspect of the game excels,  the story dirven elements and in game narrative scenes are great... and it really was the story to dragged me to the finish.\n\nI use the word dragged intentionally...  as a game... Bioshock Infinite is mediocre. It is very very very combat driven.. and that combat is tedious and unsatisfying. Dull is the best way to describe it, the weapons are all standard really without imagination or anything to make them stand out or particularly fun to use... the enemies have simple AI and pose little challenge on Normal difficulty (which is what I played) and the sheer weight of enemies you mow through just has to be a warcrime.\n\nThey are the same bad guys no matter which \"faction\" it is your fighting, they just have different badges or colours to diferenciate. The combat makes up 80% of the game (if not more) and it is for this reason it won't be a classic in my eyes.\n\nThe story however is excellent, a great ending which was really complex to get your head around, however the game succeeds in explaining it aptly.\n\nI'll miss the relationship you forge with the main supporting character Elizabeth, who was a well written, well rounded and well acted companion throughout.\n\nA good story locked in an uninspriing game which may have actually been better told as a book, at least in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1384795884,"timestamp_updated":1385404862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7687474","author":{"steamid":"76561198063043779","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1393997196},"language":"english","review":"Is such a damn fun game that you won't get bored of.","timestamp_created":1384754440,"timestamp_updated":1384754440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7684761","author":{"steamid":"76561197987926197","num_games_owned":302,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1381510771},"language":"english","review":"I kinda wish this game had dropped the Bioshock title - with a plot based around alternate universes/timelines it's more Physhock, even though Rapture makes a cameo.

But theres a good story here, some interesting ideas and the weird fact that it feels like you're hanging out with a Disney princess.

The carot being the rich story tellling, brilliantly extecuted sound track and picturesque scenery. The stick whilst short is still pointy and hurts my little tail. The stick being the at times montonous combat. Find two good weapons and stick with them although there is variety in vigours and you are encouraged to experiment with different combos. This breaks up what otherwise for me would have been a particularly irritating part of the game. The Skylines whilst good could have been utilalised better as it made little sense as to why you could not utilise vigors upon them. Another barb on this pointy little stick is it's over-reliance on the damsel in disstress trope that developers often use to give games a sense of purpose. Bring us the girl and whipe away the debt. I'll admit half the time I was expecting toad to pop up and go your princess is in another castle mario. The carrots however are so very juicy that I know little rabbits will overlook what are relatively minor flaws in an otherwise brilliant game.

But I wanted to wait for it to go on sale to avoid the hefty retail price. It finally did. And I beat it over 2 days of casual play.\n\nFirst off.. Its Bioshock. The look and feel is still the same. Except you on a city in the clouds and not under the ocean. The visuals look awesome. I took lots of screenshots. The design, and the presentation is perfect. \n\nThe gameplay, however was kind of a step back from the other Bioshock games though. It seemed very slow starting as far as the story goes. And then the way Weapons/Vigors worked annoyed me. A lot of the weapons were very similar. Same with the Vigors. and 90% of the time the Vigor was LMB to fire. RMB to set a trap..Or they were damage over time. Or they were just useless vigors. \n\nYou could only have 2 Weapons carried (I think Bioshock 1-2 was 4 weapons?) and then you could only have 2 Vigors on you toggle at a time. Making you have to stop the game for a second to switch. Which is just annoying. It just seemed clunkly. \n\nWhile a city in the clouds is very cool to see. It took away a lot of the tension. While Bioshock 1 and 2 were more of a scary action FPS about psychotic spliced up murderers in a collapsed city under the ocean -- Infinite just loses that. Its an action FPS. But that creepy \"anything could come crashing down at any moment\" feeling isn't there. \n\nAlso.. You'll find money and lockpicks. Early on the game will want you to have more lockpicks than you can find to open up safes. Later on.. you'll have them coming out of your ears and not enough secrets to spend them on. Money.. Its useless because many of the upgrades are useless. Its not until late game when you can upgrade your weapons.... Oh wait.. I can only carry 2 guns at a time.. why bother upgradings all these other weapons? THAT is very poor design.\n\nI know all this sounds pretty bad. I'm ALWAYS harsh on games. I bludgeon them to death with every new release. That being said. Infinite is very enjoyable ONCE the game FINALLY gets going. For one playthrough its awesome. Its a tragedy again that there is no New Game+ option. And they took out Multiplayer that Bioshock 2 introduced? Since when do we want to go backwards? Shame..\n\nReally the strongpoints in the game are the gunfights and the visual design. \nId give it a 7/10. Buy it on sale. After one play through its done. You've seen everything. There are NO alternate endings like BS 1-2.","timestamp_created":1384377597,"timestamp_updated":1384377597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7649495","author":{"steamid":"76561197995593335","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":696,"last_played":1396796455},"language":"russian","review":"Не думал, что сюжет игры может так удивить!

Story was great and the gameplay was classic Bioshock gameplay but with a twist. The only problem I had with it was that the game only pushed you slightly in the right direction towards your objective, although you could push the button that would slap a big arrow on the floor telling you where to go, but I forgot about that a lot! In previous Bioshock games you can run around an open but linear style map but you always felt like you were going in the right direction but with Infinite you could do the same, I just found myself getting lost more often than I'd like.\n\nThe DLC was...a little Bizarre? It looked phenomenal but again, I got lost far too often because I kept forgetting I can push a button to show me where to go. I started Burial at Sea and kept finding myself short of ammo and salts which left me constantly slapping enemies in the face with my grapple hook so it got repetitive and boring.

BioShock Infinite - потрясающая история от Кена Левина. В этой игре есть очень сильный сюжет. Не такой как в современных играх, а настоящая драматургия, что очень редко для игровой индустрии. Почему эта игра шутер? В игре не интересно стрелять и бегать по укрытиям, хочется изучать этот мир, общаться с окружающими. Кен Левин поднимает многие темы на которые не принято говорить в играх, а то что в игре присутсвует инцест между отцом и дочерью, который они не перешли и о котором герои узнают в конце выходит за грань. Ни одна игра не подарит вам такие незабываемые чувства.\nМоя оценка - 10/10\nP.S. Спустя почти 4 года еще раз перепрошел игру с полной русификацией. И это значительно преобразило игру.

The artwork and the graphic is superb. \n\nThe combat system is quite simple and the hitboxes are bit to large (for a PC game at least, guess it works for consol), but it's still a really fun experince to run (and gun) around in this world and be amazed by the stunningly beautiful world around you.","timestamp_created":1383760938,"timestamp_updated":1421937789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7585566","author":{"steamid":"76561198057482188","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":600,"last_played":1410198397},"language":"english","review":"Although we're not in Rapture anymore, Kevin Levine and his team still manages to surprise me with the beautiful city of Columbia.\nI really enjoyed the first Bioshock, and Bioshock Ininite is not dissapointing.\nJust like the previous games, bioshock infinte focus heavely on the story.
