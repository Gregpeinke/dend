Дело даже не столько в графике, удачно подобранном стиле или оригинальной истории. Игру вытягивает тончайшая проработка персонажей, особое внимание к деталям и уникальная атмосфера. \n\nЗдесь удачно сочетаются два важных компонента - шутер от первого лица и повествование сюжета. Однако чтобы полностью насладится игрой - приходится включать мозги) Игра хоть и требует задействовать все ваше серое вещество, но поверьте это того стоит. Пусть возможно и придется неоднократно перепройти игру, что бы открыть все грани этой удивительной истории.\n\nЕсли говорить про механику игры - то и она вышла довольно удачной... ИИ противника хоть и не дотягивает до Скайнета, но всё же заставит ваши ладошки попотеть. Не забудьте только выбрать уровень сложности 1999. \n\nДизайн уровней и цветовая палитра довольно сильно впечатляет. То как меняется окружение и цветовой фон в игре вполне можно сопоставить с эталонными работами студии Pixar. \n\nВпрочем и без особого зрения в каждом уровне отчетливо передано свое настроение, и оно именно то, которое хотел нам передать Кен Левин.\n\nНу а верную спутницу нашего героя Букера - Элизабет и упрекнуть то не вчем. Весьма удивительный персонаж, с великолепной харизмой и голосом. И спасибо локализаторам, что не озвучили игру. Кортни Дрэйпер и Трой Бэйкер дамы и господа - тут и говорить то нечего, это нужно услышать.\n\nНе буду ставить оценку, но эта игра явно подняла планку всем текущим и некст-геновским играм по главному критерию - качество.\n\nThanks Irrational Games!","timestamp_created":1403335507,"timestamp_updated":1479998471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10600391","author":{"steamid":"76561197970696491","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2119,"last_played":1403297797},"language":"german","review":"Super Spiel, geniale Story.","timestamp_created":1403334742,"timestamp_updated":1403334742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/5nR3sYCd/y3KA=="}
