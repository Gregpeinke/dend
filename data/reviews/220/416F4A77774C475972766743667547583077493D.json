Only (semi) criticism is that for players with less experience with shooters some of the later fights can be challenging, although they are designed to be won if you use your environment around you. The smaller puzzle elements make you feel smart when you solve them, and only enhance the game play.

Проснитесь и пойте\"\nРазработка Half Life 2 началась с 1999, но валв поняли что на GoldSrc им далеко не уехать, и поэтому принялись сами делать свой движок. Идей было много, было много концептов. Но остановились на истории про Сити 17. Изначально игра должна была быть больше гораздо больше, но один немецкий хакер запустил троян в центральный компьютер Валв из за чего ему достались прототипы не вышешдших игр. В их числе бета Халф Лайф 2. И из за этого игру пришлось урезать из за чего её можно пройти за 4 часа (не в моём случае). Так что же в итоге получилось? \nГрафика: Это шикарно. Я  серьёзно, смотрится даже сейчас (2021 если что) очень хорошо, а в 2004 люди наверно просто усыкались с графики.\nГеймплей: Это Халф лайф 1 приумноженный в 2 раза. Я хотел бы выделить кое что, а именно грави пушку. Она идеально показывает физику в этой игре.\nСюжет: (ВНИМАНИЕ!!!! СПОЙЛЕРЫ К 1 ЧАСТИ ХАЛФ ЛАЙФ И ХАЛФ ЛАЙФ БЛЮ ШИФТ) Джи-Мэн пробуждает нас из стазиса и помещает в вагон сити 17. Мы видим как старый администратор Чёрной мезы Доктор Уоллес Брин зачитывает пропаганду, а затем мы видим ГОшников. Когда нас собираются осматривать (или даже убивать) один из ГО снимает маску. Мы видим своего старого друга Барни Калхуна (главный герой Халф Лайф Блю Шифт), он связывается с доктором Кляйнером (один из учёных Мезы) и он нам говорит добиратся до него. Дальше спойлерить не буду.\nЯ крайне советую вам купить Халф Лайф 2, это шикарная игра даже по сей день.

so if you're reading this, you probably already know that Half-Life 2 is not your typical singleplayer game with a lame story, average gameplay, bad textures for it's time and terrible soundtrack. Well, it scored good with whopping 9 game awards and 95/100+ ratings. But if you are one of the few people that didn't play the game or don't even know what it's about, well, I can definitely say that this game is worth the money, although I didn't buy it at first since I was a poor-ass kid. You can be asking, why should I buy it? Now let me tell you.\n\n\nI'll try to not spoil the plot but i'm gonna be mentioning some key parts of the story, so this review isn't gonna be 100% spoiler free but i'll be only talking about parts that i think should be in the review. Firstly, if you didn't play the original game, I would highly suggest you to play it first since it sets the plot for the world of Half-Life. And also i would suggest you to NOT play the Half-Life: Source release of the game since it has lot of bugs which can sometimes even break the main story interactions. So just stick with the original release and you should be good to go.\n\n\nHalf-Life 2 scores with it's amazing Source physics engine and it's use in the game. The game is from 2004 and still only a few games have done the same or a better job with physics as HL2 did. How does it interact with the gameplay, you may ask. Well, Puzzles, enviroment interactions and of course, the Gravity gun. Seriously, if you haven't heard about the Gravity gun you must've been living under a rock until now. If you did, Gravity gun it's somehow exactly what it's called. You can use it to grab and throw most of the objects in the game that aren't the size of a building. There is a whole chapter dedicated to making you learn how it works and you can pass through the whole chapter without using any other weapons easily.\n\n\nSpeaking of weapons, there are about 10 weapons in the game. Some more special than the others. Every weapon in the game has a special use, but if you want to, you can go through the whole game only using Shotgun and SMG. For example, Revolver for one shotting enemies from afar, but it only has a capacity of 18 ammo shells. Grenade for bringing soldiers out of cover, Crossbow, which is practically a sniper rifle, Pistol for when you want to save ammo on weaker enemies and so on. They are all well balanced and I reccomend you to use them all.\n\n\nNow, about the enemies. We can split them into 2 categories, that being the Combine, and Xen creatures. Combine Overwatch can sometimes be a real pain in the ass since their AI is astounding and you can clearly see that they are elite soldiers. Not counting Metrocops since they act like normal cops and don't make such a threat. Now about Xen, you're gonna encounter a lot of Xen craetures in the game, mostly being Headcrabs, Zombies and their varients. They are Barnacles of course but one Shotgun or a few Pistol shots are gonna kill it right away. These monsters don't really have some kind of varients of attacks and they'll just rush to you and try to hit you which you can easily evade by 1 or 2 shots from a Shotgun.\n\n\nOf course, cannot forget the enviroment. You pass through many places in HL2 and every single one of them sets its tone amazingly. The disturbing and gloomy atmosphere of City 17, creepy and dark town of Ravenholm and so on. Map is made beautifully with great level design and enemy placement. Most of the game is accompanied by ambient music that really sets the tone. I highly suggest to turn on the volume of the game and never turn down the music volume.\n\n\nWhen there isn't ambient music though, you can expect some kickass music that really hypes you up. That makes these moments way more special and better for the player since you don't hear the music that much.\nThe music has been composed by Kelly Bailey who worked on other Half-Life or Valve projects and also did a stunning job. He made a great mix between Rock and Synths that when cobined made an amazing sounds that are now synonymous with the franchise\n\nThroughout the whole game you never leave the view of Gordon Freeman and are always in first-person mode. There are few cutscenes in the game but neither of them make you leave first-person view. This form of gameplay is now embranded with Half-Life games. It gives the player the feeling of always being in control and that he is the protagonist of the story, pushing forward the fact, that you can do almost anything with the enviroment in HL2.\n\n\nIn conclusion, great story, amazing work and use of the physics engine, good use of weapons, really good AI (specially the Combine), astonishing abient and soundtrack music and well-thought gameplay. Without a doubt, I can say this is, and will be, one of the best games ever made. Another astounding work by Valve, easily 10/10. A true masterpiece.\n\n\nHi, thanks for making it down here and reading all of this. This was my first serious review and I would appreciate some feedback. Also sorry for my English.

It's dirt cheap for the amount of sheer joy you will get out of it. Beat the crap out of space cops, aliens and other crazy enemies in style with your trusty crowbar and other weapons you find along the way as you embark on a journey to save humanity from the grip of the alien invaders known as the combine empire, destroying everything that stands in your path like a badass.\n\nEvery section and chapter of the game has its own gimmick, meaning that the gameplay never feels stale. In addition, there is a butt ton of secrets, easter eggs and hidden areas to find, so there is always something to do. The lore is never fed to you either, so you have to piece it together by yourself for the most part by paying attention to your surroundings.\n\nI've completed this entire game about 12 times total, and i still find myself coming back from time to time just to replay this masterpiece of a game again and it never gets old. \n\nNothing can describe the feeling of experiencing Half-Life 2 for the first time, and I pity those who have never played this game before.\n","timestamp_created":1616486736,"timestamp_updated":1616486736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88926969","author":{"steamid":"76561198215654921","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":873,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":733,"last_played":1634785725},"language":"english","review":"Timeless masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1616479641,"timestamp_updated":1616479641,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88923871","author":{"steamid":"76561199133810166","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1622129036},"language":"russian","review":"Проснитесь и пойте мистер Фримен проснитесь и пойтееее","timestamp_created":1616472937,"timestamp_updated":1616472937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88923690","author":{"steamid":"76561198106997696","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":16438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16351,"last_played":1643951985},"language":"russian","review":"мстительный свободный человек с гордыней идет убивать пришельцев!!!","timestamp_created":1616472585,"timestamp_updated":1616472585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88921984","author":{"steamid":"76561198136899610","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":1477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":915,"last_played":1647993280},"language":"english","review":"yeah yeah less goooo gameign yeah yeah dababy woo woo yeah yeah","timestamp_created":1616469042,"timestamp_updated":1616469042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88921602","author":{"steamid":"76561198354969773","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":751,"last_played":1616283126},"language":"english","review":"half life","timestamp_created":1616468326,"timestamp_updated":1616468326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88920378","author":{"steamid":"76561198889404841","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1127,"last_played":1621054731},"language":"english","review":"NICE","timestamp_created":1616466095,"timestamp_updated":1616466095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88919961","author":{"steamid":"76561198354419706","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1909,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1081,"last_played":1616629959},"language":"spanish","review":"Una muy buena continuación del Half Life.
