It wasn't as challenging as I wanted. I like the humor and dialog a lot though. Weatley and GlaDOS are pretty meniaclly hilarious. I liked Portal 1 better because the voice of GlaDOS was a little more robotic and believeable, and the puzzles were a little tougher.\n\nI liked Portal 2 because it was longer, and there was more to it. Overall it is a great game, good music, great visuals, and voice acting, and at times has challenging puzzles. You should play it as well as Portal 1.\n\nThe thing that keeps me coming back time and again to this game is the community created content called Community Chambers. You can download test chambers made by members of the community for both Co-Op and Solo. You can also create test chambers of your own just using the vanilla game. I LOVE that feature. It gives the game INFINITE replayability. Some of the maps that people make can be really tough too, and I like that. You can continue to play maps made by the community, and there will always be more than you can even play because people keep making them.\n\nThat is the main reason why I got this game for Steam when I already had it for Xbox360. On Xbox you cannot play community content or make your own maps. \n\nEven if you have this game for console you should try it on steam for community chambers. I highly recommend it.
