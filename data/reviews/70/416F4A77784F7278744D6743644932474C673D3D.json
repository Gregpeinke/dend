Mais maintenant plus de 15 ans après, n'importe lequel des ordinateurs bas de gamme qu'il y a 10 ans est capable de le faire fonctionner avec les graphismes poussés au maximum (même l'ordinateur de ta grand-mère peut le faire tourner ;-)).\n\nGRAPHISMES : 9 / 10\nEncore aujourd'hui, je trouve le visuel très soigné et bien réalisé.

Par contre, les échelles risque de vous en faire voir par moment (c'est le seul défaut qui à mon sens mérite d'être signalé).\nSi les ennemis sont trop faciles à votre goût, vous pouvez au début de la partie choisir le mode difficile pour plus de défis. La difficulté est bien dosée, avec une progression linéaire dans la difficulté des ennemis.\nLe choix des types d'armes est vraiment important, dans le jeu chaque arme à son utilité, il faut voir quelle arme est la plus appropriée en fonction de la situation. \n\nDURÉE DE VIE : 9 / 10\nLe jeu profite d'une durée de vie assez conséquente, entre 15h et 20h pour boucler l'histoire, ce qui est pas mal.\n\nCONCLUSION : 9 / 10\nAyant fini Half Life plusieurs fois, je suis à chaque fois jamais déçu de le redécouvrir.

Играть нам приходится за обычного научного сотрудника с докторской степенью - молчаливого Гордона Фримена. Однако история подается в таком варианте, что тут же захватывает игрока. Несмотря на все несовершенство графики атмосфера ни капельки не теряется и даже не задумываешься о том, что тебя окружают квадратные бочки и одинаковые персонажи. Нестандартные зомби, замысловатые монстры начиная от маленьких хедкрабов и заканчивая огромными слепыми тентаклями, готовыми раздавить тебя одним ударом и, конечно же, военные, прибывшие всех нас \"спасти\" кажутся довольно серьезными противниками, однако нас спасает защитный костюм от радиации, пуль и сглаза и достаточно большой выбор оружия от монтировки до РПГ и глюонной пушки. В скитаниях великого ученого ему будут помогать охранники черной мезы, готовые выступить живым щитом и обычные ученые, которые помогают тем, что нажимают на всевозмножные кнопки и рычажки. В конце своего путешествия по научно-исследовательскому комплексу доктор Фримен отправится в иной мир окстить Нихиланта и освободить няшек-вортигонтов.\n\nКстати, помимо оригинальной халфы компания Gearbox Software выпустила три дополнения: Opposing Force, Blue Shift и Decay, рассказывающих эту же историю от лица охранника Черной Мезы и по совместительству друга нашего Гордо - Барни Калхауна, от лица военного, прибывшего на зачистку черной мезы, но оказавшегося в одной лодке с остальными и от лица двух дам, неких Джины Кросс и Колетт Грин (к слову, в этой игре доступен кооперативный режим).\n\nЕсли же для вас крайне важна графика, то могу посоветовать римейк этой игры - Black Mesa - модификацию, выполненную независимыми разработчиками, где игра полностью перенесена на движок Source и полностью переделана.\n\nЧто же касается этой игры, то на вопрос \"стоит ли играть\" отвечу: да, да и еще раз да! Эта игра заслуживает того, что бы быть классикой среди одиночных шутеров, не даром же в нее играют вот уже второе десятилетие. \n\np. s. игра доступна в двух вариантах: на движке GoldSorse и на более новом - Source.","timestamp_created":1411727445,"timestamp_updated":1411727445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485804438591003418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12244026","author":{"steamid":"76561198132901923","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1818,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":629,"last_played":1468348805},"language":"english","review":"Fun game!

Hell, even the story might catch your attention, even if it was never a major feature. Controls are simple and fluid, and once you learn some \"special\" moving tricks, you'll be flying your way through the maps and probably having more fun than the developers conceived possible. The game is easy to get into, you'll be addicted to it as soon as the whole starting sequence ends and shit starts to hit the fan (the sequence is rather long, but pay attention to details along the way and you'll love it).
