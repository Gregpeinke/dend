Overall the storyline and gameplay follows the same story and mission objectives as the original game but with way more guns and enemies.

Opposing Force is about a marine named Colporal Adrien Shepard of the HECU Marines of the U.S.A. who is part of a platoon given orders from the government to eliminate all witnesses of the Black Mesa incident. Upon arriving at the outer reaches of the lab facility, the chopper Shepard was on got knock down and after that Shepard got knock out cold and eventually awakes inside the Black Mesa health ward. He soon realizes that the lab facility is over run by hostile aliens and various marines as well as Black Mesa staff members are either dead or horribly mutated. What started out as a simple government cover up is now a survival game for Shepard. With the aid of the last surviving marines and lab staff, Shepard must try to escape from Black Mesa, if he can that is. This was a great attempt to extend the Half Life story by introducing a different character witnessing the events of the Black Mesa incident during the same time frame. A few familiar characters reappear in the game including Barney Calhoun who provided aid to Gordon Freeman and the mysterious G-Man whom you encounter in the last game is present in this game where you get to see what he was doing when not being spotted by Gordon. Similar weapons from the previous game are usable along with newer weapons. While familiar enemies are present along with new enemies who didn't appear in the original game that help make this game less of a carbon copy. The flaws from the first Half Life are also in this game, but highly passable as the game has a great story and plenty of new and familiar locations to explore. The plot contains elements straight out of Full Metal Jacket, James Cameron's Aliens, and the first Predator that creates a military filled game that will satisfy military game fans. If you like Half Life, then you will like this game just as much.","timestamp_created":1456030874,"timestamp_updated":1456030874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21354329","author":{"steamid":"76561198119614991","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":811,"last_played":1456019837},"language":"english","review":"THIS PLACE MAKES TRAINING CAMP SEEM LIKE DISNEYLAND!","timestamp_created":1456021625,"timestamp_updated":1456021625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21334121","author":{"steamid":"76561198093640428","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":403,"last_played":1615746794},"language":"czech","review":"Stará dobrá klasika.","timestamp_created":1455953402,"timestamp_updated":1455953402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21324178","author":{"steamid":"76561198120577231","num_games_owned":305,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":854,"last_played":1639105263},"language":"english","review":"Not bad!","timestamp_created":1455911660,"timestamp_updated":1582510344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21313301","author":{"steamid":"76561198020482980","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":169,"playtime_forever":525,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":370,"last_played":1455866338},"language":"english","review":"In this one, you play as some army soldier named Adrian Shephard.

With new weapons, game mechanics, and areas, it's hard to find any flaws outside of the occational glitch. Although I do wish some weapons (like the Barnacle for example) would have gotten some more levels centered around them. This game has some really unique weapons. Half-Life: Opposing Force is a testament to good game design, and an overlooked gem that any Half-Life fan should check out. It may not be quite as long as the original Half-Life, but seeing as it's an expansion, I can forgive it. Take not new developers, this is how you make an expansion pack. Build upon the the pre-existing gameplay by adding new items and areas to explore. If I had to pick a number out of ten to give Half-Life: Opposing Force, I would give it a 9/10. While some glitches are more frustrating than others (like having your soldiers get stuck behind a door, or getting crushed by an elevator that was a few feet away from you), the rest of the game is fantastic and now that it's currently on sale for $1.24, you'd be a fool not to try this out.","timestamp_created":1455152416,"timestamp_updated":1455152416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21102218","author":{"steamid":"76561197995070765","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1567690859},"language":"koreana","review":"1300원으로 하루를 즐겁게 버텼습니다!!","timestamp_created":1455112068,"timestamp_updated":1455112068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21086561","author":{"steamid":"76561198144973364","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":16,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16,"last_played":1454959329},"language":"brazilian","review":"Uma merda","timestamp_created":1455054076,"timestamp_updated":1455054076,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.406712174415588379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21082991","author":{"steamid":"76561198265753175","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103,"last_played":1454796312},"language":"turkish","review":"asla tavsiye etmem oyun çok kötü on  saat uğraştırıyor tamamen zaman kaybı diğer half life oyunlarını tavsiye ederim","timestamp_created":1455044613,"timestamp_updated":1455044613,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.437919110059738159","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21067530","author":{"steamid":"76561198179562473","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":5749,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3630,"last_played":1580065494},"language":"english","review":"i like this game","timestamp_created":1454988513,"timestamp_updated":1454988513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21063707","author":{"steamid":"76561198025292777","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":317,"last_played":1364194800},"language":"english","review":"If you've played Half-Life before and haven't played this, you owe it to yourself to correct that.","timestamp_created":1454972560,"timestamp_updated":1454972560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21059439","author":{"steamid":"76561198256916271","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":101,"last_played":1489333037},"language":"turkish","review":"eglenceli bence oyun online zevkli arkadaslarla girince komik oluo ve eglencesi artıo bence alın derim zaten fiyatı da ucuz","timestamp_created":1454959754,"timestamp_updated":1454959754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536256313323974609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21057820","author":{"steamid":"76561198167479759","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":6192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":232,"last_played":1643301607},"language":"russian","review":"КРУТО.

I first started with this game, \"Half-Life: Opposing Force.\" And when I played it, this game was a testament to how Expansion Packs were in their day, before the age of DLC. It expands upon the original game, with a good story and plenty of new stuff to make it feel like it's own game. This is what I remember fondly about expansion packs from back in the 1990s-2000s. \n\nMaintaining what made the original \"Half-Life\" work in the first place, \"Half-Life: Opposing Force\" is a concurrent story that takes place at the same time as the main game itself.\n\nThis time, you play as Marine Corporal Adrian Shephard, who is part of the Marine Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) as they move to \"cleanse\" the Black Mesa facility during the events of the original \"Half-Life.\" This game does a great job bridging together moments between this game and the original, making it feel like it's taking place during the main story. Again, Shephard is not a speaking protagonist, making him more immersive to the player. And again, you never lose control of Shephard throughout the game, therefore making it be told completely through his perspective.  What worked very well in the first game works very well in this Expansion. \n\nAlso, the game continues to keep the game's areas interconnected, allowing you to feel like you're travelling through the Black Mesa facility. It again, worked in the first game, and works well in this one.\n\nI also liked the new weapons in this game, a Desert Eagle, a Sniper Rifle, a SAW, some new alien weapons, and even one of those Barnacles. There's plenty of new content and new areas to explore in this game that keep it fresh.\n\nI honestly found myself enjoying this game more than I did the original \"Half-Life\", and it felt like it corrected several of the flaws the original had. For one, the game doesn't give you as hard a time trying to maintain the power levels of the PCV. Also, the game avoids death-trap level design as much as the original did. There's still plenty of platforming with bad jump controls, but overall, I didn't have as many problems with this game as I did the original. I still like the original, but I feel this game felt more perfected. \n\nI also liked how this game gave you more useful allies (security guards and scientists aren't much help except for opening doors), but the other Marines in this game are a little more useful (especially the Engineer and Medic), but I found myself preferring to work alone, as the AI for the other Marines makes them not at all that useful in combat. \n\nAlso, the enemy variety is improved quite a bit in this game, especially the Race X aliens, which also add on to the variety. This is another thing that makes this game a true testament to the expansion pack. \n\nIt's a shame that most DLC doesn't have the quality that most old-time Expansion Packs did, but this game is a testament to the expansion pack of the 1990s-2000s. It has plenty of new content, enough of a story, plenty of new enemies, and improves on the original game's flaws. This is a great expansion that I enjoyed greatly. I look forward to another playthrough.","timestamp_created":1453121825,"timestamp_updated":1453122114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20595098","author":{"steamid":"76561198125049644","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":349,"last_played":1452370015},"language":"english","review":"Unlike Blue Shift, Opposing Force almost feels like a different game in some ways than Half Life (even though it is, essentially, playing more of the same of Half Life).
