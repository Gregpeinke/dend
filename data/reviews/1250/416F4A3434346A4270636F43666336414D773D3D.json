Gute Perks und viele schöne Waffen die nicht nur vom Skin sonder auch an Spielspaß sehr frohlocken. Die Grafik ist zwar nicht die beste aber dafür läuft es komplett ruckelfrei auch über Hamachi oder andere Verbinungsprogramme. Die Gegner sind nicht zu leicht, denn durch die verschiedenen Schwierigkeitsgrade können die Monster viel Munition fressen. Der einzige Manko der mir auffällt ist, dass man Ewigkeiten brauch um einen Perk auf Level 6 zu bekommen. Mit einem 6er Team geht das zwar realtiv gut aber es dauert trotzdem zulange, so dass man sich auf einen Perk konzentrieren sollten wenn man das Spiel nicht Dauersuchten möchte. Ansosten sehr schön gelungener Zombieshooter :)","timestamp_created":1418638330,"timestamp_updated":1418638330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.609413743019104004","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13375756","author":{"steamid":"76561198155048259","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1420902703},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра ждём 2 части","timestamp_created":1418638318,"timestamp_updated":1418638318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13375627","author":{"steamid":"76561198158755903","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1498853977},"language":"russian","review":"офигенная игра всем советую,много крови и мяса,затягивает особенно с другом!\n","timestamp_created":1418637196,"timestamp_updated":1418637196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13374817","author":{"steamid":"76561197998613749","num_games_owned":292,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":34723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":64,"playtime_at_review":32768,"last_played":1660053338},"language":"english","review":"It's alright for a few hours.","timestamp_created":1418628712,"timestamp_updated":1418628712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13374681","author":{"steamid":"76561198132638906","num_games_owned":814,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":3522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2231,"last_played":1423037799},"language":"english","review":"Played this 5 years ago, it was amazing. 5 year break changed nothing, still amazing.","timestamp_created":1418627296,"timestamp_updated":1418627296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13374671","author":{"steamid":"76561198035636011","num_games_owned":375,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":31453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4275,"last_played":1586148291},"language":"english","review":"Just as long as you play with friends in multiplayer, if not then prepare for level 0 medics who think they are berserkers.","timestamp_created":1418627177,"timestamp_updated":1418627177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13374652","author":{"steamid":"76561198079437491","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1424664299},"language":"english","review":"I like to shoot elves alllll daaaaay looooonnnngg","timestamp_created":1418626971,"timestamp_updated":1418626971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13374451","author":{"steamid":"76561198155470521","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1071,"last_played":1515827063},"language":"russian","review":"игра по кооперативу супер","timestamp_created":1418624756,"timestamp_updated":1418624756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13374128","author":{"steamid":"76561198119259089","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":37717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19464,"last_played":1652468541},"language":"english","review":"I wrote a lengthy review of Killing Floor a long time ago when I hit 500 or so hours. This game is still a gem and worth every hour you put into it.  If you can look past the dated graphics and bad map textures this game delivers so well on the co-op survival horror that KF2 and Back4Blood tried to emulate. KF1 is a harsh mentor and unapologetic with its humor and cheese but the highs you experience when clearing a map on Hell on Earth difficulty are unmatched.
