It always feels like lazy writing, and has bascially become a cliche. They imagined up this insane hardcore awesome world, and used the multiverse idea to link it to earlier entries in the series --- on it's own, OK, but its the only option, its flimsy.

No escort mission here.\n\nYou can also use her powers to summon items/allies from other dimensions such as cover, robot minions, health packs, or vantage points to get a leg up on your enemies.  You can only have one of these out at a time so you need to choose wisely in the midst of combat.\n\nIt's a game with a great story, interesting environments & great characters but it's also a very generic FPS experience.
