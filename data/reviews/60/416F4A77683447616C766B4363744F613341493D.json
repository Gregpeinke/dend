But does it work? Oh who am I kidding? I'm going to be straight up.\nI consider Steel Ball Run to be one of the greatest written works I've ever read.\n\nSTORY: 9/10\nI will admit Steel Ball Run has a very, very slow start. In fact, Stands aren't even introduced until like 20 chapters in. That's another thing: Steel Ball Run is seinen instead of shounen. That means each chapter ranges from 35 to 60 pages long in comparison to the 20 page long chapters of the Jojo Parts before. This may seem daunting at first, but once you get invested in Steel Ball Run it feels like the story was too short, despite being the longest Jojo Part to date. Steel Ball Run also changes the Jojo formula in its fights. Stands are no longer humanoid for the most part, and they function more as superpowers than spirits who fight for you. Each fight is engaging and unique, dealing with psychological warfare more than throwing blind punches. This makes the fights in Steel Ball Run among the best in the series.\n\nSteel Ball Run is also magnificently written with very great story arcs throughout. However, there is a controversial near the very end direction which I won't spoil that will surely throw some people off and make them consider it unnecessary. Eh, I didn't mind it too much, though it does undermine what made a previous Part so good to a degree. Despite that, it still contains one of the greatest and most emotional endings I've ever read.\n\nART: 10/10\nPart 4 may have been the pinnacle of Araki's style, but Steel Ball Run is his pinnacle in his talent. Truly perfect art in all fields. The detail is much more in depth than previous Parts and character designs are on point.\n\nCHARACTERS: 10/10\nSteel Ball Run, though its primary cast is a fraction of other Parts, contains some of the best characters in Jojo, and in my opinion some of the best characters of all time. Gyro Zeppeli qualifies for the latter. He's hilarious but he also has a tragic backstory that offers him plenty of motivation while keeping him in mystery. Diego Brando is an interesting spin on Dio Brando from The Phantom Blood and his Stand Scary Monsters is awesome. Lucy and Steven Steel are a great duo. Steven is barely in the story but he's a well written and unique supporting character and while Lucy doesn't really come into play until the finale she is still compelling. Wekapipo is one of the best side protagonists and works well as a foil to Gyro. Steel Ball Run also contains my favorite side villain, Ringo Roadaggin, and though his time spent in the story is brief it is arguably he pinnacle of Jojo.\n\nAs for the Jojo and main villain, they're simply the best. Johnny Joestar is a tragic lightning rod of Shakespearean proportions. It's not only impossible to not root for him, it is immoral. He has one of the greatest and most significant character arcs I've ever experienced, and his Stand Tusk is awesome to boot. He is my favorite Jojo bar none, despite being one of the most depraved ones. Johnny is immoral and sinful and honestly can be considered the villain of Steel Ball Run, but he is still a compelling force of nature.\n\nThe villain, President Funny Valentine, in contrast, can be considered the hero to an extent, and is one of the most sympathetic villains to grace manga. In fact, it's no secret Funny Valentine is my favorite antagonist ever. He's like a better version of Ozymandias from Watchmen who takes pride in his actions rather than cry in secret. A true patriot, Funny Valentine will stop at nothing to make America great again. As said by the man himself, his \"heart and actions are utterly unclouded. They are those of JUSTICE.\". His Stand, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (D4C), has one of the most insane and unique powers of any Stand and makes for a more than satisfying final fight.\n\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\nSteel Ball Run blew me away in every way. It is a literal epic, a poetic work of great magnitude following flawed heroes on a large scale journey that tests their spiritual and emotional strength as well as their physical. It is compelling and powerful and the fights are pretty damn great. Absolutely mind blowing and awe inspiring yet will leave you in an emotional wreck, despite the story still being filled with trademark Araki humor (Thanks mostly to Gyro and his obsession with making up gags). Johnny and Gyro are a perfect tag team; their relationship is strong and real and their chemistry is on point. They are part of what makes the story so damn compelling.\n\nOVERALL: 9.75/10\nSteel Ball Run is one of the most intense and pleasing emotional rollorcoasters I've ever experienced. It contains some of my favorite characters in fiction history and is a fantastic new take on the Jojo universe that, dare I say, is utterly superior to all that's come before it. Featuring my favorite fights, my favorite Jojo, my favorite villain, my favorite story, and one of the most emotional endings I've read, it's no secret that I consider Steel Ball Run to be the greatest Jojo Part, and one of the greatest manga ever created, period.","timestamp_created":1628650620,"timestamp_updated":1628650620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585348427295684814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97247220","author":{"steamid":"76561199031140114","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1626897570},"language":"russian","review":"4/10 игра очень старая, только один режим, ооооочень мало серверов и играков на них.

love this game, I have had it for around a week and its been the best week of my life for a long time. This game reminds me of fortnite when it first came out a fun rewarding experience, the game does have its ups and downs example how team games are almost an RNG type of thing because it all up to your team if all of your team doesnt work together and play well then you will lose, another problem would be how the servers are handled the game crashes daily and the servers crash as well but they didnt expect this many people so you cant really blame them. Another problem are hackers if you ever play late at night it will be hackers left and right and centre. But even with all these problems this game is a master piece its the best feeling when you win a game and instead of just going on with your day you get rewarded with a bunch of xp and even a special crown that cannot be bought with real life money showing your skill and how good you are, some of the game modes are even better example would be how hex a gone is like a TNT rush but in fall guys but with more chances to play risky and more chances to try new things because of how many layers there are, the amount of things you can learn from losing in hex a gone or any game for that matter is incredible and the game thrives from this. The biggest problem I have with this game is the price, i know many people who dont want to buy this just due to the price being so much for a game you might play for a week or more and then never return to in till theres a new season or update if the game was maybe single digits then it would be good buy double digits arent the best choice. Overall this game is amazing and i would recommend buying if you have some cash and time laying around.","timestamp_created":1625521651,"timestamp_updated":1625521651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95093045","author":{"steamid":"76561199037958824","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1625475406},"language":"turkish","review":"YAW BU OYUN BOKUM GİBİ ŞU SİKİK YÖN TUŞLARIYLA OYNAMAK ZORUNDA BIRAKMAYIN FARE İLE İLGİLİ SORUNU ÇÖZÜN","timestamp_created":1625475514,"timestamp_updated":1625475514,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95061205","author":{"steamid":"76561198046573892","num_games_owned":266,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":132,"last_played":1629517778},"language":"english","review":"This game is literally Valve's best game ever and I love it.","timestamp_created":1625431069,"timestamp_updated":1625431069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95049907","author":{"steamid":"76561199155009604","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":6920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1641080147},"language":"russian","review":"\nRicochet - сетевой шутер от первого лица.\n\n-Морально устаревший\n-Однообразный\n-Прицел тут лишний\n...\n-Странно, но затягивает.\n\nКак часть комплекта Valve Complete Pack - очень неплохая игра.
