It can be completed in about 2.5hrs, and probably faster if you're familiar with the levels. \n\nThe game starts with you infiltrating the Citadel and you are given a gravity gun upgrade pretty early. It makes killing the combine super easy, but ultimately cheapens the combat. There's little reason to use anything other than the blue gravity gun. It's a fun power trip, but thankfully is taken away from the player after the chapter is over.\n\nMy favorite chapter is Lowlife; you fight through a parking garage, making your way to the city streets. Parts of the mission is spent in the dark, so you must use the flashlight and flares to navigate. You must manage HEV suit power and flares so you are not left in the dark during a battle.\n\nI really didn't like the surface chapters. Open areas felt like a cheap Hollywood set and lack the depth of Half-Life 2. I know this isn't engine limitations, because some of the areas in the Urban Flight chapter did a good job at using perspective trickery to convincingly portray City 17. Also, Hal-Life 2 had terrific map design.\n\nI recommend this game because you only have one more episode before everything comes to an abrupt screeching halt.

As for underwater time it's fine, but 10 second flash light and like 8 seconds sprinting is way not enough, sometimes I have to spint and use flashlight at the same time, which makes the power to drain out in 3 seconds or so... 1. Why can't all these features a have a different meter. 2. The whole recharchable flashlight mechanic is horrible and should be avoided in any game, why can't a game either have infinite flashlight or flashlight to run on batteries. Recharchable flashlight is cancer as it always runs out very quickly and you are forced to wait a few seconds for it to recharge. 3.
