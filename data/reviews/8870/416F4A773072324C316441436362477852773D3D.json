Судьба так сложилась, что он попадает в Колумбию, чтобы спасти девушку для того, дабы расчитаться со своими долгами. Он попадает в этот прекрасный мир, воздушный мир, в котором он сразу почуял неладно, войдя в башню. С первых минут игра затягивает не на шутку. По ходу повествования мы окажемся там, где мы не могли даже и преставить себе. Колумбия, этот шикарный город просто завораживает. Что касается второстепенного героя, что перед нами предстаёт Элизабет - добрая и милая девушка. Именно из-за неё мы оказали здесь. Элизабет должна нам рассказать, как она сюда попала и что с ней произошло, и что ждёт Букера в будущем. Саму девушку держать в заточении и никак не могут её отпустить по одной просто причине - в этом должен поучавствовать Букер ДеВитт. Но тут не всё так просто - Элизабет защищает и оберегает Соловей - огромная птица-киборг, всегда срывающая планы Букера. Но а за всем этим стоит Захари Комсток - главный антогонист игры, о личности данного персонажа можно узнать по ходу игры и вы будет очень сильно удивлены, узнав,что это за человек на самом деле. Чесно,говоря, я не ожидал такого замечательного сюжета в игре. Всё очень насыщенно, красиво. Пейзажи просто удивительные, хочется здесь побывать снова и снова. Мечта Элизабет после освобождения была такова - она хотела отправится в Париж, возможно даже с Букером. Она об этом ещё не раз напомнить главному герою. Букер стал заложником данной ситуации, его будут преследовать мысли о том, что он здесь напрасно находится. Сюжет пропитан мистикой и большим воображением сценариста, который всё так нам хорошо предоставил в игре. Небесный город и его атмосфера делает своё дело. Если вы ещё не знакомы с данным творением Irrational Games -- не теряйте время и начинайте приключение, вы не пожалеете. 10/10\n\nBurial at Sea\nПомимо оригинального повествования игры нам позднее предоставили сюжетное дополнение, состоящее из двух эпизодов под названием Burial at Sea. В этом расширении мы побываем в подводном городе Восторг и совсем немножко в Париже, куда так сильно хотела Элизабет. Данное повествование является продолжением основной сюжетной линии и переносит нас в место первых двух частей Bioshock.\n\nЧто касается первой части дополнения, то тут речь пойдёт о том, что к Букеру приходил Элизабет, только уже в более зрелом возрасте и просит спасти девочку. Позднее мы узнаём имя девочки - Салли. И тут начинается самое интересное - план её спасения. Букеру всячески будут противостоять превосходящие силы противника и мы также столкнёмся с ужасным созданием под именем Большой папочка, которого мы могли встретить в предыдущих частях серии. Всё так необычно и интрига присутвует до последнего момента.\n\nТеперь речь пойдёт о втором, завершающем эпизоде, заканчивающего историю Bioshock Infinite. Здесь нам уже дают поиграть за Элизабет, что оказалось просто неожиданностью. Хороший подход со стороны разработчиков, который порадовал всех без исключения. Тут же происходит продолжение первого эпизода, который закончился на интригующей ноте и мучал игроков - а что дальше, что случилось с Букером и Элизабет? Тут уже проявляется самая сильная сторона сюжета, как это было в оригинале. Лично я был просто шокирован происходящим и это мне понравилось. Концепция сюжета предоставлена в лучших красках серии. Ну а концовка просто бомба - не буду вдаваться в подробности, всё сами увидите. Оценка данному дополнению аналогична с оригиналом.\n\nМеханическая составляющая игры и всё,что с ней связанно\nДвижок в игре обычный, без каких-либо наворотов и прочих штучек. Всё очень аккуратно и красиво. Механика данной игры отставляет только положительные ощущения. Что касается графики, то для игры такого типажа она вполне хороша. Лично меня всё устроило и это радует. Игра не показалась слишком пафосной, в ней всё очень хорошо проработанно, вплоть до деталей. Музыка в игре просто шикарная - порой бывает напрягает, но это является абсолютным плосом. Геймплей данной игры можно считать разнообразным. Тут тебе и стрельба с оружия, тут же применение плазмидов разных типов. Изюминкой геймплея стало порталы Элизабет и её непосредственная помощь в поиске боеприпасов, аптечек и золота. Также в игре можно улучшать личное оружие и способности, а также плазмидов. Такой геймплей вам не надоест, уж поверьте. Благодаря всем этим качествам игра выдаёт просто отличную картинку и ощущения от неё просто прекрасные. 9/10","timestamp_created":1446300352,"timestamp_updated":1446300352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.639271378517150879","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18792111","author":{"steamid":"76561197960922288","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":787,"last_played":1445789132},"language":"english","review":"10 hours to finish the game\n20 hours thinking about the philosophical and moral issues after playing the game\n\n10/10 would pay to think again","timestamp_created":1446298991,"timestamp_updated":1446298991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18789875","author":{"steamid":"76561198079542113","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":627,"last_played":1607549580},"language":"czech","review":"Užasná doporučuji koupit :)","timestamp_created":1446292034,"timestamp_updated":1446292034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18789722","author":{"steamid":"76561198136680042","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1528018382},"language":"finnish","review":"Very Good !","timestamp_created":1446291569,"timestamp_updated":1446291569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18787851","author":{"steamid":"76561198095461614","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":814,"last_played":1511613157},"language":"french","review":"Très bon jeu interessant riche fun seul bemole les \"trailer\" de la page du magasin en raconte trop je pense!","timestamp_created":1446285146,"timestamp_updated":1446285146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18787276","author":{"steamid":"76561198144933520","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":171,"last_played":1490879455},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING and exciting game couldnt drop the remote .\nThey've really gone all out on this game !","timestamp_created":1446283029,"timestamp_updated":1446283029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18787258","author":{"steamid":"76561198173093593","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":843,"last_played":1634961515},"language":"spanish","review":"Una excelente historia, con una agradable y muy comoda jugabilidad y el nivel de dificultad esta a la altura...\nun 100% recomendable :)","timestamp_created":1446282975,"timestamp_updated":1446282975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18785567","author":{"steamid":"76561198165714455","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2629,"last_played":1482563787},"language":"spanish","review":"Unos escenarios muy bellos y una historia atrapante y vertiginosa, una trilogia muy buena","timestamp_created":1446275820,"timestamp_updated":1480142791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18785336","author":{"steamid":"76561198039634943","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1642200162},"language":"russian","review":"Ура!

Elizabeth's animations look literally ripped from Beauty and the Beast, not to mention her character, but you can decapitate enemies and set them on fire, to creepy chords. Are they going for straight-up action? Then what's with the weird incoherent storyline, beleaguered intermissions, rifling through containers, etc.? What am I supposed to feel?\n\nDid they think the story was good because it didn't follow a linear and coherent progression? Obviously the saving grace is meant to be Elizabeth, but this wasn't even the only game in 2013 where Troy Baker played a father figure to a girl who assists you in battles that take place over regular intervals in a linear world.
