With a simple change in concept compared to other big games of the time, namely the fact that you never leave the players field of vision, the focus was always on the player, even during special events in the storyline. And the story - what a story it was and still is!\n\nIn the game, you play as Gordon Freeman, an M.I.T graduate in Theoretical Physics, who is called to the Black Mesa Complex as a Research Associate for a large-scale experiment involving alien artifacts. Already from the get-go, you may pass your time by speaking to, or just listen to the conversations between scientists and security guards. You may interact with doors, buttons, microwaves, soda machines - I mean, what more can anyone ask for, right? \n\nI am not going to spoil the story for anyone interested in playing the game themselves ([b]go play it already, if you haven't![/b]), but I can say that the ability to interact with the surrounding world is something that the player learns to appreciate throughout the game. Because of this ability, there are often several ways to complete a certain task (moving boxes, blowing things up, pressing a switch so that you don't get caught by an electrified wire etc.). This is something that  works very well with the game's overall story and design.\n\nAs the game progresses, Gordon comes face to face with stronger and stronger enemies who use different tactics to bring him down. Without ever uttering a word, Gordon swings his Crowbar (or perhaps his trusted shotgun) and plows them through, persevering through yet another life-threatening situation. It is just how badass he is (you are).\n\nMost of the times though, there is a lot of button-pushing in this game. Luckily, this is where the M.I.T-graduation comes in handy - for who could ever push a button the way M.I.T graduates can? Jokes aside though, he is darn fast at climbing ladders (while holding his crowbar with two hands - how [i]does[/i] he do it?)!\n\nPersonally, I really enjoy this game through and through. The Source engine allows for some slick movement and fast-paced gaming. If you take your time to listen to random scientists, you may or may not be surprised to hear that many of them are just as human as you and me. This is something that adds to the game and integrates the player further into the story, in my opinion. The story is great and the enemies have very advanced A.I for the time (1998, remember - that's 16 years ago!). I would recommend this game for every and any player who has ever played FPS-games, but even more so to any Quake, Doom or Unreal Tournament fans out there. So come on, give it a spin - it'll be worth it!","timestamp_created":1407878730,"timestamp_updated":1407882980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555778861045837402","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11676903","author":{"steamid":"76561197981393734","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":761,"last_played":1290585600},"language":"english","review":"I could play this game over and over again and I am positive that I would enjoy myself with every play-through.

It started Gabe Newell's roll of success, this gaming platform we call Steam, and [strike]redefined[/strike] SET the meaning of First Person Shooter.\n\nYou are Gordon Freeman, a regular old drone, on just another day in the lab, 20 miles underground. You navigate the Black Mesa facility on both foot and tram. You clock in at the security desk, and proceed to rendevous with your colleagues at the testing site. You are asked to put the crystal on the dock, and informed that this test is particularly dangerous. If only they knew...you put on your H.azardousE.nV.iroment or HEV suit, and proceed through the airlock. You push the button you are asked to, and quickly get to the balcony for safety. You watch as the machine sends beams of energy in every which direction, and can't help but speculate that it's probably not supposed the have sparks flying out of it. Over the PA, your colleaugues tell you to get out of there! But alas, it's too late. The energy beams are coming very close to hitting you, it's quite terrifying. I got incredibly scared, and I'm not a sissy...it's like the game just....absorbs you. Finally, a beam hits you, you can't run forever. You go unconcious as the balcony falls from under your feet and explosions literally blow off the airlock door. When you come to, you just feel that something is wrong. Thank goodness you had your HEV suit on (Which is shot, by the way)! You trudge to the airlock...and see all or your friends dead.\n\nThat's it for now!

Дебютное творение от Valve — Half-Life.\n\nНачнём, пожалуй, с сюжета. По сути он прост. В секретном лабораторном комплексе, где-то на Западе США, под названием Black Mesa проводятся самые различные исследования, но один из стандартных экспериментов по изучению физики пространства и кристаллов прошёл не по плану. Произошёл так называемый каскадный резонанс, в результате которого повсюду стали открываться порталы, откуда из инородного мира сотнями выпадали разнообразные и враждебно настроенные существа.\nВ результате катастрофы практически весь персонал погиб. По счастливой случайности, молодой сотрудник по имени Гордон Фримен, при непосредственном участии которого и произошёл инцидент, остаётся в живых и, помимо своей шкуры, спасает ещё весь мир.\n\nКазалось бы всё весьма шаблонно и банально, но игра имела ряд особенностей, выделяющих её на фоне других.\nВо-первых, в Half-Life впервые сюжет подавался не в виде роликов, а скриптовыми сценами, где игрок не терял контроля над персонажем. Это весьма ощутимо повлияло как на само восприятие сюжета, так и на всю атмосферу в целом.\nВо-вторых, сам главный герой, доктор Фримен за все свои похождения не произносит абсолютно ни одного слова. Это было сделано для полного погружения и максимального отождествления себя с персонажем.\nИ напоследок стоит отметить, что игра совершенно непредсказуема. События развиваются с невероятной скоростью. Вот мы монтировкой отбиваемся от пришельцев, вот в комплексе высаживаются правительственные войска, а вот нас уже забрасывают в чуждый мир. И это лишь яркие и заметные вехи в общей истории, загадочность которой добавляет странная личность в синем костюме.\n\nПомимо революционного сюжета здесь замечательный геймплей. Он прост и гениален.\nЧто сказать о вооружении? Список насчитывает аж пятнадцать различных образцов, причём фактически все имеют дополнительный режим атаки. Не обошлось и без уникальных инопланетных трофеев.\nГоворя о вооружении нельзя не рассказать о противниках. Само количество их видов около дюжины. Но не думайте, что это мало, ведь к большинству из них необходим свой особый подход.\nИскусственный интеллект довольно неплох. Даже сейчас, наблюдая за подразделением HECU, с ужасом понимаешь, что они ведут скоординированные действия. Обход с фланга, заградительный огонь, граната при отступлении – всё это уже было в то время.\n\nВ заключение напишу, что графика симпатична и не режет глаза, физика прилагается, а писки хэдкрабов забыть просто невозможно.\nКак и о любом гениальном творении, о Half-Life можно говорить много. Она хороша абсолютно во всём. Она заложила основы и стала культовой. И я горжусь тем, что она была моей первой игрой на ПК. \n\nМоя оценка: 10/10.","timestamp_created":1407332781,"timestamp_updated":1528578306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":168,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.912114322185516357","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11568926","author":{"steamid":"76561198120533339","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1609223887},"language":"english","review":"I envy those who played this when it came out.

HL1 had retail release in 1998 and it wasn't for a while before it appeared on Steam, the kind of Steam that we use. Year or so ago it was updated few times in effort to port it to Linux and Mac, like most Valve games now. No matter what, Steam release seemed to not have all tiny bugfixes that retail has. Also, unlike Retail, it doesn't have \"mods\" category. You would often see official mods there (Ricochet, TFC, CS, Deathmatch Classic) that you could download for free back then on retail, but as of right now you have to pay for those to purchase them serapately on Steam. On good side, this release comes with \"HD Models pack\" from Blue Shift by default and you can enable it in options. It increases polygonal prettyness and completely changes look of some of the weapons.\n\nNow, as for single-player... You are Gordon Freeman, a scienist with bright future and classy beardie, champion at speed whacking with clowbar, who spends most of his time mastering skills of duct crawling. Working at Black Mesa, the best and most stable research center around, today is the day you will push unknown material into sciency thingy as experiement on whetever you can do it or not. You can. Now it's your objective to reach the surface alive where military will rescue us all from hostile aliens. While you shoot things and throw grenades like a wussy. And commanding friendly Barneys to follow you with no objection.\nNow, many fans would happily tell you that game is freaking perfect and legendary. And it was indeed revolutionary. But you gotta know what exactly was and that well, by now it became just another good shooter. Though when compared to modern FPS, it's quite old-school, with levels design that makes you explore and figure out, in other words, will easily make you lost. Yea, and everybody's favourite health kits are there too. And ability to hold onto dozen weapons in same time, maybe even too many, seeing how I didn't feel like using some of them. With 3 kinds of explosive tools, with enemies happily ignoring tripmines.\nOh yes, and they also, unlike many games, don't have music running all time. Just only occasionally playing to set the mood, otherwise it's only sound. Pretty much trademarkish Vavle approach by now. At least in this current version of HL1 the music doesn't stop suddenly before it's finished when you enter new area.\nNo no no, the plot itself is not what got most of people, nothing to compare with RPG games. Instead, what got most people is that envirmoment was telling plot. A friendly scienist could tell you some news on what is going on when you would find one (and be free to shoot into their face). And you could tell away that you are in realistical envirmoment, exactly what people loved Duke Nukem 3D for, being able to tell that you are in building that launches rocket salletile and even actually launch it, for example. Before that, you either was playing plot-less Quake (Quake 2 came out year before it, everybody was playing it) or was enjoying some overblown RPG-FPS mix. HL let these Quake people enjoy something what made some sense for once. (If we forget about DN3D, yes)\nWell, and AI was getting praised a lot too. Sure, human enemies that could avoid your fireshots and properly throw grenades were nice, and they were damn good at making themselves look like they work as team was good...Until some wounded chap decides that it's excellent idea to retreat toward your position, running botherlessly despite being shot into back by chasing player. Friendly AI wasn't something what Quake player usually saw back then either (ignoring NAM game, yes), even if security guards hate doorframes and stairs, making you to babypush them around. BUT still, having AI divided into 3 opposing groups, with only one of them being friendly to you, it was something unusual.\nThat was what most likely made it hit back then... Today? Solid shooter. Good one. But don't let hype make you to overstamate this game! And it has it's fair share of glitches too.\n\nOh, and there is Multiplayer, Deathmatch to be precise... Crossfire 24/7!\nAs of right now, 2014 year, the game is far far away from the days when it was popular, but it's not dead yet. You may still find few servers having players, 1-4, here and there, playing either Crossfire map or some user-made one, which is kind of enough to have fun. Though I had a joy of playing in TDM server with around 12 players, with one team wokring as team (so it's probably not bots... I hope), just recently. But overall, occasional small casual DM still happens.\nAnd with all variety of weapons, there is enough of fun mayhem to have, killing simple players and getting killed all time by that player with Gauss Gun, combination of insta-kill railgun (after seconds of charging) with \"RocketJumping\" ability, letting such player to change position quickly. Jump Booster also helps to add fun to DM thing. Yes, it's not perfectly balanced, don't think of it as something worthy e-sport. Yet I still have joyful memories of playing LAN parties, with my friend finding creative usage for tripmines. So, nice bonus.","timestamp_created":1407169765,"timestamp_updated":1407169952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11545754","author":{"steamid":"76561198013306538","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":4423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2638,"last_played":1645191675},"language":"english","review":"cool game where u get to larp as a die hard-adjacent character, very cool stuff here, very seamless world layout and cool pacing for the most part","timestamp_created":1407147091,"timestamp_updated":1608842918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11541536","author":{"steamid":"76561198080045733","num_games_owned":885,"num_reviews":423,"playtime_forever":418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1411644788},"language":"spanish","review":"Siempre he pensado que este juego estaba sobrevalorado.\nLo jugué en su época y lo he vuelto a jugar ahora.\nY me mantengo en mi opinión.","timestamp_created":1407111861,"timestamp_updated":1407111861,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.364678949117660522","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11539124","author":{"steamid":"76561198078452281","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2986,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2946,"last_played":1480129498},"language":"english","review":"One of the greatest PC games of all time.
