Aside from being inspiration for a game I was making, and changing the way I think about puzzles, Portal 2 is brilliant. It displays excellently crafted puzzles build for and around the idea of player thought. There isn't one puzzle in Portal 2 that isn't made with a challenge to the player, a fun / humorous aspect, or an interesting new element we, the community, never thought of about Portal and it's universe. Speaking of, Portal 2's storyline (Minor / kinda spoiler ahead. Read fast or skip to \"Aside from that,\") is jam packed and offers one fun and mysterious world to discover. Aside from that, after you complete the story, you can go on to the community levels, mods, comics, shorts, SFM's, the list goes on and on.\n\nOverall, I'd rate Portal 2 a 10/10. It's a masterpiece at heart, and has (believe it or not) actually changed my life and the way I think about games in general.
