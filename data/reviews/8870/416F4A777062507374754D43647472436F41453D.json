Here's why:\n\nBioshock was the spiritual successor to System Shock, a landmark FPS action adventure. Mechanics were streamlined, the scenario, albeit ridiculous, was fresh. I couldn't get over the aesthetics and reduced complexity and so Bioshock 2 was the higlight of the series for me, since it offered an improvement in terms of mechanics and kept what already worked on top of better visuals and level design. Others might stress the clever story of Bioshock 1. \n\nNow what did the third Shock Revival do in terms of story, worldbuilding and atmosphere? And what about gamplay and mechanics?\n\nBSI is a pretty much an FPS with lots of ballast. It is not an action adventure anymore. You will be shooting at baddies with no options left, most of the time. Surprisingly, and I say this because the press certainly wouldn't tell you, the action is clearly subpar in almost every category. It feels like a late 90s shooter. Shootouts usually occur in giant rectangular places. You can almost win every fight with the criminally dumb ai through conservatively picking them off one after the other. They've reused the regenerating shield popularized by Halo, but here it makes no sense. Every battle follows an astonishing amount of backtracking and browsing. I definitely did not have to comb through so many desks and trashcans in the less action oriented predecessors! \n\nThe \"spell\" system cannot save the action part from mediocrity. It's mostly differently coloured grenades. There's one redeeming quality with the skyhooking, a system of cruising alongside rails popular in a couple of action games as of late. But you also have to make do with an stale \"upgrading\" subsystem. Yawn!\n\nMaybe the story could have made BSI an enjoyable ride, but here it fails even harder. What might start promising, as you kindly suspend your disbelief, turns into shocking amounts of narrative garbage.\n\nThe first steps are a fun experience as you're pushed headfirst into a weird city in the skies. Without spoiling much, this is another time-travel story with infinite (hence the title) possibilites and every retcon possible at every moment. So don't assume for the story elements to fit together in the end and bring clarity. Same with the background: there's a hamfisted racist angle where the beautiful city is somehow a terrible place for Blacks and the Irish. You hear their lamentations as you're fishing fistfuls of money from a segregated bathroom! Everybody in this super rich place could simply leave at a moment's notice. And the downtrodden seems to be less then animals, as their revolution makes the Haiti uprising look tame in comparison.\n\nThe main story makes no sense whatsoever and is a new low in terms of lazy a$$ AAA storytelling. You see the oh so revered \"twists\" a mile coming, cringing, hoping they won't botch it that bad. But they certainly go the extra mile. Other cheap shocks are simply conjured up when needed even though everything is utterly contradicting. \n\nMy personal theory is that the empowered female is what kept the geeks happy. You can get away with everything these days if you include a damsel that somehow is not a damsel but a strong woman. Movies, comics, books and now computer games. A Mary Sue with Jesus like qualities that make her both vulnerable but perfect for autocastrated boys who want to have permission to worship Iocaste.\n\n","timestamp_created":1527004480,"timestamp_updated":1527004480,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459992259740829468","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42177846","author":{"steamid":"76561198104863959","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1526997336},"language":"english","review":"Hands down the best story in a video game","timestamp_created":1526997925,"timestamp_updated":1526997925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464646458625793457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42177477","author":{"steamid":"76561198119558423","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":708,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":708,"last_played":1526994577},"language":"koreana","review":"전작안해보고 인피니트만 해도 무방한듯\n솔직히 마지막 엘리자베스말 듣기 전까진 스토리 1도 이해 못했음 \n그래도 스토리 정리한글 보니 이해되면서 약간 소름임\n걍 세일하면 사라","timestamp_created":1526996468,"timestamp_updated":1526997487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42177240","author":{"steamid":"76561198012452643","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":1059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1059,"last_played":1542899771},"language":"koreana","review":"난이도를 보통으로 해도 어려운 게임\n스토리를 이해하려고 해도 어려운 게임\n근데 재미는 매우 있는 게임","timestamp_created":1526995651,"timestamp_updated":1542860771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42175086","author":{"steamid":"76561198415295659","num_games_owned":577,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":910,"last_played":1526957945},"language":"schinese","review":"成功的让我一个不是很喜欢乌托邦和剧情fps的人爱上了这些元素，所以我要强烈推荐！！！！！","timestamp_created":1526986102,"timestamp_updated":1528446356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42173986","author":{"steamid":"76561198018391908","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1184,"last_played":1525560856},"language":"english","review":"Good shooter, it's imaginative and colorful.

Bu neydi böyle ? Oyun bitince yani nasıl anlatsam uzun süre boyunca ekrana söyle deyim oyun bitince aynen şu şekilde bağırdım '' What the fuck is just happen ?'' Yani bitiş jeneriği akarken uzun bir süre boyunca ekrana baktım herhalde. Spoiler yok rahatlıkla okuyabilirsin zaten bu oyunu oynamayan birine söyleyipte hevesini kaçırmak büyük insanlık suçu olur. Neyse biz oyunu inceleyelim bakalım\n\nHikayeden başlayalım. Ana karakterimiz Booker Dewitt. Oyun Booker'ın borçlarını ödemek için bir iş alır ve bu işinde Elizabeth adlı bir kızı bulmak vardır ve borçlarını ödemenin tek yolu budur. Booker istemsizce de olsa teklifi kabul eder ve Columbia isimli havada asılı duran adeta cennet misali deyebilceğimiz şehrin yolunu tutar ama bu şehir kendinise peygamber deyen ve şehri kendi istediği gibi yöneten ve bütün insanların ona taptığı bir adam olan ve tabikide baş düşmanımız olan Zachary Comstock'dır. Hikaye aşağı yukarı böyle yani daha fazla şey söylersem spoiler olacağından korktuğum için yeter bu kadar. Biraz karakterleden bahsedeyim ana karakterimiz Booker geçmişinden kaçmak isteyen ama her ne kadar kaçamayıp bunu kabullenmekten başka çaresi olmayan bir tip kendisi sarhoş ve kumara düşkünlüğünden borca batmış tam anlamıyla hayatı bok gibi olan biri aslında. Elizabeth oyunda en sevdiğim karakter olmayı başardı. Hem gücü hem çevikliği hatta Booker'dan daha zeki olması bile yeter de artar ama en güzel tarafı ise savaştayken sandığınızdan daha çok yardım etmesi ben hep Elizabeth'i yük olucak biri olaral gördüm oyunda ama oynadıkça aslında öyle olmadığını gayette kendine bakacak biri olduğunu farkettim. Savaşta olduğumuzda Booker'ın cephanesi bittiğinde veya sağlığı düştüğünde yada tuza ihtiyaç duyduğunda Elizabeth bunları bize sağlıyor. Ara sırada ben etrafı araştırdığımda onunda araştırması ve para getirmesided gayet hoş. En azından savaştayken onun derdine çekmiyoruz bu baya iyi birşey. Comstock başdüşman olucak herhalde bu ne bilim oğlum adamı oyunda en fazla iki sefer gördüm poster heykeller filan hariç onlar her yerde oyunda anca iki sefer değilmi lan tek seferde olabilir bilmiyorum hatırlamıyorum o kadar kötü. Hiçbir başdüşman özelliği yok sadece peygamber kılığına girmiş bir tip diğer yan karakterleride hatırlamıyorum aslında sadecec oyunun bütününde görünüp sürekli konuşan ikizler ama hikayeyi bildikçe aslında onların bile ne kadar önemli olduğunuda göreceksiniz oyunda büyük parçaları var.\n\nOynanış. Klasik Fps Shooter oyunu yani diyecek birşey yok aslında pek sadece savaşta kullandğımız vigorlar var çesitlilik için ama o kadar kullanmayada gerek olmuyor aslında sadece çok sıkıştığımda götümü kurtarmak için düşmanları yavaşlatmak için kullandım başka bir marifetleri yok düşmana herhangi bir kaydadeğer zarar verdiği yok. Bazılıranı hiç kullanmadım bile 8 tane filan var ma genelde ateş atmak için yada elektrik atmak için kullandım götüm sıkışınca ara sırada düşmanı kendi tarafıma çekme ki ilerde para ile bu özelliği geliştirebiliyorsunuz düşman ele geçirme bitince direk ölme gibi bir özellik var yani kendi tarafına çektiğin düşman her türlü ölücektir Vigorlar bu kadar başka bir hatlları yok. Sadece kullanmak için tuza ihtiyacınız var bunuda dünya içerisinde gezeken bulabilirsiniz savaş sırasında da biterse zaten Elizabeth size sağlıyor zaten. Ve Silahlar malesef en fazla iki sefer taşıyabiliyoruz ki bu çok kötü be abi gerçekçi merçekci diyorsunuz ama yani fantastik oyun abi bu ver fazladan silah iyice klasik shooter oyunu olsun iki tane sıkıntı ama ben genelde altıpatlar kullandım ve ikinci olarak ya sniper genelde bu yada tüfekli silahlar kullandım genel olarak ama açık ara altıpatlar favorim direk tek atıyor abi çok fenaydı yani. Geliştirince daha güzel oluyor ki silahlarıda geliştirme var dünya içinde otomat denilen yerlerde hem vigorlar hemde silahlar için geliştirme yaapbilirsiniz. Belli bir alana girincede o alanı baya bir araştırdım yani sürekli paralar ve yab toplanabilirleri almayı çalıştım.\n\nGrafikler. Oyun gayet tatlı bir grafiğe sahip zaten Columbia harbiden cennet gibi bir yer yani müthiş canlı renkleri var ultra ayarlarda 120 150 fps arası alıyordum sabitlemeye gerek duymadım.\n\nSesler. Normalde bahsetmem ama oyunun bitiş jeneriğinde çalan soundtrack harbiden çok iyi ve oyunun bir yerinde gezerken bir bara girdim ve aşağı katlarda bir gitar vardı bakım dedim bune ? Sonra Booker eline aldı ve Elizabeth'de şarkı söyledi ki beklemiyordum ama şarkı harbiden iyidi uzun versiyonu Youtube'da var zaten şarkının adı ''Will The Circle Be Unbroken'' dinleyin tavsiye ederim.\n\nVe evet işte bu kadar bu oyunu oynayın ve kaçırmayın çıkalı 4 5 sene geçti bende yeni oynuyorum ama çıktığında her zaman oynamak istediğim bir oyundu ama malesef o zamanlar ezik bir laptop vardı yani onla hiçbirşey yapamıyorumda sonra çalışınca topladım abi pc'yi bir kaç ya sonra aldığım oyunlardan biri buydu indirime girmesini bekliyordum ve hemen çekmiştim neyseki oynadım diyorum. Kaçırmayın.

You have accomplished what you set out to do, and every cink in the story is finally explained; everything is tied together in a unity not many games accomplish (that is, if you actually understood the story and it's ending). \n\nThe 12 hour story builds up this anticipation; you are guided through the beautiful city of columbia, which at first it bright and vibrant, but gradually shifts to a darker tone as what is really going on is revealed to you. The beggining areas are especially drop-dead gorgeous and still stand up against modern titles released today however, later areas share the same atmoshphere akin to ealier Bioshock games but feel underwhelming in their presentation; I know the game can look great, I just wish this was maintained throughout the game, like why is columbia hidden behind clouds 90% of the time and why is it always night. That is not to say that the same level of detail isn't preserved on all satages however, since every level has secrets scattered all over; from voxophones to posters and displays which gradually explain the back story of different characters and the development and downfall of Columbia. It is good to see this was preserved from the original Bioshock.\n\nThis shift in tone is also represented in Infinites combat, where at first you will be fighting small bursts of enemies, to literal armies near the end of the game. Some people have complained that the combat is stale and 'too simple' however, I found it to be engaging and exciting; when you are flying around on the skyline and assassinating enemies from above, before using your vigors to set a swarm of crowns upon that one bullshit Handyman, what isn't to love? Speaking of Handymen, at first they may seem powerful, but once you realise you can use Murder of Crows to stun them, and then just spam Devi'ls Kiss, they go down like a piece of pie. Being the only 'difficult' enemy in the game, it's fair to say Infinite is an easy game. I also wish there wasn't a two weapon limit, since I essentially spent the whole game using the same two weapons (Machine Gun and Sniper Rifle), which pretty much makes the whole upgrade system pointless; why would I upgrade other weapons I would never use? The only reason I even changed loadout was because of a curtain section where Elizabeth is captured and you have to fight swarms of enemies with no ammo (and that fucking jumpscare). After that I went right back to the same loadout, after realising how OP the sniper rifle was; it instakills any enemy apart from patriots and Handymen (with all upgrades), but they go down in like 3 shots anyway. It's just good that the vigors keep combat engaging, and Infinite has a great selection to choose from. You have reincarnations of the original Bioshock's Plasmids, as well as great new additions such as Undertow and Bucking Bronco.\n\nInfinite also puts excessive development on it's character progression, and this is definitely not a bad thing. It was interesting learning how the Letuces (of is it just Letuce?) fit into the story, whilst bringing along a charm of humour, along with the change in Elizabeth, once she understands the truth; shown in her physical change about half was through the game. Infinite returns the use of characters for each level, with the likes of Slate, Fink and Fitzroy who you will encounter within the various stages. I guess if the formula works, why change it.\n\nThe general consensus with Infinite is that, while it is curtainly not as good as the first game, I enjoyed learning about the history of Columbia and how DeWitt fits into it's downfall. It's just a shame that the mojoraty of people probably won't understand it's ending, unless they have been keeping track of all the events throughout the game, and spent time exploring every nook and cranny for lore about the world. This would't be so bad if the ending wasn't so damn important, since it literally explains everthing in the game; Why Comstock exists, why Elizabeth exists and why you ended up in Columbia. Any fans of the original Bioshock will definetly enjoy Infinite, just don't expect to be blown away.\n\nI give Bioshock Infinite an 8.8 / 10 with the following categories:\n[list]\n    [*]Visuals: 9\n    [*]Combat: 7.5\n    [*]Narrative: 9.6\n    [*]Atmosphere: 9.4\n    [*]Enjoyment: 9.5 \n    [*]Game Integrity: 8 (few bugs present)\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1526768980,"timestamp_updated":1526769135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42126120","author":{"steamid":"76561198085425055","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":635,"last_played":1649389984},"language":"brazilian","review":"Achei muito bom, mas na minha opiniao so vale a pena com desconto, pois achei muito caro para uma campanha curta.

Dużym plusem jest ogólnie rozgrywka i zakręcona fabuła. Plusem jest możliwość noszenia dużej ilości gotówki zamiast posiadania ograniczonej pojemności portfela jak w poprzednich częściach. Wstęgi są ciekawym dodatkiem, ale np. haki już czasem się bugują i wskakując na nie możesz od razu się przekręcić w jedną stronę, a w drugą nie. Na maksymalnych ustawieniach graficznych gra działa dobrze, ale cienie trzeba zmienić na średnie, bo inaczej w dziwny sposób się rysują i wyglądają inaczej jak jesteśmy od nich dalej a inaczej jak bliżej. Znaczącym błędem w ostatniej części gry (na maksymalnych ustawieniach) jest też to, że wsiadając do windy z Elizabeth w Comstock House, aby zakończyć rozdział gra potrafi nie wczytać następnego rozdziału lub wczytać, że jesteśmy pod podłogą i umieramy lub, że słyszymy tylko odgłos zniszczenia naszej tarczy i nic się nie dzieje i aby grać dalej trzeba przestawić ustawienia na średnie i odpalić grę w oknie i powtórzyć rozgrywkę od ostatniego zapisu. Co do wad w samej rozgrywce to możemy nosić tylko 2 bronie na raz i nie mają one różnych typów amunicji w przeciwieństwie do poprzednich części kiedy nosiliśmy wszystkie bronie i każda miała 3 typy amunicji więc musieliśmy lepiej gospodarować zasobami czy nawet zastawiać pułapki. Brak jakiegokolwiek systemu badania wrogów obecnego w poprzednich 2 grach też jest dla mnie minusem. Brak możliwości noszenia z sobą apteczek i buteleczek też uznaję za minus. Wprowadzenie autozapisu i usunięcie możliwości zapisu ręcznego to dla mnie też minus. Osobiście wolałem zdobywać EVE w poprzednich częściach i za EVE ulepszać Plasmids niż jak tutaj ulepszać Vigors za gotówkę. Wolałem też za EVE kupować Gene Tonics i móc nosić ich wiele w zależności od mojego stylu gry i potrzeb niż jak tutaj używać na raz tylko 4 części ubrań dających pasywne zdolności. Minusem jest dla mnie też to, że ulepszenia do broni kupujemy za gotówkę w automatach, bo lepszym rozwiązaniem było zdobywanie ulepszeń do broni w specjalnych maszynach w poprzednich grach. Dużym minusem dla mnie jest to, żę gra w przeciwieństwie do poprzednich 2 części nie daje nam żadnych wyborów, które wpływają na zakończenie przez co zakończenie jest tylko jedno i nawet wymordowanie neutralnych NPC nie ma na nie wpływu.\n\nOgólnie bardzo dobra gra, ale jak dla mnie najsłabszy Bioshock.","timestamp_created":1526553746,"timestamp_updated":1526553746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpbPstuMCdtrCoAE="}
