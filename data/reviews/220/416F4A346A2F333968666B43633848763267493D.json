У новой части обновилась текстуры, офигенная физика, и отличный компьютерный разум (Или как там ето называется). Я могу ща повторится, но это не страшна, и лучше сказать сразу, что все части данной франшизы, являются самыми лучшими на все времена! \n\nСюжет: И вновь, ВЫ, Великий Гордон Фримен просыпаетесь после отдыха, просыпаетесь в Сити-17, где люди стали пораборащаны инопланетными существами комбайны. Само сражение велось, если я правильно помню (Если нет, то простите), 7 часов. После порабощение, людей стали брать и промывать мозги, и создавать из них комбайнов (Альянс). Теперь вам нужно разобраться со всем этим бредом, и возглавить сопротивление против захватчиков!\n\nГеймплей: Как было сказано ранее, у игры классная физика, а в остальном все так же, как и в первой части! Бегай, стреляй, только было добавлена функция (В НАШИ ГОЛОВЫ) думать! Были добавлены транспорт, обширный оружие, не так много, но грави-пушка стала прям конфеткой в этой игре. Я не говорил, но уже с 1 части, благодаря движка, появились некоторые интересные способы передвижение, по типу бенихоп! Это тип передвижение, когда вы прыгаете, и не нажимая кнопку вперед, а именно кнопки влево право, начинали быстро передвигаться! Их много, а может и нет, так что не буду перечислять прям все, но хотите на них посмотреть, то ищите стримеров, которые спидранят игру. Локации так же получились классными, и более разнообразными, чем первый, от переулков города, до пустынь, особенно классная Ревельхольм! \n\nМузыка: Ооо да, в этой игре есть несколько классных песен, которые были прямо отлично добавлены в туда, где им и место! \n\nКак итог: Что, основной сюжет разделился на несколько эпизодов, и предысторию виде vr игры! Но я точно не помню дату, но игра не закончены, второй эпизод вышел ай как давно, из-за чего хочется наконец то продолжение, но не будем об этом. Игра была не мало раз пройдена мной, у игры много плюсов, и огромная фан база, в которую ранее входил и я, но щас не в хожу, но это не значит, что я не люблю игру, я ее все еще люблю! \n10 Охеренной памяти из 10!","timestamp_created":1619564985,"timestamp_updated":1622911301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91027922","author":{"steamid":"76561199041033438","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":477,"last_played":1657857787},"language":"english","review":"hem?\n","timestamp_created":1619564307,"timestamp_updated":1619564307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489891141653060913","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91027720","author":{"steamid":"76561199037580267","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":387,"last_played":1620406830},"language":"brazilian","review":"----<Gráficos>----\n\n( ) Credo mano\n( ) Eu faço melhor no paint\n( ) Nhe\n(X) Bonitinho\n( ) Lindão\n( ) Caralho que tesão\n\n----<Requisitos>----\n\n( ) Instalei o jogo na calculadora e rodou\n(X) Potato core\n( ) Se tem 8 gb de ram e qualquer processador acima do pentium, roda\n( ) RTX 20 pra cima\n( ) PC da nasa passa mal\n\n----<História>----\n\n( ) Que história??\n( ) Sharknado tem mais roteiro\n( ) É mais ou menos\n( ) Boa\n(X) Brilhante\n( ) Isso aqui é uma obra de arte\n\n----<Gameplay>----\n\n( ) Mais travada que tartaruga paralítica\n( ) 2D Gostosin\n(X) Fluida na medida\n( ) É um jogo com mecânica diferenciada\n( ) Mundo aberto, mas parece linear\n( ) Mundo aberto com muita coisa boa pra fazer\n\n----<Trilha sonora>----\n\n( ) Um mudo cantando karaoke é melhor\n( ) Deixa mutado na moral\n( ) Ouve sua playlist que é melhor\n(X) Boa\n( ) Bem feito hein, que isso\n( ) Nível de dedicação de DOOM\n\n----<Ambientação>----\n\n( ) Fofinhooo\n( ) É tipo a vida real\n( ) Isso aqui é uma loucura\n(X) Te deixa de queixo caído\n( ) Da até um calafrio\n( ) Caralho mano, eu to em Silent Hill ?\n\n----<Nível de diversão>----\n\n( ) Era melhor ter ido assistir zorra total\n( ) Vai jogando e fazendo outra coisa\n( ) Cara, é bom até\n( ) Vai te prender por horas!\n(X) Meu mundo melhorou depois de jogar isso aqui\n( ) Melhor que sexo\n\n----<Dificuldade>----\n\n( ) Minha sobrinha de 2 anos zera de boa\n( ) Da pra salvar com uma mão só\n(X) Descente\n( ) Com um pouco de prática vai\n( ) Souls like\n( ) Deus perdoa, esse jogo não\n\n\n----<Bugs>----\n\n( ) A ubisoft tem inveja dos dev desse game\n( ) Bugs everywhere\n( ) Dá pra jogar\n( ) Os bugs deixam o jogo mais divertido\n(X) Um ou dois\n( ) Esse jogo desconhece a palavra bug\n\n----<Tempo de jogo>----\n\n( ) 0-2 horas - É aqueles hentais pra ganhar conquista\n( ) 2-8 horas - Curtinho\n( ) 8-15 horas - Tempo bom\n(X) 15-40 horas - Grandin né\n( ) + 40 horas - Depende de quanto você gosta do jogo\n( ) Final ?

\n\nFirst, the weapons in the game feels really great to use. \nFor example, you got the iconic Crowbar which can be quite useful to fight against Headcrabs, the MP5 which is a good weapon to use against weak enemies, the Shotgun which is a handy weapon against Zombies as you aim right through their head, the Crossbow to snipe enemies at long range and of course, the Gravity Gun which is really fun to use and is also a physic-based weapon that you can use against your enemies as you throw objects and also explosive objects right at them.\n\nYou'll also encounter different types of enemies during the game too such as the Combine soldiers, Zombies, Manhacks, Gunships and Striders which I like fighting up against.\nEach chapter in the game feels so unique which makes it feel different and adding some variety into it because of the Airboat section in Chapter 4, the Zombie-infested town segment in Chapter 6 and the Strider fight in Chapter 11.\n\nIn Half-Life 2, the atmosphere feels cold and dark as it fits the tone and has this dystopian sort of setting which I really like!\nThe exploration in the game is pretty good too because you can explore and discover optional/secret areas and search for hidden stashes and supplies. \nThe game has such memorable moments and plus, the physics engine is still impressive to this very day!\n\nI also like the music in Half-Life 2 as it feels so good to listen to and also keeps you pumping and hyped throughout the game while pushing through against your enemies.\nAnd in general, the gameplay feels good and fun to play as you fight through enemies, shooting explosive barrels against your foes, doing some puzzles, exploring areas, expanding your weapon roster which feels really satisfying as I find a new weapon to use, driving vehicles, avoiding hazards/traps and using different tactics against all sorts of enemies.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is such a blast to play and if you haven't played it already then buy it, because I would recommend you to and still, it is such a great game! It is one of the best games I have ever played and one of the best FPS shooters too!\n\nThis game still holds up well!","timestamp_created":1619559832,"timestamp_updated":1619560246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91025162","author":{"steamid":"76561199065022766","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":2877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2602,"last_played":1647316096},"language":"brazilian","review":"com certeza é um dos melhores jogos em questão de inovação, que para um jogo de 2004 é impressionante\n\neu joguei pela primeira vez no xbox 360 no orange box, e em uma promoção em 2020 eu comprei o valve coplete pack para re-jogar esse jogo incrível que rodava no meu notebook de 2011 que n abria nem o chrome\n","timestamp_created":1619559470,"timestamp_updated":1619559470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91025022","author":{"steamid":"76561198305480541","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1814,"last_played":1619933328},"language":"english","review":"You should all know by now this is a must-play game.","timestamp_created":1619559204,"timestamp_updated":1619559204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91023690","author":{"steamid":"76561198803222298","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":566,"last_played":1645902718},"language":"schinese","review":"难以想象2004年的交互比2020的游戏好的多","timestamp_created":1619557088,"timestamp_updated":1619557088,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498457521200180054","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91023409","author":{"steamid":"76561198380215742","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":742,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1619556482},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun başlarda sıkıcı olsa da ilerleyince çok sarıyo oynayın güzel bir deneyim","timestamp_created":1619556648,"timestamp_updated":1619556648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91023163","author":{"steamid":"76561198121710580","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":586,"last_played":1619555969},"language":"czech","review":"If someone has not played this yet, he should.

what can I say that hasn't already been said about Half Life 2 and it's following episodes?\n\nDon't let my measly \"20 hours played\" fool you-  with the amount of time I have combined in EP 0 and EP 1 & 2 as a whole on Steam including a few mods and the ungodly amount of times I replayed it before in the past back when it first came out on the Orange Box back in 2007- I definitely have WAY more than just \"20 hours played\" I'll tell you that! \nLittle me really had no idea what was in store for her when she picked up that little black and orange case for the PS3-\n\nI've practically grown up with the Half Life franchise- what with sharing the same birth year as the original Half Life 1 for one thing- and it's definitely whats shaped my tastes for gaming as it was my very first look at an FPS shooter, (considering my parents weren't gamers it was hard to come by things back then for me) not a bad choice if I do say so myself! \nPersonally, the Half Life franchise means a lot to me and I have so many wonderful memories of watching playthrough's, SFM's and GMOD videos made in and about the series that have all helped keep me attached still to this day, especially with it's revival thanks to Valve FINALLY putting out a new one- took you long enough guys!!\n\nI adore the characters, the gameplay, the amazingly unique musical score by Kelly Bailey, the weapons- even the overall general atmosphere in Half Life 2 where despite its dark and moody, depressing tone there's an underlying humour to thing's that's just so \"Valve\"- and nobody can just forget good ole Dr. Gordon Freeman, it'd be almost physically impossible! He's a popular guy.\n\nRest assured I'll not stop loving this game any time soon and if I'm honest I can't think of a reason on why I haven't written any kind of review for the series before now- other than perhaps I've been playing the game too much over the years to be able to do so ;)\n\n(This is a very personal review of course so it may not be too helpful to newcomers of the series but as you can see this game means a lot to me still despite how old it is so I feel like that's a good indicator to how well it still all holds up to this day
