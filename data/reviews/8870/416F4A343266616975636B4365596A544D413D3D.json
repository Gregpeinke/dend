Garrus from mass effect and the other games a cool but their traits are only really shown through narrative. with elizabeth she has interesing things to say and does minor things that make her organic such as cough in smoke or around smokers and not go into the mens room with you or run ahead so it seems shes not following you and getting in the way( \"skyrim\"cough). She also finds salts, health and ammo exactly when you need it.\n-Amazing voice acting\n-unqiue graphics\n-tons of underestimated vigors\n-MORE BIOSHOCK\n-gears add more varitey to combat with buffs like 75% chance to set enemies on fire with melee\n\nCons\n-salts.Unlike in bioshock 1 and 2 you had stacks of eve hypo's which you could use in seconds and have up to 9 at once while not breaking the flow of combat. In infinte you cannot have stacks and your vigors( espically in the beginning) consume SO much salt. example. the second you run out you are restricted to your guns and have to often run from fights just to look around or wait for elizabeth to find some.This restricts you and ruines alot of potenial combat had.\n-guns are generic and uninteresing\n-no more visable upgrades on your guns like in bioshock 1 and 2\n-SO much lore is missing\n-enemys are bullet sponges near the end of the game\n-Irrational wanted to make columbia feel alive. but you cant talk to anyone unless they talk to you at scripted parts of the game.bad move\n-the \"steal\" mechanic is bad  as in when you first see the red letters in say a box in a bar in a back room with no one looking you think you can take it safely. the second you open it people start screaming and others attack you. pointless\n-WHERE ARE THE DAMN GEAR BOOTS\n-restricions. example: a nun in a airship will use a moltov to kill herself and destroy the airship your in. you know this. you open fire at her and guess what? divine intervention or some shit because the bullets go through her.

As a shooter BioShock Infinite is OK, but as an RPG story it fails.\n\nI really like action RPG's. But the shooting mechanics of Infinite are only OK. They are certainly nothing special in battles without the skylines, which is to say, most battles. The vigors are underpowered to the point that I soon stopped using them at all in most battles. \"Possession for Less\" was the only upgrade I really found to be worth the high cost.\n\nWhile the technique used to tell the narrative is quite seemless within the action and applaudable, the actual story of Infinite, and how it is reveals itself, is diappointing. Ken Levine has a great imagination but an inventive plot doesn't excuse weak characters. \n\nI'm left scratching my head when reading reviews by people who think Booker and Elizabeth are such great characters. Booker especially is the stereotypical anti-hero; nothing special. Elizabeth is under-developed, her journey from someone horrified of murder to murderer seems too easy. \n\nIf the game somehow examined the kernals of identity in a closer way there may be some effective drama. But unfortunately the reveals of the plot are only an excercise in reveals. What's worse is that multiple universe theory seems to be the sci-fi writer's get-out-of-jail free card.\n\nMulitple universe can be used to explain anything. It is pure laziness disguised as ingenuity. You think that your pet isn't an intergalactic overlord hell bent on ruling earth? Well, guess what... in some universe she is!\n\nIt makes the whole thing feel cheap. \n\nWhy do we care about this Booker? Because he isn't Comstock? What about the Booker who is neither Comstock nor the one who had a daughter? \n\nWhy care about this Elizabeth? There are infinite Elizabeths who are kinder, or smarter, or who don't need help. \n\nThere are plenty of other stories that deserve more attention.

I've played a fair bit of Bioshock 1 on the PlayStation 3, but always got bored of it. It was an incredibly dull game. I'm wondering whether that's just part of the console experience after playing Bioshock Infinite on the PC. \n\nIt's not a challenging game. It stilll has the repetative elements of Bioshock 1, but just less off them. The levels are well designed for combat, with interesting use of interactive fixtures through tears and rails. The enemy AI is dull, and you won't find them circling around you or making good use of cover. They seem to move along set paths, repeatedly, as in A>B>A>B and will stay in the same spots. So if you fall back for cover or to lure them into a trap, they won't follow. \n In contrast to the dull grunts who make up most of your cannon fodder, slightly larger enemies like fireman and handymen deliver a very large amount of damage while soaking up bullets. They're also very mobile, have long range weapons that can pin you down, and will generally be the biggest challanges you'll face.\n\n The story suffers quite a bit. Like in Bioshock 1, when you first start the whole scenario of why you're there just doesn't make sense. I suppose this is to prompt you to explore and enjoy discovering parts of the backstory. Things become more apparant the further you go, but this makes me start out the game with little motivation. I found the ending boring and pointless. I was very disappointed. \n\n Overall, it's a fun, quick game to play when you just want to loose a few bullets to let off steam and relax. It's completely undemanding on normal difficulty, and something you can zone out while playing.","timestamp_created":1415110638,"timestamp_updated":1415110638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12786049","author":{"steamid":"76561198016059468","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1536,"last_played":1416068612},"language":"russian","review":"Один из самых глубоких сюжетов в истории игр.

Es un título que derrocha calidad desde donde se le mire, conservando su excelente estilo artístico y manteniendo la jugabilidad con concepto que siempre ha estado presente desde su primera entrega. Los personajes ahora toman un papel mucho más trascendental en la trama principal y se crea un ambiente propicio para hacernos sentir afecto por los mismos, preocuparnos por sus condiciones y decidir cuidadosamente cada cosa que queremos que hagan durante nuestra partida, todo controlado por un guion magistral, que en alguna que otra ocasión se pierde entre tanta ambición, pero que al fin y al cabo logra dejar huella y convertirse en lo que en un principio se propuso a convertirse. Es en éste título en donde vemos reflejado que para un artista, es muy difícil dejar a un lado todas las ideas que se le vienen a la mente, porque todas esas ideas forman parte de un todo. El artista debe comprender que hay que prescindir de muchas características para lograr una obra maestra, y es por eso que muchos de los íconos de Infinite aparecen solo cuando se necesitan, actúan cuando deben hacerlo y ofrecen su aporte a la trama en las cantidades necesarias. Es una obra maestra, y como toda obra maestra, tiene sus imperfecciones, y por eso mismo es que es un FPS de primera calidad. Si antes se pensaba que Bioshock tenía potencial, ahora sí que es algo que se puede afirmar con total seguridad; al fin y al cabo, hay muchas puertas, todas conducen al mismo sitio, pero de manera diferente. El DLC Clash in the Clouds se puede tomar como un entretenimiento pasajero mientras se pone a la venta el contenido descargable principal.

When I do want to know more about the world, it interrupts me every time. Its like being on a guided museum tour where the guide occasionally forcibly yanks you away from something you were looking at to play one of those silly target shooting carnival games. It visually promises an interesting rich world that it tries its best to keep you from getting engaged in.\n\nAs a shooter it fails. Its just killing things until the spawn counter goes down and every 5th or so thing is a slightly bigger thing. The shoot-out sequences are long and boring. While the ability to jump onto rails freshens it up a little, it does not save it from the bland enemies. Fighting enemies feels more like time padding. Its like grinding levels in a JRPG that has an interesting battle system, but gives you the same 3 enemies so you'll never have to use any of those elements.\n\nThe game tries so hard to hold onto what previous Bioshocks offered, it fails at delivering what could have been a fantastic new world to explore. I would like them to try making this again, but a little more focued this time. I understand a lot went wrong during the development. However, this is a review of the end product. \n\nIn the end, it is worth a play-through. Its just not good enough that I'd recommend it. Its an entertaining enough experience, but an utterly forgettable one.","timestamp_created":1415069062,"timestamp_updated":1415069062,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":45,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496410340070724487","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12781346","author":{"steamid":"76561198056407216","num_games_owned":286,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":543,"last_played":1419231358},"language":"english","review":"this is me after finishing the game\n\nhttp://goo.gl/hjfJ2l\n\nplay it","timestamp_created":1415067845,"timestamp_updated":1415067845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12770595","author":{"steamid":"76561197990694402","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":956,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":951,"last_played":1433018500},"language":"italian","review":"Si tratta di un lavoro curato nei minimi dettagli, in maniera maniacale, senza lasciare nulla incompleto o con qualche difetto.\n\nMan mano che si procede nel il gioco non ci si può che stupire del lavoro colossale che sta dietro ogni angolo di Columbia, dalla cura con cui sono progettate le insegne pubblicitarie, lo stile delle scatole, dei comodini, delle architetture, dei bagni o di qualsiasi altro elemento presente nel gioco, nulla è stato fatto senza ispirarsi ai primi del '900.\n\nIl gameplay è progettato per divertirsi senza doversi impegnare troppo, probabilmente per lasciare più spazio alle scene cinematografiche di cui tutto l'andamento della gioco è ricco.

The gameplay for Bioshock Infinite is a 7.5/10.  While I love the vigors and the elements that brings to the fighting arena, the weaponry and gameplay for fighting sequences is lacking. First, you're only able to hold 2 weapons at a time, and once you start upgrading them, you don't want to get rid of them for a new, un-upgraded weapon. I found myself holding onto the shotgun and machine gun the entire game simply because I had upgraded the power, ammunition amount, and range for both before getting to guns with more appeal. Like most games, if you shoot an enemy in the foot enough times, they will die, but headshots do critical damage which is nice for sniping a few before being thrown into the heat of it. The vigors definitely help the gameplay. Ability to set up traps before a battle brings a methodical element to it instead of just going ape**** on tons of enemies.  All that being said; the story makes the game. I have never played a game with such a compelling story.  Being a fan of Bioshock, I was skeptic about leaving the familiar atmosphere of Rapture.  But 2K gaming and irrational proved to make Columbia just as magical a place.  The atmosphere which was hauntingly and eerily beautiful, played to the plot wonderfully. A captivating story that is well worth the investment. With Bioshock sales, 2K sales, Season Sales, and Weekend Sales, the Bioshock series is on sale a lot. I would suggest purchasing the Infinite + Season Pass Bundle.  Burial at Sea was a beautiful DLC add-on that brought the characters from Columbia to Rapture in its heyday.  with a 7.5/10 for gameplay, a 10/10 for story, and a bonus +1 point for the atmosphere of Columbia, I give Bioshock Infinite a 18.5/20, a Must buy ranking","timestamp_created":1415044071,"timestamp_updated":1415044071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12765745","author":{"steamid":"76561198058996148","num_games_owned":356,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1651270717},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite games.

I replayed Bioshock 1 and 2 recently, actually the 1st one 2x now, because it is really that awesome. Coming from there to Infinite i had several disappointments. The visuals are indeed awesome (recommend you putting ambient occlusion to medium to get constant 100+ fps while textures etc are in ultra.., which is an excellent feeling) The story is easily a piece of shit, and also not easy to follow. The environment is huge and almost always open-air, but it makes it actually less interesting cause the only difference it will generate is that you walk more. It has almost no cohesion, the mood is really twisted (which is the only good thing). You don´t have the feeling you are actually in that word, can't identify yourself, there are no mentionable characters apart from your company Emily. It´s like you would combat through a dreamworld without having the actual feeling of living it. The combat system is HUGELY simplified, you always never get to use all the weapons and plasmids (vigors here), cause you wont need to, -unless somehow you dont find enough vending machines for ammo so you take what your enemies drop. The enemies are easily the most boring and repetitive elements of the game. At about 2/3 of the game i really wished for the ending, so i can leave the game finally....I could go on and on what i didn´t like about the game, but probably everyone should play it 1x through. (Though it is not even close to Bioshock 1.)

If you enjoy any kind of FPS like battlefield or call of duty give this a try. It is a nice change of pace. Bioshock comes with a really intense story to boot. This game requires you to actually understand whats going on instead of mindlessly shoot at stuff for no reason. The graphics are very good. I noticed a couple of glitchy stuff but not anything that would inhibit your gameplay. There isn't to many choices that you have to make but it is worth playing several times to see the different choices played out. My only real peeve with this game is that I feel like there is to much shooting. This is just a personal opinion not really a flaw in the game.

Being from the \"old school\" sci-fi System Shock 2, going backwards never really worked for me, but I could see the appeal.\nHowever, the steampunk-ish look of Infinite was appealing, not to mention colourful (unlike the first two, which were mostly blue and green, which got old fast). And colourful is it ever!\n\nGraphics aside, the game is a rather standard shooter - nothing has been reinvented here. It's very linear, very straightforward; had it held your hand any more than it did, I'd have called it a rail shooter.\nBut the gameplay is solid and certainly fun.\n\nHowever, the shooting aspect is not why you play this game. The narrative is what really keeps you going. I can't praise the writing of this game enough. It is convoluted at times, but it makes sense... in an odd, screwed-up sort of way. And hopefully opens the door to many more iterations within this universe.\n\nLong story made short, it's a really awesome game.\nHowever, worth at most 20$ as the game can be rather... short. I spent about 9 hours in the main game and finished the primary campaign... and I'm not sure it warrants a second playthrough for any other reasons than achievement hunting (which I really don't really care much about).\nGetting it at 15$ is really a sweet spot for me, but 20$, though higher than I'd really like, is still a very good price.\nGet it when it's cheap and you won't regret it!!","timestamp_created":1414968971,"timestamp_updated":1414968971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12753682","author":{"steamid":"76561198006765516","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1036,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1036,"last_played":1414970861},"language":"english","review":"Excellent.
