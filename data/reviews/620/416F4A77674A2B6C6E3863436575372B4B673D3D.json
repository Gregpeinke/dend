I've actually played this game on console, and played through both the solo and co-op campaigns multiple times. This is the sequel that Portal deserved for a couple of reasons:\n\nFirst off, the story falls right in line with the first game. It's in depth, and builds heavily around a tight group of fully fleshed out characters.\n\nSecondly I'd like to bring up gameplay. Just like the first one, no corners were cut with the physics in this game. The fact that the player can move so smoothly through the wide open test chambers makes the visuals that much more enjoyable, because there really are a number of awe-inspiring scenes.\n\nLastly I'd like to note why I bought this game a second time when I'd already played a considerable amount of it on console. I bought it for the community contributions and map editor. Playing fan-made solo and co-op maps are often more fun and more thought provoking than the actual puzzles in the game. The ability just to mess around in the map creator (with an EXTREMELY intuitive interface none-the-less) justified my second purchase of the game.\n\nOne of my favorite games of all time.","timestamp_created":1405588541,"timestamp_updated":1405588541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11284394","author":{"steamid":"76561198063895554","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":483,"last_played":1369358577},"language":"english","review":"First","timestamp_created":1405581111,"timestamp_updated":1405581176,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.264666736125946045","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11283769","author":{"steamid":"76561198053086286","num_games_owned":378,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1189,"last_played":1619322693},"language":"russian","review":"Классная игра!
