Your mouse sensitivity changes whe you are sprinting. Which is counterintuitive to the open level design which requires you to move around and pick off enemies. You can only carry 2 guns at a time, and in the second half there are hardly any vending machines to buy ammo from. I ran a carbine rifle and handgun the whole game, but later on I was forced to change my weapons of preference because I ran out of bullets in the middle of the ghost fight with nowhere to get bullets from, while Elizabeth threw meds at me while both my guns are zero and I'm out of salts too. [b]And a big -1 for the last tower defence simulator mission. Finally I figured that I was not supposed to use the bird on zeppelins but go in there myself. [/b])[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Narrative[/td]\n        [td]5 (My biggest gripe about the narrative was the playable character, and with extension his ending. And no, not just the fact that he has the inane likeability and charisma of a generic Far Cry protagonist. But that he had a backstory that HE KNEW and I didn't. [spoiler]Him selling his daughter and the baptism scene should have been the very first things shown in the game so as to tie it all full circle by the end.[/spoiler] But that information is withheld from the player and things are just built up more and more and more until the very end. I mean, it was FINE. Maybe even pretty good. I liked Elizabeth as a character, and I liked the twist. I just didn't like how they decided to show it.This is the perfect example of a game with a GOOD story but terrible storytelling.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Visuals[/td]\n        [td]9 (There's no doubt about the fact that Columbia looks great. The visuals are well done and even the fights with whatever they brought in in place of Big Daddies looked cinematic with that thing jumping around from floating platform to another behind me. It wasn't as stimulating gameplay-wise but it would have proved a good watch for someone watching me play and thinking what a great game I'm playing.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Mechanics[/td]\n        [td]6 (I've already talked about the sprint thing. It was a major gripe for me throughout my whole game and I never got used to the clunky mechanics. I would have given it a 7 if not for that. The shooting is fine. The skyline thing was great. It tied in the whole aspect of it being a land in the clouds together. They couldn't have given us Doraemon's Bamboocopter anyway, with the player crashing on invisible walls the whole time - and I think this was integrated well. Wish we had something like this in Rapture with the underwater setting - but it might not have made sense since Rapture is isolated from the water anyway.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Challenge [/td]\n        [td]5 (I always start games at Hard difficulty. And this game didn't challenge me half as much as Bioshock's big daddy fights. Most times I felt challenged was because of lack of resources and not well-balanced difficulties. There were hardly any enemies using the Vigors that was a huge missed opportunity. There was no scope of choice in which plasmids/vigors I wanted to equip. Around the last missions I remember the scene literally turned into a tower defense kind of game which was very annoying and soured the experience.)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Variety[/td]\n        [td]5 (Zero flexibility most of the time. But I don't really give that low of a score here just for the sake of effort. I remember I went to the graveyard place while exploring, before triggering the main mission that asks me to go there. There is a tear but I did not get the prompt of Elizabeth opening it. Then, when I went all the way back to talk to a door - now all of a sudden I want to open up her mother's grave and what not. This is what differentiates it from the likes of TW3, where these player agencies were taken into account.) [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Mapping[/td]\n        [td]7 (Columbia is very well made. As I said, the skylines tie in the map and gameplay well in together. But the people were weird. It somehow felt more dead at times than Rapture - which was literally dead. The level design in combat arenas was mediocre. But I'll still give the game a kudos to have a pretty memorable map anyway. The fact that it is compared to one of my favorite in-game environments of all time as its predecessor doesn't help the case - where almost every new area felt distinct despite having the same aesthetic. [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Soundtrack[/td]\n        [td]9 (The music was perfect. Whether the main menu one, or from voxophones lying around. It was very well done and established the setting very well. The combat music was stimulating. The voice acting was well done. While I don't remember any specific soundtrack specifically, I do think I'll be able to point out if someone made me hear any of em again.)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Interface[/td]\n        [td]7 (The main menu looks phenomenal. On the other hand though, there's some things I hated. I use the tab key to open the map or the 'mission menu' or whatever. And here I was locked to use Tab for what I use on Esc and Esc was already doing that anyway. I hate it when games lock keys like these out. I hated that in Just Cause 3 and I hate it now.)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Pricing & Performance[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Replay Value[/td]\n        [td]6[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\n    [tr]\n        [td]Online/DLC [/td]\n        [td]- (I will play the DLCs and update this later)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\n[/table]\n\n[b]SCORE : 6.7/10[/b]\n\n\n[url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hU-EeIPXVLoEmwcIPggkGa5bfc3ykvTxWwgTty-7Unw/edit#gid=0] Full list of Rated Games.

Afinal, ser melhor em tudo requer que não tenha falhas, que seja completo. E BioShock consegue e diria que vai além.\n  Você controla Booker DeWitt, um ex-agente de Pinkerton. Para poder pagar suas dívidas, ele recebe a proposta de ir para Columbia, resgatar uma garota (Elizabeth) e, assim, estará quite.\n\n  Este é apenas o início banal de uma história fantástica, com reviravoltas incríveis. Parte dela encontra-se em aproveitar a história ao máximo.\n BioShock Infinite acontece por volta de 1912 em Columbia, uma cidade flutuante e extremamente patriota (ela se considera os “verdadeiros” EUA). Ela é viva, lotada de NPCs (personagens não controláveis) fazendo coisas diferentes, cada um deles. Os gráficos são um show à parte, sem contar os efeitos sonoros. \n  É um shooter, baseado em três pontos: história linear (com exploração que te permite ir mais a fundo), tiroteio e poderes sobrenaturais. Os três estão em Infinite mais fortes do que nunca. Você terá que explorar todo o canto do cenário para adquirir itens e garantir que não morrerá nas batalhas; terá que evoluir suas armas e usar a munição com consciência e deve usar os vigores (os novos “Plasmids”, para quem jogou os outros da série) para, por exemplo, lançar bolas de fogo, corvos, água e até mesmo possuir (no sentido de controlar) objetos.\n\n  Mas a verdadeira atração de BioShock Infinite é Elizabeth. Cerca de 75% do jogo você estará acompanhado dela. Quando se pensa na adição de uma personagem acompanhando o seu, sem dúvida há uma preocupação em como isso afetará a sua diversão, principalmente considerado o fato de que se precisaríamos protegê-la. E aqui justamente o contrário acontece: Elizabeth protege você. Ela o auxilará com itens de tempos em tempos e não precisa ser protegida. Elizabeth inclusive adiciona elementos de gameplay nos combates – por ser uma pessoa especial, ela pode abrir o que chamamos de “fendas”: espécies de portais para um mundo paralelo e trazer, de lá, coisas que podem ajudá-lo em combate.\n  O charme de Elizabeth não acaba por aqui. Em vários momentos você se pegará vendo o que ela está fazendo pelo cenário. É incrível a sua programação: ela encostará em paredes enquanto espera pela sua coleta de itens, verificará papéis nas mesas e NPCs espalhados pelo cenário e muito mais. Isso sem contar os fatos “realmente” programados, para que a história avance. Sua expressão facial é simplesmente incrível, sem contar a excelente dublagem de Courtnee Draper.\n  BioShock Infinite possui algumas coisas que você sente que foram reaproveitadas dos jogos anteriores: principalmente os inimigos. A movimentação deles é muito parecida com os que estavam presente em Rapture, assim como os Handyman são os novos Big Daddy mas sem suas Little Sisters (mas neste caso a comparação é injusta, Handyman possui animações únicas, o que queremos dizer é que é um inimigo grande, que não “sente dor” e com muita vida). Fora isso há os Patriotas e alguns outros inimigos que usam vigores. Apesar de serem pouco variados, você não se incomoda com isso, pois o cenário de combate é sempre diferente (sem contar a ambientação de Columbia ser totalmente distinta de Rapture), tornando a batalha também diferente. E a cada instante você adquire um novo Vigor ou uma nova arma. No fim, isso não se torna um ponto negativo. E fica o alerta: o jogo é bastante desafiador (depende da dificuldade, claro).\n\n  BioShock Infinite é simplesmente perfeito. Todos os aspectos técnicos são de impressionar, a história é perfeitamente construída, possui diversão garantida e você se apaixonará por Elizabeth. A Irrational Games conseguiu novamente um jogo incrível.\n  Detalhe para as DLCs \"Burial at sea 1 & 2\"; as conclusões finais que encaixam as peças do enredo, se tornam OBRIGATÓRIAS após o fim do jogo, é necessário que tenha conhecido pelo menos o primeiro jogo da série.","timestamp_created":1572246875,"timestamp_updated":1572246944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605962276458740234","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55852092","author":{"steamid":"76561198258930490","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1338,"last_played":1636700032},"language":"schinese","review":"相当棒的剧情，伊丽莎白天下第一！！！！！！","timestamp_created":1572243109,"timestamp_updated":1572243109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55851158","author":{"steamid":"76561198073052525","num_games_owned":332,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1182,"last_played":1537735905},"language":"spanish","review":"[h1] Porqué la saga Bioshock es cool y tu no.

Bioshock infinite - это \"штучная выделка\". Она цепляет своей драматургией (к этому приложил руку её создатель - Ken Levine). Bioshock - это игра про историю, человеческие отношения, про персонажей - в первую очередь, конечно про Elizabeth. Elizabeth - это напарница, которая возведена в ранг главного героя.\nЧто касается боёвки в игре. Я бы не сказал что она слабая, просто недостаточно проработанная.\nДа,Bioshock - это шутер на арене (замкнутое пространство из которого мы не уйдём, пока не убьём всех).
