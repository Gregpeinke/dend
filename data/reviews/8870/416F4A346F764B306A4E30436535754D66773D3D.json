The rope is so tight and strong a knife couldn't pierce it. That's what you're coming into this game for, not the gunplay, not the powers, not even for the gratuitous kill shots, it's for the story. While they all work, that isn't what makes this game what so many people call a masterpiece. \n\nThe characters are endearing or utterly despicable in all the right ways, I felt myself caring for Elizabeth, to the point where whenever she was horrified at a gratuitous kill moment I actually felt guilty, and it got to the point where I just stopped using them entirely. By the end of the game you think there can't be any more twists to throw at you, but when they drop the final bomb it leaves you speechless as all those threads and ties and mysteries suddenly just drop down on your head like a ton of bricks, and it still doesn't stop because they even have an after the credits scene that raises even more questions. \n\nThe connections to Bioshock are loose but enjoyable, and hardly even necessary. This actually does raise an interesting question about whether it's easier to build a submerged city or a flying city? Regardless, this was not just a worthy addition into the Bioshock series as a whole, but to gaming itself, and, I would go so far as to say a shining example of excellent story telling in any entertainment medium.","timestamp_created":1499570515,"timestamp_updated":1499570515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33392412","author":{"steamid":"76561198078072072","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":1162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1012,"last_played":1550611784},"language":"english","review":"One of the few games out there to transcend the medium","timestamp_created":1499569340,"timestamp_updated":1499569340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33392298","author":{"steamid":"76561198080125781","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":826,"last_played":1546769145},"language":"english","review":"the ending fucks me real hard in the head\n9/10","timestamp_created":1499568971,"timestamp_updated":1499568971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33391560","author":{"steamid":"76561198041890582","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1086,"last_played":1499566009},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego si pero el DLC NO!!

The gameplay was smooth, and had its fair share of annoying bosses, controls worked like a charm as well. The real highlight of Bioshock Infinite is the story that perfectly blended in while you played. It made the game feel like reality, immersing yourself into the world created. Your companion throughout your journey was actually useful, as Elizabeth scoured the battlefield for ammunition, salts (basically mana potions), and health to aid you.

story。我希望他们可以公开更改海葬二的结局，不解释吃书可以，换个平行世界的说法也可以，出正传外篇可以，同世界观埋彩蛋也可以，做游戏可以，出官方漫画小说电影也可以。总之，只要让伊丽莎白有个好结局，你出什么我都买爆。反之，如果这样维持现状，能让老子在有生之年掏一分钱算你赢！\n\n---------以下为7月8日评测原始内容-----------\n\n伊丽莎白全程carry，捡红捡蓝捡钱捡子弹，标记火兵狙击手爱国者，杀器大鸟也是她的宝宝，突突突这么没技术含量的事还是不劳烦小姐姐了，让本菜鸡给你分一点忧……啊，我就是拿狙击枪当望远镜偷窥一下大胸嘛，你别转过去啊\n\n--------以下为7月10日添加---------------\n\n海葬已通关，评价还是不改了，但是，编剧滚过来，看到我竖起的中指了吗？\n\n--------7月11日---------------------------------\n\n继续写\n\n本体结局我没意见，屏幕里的布克是伊丽莎白的爹，屏幕外的我——就当是魂穿布克了——按照“女儿是父亲上辈子的情人”说，姑且算是伊丽莎白的情人吧。无论哪个身份，为她的自由和幸福付出生命，甘之如饴。然而，让她最终香消玉殒是几个意思？这真的有必要？追杀漏网之鱼和拯救小女孩是她的选择，大老爹的意外失控和裂隙能力的失去则完全是编剧的恶意。工作室解散在即，所以给自己的心血之作一个完满结局，这事我能理解。但为什么要以牺牲伊丽莎白为代价？为什么她的归宿就必须是暗无天日的海底？就因为她右手那一截失而复得的小指？只要剧本有心，在她为了寻回头发穿越裂隙后，有无数次机会无数种写法重获新生，别跟我提这样剧情不合理，再不合理，能比她最初获得上帝能力的理由更无厘头？让她再度撑开一个世界后功成身退就那么不可接受？为什么非要她用普通女人柔弱的双肩扛起整个系列故事的过往？再说一遍，编剧呢，你他妈给我滚过来，答我一句，凭什么？\n\n在这里，我要单独给DLC海葬第二部一个“不推荐”，潜行系统的不够完善是其次，最重要的原因是：我前进的每一步，都等于在懵然不知中将伊丽莎白推向死亡的深渊。从这个角度说，游戏制作人是刽子手，而玩家，就是你们手中冰冷的屠刀。\n\n理智告诉我，BS系列早已曲终人散，我不可能真正质问Irrational Games，让已成定局的历史改写，更不可能穿越到那个世界，为伊丽莎白挡下哪怕一丁点危险。但我默默企盼，企盼在某个平行宇宙的地球，不管IG工作室结局如何，他们的生化奇兵无限中，伊丽莎白终于拯救了所有的世界，终于安然漫步于巴黎明媚的阳光之下。街头的人们认识她，喜爱她，他们微笑着向她问好，为她画下美丽的肖像，递给她带着碳香的长棍面包。道路尽头的红色气球，也将成为她平凡生活的开始，而不再是通往地狱的路标。而在无奈的这个宇宙，我只能在抹干泪水后，在心中献上一朵百合花后，在涂完这些胡言乱语后，留下一个代表全部情绪的、向下伸出的、大大的拇指，这，就是我能为她做的全部了。\n\n谨以此，悼念我的伊丽莎白。\n\n-----------7月15日-----------------------------------------\n\n二周目开始，截图记录，路过的各位有兴趣可以来转转\n\n[strike]http://forelizabeth.blog.163.com/[/strike]\n\n就因为“自由”两字，zz网易把我博客封了……回归steam，内容陆续搬运至本人的指南\n\n-----------8月6日-----------------------------------------\n\n以下是我在某个无限剧情讨论帖的回复，贴到这来，字数限制，见评论","timestamp_created":1499516271,"timestamp_updated":1509253313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.711419224739074707","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33371833","author":{"steamid":"76561198081425048","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":4258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4258,"last_played":1499499201},"language":"english","review":"An

The cartoon-ish, but still kinda realisitc art style fits really well with the atmosphere of the game. The characters feel real and interesting.

유명한 바이오쇼크 시리즈의 3편\n하지만 전작들에 비해 꽤 달라진 전투 구조 때문에 약간 실망하게 된다.\n\n일단 무기. 전작들에서 10정에 가까운 무기+무기별 특수 탄약+강화제 조합으로 정말 다양하게 적들을 조질 수 있는 반면 본작에서는 2정 밖에 무기를 들고 다니지 못하고 특수 탄약도 없으며 강화제를 대체하는 장비 시스템도 부족한 구석이 많다.\n\n본인이 들고 있는 무기가 잘 안 먹히는 적을 상대할 때는 그 자리에서 적절한 무기를 주워서 써야 하는데 말이야 쉽지 정신없는 난전 속에서 무기를 바라보고 줍기 키를 꾹 눌러야 하는지라 매우 성가시다. 여기에 체력 회복제를 들고 다니지 못해서 전투 중 체력 소모가 심하고 잃은 체력은 전투 종료 후 적의 시체나 맵 상의 사물을 뒤져서 회복하는 식인데 이게 또 게임 속도를 늦춰서 은근히 짜증난다. \n\n무기/비거 업그레이드도 똑같은 돈으로 구입하는 식이라 업그레이드에도 제한이 생길 수 밖에 없고, 그만큼 전작들의 무쌍식보다는 전략을 잘 세우고 엄폐물을 찾아다니는 현대 FPS에 가까운 게임이 되었다.\n\n그렇다고 전투가 어려워졌나 하면 그것도 아닌게, 동료 엘리자베스가 잊을만 하면 회복제와 탄약을 던져주고 균열을 통해 아군을 소환할 수 있기 때문. 그래서 전체적인 난이도는 쉬운편에 속한다.\n\n그렇지만 비거의 활용도는 조금 아쉽다. 비거를 충전해서 사용하면 대부분 \"적이 그 위를 지나가면 고유 능력을 발동하는 함정을 설치하는\" 형태인지라 플라스미드에 비해 개성이 부족한 감이 있고, 대체로 정해진 루트를 따라 이동하다가 다수의 적들과 맞딱드려 싸우는 선형적 구조인 게임인지라 함정 능력을 적절하게 사용할 여지가 없다. \n\n선형적 구조 자체도 좀 어설픈 것이, 전작에서의 지역 탐험 요소를 억지로 구겨넣은 듯한 사이드 퀘스트가 그렇다. 그렇다고 열심히 사이드 퀘스트를 해결해서 나오는 보상이 대단한 것도 아니고...\n\n그래픽은 더 말할 나위 없이 훌륭하다. 20세기 초의 감성을 담아낸 유토피아 같은 외견 속에 숨겨진 차별과 편견이 가득한 디스토피아를 예술적으로 화면에 그려낸다. 말 그대로 이게 영화야 게임이야? 수준.\n\n스토리는 이전 시리즈처럼 큰 줄기를 두고 음성 기록을 통해 배경 설정을 덧붙여 보여주는 식인데, 때문에 음성기록를 꼬박꼬박 모아놓지 않으면 이해하기 힘든 구석이 조금 있다. 많은 것이 함축된 이야기니까 꼮꼮 모아서 꼮꼮

[/b] A game where the main protaginist/character is Booker DeWitt. A man on a mission to bring someone a girl in order to wipe away his debt. [b] But the game is much more than that. [/b]\n\n[h1] The Main Game [/h1]\n\nThe main game is most definitely a great experience, you start off on a boat sailing towards a lighthouse. The boat then comes to a stop and you journey up and into the lighthouse, at the top you find some sort of chair and Booker sits in the chair, what happens next is amazing... \n\nThe main game is a FPS based mystery type adventure where you go to many places in order the find the girl and wipe away the debt.\n\nI'd say my favorite part about the main game is definitely the mystery behind everything, nothing is fully solved until the jawdropping amazing ending unravels.\n\n[h1] Burial At Sea DLC [/h1]\n\nExclaimer: It is up to you to get the DLC but I would HIGHLY reccomend it as it is almost as great as the main game. The DLC also has 2 parts and both are very great.\n\nThe Burial At Sea DLC is by far extremely great! If you have played the original BioShock games you would realize that the Burial At Sea DLC is based in Rapture! This makes the DLC 10X better as i'm sure all of you fanboys/girls love Rapture! The story also involves Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth however they live in the city of Rapture and they embark on a journey to find a little sister named Sally.\n\nThe second episode has a lot of mystery to it, that is what makes it amazing.\n\n[b] Anyways that was my no nonsence, no bullshit review to BioShock Infinite.
