Lab experiment goes wrong and zombies (or Zed's in this case) overrun London and the surrounding countryside. Now what remains of the police and military must band together alongside the few survivors to try and fight off the hungry horde. \n\nWhat little more that is given in the way of story is told in boxes of text before each map. However at large the plot isn't groundbreaking, but that isn't particularly problematic for this sort of game.\n\n\nGameplay/Interface\n\nThe basic gameplay of Killing Floor is an online co-op Horde Mode, surviving waves of foes with chances to resupply between each wave. However it adds some of its own touches to the formula. Most notably is the additional of classes, or Perks as they are called here. Each of these Perks serves a different purposes and utilizes different weapons and perks, ranging from the melee focused Berserker who can wield a claymore to the Medic who can fire healing darts from their gun.\n\nIt also adds a leveling system for each trait that fills up as you complete certain task. As this level increases, certain stats improve and, in some cases, you even begin spawning with better equipment. This can range from beginning the match with one of your Perk’s weapons instead of the basic pistol to starting with the every essential protective body armor. \n\nAs for the Zeds, Killing Floor faces the players off with a variety of increasingly difficult foes throughout the 4-10 waves. Early waves generally start off comprised of the basic grabbing Clots and bile spewing Bloats, but build up to the fire spewing Husk, wailing Sirens and the ever dangerous Fleshpound.\nMatches then finish off in a battle against the powerful Patriarch, who wields a deadly arsenal of weaponry along with the abilities to cloak himself and regenerate. These foes will prove further challenging as players move up the Difficulty levels, from Beginner to Hell on Earth.  \n\nFinally the game provides the player with a wide variety of maps to fight their way through, including 5 core maps and an additional 17 added for free over a course of about a 5 year span. The games accompanying Steam Workshop further increases this number by boasting a wide range of fanmade content and maps, some of which were released officially as part of the additional 17.   \n\nThe only downside the game does have is its interface. Being originally created by a small team as a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004 means that its UI is functional but isn’t as spot on as it could be. It is all very basic and the placement of some important information, such as ammo reserve and player health are rather oddly placed. The control for the game can also take some getting use to, such as how to heal yourself or seal doors, and the game does not support controllers in any capacity. \n\n \nAnimation/Sound\n\nFor a game made by a 10 person team in 3 months, KF was decent animation and sound. Zeds have tells that allow the allow player to anticipated their action once learned. They are all have unique cries, allowing plays to know what's around even if they cannot be seen. Players also have a range of lines, all of which are delightfully British, some of which have even become beloved memes among fans. The whole visual/audio experience is rounded off with a soundtrack comprised of intense metal, fitting the gritty B-Movie feel of the whole game.  \n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nKilling Floor is easy to enjoy both with friends or complete strangers online. The game has a thriving community, even after 7 years and the love they have for the game is very apparent. So if you're thirsting for a little zombie killing action in the vein of Left 4 Dead, I recommend giving it a try. So grab some mates, strap on some body armor, grab your incendiary shotgun and go make some sweet sweet dosh slaying Zeds!\n\n\nCheers!\n~Fish","timestamp_created":1386053222,"timestamp_updated":1477202208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7891846","author":{"steamid":"76561198027842342","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3474,"last_played":1610950691},"language":"english","review":"This is a great casual shoot-'em-up zombie game.

Military experiments went wrong and people started to make you pay euros for weapons when you are trying to stop the infection. Those fucking idiots.\n\n        This game is alright when you play by yourself but when you get together with friends, it gets 10x more fun and interesting to play. The game doesn't really have any in depth story but its fucking hilarious.  \n\n       When you get to play at least 45 hours of the game it really starts to die down once you've played and beat every map.\nThen you gift your friend the game when you're already bored of the game, you play it with him for about 10 hours total, then you uninstall the fucking game cuz its boring as fuck, then he bugs you to play the game with him/her. When you actually see how FUCKING STUPID THIS GAME you realize that this game is only fun for a fraction of the day and that you will never play again. It's a dust collector on the shelf of your steam library. 10/10\n","timestamp_created":1385883394,"timestamp_updated":1385883394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7857713","author":{"steamid":"76561197998238133","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2019,"last_played":1658539051},"language":"english","review":"Its a Game!","timestamp_created":1385875814,"timestamp_updated":1385875814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7855504","author":{"steamid":"76561198096460984","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1712,"last_played":1379210243},"language":"english","review":"twas fun to play. that and very fustrating :D","timestamp_created":1385863057,"timestamp_updated":1385863057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7855116","author":{"steamid":"76561198067054414","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":51338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37826,"last_played":1484347644},"language":"english","review":"I have played this game far too much for my own good, but it is absolutely fantastic.  The classes add nice diversity and there are plenty of weapons for each.  Should you want more you can always buy the dlc, but they are by no means required.\n\nThe game prioritizes teamwork (especially on higher difficulties) and has a great community.  Many people helped me with learning the ins and outs of the game when I was new and there are plenty of resources for each class.\n\nWould seriously recommend this game (especially if you can grab it on sale).  I've gotten hundreds of hours out of it so it was well worth the price.","timestamp_created":1385861184,"timestamp_updated":1385861184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50113379955291748","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7854947","author":{"steamid":"76561198075784198","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":1506001094},"language":"russian","review":"))","timestamp_created":1385860322,"timestamp_updated":1385860322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7854602","author":{"steamid":"76561198063100341","num_games_owned":364,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3297,"last_played":1634432964},"language":"english","review":"This game may seen like another zombie shoot em' up but its WAY more, with seasonal events like Twisted Christmas and Summer Side Show it adds a flair other games like this can only dream of.

While it does hold on to the aspects of a post-apocalyptic, that make the genre likeable, it also puts an interesting twist on it. You and team of 5 others are pitted against a set amount of rounds, each getting more difficult. Teamwork is required to survive and make it to the end. All of this put together makes for a great game.
