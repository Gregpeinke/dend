This game that now is about 5 years old STILL beats a lot of recent AAA games.

Going though portals.\n\nNow there is a downside... ish... Not really a bad thing but I beat the game in 7 hours, which I assume is average. So there is \"only\" 7 hours of main story play time. Well, depends on if you're better or worse at the game obviously. But there is a little PC exclusive thing in this game that makes up for that. That is Community Levels. And well, they're levels built by the community. That should add a lot of play time. There is also a (not PC exclusive) CO-OP mode!

The United States was particularly unhappy with Japan’s increasingly belligerent attitude toward China. The Japanese government believed that the only way to solve its economic and demographic problems was to expand into its neighbor’s territory and take over its import market; to this end, Japan had declared war on China in 1937. American officials responded to this aggression with a battery of economic sanctions and trade embargoes. They reasoned that without access to money and goods, and especially essential supplies like oil, Japan would have to rein in its expansionism. Instead, the sanctions made the Japanese more determined to stand their ground. During months of negotiations between Tokyo and Washington, D.C., neither side would budge.

Great continuation of the plot from the first Portal, with very entertaining dialogue from both Wheatley and GLaDOS. The story is pretty long and becomes the tiniest bit tedious at times, but overall it is worth it. As always, love the song in the end credits! Very cute! Additionally, the co-op is extremely fun, and a little more challenging as it is somewhat more complex than the challenges from single-player.

I really enjoyed the first portal.  It made me rethink what was possible to do in a game and had me laughing a few times too.  All in all, it felt like a DLC to Half-Life 2; they are in the same universe anyway.  On the other hand, Portal 2 felt like a fresh/new experience ready for me to invest more hours into.  With an awesome intro, Portal 2 had me hooked from the very beginning, it had trickier puzzles, a better interface and more laugh out loud moments than before, most of which came from the multiplayer.  Adding multiplayer/coop into the game was probably one of the better decisions when making Portal 2.  I found myself laughing my  ass  off with my friend as we went through the suprisingly challenging courses by the creators and even the community!  All in all Portal 2 will most definetly keep you entertained through its really good campaign about testing stuff, once again.  And the multiplayer will keep you satisfied and laughing for years to come.

Man kommt in eine Testkammer, man hat nichts als die Portalkanone und seinen Verstand, und man muss aus dem Raum wieder rausfinden.\nDieses Spiel hat einen so extremen Suchtfaktor, wie ich es noch nie erlebt habe. Ich habe Nächte gehabt mit sehr wenig Schlaf, weil ich wusste: Es gibt eine Lösung, es gibt einen Weg zum Ausgang. Ich muss ihn eben nur finden.\n\nEin perfektes, ein geniales Spiel. 11/10.
