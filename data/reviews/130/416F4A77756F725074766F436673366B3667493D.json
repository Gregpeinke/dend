Ну дословно это переводится как \"Период полураспада: синее смещение\", хотя и непонятно причем тут \"синее смешение\". Ну а если вы про игру - то это модификация к Half-life выпущенная компанией Gearbox Software. \nВкратце повествование истории ведется от лица охранника Барни Калхуна во время каскадного резонанса в Black Mesa. Хотя если учесть что Half-life 1998 года использовала модель охранииков в виде Барни, то непонятно от лица конкретно которого Барни идет повествование...\n[hr][/hr] Управление в этой игре ужасно, в прочем как и в Half-life 1998 года, но для игры того времени - это нормально.\nИз плюсов отмечу, что в этой модификации бойцы HECU умеют обращаться с подствольным гранатометом, поэтому даже на сложном уровне сражение против них - это целое испытание. А также плюсом является тот факт что модель оружия - это винтовка M16 с подствольником, а не SMG MP5!\nИз минусов - это балансные правки на сложном уровне игры. Иногда порой кажется: что все винтовки стреляют травматикой, а не пулями. Поэтому и приходится всаживать 1.5 обоймы в одного вортигонта, чтобы тот умер. \n[hr][/hr] Как итог - только 3.9 из 5 баллов заслуживает от меня эта модификация...","timestamp_created":1625792587,"timestamp_updated":1626088260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529411733150482178","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95366267","author":{"steamid":"76561198395960380","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":110,"playtime_forever":140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66,"last_played":1627838758},"language":"turkish","review":"Half Life furyasına övgüler yağdıran kitlede bile şu DLC oyunları bilmeyenler vardır mutlaka.

Este es la segunda de las tres expansiones que tiene Half-Life.\n\nHALF-LIFE: BLUE SHIFT \n\nEn este juego vivimos de vuelta el accidente de Gordon, desde el comienzo vamos por un morriel viendo todo Black Mesa como en el HL original. Solo que ahora somos Barney Calhoun, uno de los muchos guardias de seguridad de Black Mesa, quien vive al mismo tiempo que Gordon Freeman el incidente de Black Mesa, pero en otros momentos y lugares. De echo, a penas comenzamos vemos a Gordon pasar por detrás nuestro\nBarney Calhoun es responsable de la preservación del equipo y materiales del Sector 3.\nCuando pasa el problema de la cascada de resonancia, Calhoun queda atrapado en un elevador con dos científicos. Él despierta en el fondo del eje de elevación, y pronto se encuentra luchando en áreas subterráneas para alcanzar la superficie y escapar. Nuestro príncipal objetivo es rescatar a un tal Doctor Rosenberg (Que también forma parte de HL:Decay) y cuando lo hacemos este advierte a Calhoun de que el complejo ha sido rodeado por los infantes de marina, mandados a matar a todo el personal de investigación del Black Mesa. La única manera de escaparse, explica Rosenberg , es utilizar un viejo prototipo del teletransportador de una antigua parte de Black Mesa, temporalmente abandonada, donde algunos de los más antiguos miembros del Personal de Black Mesa intentaban ya utilizarlo; con él pueden alcanzar una salida de Black Mesa que ha sido pasada por alto por los infantes de marina. Es decir, escapar por un portal.\nEntonces, Calhoun, Rosenberg y otros dos científicos intentan arreglar el teletransportador. Calhoun lucha con infantes de marina y extraterrestres, mientras que los tres científicos huyen. Finalmente Calhoun vuelve con seguridad a la salida de la Black Mesa con los tres científicos. Siendo el único juego con final \"Felíz\"\n\nDatos innecesarios: En el final de Half-Life G-Man recluta a Gordon Freeman y también detiene a Adrian Shephard en Opposing Force para asegurar su silencio. Sin embargo, en Blue Shift, Barney y los tres científicos escapan de Black Mesa y G-Man no aparece...\n\nEn mi opinión, es el más flojo de todos dado que no presenta algo muy innovador como OF, no tiene tanta armas nuevas (solo pocas) y tampoco presenta nuevas amenazas ni un boss final como nihilant, solo un enfrentamiento con soldados, no tiene muchos capitulos pero siendo una expansión no está mal, hay algunos puzzles pero no son muy complicados. Sin embargo es un juego digno, y para pasar un buen rato lo recomiendo bastante. 9/10","timestamp_created":1625488675,"timestamp_updated":1625488675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95103271","author":{"steamid":"76561198836846204","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1630262881},"language":"russian","review":"Барни, Мишка","timestamp_created":1625488061,"timestamp_updated":1625488061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95096493","author":{"steamid":"76561198404961045","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":353,"last_played":1625333471},"language":"english","review":"Old school hardcore FPS, set the standard for FPS today and even 3rd person shooter.","timestamp_created":1625480090,"timestamp_updated":1625480090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95082178","author":{"steamid":"76561198323900282","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":32,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1578063848},"language":"russian","review":"да","timestamp_created":1625459968,"timestamp_updated":1625459968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95081148","author":{"steamid":"76561199111135335","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1625457784},"language":"spanish","review":"Esta expansión es buena, pero Opposing Force dejó la valla muy alta. \nBlue Shift conserva la esencia de Half-Life 1, y por eso lo hace un buen producto.

Barney could have missed his day of work and not a single thing would have changed for the original game/story.\n\nWeak sauce.
