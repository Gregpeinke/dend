They gave us a new character AI to talk at you. They gave us Glados. They gave us the backstory to Glados. They gave us the backstory to Aperture Science. They expanded the world. The new song isn't as great as \"Still Alive\", but it's still sung with as much gusto.\n\nPortal 2 also has a cooperative mode (which I suppose would be the sequel to the single-player campaign), which I haven't tried (because I generally don't do multiplayer), but it's certainly a step in the right direction. \n\nAlong with new puzzles, there are new mechanics, including different types of gels, different ways of moving around, and lasers. I wish there were more lasers. I love lasers.\n\nSo, yeah, great game, especially if you like multiplayer.

Überhaupt empfehle ich, Portal zuvor zu spielen, nicht zuletzt, weil die darin erzählte Geschichte merklich aufeinander aufbaut.\n\nDie wesentlichen funktionalen Erweiterungen zu Portal sind:\n- Es gibt einen Koop-Modus, in dem man zu zweit rätseln kann. Entweder lokal oder übers Internet/Steam. Die Rätsel fand ich ziemlich fordernd.\n- Es gibt einen Workshop mit sehr vielen von Usern erstellten, oft sehr guten Rätseln.\n- In der Solo-Kampagne gibt es ein paar neue Features, insbesondere die Soßen.\n\nDas Solospiel bestreitet man wieder mit Chill als alter ego. Ebenso gibt es wieder Begleiter, sichtbare und unsichtbare, die unglaublich amüsante, süffisante, euphemistische und kaltschnäuzige Kommentare abgeben. Neben den bekannten Testräumen gibt es sehr viele freie Abschnitte, die aber letztlich auch linear aufgebaut sind.\n\nBe3sonders \"gefallen\" hat mir Cave Johnson, der Gründer von Aperture Science, der Firma, die den riesigen unterirdischen Komplex gebaut hat.\n\nMehr wird von der Geschichte hier nicht verraten. Sie ist jedenfalls originell.\n\nDie Schwierigkeit der Rätsel ist merklich höher, auch wenn sie nie unfair sind.\n\nDas Spiel ist auch deutlich länger. Ich habe etwa 12 Stunden gebraucht, man kann es aber auch deutlich schneller durchspielen.\n\nIch hatte fast keine Schwierigkeiten, das Spiel unter Windows 10 zu spielen. Nur beim Starten des Spiels ist es (anders als vorher unter Windows 7) bei mir ab und zu abgestürzt, wenn der PC schon etwas länger lief.\n\nPro & Contra:\n+ Mindestens so gut wie Portal\n+ Gute aber lösbare Rätsel\n+ Gute Grafik und Steuerung\n+ Amüsante Geschichte\n+ Vernünftige Kontrollpunkte zum Wiedereinstieg\n\n- (fällt mir nichts ein)\n\nWertung: 10/10\n\nDas Spiel ist, insbesondere im Doppelpack mit Portal (1), ein Highlight des Rätselspiels.\n","timestamp_created":1492717918,"timestamp_updated":1492717918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586263418197631836","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31262220","author":{"steamid":"76561198065222774","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":678,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":211,"last_played":1545499167},"language":"russian","review":"Ты - чудовище!

Because everyone should experience this masterpiece. The puzzles are really hard sometimes, but incredibly fun to solve. But the parts where this game really shines is its story, and aesthetic. The story is perfect. Even the humor works which is something not every video game can manage to pull off. The story has extremely memorable characters, but a dark tone and amazing pacing. The aesthetic of this game is classic Valve. This is why they are the best game developers on the planet. The aesthetic changes throughout the story, but maintains this dark and hopeless mood, with humor thrown in. Its simply perfect. 10/10","timestamp_created":1492553068,"timestamp_updated":1609297098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3o3GwdsCc8GPdw=="}
