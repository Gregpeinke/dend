Кен Левин создал то, чего так не хватало игровому мейнстриму - игру, по прохождении которой, приходится думать . Правдивая история: после завершения игры, я, в 3 часа ночи, пошёл на кухню, зажёг свечи и курил сигареты. Одну за одной. Сравнение с американскими горками, что я проводмл ранее и не здесь - слишком мягкое. Тут не просто горки, а горки с Луны до Юпитера в 5D. Пожалуй только так можно описать весь ВОСТОРГ (отсылка, да) после первого посещения Коламбии. И после второго. И после третьего. Да так можно до бесконечности продолжать (недаром подзаголовок такой).\nУглубляться в сюжет, на мой взгляд, - не стоит.

The voxophones that are scattered around the campaign are a good way to get deep within the story and background story also.\n\nGameplay-wise it was good. The weapon variety could have been a little better. The mouse sensitivity was alittle difficult to get used to. There were some random audio issues and it would randomly load in the middle of a fight for no reason. these small issues were a little frustrating and need to be fixed cause it really takes tehe player out of the mood and feel of the game when these issues are present.\n\nThe game is a bit long for my liking but i kind of expected it since it is a Bioshock game.

Embora guarde algumas ligações com os primeiros jogos, não se trata de uma sequência direta.\n\nA trama novamente aborda temas polêmicos, como religião e política, e desta vez se passa nós céus, em uma cidade voadora chamada Columbia. Você controla o protagonista Booker, que está na cidade para resgatar uma garota em troca do pagamento de suas dívidas. No entanto, sua missão acaba sendo alterada por diversos acontecimentos que culminam no final mais surpreendente de todos os tempos. Felizmente a forma como se dá a exposição dos fatos foi consideravelmente melhorada, o que ajuda bastante a entender os fatos que se passam.\n\nO jogo é visualmente lindo. Os cenários beiram a perfeição, com edifícios, roupas, e até mesmo costumes do moradores fiéis a época. Cada parte da cidade foi muito bem elaborada, com alto nível de detalhamento, além das expressões faciais dos personagens serem bem bonitas. A trilha sonora temática da época também contribui para tornar toda ambientação ainda mais envolvente. No entanto, o jogo perdeu aquele clima macabro dos jogos anteriores, o que não vem a ser um defeito, mas apenas uma mudança.\n\nOs combates estão agora muito mais dinâmicos, e os inimigos além de terem uma inteligência artificial inacreditável, também são muito mais numerosos. Ainda assim, o jogo está mais fácil graças ao escudo regenerativo e a ajuda de Elizabeth. Além disso, achar o caminho certo ficou muito mais fácil, pois além de estarem menos tortuosos, há uma seta verde que auxilia a encontrar a passagem correta. É um bom mecanismo para sabermos qual será o último caminho a ser tomado, já que vale a pena explorar cada canto do mapa.\n\nEm Columbia, também existem situações em que o jogador deve fazer escolhas, mas infelizmente, elas não têm nenhuma importância, e se chegam a mudar alguma coisa, trata-se de algo irrelevante. Pela forma como ocorre o final, é até compreensível que as escolhas não afetem o desfecho, mas ao menos alterações concretas na campanha eram esperadas, e sua falta foi desapontador.\n\nUma coisa curiosa é que apesar de o jogo estar com legendas em português, não há legendas para a reprodução das gravações encontradas pela cidade, nem mesmo em inglês, o que força o jogador que as quiser ler ir até o menu. Mesmo sendo algo meramente cosmético, não deixa de ser uma coisa negativa.\n\nEm resumo, Bioshock Infinite é uma experiência única. A ambientação é provavelmente a melhor já criada para um jogo, e a história excepcional e de alta complexidade tem um desfecho totalmente inesperado, que certamente irá superar suas expectativas.

Takes about 10-20 hours to play and is a great offline game (why I don't have more hours into this).\n\n The story mixes with the actual game and makes a great combo the fighting is never boring due to the combination of guns and vigors (magic). The combat itself is hard and forgiving because of the fall back to a checkpoint style of death while at the same time keeping with the story which every part of this game does perfectly, there's no meta game moments which brings the world in a beautiful way to you, uninterrupted by gameplay. The game is fresh and unique while at the same time familiar and easy to grasp again.\n\nThe story is that of the best I've played for a long time and without giving away spoilers its one you most likely won't get until the game tells you. It gives you the nice twist you (should) expect and it ties it off, yet in a way that allows for another game after this.\n\n=== Complaints:\n\n Choices don't matter in this game but they still make the world different and... well its related to the story.\n\n There are no puzzles like I expected... aside from [spoiler]The one in the very beginning regarding bells[/spoiler] and that... that's a joke.\n\n Easy mode is... nothing normal is easy hard is normal and 1999 (konami code) is hard. by that I honestly mean that hard (normal) makes you use your skills and your guns or else, you can also make it through without any back tracking or grinding for money. Easy you could probably use your melee through the entire game. 1999, is the hard mode you expect, requires precision and sometimes may involve an actual use of vigor combinations along with just about anything else.\n\n Last is the vigors... they are great and each person has their own favorites, once you find yours you wont stray too far except in some situational use.\n\n=== Warnings/Spoiler free tips:\n\n If you fancy yourself a seasoned gamer I would recommend entering the konami code at the main menu (where you get an options menu) this will give you a tougher game mode and you don't have to repeat the game in hard / normal / easy. (although I will still play the game on the harder mode so that I can revisit and re analyze the game.)\n\n Pay attention.\n\n Collect the voice recorders to uncover the full story.\n\nStory: 10/10 (WoAh, watch out for that twist)\nGameplay: 9/10 (FPS, not very exciting. +Vigors or else it would be 7)\nPresentation: 10/10 (Good style)\nSoundtrack: 7/10 (Non memorable, a few snipets of pop culture type of music)\nReplayability: 5/10 (If you do it will feel like a chore, or that you have been betrayed by the game.)","timestamp_created":1389668656,"timestamp_updated":1408853603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.703684449195861816","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8699713","author":{"steamid":"76561198019860271","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1278,"last_played":1405122308},"language":"spanish","review":"juegaso, buenas graficas, buena historia","timestamp_created":1389665570,"timestamp_updated":1389665570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8699591","author":{"steamid":"76561197965231197","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3601,"last_played":1397698383},"language":"german","review":"Favorite Game 2013","timestamp_created":1389664859,"timestamp_updated":1389664859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8699056","author":{"steamid":"76561197962285215","num_games_owned":1554,"num_reviews":148,"playtime_forever":1710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":795,"last_played":1420484083},"language":"spanish","review":"el joc està molt bé, grans grafics i control, potser l'unic negatiu pera mi es que és massa \"consolaire\".
