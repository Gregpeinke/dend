IT'S A CLASSIC AND I STILL CONSIDER IT TO BE BETTER! \nI can't believe I forgot to write a review of this game! Well, let us just say that Portal 2 is a game unlike any other. It combines the always interesting portal gun mechanic with hilarious humor and a deep, incredible storyline that is left in mystery. The graphics fit the game very well, and are a great example of the full capacity of the Source Engine. The puzzles are fun and each one is different. They vary in difficulty, but none are so difficult that they cause frustration. The soundtrack is truely awe inspiring. I still find myself listening to \"Science is Fun,\" \"Bombs for Throwing at You,\" and the ending song among other great parts of the soundtrack (I recommend listening to the entire soundtrack if you ever have to study for something! It makes it MUCH better!). The co-op is some of the most fun I have ever had with my friends in videogames. It is funny, challenging (but not too challenging), and a good chunk of game that will take you and a partner a good while to complete (depending on how often you play). The Perpetual Testing Initiative was also a great addition, and allows you to try puzzles of many difficulty levels. There are also some awesome custom co-op campaigns. The game also has some cool mods to try, and there are many other interesting ones coming out soon. The only problem with the game is that it has no sense of replayability, although I really don't see that as much of an issue. A really fun thing to try is to make a friend who has never played the game try it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Overall, Portal 2 is easily one of the greatest games I have ever played, and is probably one of the best games ever created. Despite its greatness though, I still retain the opinion that the original Portal is better. Play it first. The stories link together strongly, and the atmosphere and feel to the original is extremely well developed. Portal 1 is some (mostly) serious art. Portal 2 is art with a splash of fun. Bottom line is, you have to play Portal 2, but you also have to play Portal 1 first.","timestamp_created":1412042683,"timestamp_updated":1412042683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12295913","author":{"steamid":"76561198022820771","num_games_owned":555,"num_reviews":155,"playtime_forever":628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":628,"last_played":1411770780},"language":"english","review":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJQfIyd7zrU&list=UU7_-PLIhjsEBwIQXqKxmNpA\n\nPortal 2 is a first person puzzle game with excellent physics challenges.\nIt is a second part of the story from the first Portal game.

Great game and storyline. Thought I'm very late on Portal 2. It's been out for a long time now and I waited for a good time to buy. Purchsed it on sale for a good deal. (Even better then the Summer Sale price)\n\nI was very pleased with the puzzles and gameplay in the first one so I did not watch any trailers or youtube any game play for Portal 2 because I knew I was going to enjoy the game no matter what. I'm very glad I finally made the purchse. Portal 2 was a short game like the first one but the storyline was truly awesome and I felt like my life was complete after seeing how it ended. \n\nI did like the fact that the game play was changed around a bit as in the \"Paint\" aspect of it. Threw me off guard with some of the solving. Had to think a little deeper to progress forward. I think i raged maybe a total of three times? Took a break then came back.\n\nI beat the game within 10 hours to be exact. Same exact hours it took for Portal 1. \nTo be fair and defend the shortness of Portal 2. I must say Valve added alot of goodies and extras to enjoy. Such as creating your own test chamers and making blue prints to upload to the community for others to play. \n\nPortal 2 also has an online Coop. You and a friend to tackle the test chamers. \n\"Are you still there?\"\n\nGood!
