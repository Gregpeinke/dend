Hella zombies. Science. Scientific zombies. Scientifically Accurate Zombies.\n\nThis game magic point is a cooperation between players. Cooperation due to survive. Survive the waves full of nasty zombies. You can kill them but you can't get rid of them. You can run, but they will eat your heart out before the sunrise.\n\nGame takes a place in England. You can feel the british accent in the character and npc(from the objectvie mode) voices, which is bloody nice.\n\nZombies are full of variety, but you also have full of weapon variety. So well, what's the matter? It's simple. Just slaughter on every wave. When all zombies be-gone; the wave will end and the trader will spawn on her spot. You will have one minute to run onto her, buy a stronger weaponry, ammo and other accesories... and heeereee we go again, next wave. Next wave. And next wave. The basic longplay has 10 waves + patriarch wave. Patriarch is a Killing Floor boss. Nasty. Rocket launcher. Chain gun. Did I mention the ability to go visible? Or his guts attacking you? Gulp.\n\nAt the starting lobby you can choose up from 7 perk(classes). Every one of those has unique skills and weaponry suggested to use. So well, there is a sharpshooter with pistols and headshoot upgrades, support specialist with stronger shotguns and faster welding skill, berserker with his melee weapons, resistance and faster movements, medic with his healing skill via shooting syringes by his weapons, demolition with... well... explosives? Demolition is simply one, the bigger explosion is, the better. Pipe bombs are handy aswell, if we mention demolition. And typical commando with his rifles, ability to see zombies hp and ability to see invisible zombies(stalkers). Uh oh, there is also a firebug, which is actually a fired freak. Yup. Flamethrower, flares, or even one of the zombie(husk) firegun.\n\nWell, I've mentioned two specimens already(husks, stalkers), but here goes the rest: the basic zombie is clot. His only ability is to grab players. Most common zed. Comes in hordes each wave. Crawlers are spider-alike zeds, lowest hp they have, smalest they are and aswell most agile. The gorefast... zed with a blade at one of his hands. Ability to charge upon players, but common too, not very dangerous. Stalkers with their ability of invisiblity as I've told before and husks with ranged fireball attacks. There is also a siren, screaming out, damaging hp with not affecting kevlar, destroys explosives while screaming. Scrake as a tanky zed with a chainsaw. Hannibal reincarnation, just look at his face. And well, fleshpound. The only black-skinned zombie(so this game is not racist after all!). But well, serious now, he is full of glow-tubes lighting on yellow, well, mostly. When you enrage him by shooting he light his red sign. That's actually a sign for you, not for him. A sign for something. Well, what time it will be? ♥ time. And well, those are all zed types(along with patriarch mentioned before...\n7.5.10","timestamp_created":1404733499,"timestamp_updated":1404733499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11116131","author":{"steamid":"76561198025477293","num_games_owned":418,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":67048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31239,"last_played":1625240986},"language":"koreana","review":"lady and gentlman, enjoy to killing for subjects!\nit's not danger? no problem! they are want to die!","timestamp_created":1404733259,"timestamp_updated":1404733259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11115861","author":{"steamid":"76561198096817443","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":482,"last_played":1543235118},"language":"russian","review":"ОЧЕНЬ КРУТАЯ ИГРА!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1404731949,"timestamp_updated":1404731949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11115804","author":{"steamid":"76561198050200559","num_games_owned":660,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":35216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31754,"last_played":1507881045},"language":"english","review":"Pros: \n+Huge replay value\n+Satisfying physics and gore\n+Fun with friends or alone\n+Tons of community - made workshop content\n+Great variety of enemies\n+Entertaining voice acting\n+Continued support from developers\n\n        Cons:\n-Loads of DLC\n-Menus can be very awkward and clunky\n-Not much is explained to new players, resulting in a bit of a difficulty curve\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------IN DEPTH:------------------------------------------\n     \n     England is swarming with genetically altered specimens and it's up to you (and your team) to cleanse the area of the freaks!  You start on wave one and work your way up to the end (either wave 5, 8, or 11 depending on the game length) where you'll fight the Patriarch, a mad mad scientist with a rocket launcher for an arm! Unlike many wave - based shooters, Killing Floor has a very solid sense of progression. You'll spend your hard - earned dosh on lovely new weapons to help you decapitate, dismember, and otherwise mutilate the zeds coming your way. Meanwhile, the waves will be getting tougher, with increasingly meaner enemies appearing as the wave counter goes up.\n\n     Killing Floor features a 'perk' system, seven classes that all utilize different weapons and bonuses to bring something unique to the table. Each perk can be leveled independently, improving the bonuses a player receives. Most of the perks can be played solo with the right strategy, and in multiplayer different perks come together like clockwork.\n\n     Killing Floor isn't about being the best shot or getting all the kills and 'carrying' the team. It's about making split - second decisions and being able to react to anything the game throws at you. Unless you're able to learn from your mistakes and improve your strategy, you'll find yourself dead quite often, even on the lower difficulties. In multiplayer, teamwork is integral to survival. Since some perks handle different situations better than others, teams will have to coordinate and work themselves into a pattern. There's nothing better than playing with a team who can at a moment's notice flawlessly dispose of some of the toughest enemies in the game.\n\n     The community is more or less what you'd expect with this sort of title. I've met some wonderful people in my time with Killing Floor, but I've also met my fair share of toxic players, trolls, flamers, and the like. I'd recommend playing with people you know, since a full team of pubs can be excruciating. The modding community is great, with an entire workshop full of custom maps, player skins, weapons, music and more to keep you entertained.\n\n     No game is without its flaws, however. I think Killing Floor's greatest problem is its lack of tutorial. New players are thrown into the game with little to no understanding of how perks work, and often struggle to understand the awkward trader interface. If you're new to the game, I'd strongly recommend grabbing a friend who can explain it to you or looking up one of the many great Steam guides on how to play.\n\n     Additionally, this game is very DLC heavy. While the bulk of it is just player / weapon skins that are completely unnecessary, there are several weapons in game that are unavailable without DLC.\n\n     Overall though, Killing Floor is a great title I'd recommend to anyone. I'm well over 500 hours in (and have met people with several thousand) and still enjoy it as much as I did on day one. It's funny, gory, and action - packed to the brim! It goes on sale all the time as well (at the time of writing this it's 75% off) so if you don't have it you should probably go pick it up.

A good soundtrack that gets the blood flowing and plenty of guns to choose from. The monsters are dangerous and come in many varieties ranging from simple cannon fodder to violent powerhouses.\n\nPerks in this game also benefit the player as well as their team giving them a edge on the approaching horde of monsters.  Sharpshooters and commandos have an advantage while in combat, while the medics make sure they stay alive. The other classes/perks such as support, demolitions and firebug serve to weaken and thin the crowd that pursues you.\n\nOverall a very good game worthy of your money. However if you prefer going it alone like other FPSs you will get torn apart and so may your team. Co-operation is key in this gorefest of a game.
