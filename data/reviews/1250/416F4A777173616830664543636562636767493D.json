Представленный обзор, лишь личное мнение автора, оно может отличаться от вашего![/quote]\n\nВ далеком 2009 году выходит игра от компании Tripwire Interactive, зомби шутер с огромным количеством вооружений, персонажей и перков. Настоящий ли это соперник Left 4 Dead?\n\n[h1]📋Сюжет[/h1]\nКак такого-во сюжета в игре нет, можно найти некие отсылки и записки по вселенной, но это не то. Игра создавалась только для онлайн составляющей.\n\n[h1]🎲Геймплей[/h1]\nГеймплей схож с Left 4 Dead, вы так-же покупаете оружия, отстреливаетесь от зомби, но в отличии от игры Valve, в этой игре есть различные классы персонажей: Солдат, Подрывник, Медик, Коммандос и так далее. Данные классы можно прокачивать и получать какие либо бонусы.\n\n[h1]🧩Карты[/h1]\nКарт в игре довольно много, все они сделаны очень круто и атмосферно. Для каждого найдется своя любимая карта.\n\n[h1]🧟‍♂️Персонажи[/h1]\nВ отличии от той-же Left 4 Dead, в этой игре персонажей будет побольше. Как в плане выживших, так и в плане разнообразия зомби. У каждого выжившего своя озвучка, а вот у зомби (зедов - так они называются) все более красочно: Толстяк, Отбивальщик, Сирена - это те зомби, схожие по механике \"Особых зараженных\" вселенной Left 4 Dead, но в этой игре есть и босс - Патриарх - босс со своими умениями, который появляется в конце всех волн. Довольно опасный противник.\n\n[h1]🔫Вооружение[/h1]\nВ игре очень много различного вооружения. Для каждого класса имеются свои пушечки. В игре их около 80. Тут вам и дробовики, пистолеты и винтовки, холодное оружие и так далее.\n\n[h1]🔶Итог[/h1]\nИгра, особенно для 2009 годы, была отличным соперником Left 4 Dead, если Left 4 Dead это в большей степени сюжетный шутер, то игра от Tripwire Interactive была нацелена на онлайновый рынок. Если вам нравятся такие шутеры, берите. И да, у игры есть и 2 часть, которая сделана еще круче, советую обратить внимание.\n\n[h1]Надеюсь вам понравился мой обзор, моя критика в сторону игры вами была одобрена, вы взвесили все за и против, и утвердились с покупкой данного проекта[/h1]","timestamp_created":1588784197,"timestamp_updated":1592727125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605924308300018311","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68653399","author":{"steamid":"76561198112477631","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1512169403},"language":"english","review":"Purchased this game just for myself.

Wer keine grafischen höchst Ansprüche hat kann sich hier durchaus einen runden soliden Zombie Shooter abgreifen. Die Community ist noch vorhanden (viele Server sind noch online und belebt). Meiner Meinung nach liefert Tripwire mit dem Spiel Killingfloor das Beste Zombie Spiel das überhaupt am markt existiert, da definitiv hier das Augenmerk auf einen Wellen Basierten Zombie Shooter liegt, ohne Lootboxen und anderen Loot schnick schnack. Natürlich hat das Game auch DLC aber effektiv fügen nur 3 stück neue waffen hinzu, der rest dind Waffen skins oder Charakter modelle, also nichts was man zum Spielen essensiel benötigt.","timestamp_created":1588284682,"timestamp_updated":1588284682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68326384","author":{"steamid":"76561197987893790","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":157385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157020,"last_played":1632118362},"language":"english","review":"alot of fun","timestamp_created":1588284071,"timestamp_updated":1588284071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68297716","author":{"steamid":"76561198977053304","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1588249819},"language":"russian","review":"норм но быстро надоело","timestamp_created":1588250109,"timestamp_updated":1588250109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68274682","author":{"steamid":"76561198207563427","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1599109456},"language":"english","review":"YES","timestamp_created":1588213529,"timestamp_updated":1588213529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492763817310333252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68260870","author":{"steamid":"76561197970349414","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1619,"last_played":1589140401},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor is proof that a simple concept and dated graphics are enough, even in 2020.

like it more than Killing Floor 2 and L4D 1 and L4D 2 and World War Z and I like all of those too.\n\nThe graphics of Killing Floor 1 are bad compared to all of the above.I like the gameplay and different classes in KF1.\n\nI like every one of those games and think you should try them all if you into zombie shooters.\n\nJust look at a video of KF1 and see if you think you can look past the old graphics and if you can than you should buy it on a steam deal.\n\nYou cant be a zombie or bad guy in this game but it is still fun killing the dead.It still has players who play online for MP.\n\nFighting the boss is always fun and usually hard unless you blow him

players on 1/2 maps camping 24/7 You can win be actually going AFK the entire match.Unavoidable damage without specific classes and what feels like abuse of wonky mechanics   Holidays the monsters are dressed up goofy   Deal with it or dont play the game during those times.Only 2 classes sharpshooter and commando require skill every other class is decision making.The game is heavily focused on beserker and medics since all the unavoidable/hard to avoid damage.Both classes take extremely less damage and can immedilty recover.Darkness with only some guns having flashlights so everyone turns gamma to max and dlc guns are p2w.Spam pipebombs on the boss to instant kill\nThe gameplay FEEL is amazing in the same way doom4/eternal or god of war 2 feels but shallow once you are experienced with the systems\nWorth for 10$ if you buy games like uncharted or gears of war which dont have heavy replay value >At its

first impression was during my first games...this game is not terrible and I had left it aside.\n\nA few years later I got back into it a bit seriously after playing \"Left 4 Dead 2\".\n\nWell...I realize that \"Killing Floor\" is much better and its community too...certainly it lacks a versus but there are three game modes that I let you discover.\n\nThe problem in my region there are too few servers and my internet connection is too bad for the moment (too many pings).\n\nToo many DLCs that are too expensive...some are needed for achievements...\n\nThis game is full of good little
