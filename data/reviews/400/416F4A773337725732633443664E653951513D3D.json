And if it had arms. and if it talks. and if it had guns, and lasers and.... There is also some green sludge at the bottom that if you fall into you die probably because it smells so horrid or maybe because it is green and we all know green is bad, just like vegetables.\n\nBasically the game is like this, get from point a to point b. With this robot lady nagging you all the time about some cake or whatever, robots shaped like guns shooting guns, avoiding balls of plasma that activate doors, using cubical shaped objects to do what cubical shaped objects do, like dying in a fire, while avoiding green puke on the ground while warping space-time itself so that you can get from point a to point b. Seems simple, all you do is shoot that gun and warp the space field around the walls because worm holes on mid air could prove disastrous, creating a black hole and destroying the entire universe and blowing up your computer. It happened to me, twice. Remember do not try to open portals in the air.\n\nGraphics - 8/10\nGameplay - 9/10\nAnnoying robot voice - 2/10\n\nAlso there is no cake in this game, so overall score:\n0/10 (No cake for you)\n\nNow go buy this game and your own cake.\n","timestamp_created":1438411810,"timestamp_updated":1438411810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493670880794525146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17327813","author":{"steamid":"76561198092540221","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":118,"playtime_forever":54,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1439694787},"language":"english","review":"Portal in general is the best puzzle game I've ever expirenced.
