This game is highly regarded in the gaming community as a classic FPS and I finally got the chance to play it.\n\n As a first person shooter, Half-Life immediately distinguishes itself with its gameplay mechanics. The shooting feels great, the movement is very characteristic and takes a while to get used to, and mastering bunny hopping and long jumps/crouches takes time. There are many weapons available that are unlocked throughout the game as well as many different types of enemies and encounters.\n\n Every area (until the last few chapters) is well thought-out, with hidden paths and secrets as well as challenging enemies. Every time you progress in this game you are presented with new puzzles you have to solve and this helps keeping the gameplay fresh and fun. You will also encounter NPCs scattered through the levels, some can help you defeat enemies or unlock storage rooms with loot, while others can help you open security doors and access new areas. \n What's great about Half-Life is the way you have to approach the maps. I quickly found out that traversing them requires some skill in the mechanics taught in the optional tutorial level. Sometimes, it's the quick mash of these different movement mechanics that get you to that special hidden room.\n\n The enemies in Half-Life are varied, some human and some alien. Human enemies are mostly the same, with a few exceptions, while alien enemies are vastly different from each other. Some are quick, jumping parasites while others are big armored tanks. There are also a few \"boss\" enemies which can't be defeated by conventional means - in these cases you have to either escape safely or used the environment against them. Most enemies were fun and fair, with some being a bit boring or annoying (like the Tentacles and the flying aliens). I also found the enemy AI to be good, knowing when to hide, when to attack and forcing you out of cover by throwing grenades. Alien and human enemies will also fight each other which makes sense in terms of the story.\n\n About the plot: if you're wanting to get into this game only because you heard positive things about the storytelling, think twice. This being the first Half-Life game, it barely contains any story at all. Most of the plot is told through visual means, with rare occasions where NPCs will refrain from spouting their usual standard lines (most of which have been turned into memes) to add a bit to the story. I personally found the plot to be interesting, but poorly laid out, and that disappointed me a bit (that said, the game's final moments are great and I'm excited to play the sequels).\n\n The only negative thing I have to say about Half-Life is that the last four chapters are terrible. I couldn't believe how boring and frustrating the game became. The interesting maps and routes were gone, the enemies were annoying, and the final boss was a complete joke. Thankfully, it only lasts for a bit until it's over, and the ending is great.\n\n The online community is also still active as I was able to find populated servers to try out the multiplayer aspect of the game.\n\n In conclusion, I recommend playing this game if you're curious about it and enjoy a good FPS with bits of good storytelling. The gameplay is solid, the mechanics are great and aside from poor graphics and the final levels, Half-Life is a phenomenal, unique shooter that is worth playing.\n\nOh, and...

was going to just write a little reference from Half Life with a recommendation but I think game has highlighted something really important for myself as a gamer and the gaming industry as a whole.\n\nI've never experienced a game like this before and it goes to show just how generic modern gaming has become. Valve's attention to detail and open minded approach to level design allows for some of the most creative and original experiences I have ever known.\nDespite the game being 22 years old, I was amazed by how advanced it felt with its imaginative solutions to challenges. This kind of gameplay is something I have always thought was the future of gaming, so it came as a shock to find that a classic title had achieved this many years ago. To put it in the most simple explanation - If you think of a solution, there's a chance it might actually work; so try shooting things and pressing buttons!\n\nUpon finishing my playthrough, I have realised just how mind numbing modern titles are; it feels like the simple formula that so many developers follow now has shut my mind off to being creative with my thinking when it comes to approaching new challenges. \n\nAt various points during the game, I was reminded of the puzzles of the Zelda series - particularly Ocarina of Time, and the gunplay of the original Doom titles, which was a clear indication to me that Valve understood the good gameplay mechanics that made Zelda and Doom so addicting and unique and then took it further with the extra power of computer hardware that was available at the time.  From seeing this clever formula in action, I feel that being given the opportunity to think outside the box is something that more developers need to explore.\n\nThe combination of unique and interesting story with sandbox yet varied gameplay is an experience like no other and I highly recommend this as a game for everyone to try at some point in their life because I am yet to have played anything like it.\n\nHalf Life 1 is by no means perfect, and there were moments of frustration as the game showed its age - however I did play on hard difficulty mode which is something I do not recommend unless you are ok we having to regularly quicksave and re-attempt. Probably one of the biggest issues is the parkour can be very annoying sometimes but it can also be really fun. Oh and also, there is no sprint -_-\n\nThe game requires you to think about the situation rather than running in and gunning down everything (on hard 1 v 1 can be death) so don't always rely on weapons. You can manipulate the environment to help you and stealth is often an option although this is not always possible.\n\nSo there is my review and it took me way too long to write but I think that this message is something really important for the future of the industry. Thank you very much if you've taken the time to read it and I wish you the best of luck if you decide to begin this journey, you've bought yourself a rewarding challenge! \n\nAnd for those of you who are still undecided - play this game and you too can become a fellow scientist ;)\n\nOh and one last thing, I was on the fence about buying [b] Black Mesa (remaster/remake of Half Life) [/b] over the original version and I'm glad I bought this first instead. Knowing some of the levels are changed in the remake and that a lot of the flaws of the original version [spoiler] especially Xen [/spoiler] are fixed makes Black Mesa look even more appealing!\n[u] Please make sure you don't get Half Life Source because it's bugged!!!
