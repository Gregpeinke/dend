Also worth noting that I did NOT enjoy the burial at sea DLC. While definitely being a fun nod to the original 2 BioShocks it is still different and borrows a lot from the main game (imo not a good thing).

Não sei onde eu estava todos esses anos sem conhecer a trilogia BioShock, confesso que os outros dois primeiros fiquei com preguiça de jogar, mas depois de BioShock Infinite com certeza vou zera-los prestando atenção em cada detalhe.\n\nA [b] história é a MELHOR E MAIS ENVOLVENTE QUE EU JÁ VI, [/b] com certeza virou meu jogo favorito por conta disso.\nO [b] jogo é relativamente curto, [/b] zerei em quase 15 horas tentando explorar ao máximo, mas ainda deixei algumas coisas passarem. Recomendo jogar com calma e prestando atenção nos mínimos detalhes. \nOs [b] gráficos são LINDÍSSIMOS, [/b] mesmo não sendo tão realista quanto os atuais ele cumpre com perfeição a proposta utilizada, deixando o jogo totalmente imersivo. \nA [b] jogabilidade é EXCELENTE, [/b] tanto nos momentos de ação e quando está apenas lootando / explorando o mapa. Vale destacar algo que sempre me incomodou em outros jogos é que seu(a) parceiro(a) não fica pra trás quando você está correndo, ele(a) anda na mesma velocidade que você ou as vezes até mais rápido, então você nunca irá ter que parar de correr pra espera-lo(a). Que inclusive é o(a) melhor parceiro(a) dos games, em nenhum momento você se decepciona por causa da IA fazer alguma burrice, muito pelo contrário, só te ajuda durante todo o jogo.\nO jogo [b] não é difícil, [/b] mesmo na maior dificuldade da pra zera-lo tranquilamente, até levando em consideração que o jogo se preocupa muito mais em você entender todo o universo representado que apenas sair por aí tentando matar geral.\nA [b] trilha sonora é muito boa, [/b] porém nada de tão incrível como um Guardiões da Galaxia da vida. Ela apenas cumpre bem o seu papel de imersão no universo.\nEle também é [b] EXTREMAMENTE OTIMIZADO [/b] e quase não tem bugs perceptíveis, ainda não sei como fizeram esse jogo ser tão fluido, principalmente vendo a vergonha que foi a otimização dos remaster 1 e 2.\n\nPra você que tá na dúvida vale muito a pena pagar o preço dele, mas recomendo esperar uma promoção e pegar logo a trilogia que vai sair por mais ou menos 24 reais.

Once I started getting into games, I told myself I'd play this one. And I did! It was such a good game. The main characters are enjoyable and interesting, as well as their relationship and the plot twists that come with it. The game play is pretty fun too; it started off easy, but definitely grew in challenge as it continued (I'm talking in terms of the people you fight; the controls and game mechanics are not hard).

Yeah, I know, graphics from 2013, but god, it's still so pretty - I spent a lot of time just enjoying the views and my surroundings;\n- so much attention to detail and soul put into level and visual art design! All buildings look quite different (and a lot of them you can actually enter and explore!) and the locations are visually distinct, you'd never call any of them \"generic\"; \n- combat is incredibly engaging and satisfying. You have a huge variety of vigors (plasmids), weapons and possibilities to deal with your enemies [spoiler](like using the realm tears)[/spoiler], and it doesn't get boring or repetitive;\n- AI deserves a special accolade. Enemies are pretty fun and don't do stupid things. Elizabeth is probably one of the best followers implemented in a game: yeah, maybe she doesn't do anything \"exceptional\", but she's really helpful in combat and exploration (not overwhelmingly though), makes interesting remarks and, the most importantly, doesn't become annoying or inconvenient - she won't block you in the doorways, she won't get stuck somewhere or run ahead and spook the group of enemies;\n- main story is quite complicated, but non-trivial; characters - deep and memorable, cut scenes - just of the right length so that you won't feel you're watching a movie instead of playing a game;\n- the game is incredibly polished - I played for almost 40 hours and didn't encounter a single crash or bug;\n- it felt quite different from the Bioshock 1-2, but there were a lot of subtle details that reminded me of the first 2 games (not to mention the entire 2 episodes of 'Burial at Sea' DLC dedicated to those of us reminiscent for old times!)\nI can probably go on and on, because this game is perhaps one of the best games I played in the last decade, and it makes me a little sad that the studio behind it (Irrational Games) 'rebranded' and hasn't released anything new since 2014, but I really, really, REALLY recommend it.\nDo not be afraid of the \"outdated\" graphics, because it's not - just play it, believe me, you won't regret it.","timestamp_created":1641123556,"timestamp_updated":1641123556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107123903","author":{"steamid":"76561198869109082","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1642243473},"language":"russian","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1641115702,"timestamp_updated":1641115702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107122672","author":{"steamid":"76561198819858210","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1349,"last_played":1656216868},"language":"latam","review":"Excelente narrativa","timestamp_created":1641114223,"timestamp_updated":1641114223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107122488","author":{"steamid":"76561199108618796","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":894,"last_played":1641644469},"language":"english","review":"Probably one of my favourite games.
