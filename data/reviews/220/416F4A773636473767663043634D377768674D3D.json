Its an impressive and engaging shooter that follows-up one of the best PC games we've seen (Half Life 1). Its so great it has made Valve's reputation to what it is presently. Valve made the first Half-Life as an indie studio. Then, at that point, they required around six years to foster the second one with the prizes they acquired from the establishment starter. Presently, they hold the most prominent PC games retail facade.\n\nNumerous things radiate through this game. Most important is, everything talks. Valve took as much time as necessary to assemble the world without boring exposition. Its dependent upon you to find what is happening as you approach your journey. Also, the game is loaded up with a wide range of radio chat, outsider sounds, researchers shouting, and outcasts running. Enough hints to sort out whats going on. \n\nAlso, it was a remarkable FPS some time ago. Hell, it actually is with the fabulous showcase of weapons. In any case, the AI and the mechanics don't appear so great any longer, yet its still a pleasant encounter because of the immense range of adversaries attempting to chase you down. What's more? There are additionally allies assisting you with opposing during the most insane situations. \n\nThird, the game causes you to remain alert. Its a straight game with parts, and each segment is not quite the same as the last. \n\nTo wrap things up, we have that flawless gravity gun. Its a unique weapon that can be used to lift, summon, and launch objects back at your enemies. The gravity weapon can connect with nearly anything, so its hugely fun and dangerous, however its likewise an imperative part of the plot. \n\nIn addition, Half-Life 2 has two subsequent episodes (Episode 1 and Episode 2). These follow Freeman's story and the conflict against The Combine. They additionally further investigate the baffling presence of the G-Man, a  inter-dimensional man in a suit with contrived goals.\n\nYou could pick any of these titles and be satisfied. You’d be playing history. Is there anything else to say? Half-Life is what made Valve. Half-Life is what made the Steam store.","timestamp_created":1636715548,"timestamp_updated":1638817597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102641228","author":{"steamid":"76561198802476354","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1093,"last_played":1642460396},"language":"brazilian","review":"Divertido, com uma história rica para época, mesmo sendo bastante antigo, ainda é muito bom, recomendadíssimo, não a outro como ele.

There is lots of free roam which also adds to the experience. The game is split up in 13 chapters but you barely even notice since the game flows so well. \n\nDifficulty : \nI don't think this game is too difficult. I mean it has it's moments but you can always ask google or watch a walk through for help.\n\n\nRating :\nThis game gets a 10/10 from me.\n\n\nEdit : I replayed the game to collect all the achievements and It was just as good as the first time playing.","timestamp_created":1636674842,"timestamp_updated":1638302109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102616258","author":{"steamid":"76561199071360698","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":2272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":63,"playtime_at_review":2047,"last_played":1659729662},"language":"brazilian","review":"Meu jogo favorito de todos os tempos.","timestamp_created":1636673332,"timestamp_updated":1650281656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102614814","author":{"steamid":"76561199181405761","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":331,"last_played":1653332050},"language":"english","review":"Remember, Gordon hasn't slept in about a week by the time hl2 ended","timestamp_created":1636670782,"timestamp_updated":1647147074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102610258","author":{"steamid":"76561199070432345","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":860,"last_played":1653766816},"language":"english","review":"-cool story \n-you can play on toaster\n-fun\n-console cheats\nbeautiful 10/10","timestamp_created":1636664110,"timestamp_updated":1636664110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102609361","author":{"steamid":"76561199101234220","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":93,"playtime_forever":164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158,"last_played":1642608621},"language":"polish","review":"KOX GRA\nfabuła 9/10\ngrafika 8/10\noptymalizacja 7/10\nCHLEB BRAK (mogli się postarać ): )\nrozgrywka 9/10","timestamp_created":1636662972,"timestamp_updated":1636662972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102609129","author":{"steamid":"76561199123465348","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":287,"last_played":1639970183},"language":"english","review":"Greatest.

Todos sus alardes y sus premios al mejor juego valorado en PC tienen un total sentido y apoyo, porque eso se merece esta obra maestra.\n\n La trama de Half Life 2, a pesar de ser de una época donde esta parte de un título era de menos, consigue atrapar de principio a fin, con un guion excelente, giros de trama que enganchan aún más y unos personajes muy carismáticos y con personalidad muy propia y marcada. Aunque no continúa directamente con lo visto en su primer título, este tiene montones de conexiones, ya sea a lo largo de la trama como en conversaciones, o en secretos visuales o easter eggs. Su duración es la de un FPS actual, y tiene tantos misterios y cosas por descubrir que genera un lore muy rico y único.\n Su apartado gráfico, a pesar de los años, impresiona: Actualmente, jugarlo con todo al máximo (Aunque claramente no llegue a cosas actuales) es genial y ni hablar de haberlo jugado en su fecha de salida: Habría explotado la cabeza de los jugadores, envejeciendo excelentemente. Sus texturas se mantienen de maravilla, sus efectos también, el diseño de npcs y enemigos sigue siendo único y característico, sus animaciones muy bien cuidadas para sus tiempos, y un motor de físicas que incluso ahora puede alardear de su mimo. Su apartado artístico y puesta en escena es atrapante: Se siente como una buena película de ciencia ficción, donde se mezcla lo desconocido con lo conocido, donde hay muchas cosas que llaman la atención e impresionan por sus detalles y ganas de explorarlas.\n Jugablemente, el título ha marcado prácticamente todos los juegos de disparo, en especial los de primera persona. Tiene una justa y necesaria cantidad de armas, todas extremadamente efectivas en su apartado y muy diferenciadas de las demás (Como desventaja, la pistola tiene poco uso luego del primer tercio del juego, aunque el resto del armamento siga siendo extremadamente útil). Su gunplay es muy divertido, haciendo un buen desafío en modo difícil, y dando gracias a su motor de físicas unos momentos visuales espectaculares: Disparar naves, lanzar enemigos por los aires con granadas, clavarlos a una pared con la ballesta... todo se siente muy efectivo, causando una sensación real: Gordon Freeman es una máquina de matar. Su diseño lineal está muy bien logrado, usando mucho la verticalidad y asi sentir que no estamos totalmente guiados y obligados. Además, encontrar los lamda en cada ubicación es un reto muy beneficioso, pues cada logo dará vida, escudo y munición; lo que implica que en los pocos momentos que hay espacios abiertos (Y muy amplios), seamos compensados por la exploración.\n El apartado sonoro del juego también es genial. El sonido de cada arma es único, y en las armas \"Ficticias\" se logra una sensación muy bien cumplida de satisfacción al disparar. También los ruidos de colisión, explociones y de enemigos se sienten muy dañinos y destructivos. Además, el elenco de voces está muy bien logrado, dando a los personajes una característica propia (Destacando especialmente al enigmático G-Man, con su voz inquietante y sus extraños gruñidos y ruidos de respiración). Como muchos juegos de Valve, no suele haber música en todo combate; pero si en los más geniales, de grandes escalas y proporciones titánicas, dando una sensación aún más aventurera y épica (Y en los casos donde el juego llega a dar miedo, nos pone los pelos de punta en pensar que hay en cada esquina)\n\n Concluyendo, Half Life 2 es un juegazo. Un título que marcó fuertemente toda la industria y a la mayoría de los jugadores que lo probaron, tanto en su momento como en una década y media después. Ha envejecido grandiosamente, y se lo recomiendo a todo jugador que le llame la atención, y a los que no, también. Mi FPS favorito y uno de los juegos más revolucionarios e importantes de la historia.","timestamp_created":1636587567,"timestamp_updated":1636587567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102562067","author":{"steamid":"76561198040636102","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":3511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3511,"last_played":1614498792},"language":"english","review":"Would highly recommend this if you like FPS games, the level design and setpieces are the best I've seen, and the atmosphere is strong.

The game just felt like it dragged on forever. You find the same weapons as in HL1 pretty quick, the only new thing is the gravity gun (actually quite fun) and a high-tech machine gun, which is pretty much like the normal machine gun, but has less ammo and a worse 2nd attack :/.
