Finally, the actual gameplay is very fun - while the two-gun limit can get a tad restrictive at times, the use of vigors is considerably more interesting than the use of the old plasmids, the combat is fast-paced and with good movement (particularly with your blade allowing you to move around the battlefield at great speed), and the game is just generally very enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1485093009,"timestamp_updated":1485093009,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29421768","author":{"steamid":"76561198083794848","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":522,"last_played":1451790751},"language":"english","review":"All I can say is wow. just wow. my played hrs may indicate being \"casual\" but really all I did was rush through the game and I'm ashamed of myself for doing so because the game is just superb and my PC in the past was losing memory so I hadn't had the time to play the other content.

As someone who didn't care about this game when it came out and has never played a Bioshock game before, I can say that this is a GOOD game.  Not better than other Bioshocks or the best story game out there, just something that's worth playing through.\nOne warning:  This game kinda screws with your head.  Not like other Bioshocks from what I've heard, but it gets quite dark the further you go in the game, and [spoiler] Elizabeth does some weird inter-dimensional s*** [/spoiler]\n\n\nGraphics:  8/10 -  While the graphics aren't amazingly realistic, BSI is a beautiful game.  Every color pops, but it also varies with the darker parts of the game\n\nStorytelling: 7/10 - The story itself (in my opinion) is hugely interesting and complex.  It's not the best told (this isn't Firewatch or anything), but it's clear where it needs to be and a little less where it should be.\nThere are also some interesting interactions that can happen in the game, with all of the characters pretty fully fleshed out.\n\nCombat: 9/10 - Vigors are one of my favorite combat mechanics.  I don't use all of them, but when you find yours you'll love using it (I go with a shotgun and Bucking Bronco).  Gunplay isn't the best, and I find it a bit hard to aim, but hits feel satisfying and combat is somewhat challenging.\n\nProgression: 6/10 - I'm not huge on progression in games (with my favorites being Firewatch and Overwatch), so nothing really bothered me.  However, fully upgrading a gun you like, with the easy-to-find guns not being any worse than rare guns, is really easy, and the same goes for vigors.  Getting your perfect loadout may take until the end of the game, though.  Also, there are some permenant stat-boosters (I forgot what they're called), and they really halp the progression.\n\nSo I don't rate any of the aspects 10/10 on their own, I'd give the game as a whole a 10.  Something about the game made me truly remember every section of it, and despite telling myself I couldn't play it again (due its hell of an ending getting stuck in my mind for a long time), I'm currently playing through it again.","timestamp_created":1485034842,"timestamp_updated":1485035027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29407632","author":{"steamid":"76561198034455552","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":968,"last_played":1484952921},"language":"italian","review":"Dopo averlo finito due volte, la prima volta sulla versione Xbox 360* e la seconda volta su PC per un totale di circa 32 ore \nposso finalmente esprimere un parere (a mente lucida) su Bioshock Infinite: decisamente non all'altezza dei precedenti, nemmeno di Bioshock 2 che, seppur davvero bello, pareva più che altro un'espansione stand-alone di Bioshock che un capitolo a se stante.\n\nBioshock Infinite ha un art-design favoloso, probabilmente tra i più immersivi mai creati, un'ambientazione che avrebbe anche poco da invidiare a Rapture ed un comparto audio/visivo che ancora oggi a distanza di 5 anni appare molto piacevole. Peccato che trama e gameplay non siano minimamente all'altezza del già citato art-design.\n\nLa storia parte dire ALLA GRANDE, immergendoci in quella che è a tutti gli effetti una rivoluzione in corso (cosa che non si è vista nel primo Bioshock, ad esempio, dato che entriamo in una citta già decaduta da tempo) e fino a metà,  ovvero quando ci ritroveremo faccia a faccia con Daisy Fitzroy, il capo della ricoluzione socialista in atto a Columbia, tiene botta rivelandosi piuttosto cattivella sul piano politico ... forse anche di più dei precedenti Bioshock ... da li in poi BAM, il tonfo più totale in un confusissimo minestrone sci-fi di quarta categorica pieno di buchi e non-sense assurdi,  di salti spazio-temporali da una dimensione all'altra in cui non torna più nulla e in cui il giocatore (fino a poco tempo prima concentrato sulla rivoluzione) inizierà a non capirci più nulla fino ad arrivare ad un finale che boh vabbè ti lascia un po' così ... in realtà data l'assurda piega che prende la trama, il gioco non poteva epilogare altrimenti, ma allora non si spiega il perché di tutta la parte iniziale. \n\nVabbè, su un plot confuso e raffazzonato ci potrei anche passare sopra se Bioshock Infinite proponesse un gameplay soddisfaciente, d'altronde si parta di un videogioco non di un film, ma purtroppo non è così: hanno semplificato talmente tanto il gameplay in tutti i suoi aspetti che parlare di vera e propria mutilazione renderebbe abbastanza l'idea. \nInnanzitutto hanno eliminato del tutto i tonici, le stazioni inventomat, i minigiochi per le sessioni di scassinamento ed hackeraggio e simili (ridotte all'utilizzo di un unico plasmide, sia per umani che per sistemi meccanici ... ditemi voi) e la possibilità di portarsi appresso armi multiple ... si perché Booker potrà portarsi dietro solamente due armi per volta e non potenziabili/moddabili.\nPer quanto riguarda i già citati plasmidi e l'eve, in Bioshock: Infinite sono comunque presenti con altro nome infatti i primi si chiamano Vigor e il secondo semplicemente \"sali\" (boh) solo che sono in numero estremamente ridotto. \nPer carità ci sono anche degli elementi interessanti come ad esempio le rotaie sospese che permettono fughe dell'ultimo secondo e l'interazione con Elisabeth che ci farà da spalla negli scontri, ma tutto questo non riesce a salvare un level design notevolmente più lineare e ripetitivo rispetto al passato.\n\nInsomma, tecnicamente non sarebbe uno sconsiglio vero e proprio ... non è nemmeno lontanamente il peggior gioco a cui abbia mai giocato, ma se siete dei veri fan di Bioshock probabilmente ne rimarrete molto delusi. Diciamo che sì, andrebbe giocato ma per completezza più che altro. \n\n\n\n* che equivale a giocare su PC usando un pad, a 720p 30frame e settaggi grafici su v.low ... non proprio godibile come esperienza di gioco.","timestamp_created":1485033714,"timestamp_updated":1534460891,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53091055154800415","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29407232","author":{"steamid":"76561198004244777","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":1457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1457,"last_played":1485032256},"language":"schinese","review":"8分","timestamp_created":1485032417,"timestamp_updated":1485032417,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29406944","author":{"steamid":"76561198178466182","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":2967,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1957,"last_played":1581438273},"language":"spanish","review":"es bioshock infinite, nada más que decir","timestamp_created":1485031666,"timestamp_updated":1512260536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29405593","author":{"steamid":"76561198111834039","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":101,"last_played":1402682569},"language":"russian","review":"Чётко))0)\n","timestamp_created":1485027517,"timestamp_updated":1485027517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534974455833435059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29400043","author":{"steamid":"76561198015794913","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1427,"last_played":1485002906},"language":"english","review":"12/10, Game of my life.

This is a welcome change as the cramped corridor shooter was getting a little played out.  Infinite is still a corridor shooter but it's out in the open so there is an illusion of a bigger world.  The game mechanics are improved over Bioshock but I would say a little less functional than what was in Bioshock 2.\nI'm not that far into the game but the story for this one is a little off-putting.  Everything is about racism so far.  There is no sense of right vs wrong as the \"right\" path is forced down your throat.  There is even a character that claims to be a \"progressive\" so is therefore a good person.  Up to this point the writers clearly have issuses with religous and conservative minded people.  If I wanted political commentary I would watch MSNBC or FOXNEWS.\nI like the achievements and flow of the game.  Some things need to be collected by going backwards which makes the game feel a little less linear.  The animations and NPC actions are interesting.  The atmosphere and artwork throughout the game is visually appealing and does a good job of drawing the player into the levels.  There is a very annoying feature of not being able to save.  The game is based on autosave points...so...yeah...kinda dumb.  Reminds me of old Sega CD games.\nThe enemy AI is semi-intelligent but there are a few examples of games from this timeframe and even older with much smarter enemies.  At the core it feels like a run around and kill the baddies game.  Not much to it.  There is an attempt by the designers to include enviromental elements to aid in the killing, but so far, it feels lacking.\n\nRevisiting after I have now finished the game.  The game certainly had a better back half.  After a rough start the politics and \"right vs wrong\" seemed to go away.  At that point an interesting story was told.  I feel like a better beginning would have made this one of the best ever.  The story got good when the writers decided to tell us the story in the protagonist and scienctists.  I was surprised at how fast things came to an end.  The game seemed to be building towards a huge climax and then it was over.  In a good way.

Sejao 1, 2, Infinite ou as DLC's. Eu simplesmente amo esse jogo e é minha franquia preferida, então vamos lá.\n\nENREDO: Começando pelo enredo. O enredo é MUITO MUITO MUITO BOM e complexo e é algo completamente diferente do 1 e do 2 mas ao mesmo tempo é uma ponte pro 1 (se você jogar Bureal At sea). O jogo fecha o ciclo Bioshock de uma forma tão linda, magnífica e deslumbrante. A Elizabeth (que te acompanha o jogo inteiro) é uma das melhores (SE NAO A MELHOR) personagem que já vi nos jogos, sua dubladora (Courtnee Draper) fez um ótimo trabalho e captou a essencia inocente e destemida da personagem. Anna Moleva (que serviu como modelo para fazer a elizabeth) foi perfeita para SER a personagem (ela é muito gata tb). Podemos falar do Booker DeWitt...Ah nossa querido protagonista. Além de ser um ótimo personagem com uma personalidade forte, seu dublador, Troy Baker (que faz a voz do Joel de The Last of Us também) deu um toque mais Badass ao personagem que cá entre nós não é tão bonito-qqqq. \n\nJOGABILIDADE: A jogabilidade é excelente também mas o que eu não gosto muito é o fato de poder levar apenas duas armas consigo, por outro lado da um toque de realismo ao jogo, MAS POR OUTRO LADO é meio imbecil visto que nos outros jogos anteriores da franquia você poderia ficar ATOLADO DE ARMA ATE O C U. Se não me engano, eles corrigem isso em Bureal at Sea (expansão que completa a história). \n\nGRÁFICOS: Os Gráficos são lindos até hoje. O que, pessoalmente não me agrada muito são os NPC's, sua modelagem não é muito realista, mas acredito que seja uma caracteristica do jogo que devemos aprender a gostar. O céu do jogo é lindo, o jogo de luzes MAIS que perfeito, etc.\n\nOBS: ****Sobre o ENREDO esqueci de acrescentar um ponto negativo. Nossas escolhas não tem muito sentido durante a trama. Como assim? Bom não vou explicar por que é uma linha tenue entre o spoiler.\n\nTRILHA SONORA: Aaaaaa para quem é amante de musica classica é um PUTA PRATO CHEIO. Musicas que combinam com o cenário que vão de mozart até Nina Simone (cover). Há também musicas atuais em cover sim como é o caso de Fortune Son (acho que é assim que escreve). Eu tenho uma playlist só de musicas do jogo. Sério!\n\nAs expansões eu digo o mesmo, e o nivel de dificuldade aumenta nos Ep 2 de Bureal At Sea\n\nSobre a franquia, eu amo de coração e eu tive ótimos momentos seja no PC, Xbox 360 e as vezes até no Ps3 com Bioshock e ainda to tendo no PS4 com o Collection (eu tive que comprar). Chorei nos finais, nas tristezas, senti na pele o que cada um sentiu, entendi as críticas que o jogo faz a politica, religião, á sociedade (sério, prestem a atenção). Mostrei pra amigos, indiquei a eles, dei até de presente pra alguns. Eu sinceramente amo a franquia e agredeço ao Ken Levine, a toda a equipe da falecida Irrational Games e uma parte a 2K por me proporcionar uma das melhores experiencias da minha vida. Espero que todos que joguem se divirtam e amem essa franquia assim como eu. Agradeço a meu amigo Arthur, por ter me apresentado essa franquia anos atrás.\n\nDeixo aqui duas frases do jogo marcantes para mim:\n\n\"A mente do indivíduo irá lutar desesperadamente para criar memórias onde elas não existem\" - R.

Не заковыристой смесью жанров, заставляющей чесать в затылке даже самых искушенных игроков — хотя свои геймплейные диковины тут имеются...\nBioShock Infinite поражает воображение старым, дедовским способом — за счет богатого воображения его авторов, которым удалось создать по-настоящему захватывающую историю, наполненную яркими образами, запоминающимися персонажами и резкими сюжетными поворотами.

An amazing game to (sadly) finish an amazing franchise. One of the best FPS I have played, as for any Bioshock game for that matter. A must have for any one. Whether you like FPS or whether you don't, this franchise will make you like it - this was my case.\n\nVisually speaking, the game is just one of the most beautiful game out there. Be it graphical style or world design/atmosphere, it is stunning. Goodbye deep sea Rapture, welcome to sky high Columbia, this seemingly flying paradise in which you will take your sweet time contemplating the view. A total change of atmosphere from previous Bioshock game but just as amazing. Props to Irrational Games on that, they prove once again they are true masters on that subject.\n\nGameplay wise, it is no different from its borthers: very smooth, fast pace and responsive FPS mechanisms inherited from the past two episodes, juggling between a good variety - some new interesting ones and some classics - of vigors (ex-plasmids) and fireamrs.\nIf anything different, you can now only carry two firearms at the same time instead of having your full arsenal available like its predecessors, so this could be seen as a limitation regarding the variety of choice, or on the contrary as a more realistic approach of weapon carrying and pushing for more involvement in the choice of the weapon. Whatever suits you best.\nAnother new aspect is the possibility to do vigors combos, a nice little addition in the gameplay for more variety.\nOverall it remains the Bioshock distinctive refined gameplay that we like.\n\nWhere the game actually goes further than the other two is in the character development, thanks to this one character that will walk alongside you throughout the game: Elizabeth. This is the biggest change from the Rapture Bioshocks where you wandered alone with barely any contact aside froma radio.\nAside from being extremely well made (not only good looking with magnificient facial expressions, but also extremely endearing in her personnality), the interactions you will have with her will get you involved into the game and story at a whole new level. You will fall for her. Literally.\n\nAnd speaking of story, prepare yourself as it gets complicated. If you liked Bioshock twisted scenario, prepare yourself here as you will get a headache in this one. To the point where it may be overkill and thus a bit detrimental in the end honestly. still mind blowing.\n\nOverall it is an amazing game that will keep you busy and happy for hours. The game will take around 15 to 20 hours to finish, which is very nice compared to current FPS standards.\n\nI will also highly recommend getting the Burial At Sea DLCs which are very much worth it and bring a new enlightment on the history and ties between Rapture and Columbia, while offering a more stealth approach to the game that is very welcome.","timestamp_created":1484601401,"timestamp_updated":1484601422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29303523","author":{"steamid":"76561198027269109","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1215,"last_played":1471305979},"language":"english","review":"If you love Bioshock 1 or 2 you'll love this game.

The storyline is rather complex and you might not understand it at first, but once you do you will instantly feel that you've left so many details behind. The characters are memorable and having Elizabeth as your right hand everywhere you go just intensifies the feelings of protection and care through the story. The artwork is really amazing, voice acting is very good and the soundtrack is superb, which creates a great and constant atmosphere.\n\nGraphically this game is very good, but beyond the graphics quality, the artistic style is what should be highlighted in my opinion. The color palette used is perfect and gives a unique and unforgettable look to the entire game, making the artwork a key piece that certainly adds up to the whole experience.  Nonetheless, the graphic quality is not far behind. The game looks great and is properly optimized for a stable performance.\n\nThe game offers a wide variety of weapons, although you can only carry 2 at a time, and Vigors are well implemented and very fun to use. Throughout the story you will gather Gear pieces, which improve certain stats for Booker, but I found this system to be expendable since it's not given much importance and I rarely found myself using the Gear menu to upgrade my suit. The mechanics of the game are good: movement is nice but the battle mechanics can feel repetitive since enemies are often the same and you already know their behavior.\n\nI'd like to point out that I have not played Burial at Sea since it relates more directly with the storyline of the earlier games of the franchise, so I'd like to play those before playing this DLC.\n\nWith all that said, I think that this game is an incredible experience and I would totally recommend it to anyone. Definitely a must buy even if you are not a follower of the saga, you will still be able to enjoy the whole story and the stunning visuals.","timestamp_created":1484585867,"timestamp_updated":1603321799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29298638","author":{"steamid":"76561198018826422","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":585,"last_played":1477085924},"language":"italian","review":"gioco dalla trama davvero intrecciata e bella. da giocare tutto d'un fiato anche se purtoppo, il gioco pecca leggermente di longevità: un giocatore medio  in 18h riuscirà a finirlo senza problemi.\ntuttavia rigiocabile anche dopo molto tempo; meccaniche e grafica di livello e molto fluida e finale (come tutti i bioshock) mozzafiato","timestamp_created":1484583627,"timestamp_updated":1484583627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29297576","author":{"steamid":"76561198322428965","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":374,"last_played":1632619230},"language":"russian","review":"ак","timestamp_created":1484580173,"timestamp_updated":1632578448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29296905","author":{"steamid":"76561197990954868","num_games_owned":1582,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":763,"last_played":1484430019},"language":"english","review":"They did it AGAIN. Like previous games in the franchise, BadShock Infinite has poor gunplay which is slightly improved by magic. However this time game has a somewhat enjoyable story with a sick twist at the end. Since twist is being revealed 15 minutes before end of the game, a lot of reviews automatically become positive, ignoring gameplay flaws.\n\nAfter 2 previous games someone decided that players don't have time for exploration. Meet the Lizzy, portable ammo and health dispencer. She will revive you (revival animation is cute) and give you shitload of ammo for a small fee - a nice replacement for vita-chambers. Girl is definitely useful, but she is too helpful. Out of ammo - booker, catch this fully reloaded weapon which happened to be the same you use. Low on hp - booker, catch a huge healthpack and don't forget - you are invincible during the animation. Of course this is handy considering you can carry only 2 weapons and lack of portable healthpacks, but it just feels wrong compared to previous games.\n\nWeapons are bad, just bad. There is no reason to use starting pistol after getting anything else, shotgun is somewhat enjoyable, but 4 shots is always not enough. Machinegun is more or less fine with upgrades, but without them I'd rather use pistol. Repeater and whatever else that 20 rounds gun was are meh, heater gun is a joke. RPG needs upgrades, lacks damage. Grenade launcher doesn't feel like it shoots fire grenades, more like bad shotgun. Since there are 2(!) weapons slots instead of 6-8 like in previous games, you will have to swap weapons with new ones almost constantly, which makes the situation even worse. Upgraded shotgun is out of ammo and you need a sniper rifle to kill a bunch of snipers? Sure, booker, catch that sniper rifle without upgrades and take some ammo for it as well. Of course you won't see enemies with shotguns for like another half an hour and even if you do - there will be no shotgun ammo. Thanks consoles for 2 weapon slots.\n\nVigors are kinda fun, the key word is kinda. Since there is no adam, you will have to spend money on both weapon and vigor upgrades. And of course there will be not enough money to upgrade everything so you will have to upgrade things almost blindly to find out later that these upgrades were useless. Bad choices lead to more revivals = more lost money = less upgrades. Adam removal was a mistake. And why can't I lift a patriot with a lifting vigor? I paid like 1k for all upgrades  and yet it does nothing.\n\nYou can finally see where blinking enemies will blink. This is a HUGE improvement, which makes crow dudes bearable. Handymen have stupid range and mobility. Whoever thought that adding an archvile will be fun should be fired. And it always resurrects at least one enemy even if there are no bodies around - why?\n\nAs usual, there is little to none replayability. Maybe someone will enjoy 1999 mode, which makes everything harder, but why cripple yourself when there are better shooters to play? Game looks pretty, has nice design and generic combat music. Story really makes you think and does it's best to hide gameplay flaws behind deep™ meaning and pretty grill. Last fight with bird gimmick was so bad, that only instant ending can make people forget it. Remove the ending twist and amount of positive reviews will be cut at least by one third.","timestamp_created":1484578088,"timestamp_updated":1484578088,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535678863525390625","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29295693","author":{"steamid":"76561198280912316","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":672,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":429,"last_played":1646166225},"language":"turkish","review":"Borcu ödemek istiyorsan kızı getir .","timestamp_created":1484573858,"timestamp_updated":1484573858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29293017","author":{"steamid":"76561198194592714","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1967,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":765,"last_played":1517121323},"language":"koreana","review":"내가 했던 스팀 게임중 제일 재미있게했던 게임 후속작 나오면 나오자마자 바로사야겠다 ㅎㅎ","timestamp_created":1484561576,"timestamp_updated":1484561576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502888321876525879","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29292755","author":{"steamid":"76561198069976292","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":961,"last_played":1468925145},"language":"schinese","review":"前面就像天堂一样美好 结果画风变的太突然了  杀的我措手不及   \n另外伊丽莎白还是短发美啊！！","timestamp_created":1484560237,"timestamp_updated":1484560237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29290291","author":{"steamid":"76561198045441163","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":487,"last_played":1585049297},"language":"english","review":"Honestly so good.","timestamp_created":1484546980,"timestamp_updated":1484546980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29286759","author":{"steamid":"76561198055063451","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":453,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":453,"last_played":1483193739},"language":"english","review":"As it,s predecessors  \" Bioshock Infinite\" Is the solid proof that Irrational Studios and 2k are capable of making a game that both has  a beautiful and Immersive story and impressive gameplay.
