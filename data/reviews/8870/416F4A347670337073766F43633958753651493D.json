剪断了牵挂\n剪一地不被爱的分岔\n长长短短短短长长\n一寸一寸在挣扎\n我已剪短我的发 剪断了惩罚\n剪一地伤透我的尴尬。。。”\n当时脑海里就莫名有这首歌响起。那一刻剪断一切的伊丽莎白是如此迷人。\n一路相伴的父女在互不认识的情况下竟然产生了朋友般的情感。如此才有了那句让人记忆犹新的话，“布克我好想你，不管怎么样你是我拥有过唯一的朋友。”\n可惜在如此深厚又复杂的情感下，为了终结这个闭环，布克接受了被多次元伊丽莎白海葬的结果，布克救女的故事定格在第123次，而后伊丽莎白又牺牲了自己。\n不得不说悲剧就是容易出神作。而每次玩完神作，总是有种玩它恨晚的感觉。\n在will the circle be unbroken的旋律里，一遍遍回味着剧情。\n算了，难受已经够多了，第一部已入，亚特拉斯，你丫给我等着。\n","timestamp_created":1625346589,"timestamp_updated":1625346589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94984888","author":{"steamid":"76561198390937217","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1657390005},"language":"turkish","review":"yolu

That is where the positives end. \nThe story is nonsense and destroys what should be the most important thing about this game, immersion. The vigors are dumb and most of them overlap, not to mention how op some are in comparison to others. Possesion and bucking bronco and immensely strong while the the octopus one and murder of crows are largely useless. The charge is almost a full on suicide on hard difficulty.\nThe whole deal about alternate dimensions is so poorly implemented it makes you shake your head in confusion at what is actually unfolding. By the second time you hop realities it becomes aparent that the writers can pull whatever they want out their ass and justify it with muh infinite realities. \nThe most interesting themes of the game, the values of Columbia and the worldbuilding are sidelined by the dumb dumb Elisabeth plot about other worlds. Riddle me this, if Elisabeth can open a fucking passageway from her Room into Paris why the fuck doesnt she just hop in if she prefers death to being locked in her stupid tower? Why doesnt Booker cover his stupid AD tattoo after he sees an poster warning people about the evils of the man with the AD tattoo? The answers are, because the writers didnt really care about making an actually coherent story and simply wanted to introduce the hot scientific notion of quantum mechanics in their game without understanding them.\nThe main contrivance of the game, the plot device that Elizabeth can hop realities into another possible world, is basically a trick by the writers to advance the plot without actually having to bother about such trite things as causation and natural progression. Take for instance the second time they hop realities. The dynamic duo are confronted with a situation where they have to move heavy weaponry from point A to point B. How do they resolve it? By jumping to a reality where the weaponry has already been moved. Notice how stupid this is? If their main goal is to escape Columbia why the fuck dont they just hop to a reality where they have already achieved that? We know it is possible based on the very first scene we see of Elizabeth where she opens a portal to Paris and doesnt bother to hop in. Amazing. This completely and utterly destroys inmersion anybody who cared about the story might have had.\nPeople might be wondering why I devote so much time into what seem like simple plotholes in a story when ths is a videogame. Well, the story basically is the videogame. There are plenty of much better shooters out there. This game is to be judge by how well it integrates first person shooting with the grand ad nuanced narratve we have come to expect from Bioshock. It does poorly in all regards.\nI wouldnt complain so much if the narrative was just ok, but it feels like a punch in the gut when you realize nothing makes sense. The ending is similarly nonsensical, we are operating on multiple worlds here, every decision leads to a branching path, so why did the protagonists decide that killing Comstock would solve anything in all worlds when there is always a world where they did not decide to kill Comstock?\nOverall, fun shooter with amazing setpieces being held back by repetitive combat and an eyerolling worthy plot.","timestamp_created":1625273130,"timestamp_updated":1625332825,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94921286","author":{"steamid":"76561199010924665","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1035,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1035,"last_played":1625272611},"language":"brazilian","review":"BÃO","timestamp_created":1625272759,"timestamp_updated":1625272759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94916991","author":{"steamid":"76561198331488159","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1625266025},"language":"russian","review":"Игра отличная, красивая очень и интересная, но сюжет, аааааа, зачем так сложно((","timestamp_created":1625266714,"timestamp_updated":1625266714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94915163","author":{"steamid":"76561198212500840","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":900,"last_played":1625264448},"language":"english","review":"Amazing","timestamp_created":1625264507,"timestamp_updated":1625264507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94909732","author":{"steamid":"76561198291299985","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1625258139},"language":"english","review":"The game was amazing overall\nBut the ending was least to say confusing and stupid didnt like it but the game is worth a play\nOnly gameplay problem i had was on hard mode trying to get ammo for guns you cant just stick to 2 weapons and upgrade them to max you really have to switch between weapons especially towards the end.","timestamp_created":1625258265,"timestamp_updated":1625258265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94908457","author":{"steamid":"76561198799090719","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1169,"last_played":1533218727},"language":"schinese","review":"玩了很多游戏，但是可以像伊丽莎白这样被我记住的NPC太少了，生化奇兵无限，第九艺术实至名归","timestamp_created":1625256857,"timestamp_updated":1625256857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94907530","author":{"steamid":"76561198104507808","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":433,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":433,"last_played":1625255788},"language":"english","review":"Such a great game, I had to replay this once I got a PC.","timestamp_created":1625255818,"timestamp_updated":1625255818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94906114","author":{"steamid":"76561198384979085","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":828,"last_played":1659468451},"language":"english","review":"I passed the game at a high level of difficulty and did not feel any resistance from the AI.

\"The White Injun\"的称号。\n\n伤膝战役小科普：Booker在16岁参军，在伤膝河战役时，Booker在犹豫该不该下手屠杀已经投降的平民，而中士此时面对所有人指责Booker拥有土著人的血统（所以才不下杀手）。为了不被朋友同僚嘲笑，Booker剥掉了土著人的皮，并点燃了仍有印第安人在内的帐篷。由于这一令人发指的行径，编队中的同僚，包括Cornelius Slate，给了他这个The White Injun（白皮印第安人）的称号，因为Booker喜欢从受害者身上收集战利品。\n\n经过这次战役之后，Booker一直为当日的所作所为感到后悔。战役结束后，Booker带着内疚去参加一个小河中进行的洗礼，希望能够以新的身份重新开始生活。但是，在最后时刻，Booker拒绝了洗礼，认为自己的罪孽无法靠“浸在水里”消除。与此同时，另一个位面的Booker接受了洗礼，成为Comstock。\n\n1892年1月，Booker成为 Pinkerton's National Detective Agency的一名侦探，由于在处理工人运动时利用极端的暴力手段而背负“盛名”。在为Pinkerton工作期间，他遇到一个女人，并很快的搞大了人家的肚子。结果该女子在生Anna时难产死了。这场悲剧结合Booker因平时滥用暴力的行为而被工作机构开除，Booker走向了自我堕落，沉迷于酗酒和赌博。\n\n1893年，Booker成为了私人侦探，但债务高筑。在1893年10月, Robert Lutece 走进Booker的办公室，代表Comstock神父给了他一个用女儿Anna抵消所有债务的条件。出于绝望，Booker将女儿交给了Lutece和Comstock。Booker在Anna即将被Comstock带入传送门的最后一刻反悔，在与Comstock争抢Anna时，由于传送门的关闭，Anna在Booker的位面留下了一截被时空切断的手指，因为Anna获得了穿梭位面的能力。\n\nBooker陷入更大的绝望，之后在自己的右手上烙印了AD两个字符来即纪念自己的女儿Anna DeWitt。20年之后，1912年，Lutece兄妹再次出现，开启了一个位面让Booker进入解救自己的女儿。进入位面时，Booker由于空间转换效应（由Lutece提出）失去了记忆同时捏造出了新的记忆。他将20年前卖女儿抵债的记忆和现在的解救女儿任务搞混，认为自己应该找到一个叫Elizabeth，并将她带去纽约，然后抵消自己的债务。\n\n之后便是无限中发生的剧情，找到Elizabeth，E被SONGBIRD抓走，另一个位面被洗脑成功因为过度使用空间装置而加快衰老的Elizabeth将Booker召唤过去，让他将一个控制SONGBIRD的密码交给刚被抓走的E，之后E在得到密码后开启了全部的空间力量。在女神之塔被SONGBIRD摧毁后，SONGBIRD失控，试图攻击E和BOOKER，被E传送到深海中被水压挤死。\n\n开启全部力量的E带领BOOKER走过灯塔的每一个门，BOOKER的记忆也慢慢回归，记起了自己当初卖掉女儿以及在争抢女儿时，Anna被切断小拇指的经过。他也想起来，E就是Anna，是自己的女儿。BOOKER被E带回当初接受洗礼的地方，BOOKER同样在最后时刻拒绝了洗礼，同时告诉E一切都结束了，COMSTOCK已经死了，他们可以一起去巴黎。E回答，comstock没有死，还活在千千万万的世界里。愤怒的BOOKER表示E所受的一切苦难都是COMSTOCK造成的，要将COMSTOCK淹死在摇篮里。E问BOOKER，是否真的决定要这么做，BOOKER给与了肯定的回答。\n\n最终E将BOOKER带到“摇篮中的comstock”位面，BOOKER发现，是自己在小河中接受洗礼前的场景，他终于明白，自己在接受与不接受洗礼时产生了两个位面，只要这个做出决定前的BOOKER还活着，不接受洗礼的BOOKER和接受洗礼的COMSTOCK就会一直在不同的位面出现，E也会一直受苦。最终，BOOKER让所有位面的E将自己淹死在小河里。其他位面的E，由于BOOKER和COMSTOCK都不存在所以一个接一个的消失了，只有当前位面的E还存在着。\n\nBOOKER在1893年10月8日，失去女儿的同一天醒来，他打开了ANNA的房门，见到ANNA的婴儿车还在屋内。\n\nZachary Comstock\nBOOKER在小河中接受了洗礼的版本，他成为一个宗教狂热人士，利用新的信仰重新塑造了自己的身份。很快在美国政府中获得很大影响力。\n洗礼之后，COMSTOCK遇见了女科学家Rosalind Lutece，当时RL正在进行有关原子控制的实验，命名为Lutece领域，可以锁住原子并在空间中固定位置。C对此很感兴趣，并认为这项实验令哥伦比亚浮空成为可能。在得到政府支持后，C开始利用这项科技对哥伦比亚进行建造。项目在1893年竣工，伴随着大量的宣传，C成为了城市的领袖，之后创建了一个完全由白人居民组成的政治团体“奠基人”。\n\nC开始意识到美国的“新伊甸园”形态，并认为自己是人类的先知，聆听了神的声音。他同样认为白人才是真正高贵的人种，对其他人种应该歧视。他认为哥伦比亚是他能够实现正义的关键。（白人至上）\n\n随后C和他的狂热追随者comstock夫人结婚。\n\n*comstock夫人小科普：C夫人是C众多追随者中的一员。在早年生活中，她自私地利用大量追求者为自己谋利。C出现，告诉她可以有一个机会洗清自己的罪过，并与C结婚的机会。C夫人感激涕淋，成为第一夫人后利用自己的影响力帮助丈夫进行宣扬工作。尽管如此，在见识了丈夫对意见不同的人进行的残酷手段后，她开始质疑自己的信仰。在C找回另一位面的女儿后，由于嫉妒和怀疑此女为C和女科学家所生，在容忍并默认孩子是C和自己所生两年之后，决定将事实公之于众。在公布之前被C杀死，并嫁祸于她的女佣Daisy Fitzroy。\n\n1892至1893年间，通过对Lutece领域更深入的研究之后，女科学家Rosalind发现，他可以与另一位面进行沟通。在那里，他发现了Robert Lutece，另一个位面的自己，也正在做同样的实验。为了能够和另一位面的男版自己面对面，R将实验收获告知了C。C提供了更多的财政支持，相信她的发现会预知未来，另一方面无视了她的警告。1893年，男女Lutece创造出了一个能够进入其他位面的设备。1893年10月8日，他们成功地开启了一个位面，让男版Lutece可以进入女版Lutece的位面。\n\nC大量的运用此装置，通过它观察其他位面，甚至能观察到未来。当他将自己所见告知商人Jeremiah Fink之后，后者利用此项技术极大的提高了科技水平。（最终通过在其他位面了解到的科技为C创造了SONGBIRD）。由于使用位面装置观察未来，格伦比亚的人民视C为先知，并将他奉为神祗。\n\n1901年，在义和团起义期间，由于起义军扣押美国人质，C下令哥伦比亚向天朝平民开火。这个行为导致世界意识到哥伦比亚现在是一艘巨大的战舰。美国政府与哥伦比亚脱离关系，并要求C下台。C认为这是国家对自己的背叛，之后C让哥伦比亚消失在高空之中，宣布哥伦比亚独立，认为美国也是自己需要拯救的国家之一，和其余所有国家一样。\n\n通过Lutece的装置，C看到了哥伦比亚的未来必须掌控在自己的血脉中，否则大业就会失败。由于过度使用空间装置，他的衰老速度过快，随后发现自己已经失去了生育能力。他要求男女Lutece帮他找到其他位面的子嗣。\n\n1893年10月，男L发现了BOOKER，后者在拒绝接受洗礼后，依然沉浸在赌博和酗酒之中，债台高筑。男L和C提出了用女儿抵消债务的条件，BOOKER答应了。\n\n几乎片刻后BOOKER就后悔了这个决定，他请求男L交还回ANNA。尽管BOOKER与C进行了一番争夺，C最终还是带着ANNA离开了。\n\nC认为ANNA是完成他梦想的关键。可是这个孩子却不被C夫人待见，认为这是C和女L的私生子。在第一夫人的持续作死下，C将其软禁在Monument Island Tower中。在ANNA展现空间撕裂能力之后，C将其重新命名为Elizabeth,同时称其为Lamb of Colmubia，哥伦比亚圣女。\n\n之后，过量使用空间装置后，C的身体老化情况更加严重，患上癌症，另外使他在38岁就拥有一副老人的相貌。他同时预测到，BOOKER会最终从他手中将E夺走。于是他开始警告世人关于BOOKER“假牧师”的出现，同时开始计划利用科技手段让E完全服从于他。\n\n与此同时，第一夫人继续作死，并表示要把E不是C亲生的这个消息公布于众。C谋杀了她，并栽赃于她的女仆Daisy Fitzroy。这导致后者发动了VOX起义。\n\n也在此时，男女L通过空间装置看到了未来的哥伦比亚，以及E的悲惨命运。为了阻止这一切的发生，他们决定偷偷的将E送回原来的位面。C很快发现了这对男女的行为，命令Fink在他们的空间装置上藏好炸药，在他们使用装置时害死他们，造成一场意外。这场爆炸导致了男女L可以任意穿梭所有的时间和位面，令他们可以在任意时间任意地点出现。为了继续阻止 C，他们设计了一个方案，让BOOKER前去哥伦比亚夺回自己失散多年的女儿。（你俩为啥不直接回去把BOOKER摁死在水里？）\n\n之后是生化奇兵中发生的剧情，C最终被BOOKER溺死在水池中。\n\n海葬中的Comstock和Elizabeh以及Sally\n\n淹死BOOKER之后，其他位面的C和BOOKER都消失了，唯有一个错乱的平面中C和BOOKER依然存在，也正因为这个平面的C依然存在，E没有消失。E来到最终的位面正好赶上C和BOOKER在抢夺ANNA，E希望自己的出场能让ANNA在争夺过程中，大部分留在BOOKER的位面中，而小拇指被空间切断，这样ANNA就可以同时拥有撕裂空间的能力又能和自己的父亲在一起。但是C在最后时刻突然发力，导致ANNA的头被空间裂缝切断。\n\nC充满了悔恨和愧疚，命令男女L将他送到一个他什么都记不起来的位面去，他们选择了1949年的海底城。在出发之前，C在右手背烙印了AD两字纪念被自己害死的女儿以及在失忆后重新以旧身份BOOKER生活。在经历空间效应之后，C忘记了一部分记忆，并捏造了新的记忆。E很快找到了他，并决定让在让他记起一切之后杀死他。\n\n之后的十年里：\nC又走上了BOOKER的老路，酗酒赌博。在1代中的Frank Fontaine政权倒台期间，little sister孤儿院停业，C收养了一个名为Sally的孤儿，接着在Sir Prize的一场赌博中赢钱时把Sally搞丢了。\n\nE回到了1958的海底城，通过一个Silver Fin饭店的裂隙进入了这个城市。裂隙被饭店老板，Morris Lauderman发现并汇报给科学家Suchong Yi进行学习。E逐渐熟悉了海底城的文化，并开始卖自己新款式的衣服....为了融入环境，E阅读了大量关于城市的书籍，了解了Ryan的理论。为了能够抓住Cohen非法交易的把柄和弄清他与Sally的联系，她最终成功突围成了著名艺术家Sander Cohen的助手。期间E录制了一首歌“you belong to me”。由于她的出席，时空裂缝再次出现在城市里，这引起了科学家Suchong Yi的关注。\n\nE最终找到了C的住处，并了解了他的情况以及他和Sally的关系。当Sullivan告诉C，Sally已经死了以后，E知道Sally其实被抓去制造成little sister收集ADM，被Cohen送去了未知的地方。得到这些消息之后，E开始了复仇。\n\n1958年12月31日，E走进C的办公室，并给C提供了一个找回Sally的任务。E狡猾的避免暴露自己的意图，并坚称Cohen知道Sally的动向。C表示这项任务免费，并开始与E一起寻找Sally。\n\n过程中C多次对E起疑，但都被E利用对C和Sally之间的关系，以及如何丢掉Sally的描述打消。\n\n之后是海葬一中的剧情，历经艰难险阻，最终E和C看见Sally逃进通风管道。E建议关闭所有只留一个，并且打开加热逼Sally出来。C不同意，怕会伤到Sally但最终还是同意了。关闭了所有出口以后，他们来到最后一个玩具区，E打开了加热，烫到了Sally，也令C备受煎熬。C在试图将Sally拉出管道时发现Sally已经被制造成lttle sister，一晃神松开了手。之后C和Sally的BIG DADDY殊死搏斗将其打到，并认为已经杀死了它。\n\nC回到通风管道尝试再次将Sally拉出来。在争抢过程中，E命令他记起曾经害死ANNA后逃到海底城的经过。这时男女L出现揭开了真相，并告诉他C永远只会逃避自己的错误。C后悔万分，向E道歉。E回答“不用，你很快就会感到抱歉了”，之后复苏的BIG DADDY一锥戳死了C。出乎意料的是，BIG DADDY在杀死C之后又用把E钉死在了墙上。\n\n海葬二中的Elizabeth\n这个时候最后一个位面的C和E已经死了。E在弥留之际产生了幻觉，自己置身于巴黎，过着想象中完美的生活。之后黑云大作，Sally出现，E在悔恨中醒了过来。\n\n男女L出现告诉EE，之所以她还活着是因为她拥有撕裂空间的能力。如果她要回到海底城的话，必须放弃能力变成一个普通人，因为在这个位面她已经死过一次了，同时她也要受到空间转换的影响失去一部分记忆。于是E回到了海底城，尝试救出Sally并活下来。\n\n之后是海葬2中的剧情，在BOOKER幻觉的陪伴下，E完成了Atlas的各种任务，帮其取得了控制JACK的密码。在交给Atlas密码时，A给了E头部一扳手，导致E的精神再次撕裂空间，来到了JACK所在的飞机上，看到未来的JACK在收到Atlas的指令后劫持飞机。拿到密码的A不明白密码的含义，要求E告诉他密码代表什么。E告诉A密码是“wound you kindly”之后，A用扳手给了E致命的一击。\n\nE在濒死之际看到了未来的景象，JACK劫持并坠毁了飞机，到达海底城，推翻Ryan，解救little sister，最终推翻Atlas。E想起了曾经看过的最后一道门，JACK从海底城回到陆地，给了所有little sisiter一个家。（1代good end）\n\nE最终意识到，她之前所看到的未来是关于JACK的，在溺死Booker之后她没有消失而回到海底城，就是为了发起对Sally的营救，从而结束对儿童的暴力和虐待，拯救Sally的命运。这时候，Sally握着E的手，唱着La Vie en Rose，E微笑地看着Sally死去了。\n\n至此：\n1.所有的Elizabeth都消失了;\n2.所有的接受或不接受洗礼的Comstock和Booker也都消失了;（*海葬中最后一个由Comstock穿梭空间后化成的Booker死后，与其对应的未接受洗礼的Booker也消失了）。\n4.唯一的未做出选择位面中的Booker和Anna生活在一起。\n5.所有的little sister都被Jack拯救了","timestamp_created":1625232377,"timestamp_updated":1625999745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94877715","author":{"steamid":"76561198021841147","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":797,"last_played":1655971640},"language":"russian","review":"Крайне
