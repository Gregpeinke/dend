Huge Success!\nYes, this game is a huge success.\nIf you enjoyed the first Portal then why on earth are you reading this and haven't already bought this game?\n\nThe sarcastic GladOS is back and she's very cross with you after you killed her in the first game (I'm allowed to spoil the ending of the last game, you shouldn't be looking at the sequel!)\nIf you've played the first game then you're probably expecting more of the same... Well... Yes and No.\nThere's a lot more challenges, so many more different blocks to use and different techniques to use to beat your puzzles. \n\nNot to mention the fantastic voice acting in this game will always make you want to keep playing just to hear more. The beginning of this game is quite similar to the last one, learning how to make portals and all that, teaching you the ropes again, but that quickly disappears into much harder puzzles to get through so don't worry, you'll be pulling your hair out and slamming your head against the wall in no time!\n\nI really do recommend this game, it's the definition of a FUN game. Something a lot of games like to forget. It adds something new to the table, while it's very similar to the last game, we need more innovative ideas like this game to really appreciate modern day games. It's not all about the pew pews and explotions, it can be about awesome dialogue and puzzles too!\n\nSo bring on Portal 3!\n... Oh wait...
