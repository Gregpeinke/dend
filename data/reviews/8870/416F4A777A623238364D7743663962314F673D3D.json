Since the first moment when we step into the Columbia, I fell in love with this game. \n\nThe art-style is beyond any words, to combine the steampunk and early 20th century United States fashion might sound like a simple idea, yet the execution is beyond my words, the only correct one would be... perfect. All of this with amazing graphics that still look amazing to this day, except maybe for vegetation, fruits, human animations and eyes (some might say the latter two are too cartoony). \n\nAnd atmosphere, of course... It feels like bright cozy home when you are in bright locations, it makes you feel anxious in dark and sinister environment, it makes you sad when you see innocent people being a punchbag for the crowd's fun, and thats just the beginning.\n\nGameplay - Simple and yet detailed. As you progress through the story, you will find more guns (yet you can carry only 2) and vigors (two at the same time, BUT you can swap the one you don't want to use for another vigor), latter is a \"magic spell\", there is one for hypnosis, burning grenade, and more on as story progresses. There is also a sky-line, a railroad from which you can directly strike and insta-kill enemies (except for big guys), or just shoot them from above. Enemies differ in types, and further you go, more quantity and diversity: from a simple policeman, to a big ass handy guy (this one doesn't seem to be great for handshakes, I tried). Simple, easily learnt, and that's what so good about it. You understand the game and just get to perfecting your use of its mechanics, which always satisfy you.\n\nStory - Gasp in surprise, laugh out of joy, and cry because of the end, then look for the truth and be happy because of the true end (after credits).\n\nStory is everything in Bioshock Infinite, it is what drives those people, who don't like gameplay like me, to finish the game. It is what just tears apart 99% of modern video game stories. It is the... perfection of writing. Its complex, very difficult to understand, true. But when you collect all the voxaphones (audio files by different characters), when you complete game once more with more attention to every part, everything makes absolute sense. So much sense, that this story can't be called anything, but perfect. I won't spoil anything, you HAVE to experience it for yourself, it is an OBLIGATION for every person who knows what a video game is to experience the story of Bioshock Infinite. It is the pinnacle of the video game story, and no game has beaten it (I hope it will be beaten, but 8 goddamn years already passed, and so far - no change)\n\nBioshock Infinite redefined for me what a story driven video game SHOULD be. Yes I will love Last of us 1 and 2, yes uncharted series is a good plot driven series, yes Enderal: Forgotten Stories has amazing and shocking story, Yes Bioshock 1 has great, dark and twisted story, Yes, there are dragon age and mass effect series with very deep characters and lore, Yes there is famous Red Dead Redemption 1 and 2. AND YET NONE OF THEM CAN BEAT THE PERFECTION OF GODDAMN BIOSHOCK INFINITE (at the very damn least, for me).\n\nIt is saddening that the game ends, it is devastating that there is far too few games that can compete with it, it is sad that there is no game that would beat Bioshock Infinite for me. \n\nAnd yet I am happy that I love that game, I am happy I was able to witness it as a 10 year old Christian, and as a 18 year old atheist, I have seen it from both perspectives, and loved it from each one. This diamond of video games must be preserved at all costs and hailed forever.\n\nThank you Irrational Games for this Masterpiece, thank you for changing my mind, and life. Thank you for everything.\n\n10/10.

I didnt want to stop playing when I got into the story. I have some friends who are interested but use apple Macs so iI think Bioshock should be avalible for Macs not just Windows and Xbox 360. Still i loved the art and charecter modles it was one of my all-time favorites along with the rest of the sieries. I got interested when I found a PC disk for Bioshock 1 as a young child and was curiouse towards the game so I watched a lets-play of the game and was set on playing it. when I found out about Bioshock 2 I was extremly happy with the gameplay and story. I also watched part of a Bioshock Infinite lets-play by a youtuber called TheRadBrad so i sugest you check that out. when I finished Infinite i was sad that booker had to die. I was even sadder in Bioshock 2 with the good ending that subject deltas mind was trasported to elenores body so deltas body died but mind was downloaded into elenores body and elenore died.

Not that there aren't any nitpicks, but overall, this game is pretty solid. I have played through this game twice, once on Medium, once on Hard. In the future, I might try 1999 mode, which is the hardest mode after Hard, and is only unlocked after beating Medium mode. Overall, I'd say there is a definite challenge, but I'd recommend heading straight to Medium mode.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Elizabeth. What can be said that hasn't already been said? Usually, a video game ally requires that you keep them alive, and are usually very stupid and bumbling. But Liz is fantastic. Not only is she always safe, but she's also crucial to the plot, and, most importantly, she throws you ammo, salts, and health during fights. This is important in two ways: 1) it keeps you fighting longer, without dying (because dying, in this game, is worth money), and 2) makes her important. When she's no around, you actually miss her, wish that she were there, because she's absent from the field, and therefore not there adding to the plot and giving you supplies. This is very smart. By making her useful, you become attracted to her. By making you invested in the character, you actually feel a sense of urgency and necessity to getting her back (as she does disappear from time to time). This makes finding her an actual desire, rather than a chore, and therefore investing your attention. Also, I thank 4K for not making Liz a love interest. Even though she is attractive (and wears some low-cut shirts later in the game), she and Booker never have any attraction between them; it's just a matter of business, and, later, friendship. This is a fantastic move, away from other triple-A titles of recent years, whose crutch is a busty, attractive female character whose sole purpose is to simply exist as an attractive woman, rather than a useful, interesting, friendly person like Liz.\n+Even on low graphic settings, the vistas and views from the flying barges and skylines are spectacular. Seeing the misty clouds, floating buildings, and the sun filtering through the trees is pretty darn cool. I'm not sure how great the improvement is to max graphics settings, but that's for others to decide.\n+Sounds, guns are punchy and entertaining. Everything feels explosive and action-packed. There's nothing more invigorating than flying around, shooting your foes with a carbine, or taking down a heavy with your RPG. It's unbelievably fun.\n+Gear system is a new addition to the \"Bioshock\" series; you can equip clothes, or \"gear\", that you can find in locked rooms and hidden places. A hat, for example, may give you the ability to light enemies on fire when you Skyline-Strike them. Or a pair of lovely pants that refill your health when you respawn. The cosmetics don't alter your appearence, however, and are simply stats. Also, I swear that in my two play-throughs, I found different cosmetics, and missed some I'd already found, giving greater variety to the system. [Notice: I've encountered a strange glitch involving a certain hat, which, upon equipping, crashes my game. It's very strange, not sure if anyone else has this issue, but not an error that ruins the game]\n+The story is fantastic. It is able to talk about contemporary topics of the 1910's in a non-subjective way that allows the player to think for themselves, and make their own moral decisions. The story is well played out, paced well, and fairly interesting. Definitely one of my favorite plots of all time. \n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Vigors are useless. They're useful in a few places, and they're an absolute riot to use, even more so than the older games. But unlike the original games, wherein the plasmids were useful not only for taking down or stunning enemies but to also open areas and clear atmospheric obstacles, the vigors serve no purpose other than killing foes and opening something specific to the game's storytelling. I found that, in my initial play-through, every firefight could be just as easily won through bullets as with combined arms. Unlike in the original games, where bullets are expensive and hard to come by, ammo and money are literally [u]everywhere[/u], so you're almost never out of cash to spend on ammunition for your shotgun.\n-The boss fights are really annoying. Have you ever hated game bosses where they simply lock you in a condfined space and tell you to just kill a ton of dudes? That's every boss in this game.\n-Enemies are pretty boring. 90% of the time, you'll spend your time fighting plain humans, although with assorted weapons. The special enemies, such as the \"Firemen\", \"Motorized Patriots\", \"Boys of Silence\", \"Crow\" and \"Handyman\", are rather interesting, and each require a different strategy to beat. For example, you can take the vigor you receive later in the game, the \"Return to Sender\", to catch the Fireman's bombs and whip them back at him. However, but there aren't enough of them for it to feel fun. \n-The game lacks a lot of the scary elements of the original games, trading in terror at sea for high-flying shooting in the sky.\n-There are many more guns than in the previous games, but half of the guns are simply the same thing as the other half (one half are the regular weapons, the other half are \"Vox Populi\" remakes, with slightly different stats).\n-Unlike in the previous games, you can only carry two weapons at a time, and all of your vigors, as compared to the first game (which allowed you to carry all of your weapons at once). This makes some firefights hard, and you have to plan to carry one short-range, one long-range gun (i.e. a shotgun and a carbine). \n-One aspect of the original games that made combat interesting that was left out of this game was the different ammo types, which allowed you to have certain bullets that deal with heavy armor rather than flesh. I missed this in \"Bioshock: Infinite\".\n-The game offers, in a few places, decisions over whether to choose a specific action or not. However, after playing the game again, I came to the conclusion that the decisions did not actually matter (as in, they didn’t hold any bearing on the ending, such as the first two \"Bioshock\" games did with the collection of \"Little Sisters\" on the good/neutral/bad ending).\n\n[b]Final Verdict:[/b]\nI enjoyed this game, as evident in my 25+ hours playing the game twice. There are definitely some things I didn’t approve of, such as the low weapon inventory, expensive revivals, too few good enemies, and uninspired vigors. But overall, the thrill of flying along the skyline, firing my pistol on the guards below, jumping down on the enemies with a skyline strike, makes it a pretty fun game. It may be one of my favorite games, but it's not my absolute favorite. \nMy biggest note about this game was the feeling I encountered after I finished it; it didn't feel like a \"Bioshock\" game. I have not played the second game in the series, but I felt fairly familiar with the plot and atmosphere of the first. Whereas the first game was about searching for every scrap of ammo and health, trying to save yourself from the splicers and other insane inmates of Rapture's sunken Hell, \"Bioshock: Infinite\" is about high-flying action. There's no premise of survival, simply enjoying the ride and unlocking the secrets of Columbia. They're different game types, they emphasize different strategies, and they vary in styles. They're so different, except for their references, that I couldn't tell they were related. This doesn't mean they're bad. They're both [u]fantastic[/u]. Point made.\n\n[b]Verdict: 9/10[/b]","timestamp_created":1429750355,"timestamp_updated":1433158864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15497890","author":{"steamid":"76561198095308064","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":964,"last_played":1429748539},"language":"english","review":"I wanted this game so bad after all of the great reviews I've read all over the internet.
