It's not as good as Opposing Force and certainly not as long, but it's pretty fun - except for some infuriating parts where they throw you at some puzzles with ridiculous solutions.\n\nNear the end of the game, there's a door that needs to be blown up with TNT, but the cables that connect the TNT to the detonator were cut. So, the logical solution would be to shoot the TNT so it would blow up, or use a grenade, right? Nope. You have to get a BARREL and push it in the middle of the disconnected cable, so the BARREL \"connects\" them? What? That doesn't even make sense, that is the stupidest solution I've ever seen to a puzzle, ever. What were they thinking? The only reason why I wasn't stuck in this part for a long time is because I've just finished the two previous Half-Life games, so I'm used to sh*t like this, so when I see it I immediately know it's time to open youtube and search for the solution. On the walkthorugh video that I saw, EVERY single comment is talking about how stupid this \"puzzle\" is.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty fun and immersive, and a fine addition to the Half-Life story from a different perspective, but I just had to express how frustrating that part was.","timestamp_created":1581439866,"timestamp_updated":1581439866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63344986","author":{"steamid":"76561198818160686","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1581410354},"language":"portuguese","review":"O jogo em si é muito bom, Mas é muito curto, sem contar que o porte dele para o pc (Inicialmente feito para consoles) é muito ruim, Mas isso não chega a atrapalhar e são apenas DETALHES.

Przykładowo, już na samym początku gry przez dłuższy czas spotykamy przyjaźnie nastawione postaci, nie mając ani do kogo, ani z czego strzelać.
