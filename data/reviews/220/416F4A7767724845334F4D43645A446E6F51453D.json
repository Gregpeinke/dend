Игра собрала множество наград и более 45 титулов «Игра года 2004». Для многих это игра вызывает ностальгию, ибо вышла она в далёком 2004 году. Не буду долго расписывать, просто расскажу про минусы и плюсы по-моему мнению:\n\nПлюсы:\n\n+Очень трудно встретить баги\n+Отличный сюжет\n+Атмосферные уровни\n+Фишка главного героя\n+Прекрасные звуки, озвучка и саундтреки к игре\n\nМинусы:\n\n-Бывают моменты, когда ты не знаешь, что делать или куда идти. У меня это было за игру раз десять. И я либо шёл на ютуб, либо пытался сам. (Это не критичный минус, но бывало подбешивало)\n-Тупые НПС, которые только и могут, что стопить вас и мешать вам.\n\n\nВ итоге минусы я выявил уж очень незначительные, и они не покрывают кучу значимых плюсов.

Se publicó el 16 de noviembre de 2004, 14 años han pasado y sólo puedo decir que ha envejecido de una manera increíble.\nLa historia de Half Life 2 pone al jugador en el papel de Gordon Freeman, continuando la historia del primer juego salimos del estado de hibernación en el que G-man habia puesto a Gordon y a los pocos minutos de juego nos percatamos que el imperio de alienigenas ha esclavizado a lo que queda de población de Ciudad 17, uniformandola con monos de presidiario, recluyendola en apartamentos, lo que queda de población humana se encuentra contra las cuerdas.\nGran control del personaje, la experiencia jugable de Half life 2 es muy satisfactoria el jugador cuenta con la palanca, símbolo de la saga Half Life como arma cuerpo a cuerpo, el arma de energía de punto cero o arma gravitatoria que creo que surgió en Valve como medio para aprovechar mejor el nuevo motor de físicas  que desarrollaron los chicos de Valve en exclusiva para este videojuego.\nDurante el gameplay visitamos diferentes partes de la ciudad 17 creada por Viktor Antonov director artístico de videojuegos y artista conceptual, sus exteriores a bordo de una lancha y un vehículo todoterreno, Half life 2 tiene una gran virtud que no tienen otros videojuegos de su mismo género, esa virtud es que la narrativa del videojuego no está contada quitándole el control del personaje al jugador sino lo contrario, al avanzar más en el videojuego al llegar a Ravenholm que, según el lore del juego es un antiguo pueblo minero que tras la tormenta de portales en el primer Half life que el protagonista en su centro de trabajo desencadena por accidente el tono cambia y se vuelve un survival horror al estilo de videojuegos clásicos de terror como Dead Space, FEAR, Slender the eight pages, Resident Evil 4 etc de que es más que probable que de mas sustos y su compra deje más satisfecho al consumidor que la de otros videojuegos sobrevalorados para un servidor como son Bendy and the inc machine o Amnesia a machine for pigs que no son más que subproductos de esta industria. El juego cuenta con algún que otro pequeño puzle para usar la pistola gravitatoria que se soluciona muy rápidamente, unos 30 o 40 minutos de conducción del coche todoterreno, manejo de una grúa 33 logros para desbloquear que le aportan un poco de rejugabilidad. Se completa en 12 horas en dificultad normal y los videojuegos que más se le pueden comparar son los de la saga Bioshock y System Shock porque tienen buena trama y los tres son FPS.\nSe público en 2007 el recopilatorio para Xbox 360, PS3 y PC The Orange box que incluye Team Fortress 2, Portal y Half Life 2 y sus dos episodios.\n14 años después HALF LIFE 3, todos los jugadores que han jugado Half life 2, tanto en su lanzamiento en 2004 como los más recientes estamos de acuerdo en que queremos una tercera parte de este titulo.
