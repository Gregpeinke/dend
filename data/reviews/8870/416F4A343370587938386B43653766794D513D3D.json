The ones saying to buy it and you won't regret it in particular were big fat liars for me.\nHence why Im writing this review even if I normally don't bother with such things. It's probably going to be an unpopular opinion going by the masses of hyperbolic reviews that read more like gushing love letters yet get a ton of upvotes seemingly for just liking the game (tbf that's a problem I see in steam reviews in general) but sod it, I don't care about being downvoted so long as I spare a few people wasting their money like I did.\n\nThe gunplay and overall gameplay is mediocre to dull, arguably the most boring set of weapons I've wielded in an fps in a long time  and it was a painful slog playing through with little excitement outside cutscenes where a lot of cool stuff happens but the actual game lacks tension, exarceberated by the games overall easy difficulty, even on hard mode. Apparently there's an old school mode but I'll be damned if I have to replay the game to experience it.\n\nYou get an item called a skyhook which you use to grapple onto railings and travel around , but I found whatever thrill is artifically created there as you swoosh around evaporates when you realize even if you were to somehow mess up and fall off the railings to your doom or just stumble of a ledge, you'd get no penalty and just respawn on a ledge with a flash.It's another little thing that helps you feel less like an action star and more like a passenger being taken for the game's boring ride.\n\nIt's not like I'm new to this series , I quite enjoyed Bioshock, this just felt like a pale imitation of that game at best only with a lot more bloom.  \n\nAs for the story.. Well the fact it couldn't keep my interest going and I ended up not finishing the game and getting buyers remorse should say it all. I ended up watching an LP to see if I missed anything and nope, I even guessed the twist midway through (and I'm no smarty pants). \n If one finds the twist(s) of this game so amazing then actual twists like that found in games like KOTOR would presumably give these people heart attacks due to being so easily impressed.\nThe story is functional but hardly some narrative masterpiece.\n\nThe setting is probably the best thing about the game (city in the skies and all that) but even then it was hardly enough to motivate me to see it through. One of the draws is meant to be Elizabeth I guess but Booker was a boring protagonist so I didn't feel much in their interaction. And for a \"smart\" AI partner Elizabeth sure had a bad habit of getting herself noticed by guards whenever I tried being stealthy in an effort to avoid tedious combat and just blitz through. Other then hiding in a corner in combat she throws you items from time to time, but as I was finding the game easy enough already it wasn't something I was particularly grateful for.\n\nAn Elizabeth related game mechanic (she's a girl who can travel different parallel universes via portals call \"tears\") is your ability to access \"tears\" at certain set pieces of the game to summon things like ammo supplies or turrets or minor structures and platforms from which to navigate whichever section you're in. I didn't feel strongly about this one way or another.\n\nHow this game is anyone's idea of a\"10/10\" leaves me wondering what they have been smoking. Were we even playing the same game?  \nThen again I'm a bit old fashioned in that there ain't a lot of games I'd give a 10/10 to and this one barely reaches a 6 in my book, mainly cos its functional and I guess pretty. Don't believe the hype, this game is no perfect gem and even within its own genre there are far better FPS games to play, which reminds me...\nI bought Shadow Warrior at a similar time to this game and had a lot more fun with it, I guess in a way contrasting these 2 games helps clarify why I hated Bioshock Infinite so much, SW is more of a classic FPS with a focus on the gameplay, Bioshock Infinite is more of a spectacle FPS where the gameplay is secondary to the story it's trying to tell you aswell as trying to wow you with its setting. If you find the story palpatable you'll enjoy the ride even if the gameplay is mediocre and serves only to connect one cutscene to the next, but if like in my case the story leaves you cold or unimpressed, then there is very little to keep your interest in the game. And Lo Wang from SW plus his demon buddy are a much more likeable pair then Booker and Elizabeth in my book, difference is I guess Elizabeth physically follows you around whereas the demon speaks inside your head.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're after an FPS with fun or challenging gameplay, B:I is not that FPS and there are far worthier titles out there.","timestamp_created":1417113494,"timestamp_updated":1417454524,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487732082605361938","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13109273","author":{"steamid":"76561198043620498","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":519,"last_played":1415983924},"language":"english","review":"Wow....

The combat systems are rather satisfying and offer variance for your personal style and expression. Choosing which gun to upgrade or your favourite vigors is up to you without detracting from effectiveness. Things go flying around and it's a very visceral experience no matter which methods you choose. Some of the deaths actually become quite gruesome.\n\nIt's not the combat that's special about this game though. At it's core it's very simplistic and enemies don't offer much of any challenge. The combat is more for a sense of pacing and the feeling urgency or distress you may feel. It was used to great narrative effect in this way. The reason this game gets such high reviews is for the overall cohesive experience the player gets.\n\nThey story is played out in the classic Bioshock/System Shock method. It's almost entirely linear with very little back tracking. The atmosphere and tone goes for a 1900-1920's type of optimism and environment. With dialogue and set building that enforces this. The use of lighting and colours is taken into consideration to create proper setting and feel to each area. Or rather, in some instances a stark contrast. One of the tougher enemies, the motorized patriot is a good example of this.\n\nThe motorized patriots are robots designed to look like founding fathers that go around trying to kill you with a gatling gun. The design of these enemies is really quite something to behold and in and of itself can serve as a metaphor for the city of Columbia. Dressed in colonial garb, they have 2 flags sticking out of their backs that drape behind them like angelic wings. \n\nThey use the dialogue in this game to great effect. My advice is, when someone starts talking, stop and listen. The line deliveries are very well done and are very short and concise. Metaphors and imagery permeate the dialogues with not a single wasted word.\n\nI feel the way the game tells the story through visuals, sounds, and mechanics is top notch.

He's constantly bringing up things he doesn't want to talk about, like a Vaguebook drama queen, thereby immediately careening any potential vehicle of intrigue into a brick wall of irritation. The female lead has a capricious and flaky personality that makes her impossible to follow. I tried to hang on but it lost me.

Os personagen são bem convincentes, principalmente Elizabeth, que é muito carismática e de total importançia na trama do jogo, Booker DeWitt é o personagem princpal do game (apesar de Elizabeth se destacar), ele é enviado a Columbia para resgatar Elizabeth das mãos de Zachary Hale Comstock, vilão do game e tambem connhecido como \"o Profeta\", lider religioso da cidade, que alias, tem um senso de justiça e ética bem deturpado.\n  O grafico é lindo e meio cartunisado, a ciade voadora de Columbia é linda (isso mesmo uma cidade que vôa), a ambientação dos anos 10 é ótima e bem detalhada, e conta com o figurino e arquitetura das construções da época. Os efeitos de iluminção e sombra do game também mereçem destaque.\n  A mecanica do game é praticamente a mesma dos games anteriores, mas temos algumas coisas a mais, como a adição dos aérotrilhos que deixou a jogabilidade bem mais frenética e alguns \"poderes\" diferentes. A quantidade de armas é bem grande, sendo que, temos modelos do exercito de Comstock e Vox Populi .Os modelos da Vox tem algumas  modificações que deixam as coisas mais explosivas.\n   Bem essas são minhas opiniôes sobre o game por isso espero que a respeitem, obrigado desde já, HerculesLF.","timestamp_created":1417036153,"timestamp_updated":1417037039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13094181","author":{"steamid":"76561198076017283","num_games_owned":266,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":881,"last_played":1562775512},"language":"czech","review":"Bez chybyčky!\nTuto hru doporučuji každému!","timestamp_created":1417033914,"timestamp_updated":1426165222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13092835","author":{"steamid":"76561197961262628","num_games_owned":348,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1044,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1430352497},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I've ever played.

I think I got it last year 2013 Black Friday sale and it sat on my hard drive for a year. I was pretty bored by Bioshock 2, but I really liked Infinite. After playing The Last of Us on the PS3, and experiencing that amazing story, I was worried I wouldn't be satisfied by anything else. And even though Infinite came out a couple years before The Last of Us, this was still a very solid story. Like TLoU this story has 2 characters that I really cared about and wanted to see what would happen. The level design is really great overall and the weapons are varied and imaginative. The new \"Vigor\" (still called plasmids) in the menu's and dialog text is also well done. I tend not to bother too much wiyth magic powers if I have guns in a video game but in this case it's almost required. Bucking Bronco was the one I used the most. I also loved the Carbine rifle, single shot simi-auto and hits hard, espececially for head shots and after a few upgrades. And who doesn't love a good ricket launcher? That was always my favorite secondary weapon. It hits REALLY hard, especially after a few upgrades. Speaking of upgrades, the weapons have an upgrade system. At first it seems outragiously expensive, but slowly money becomes easier and easier to find. One thing about the Carbine that was a little annoying was that it was very hard to find ammo for large parts of the game, I would often have to stock up at a \"Dollar Bill\" when ever I saw one and top off my ammo. Controls where also very good, I am an old school keyboard and mouse player, but I can manage with a game pad. I didn't try a gamepad with this game, but I can say the mouse & keyboard was tight yet a bit weighty, I like that. Load times on my 2 year old upper mid tier gameing PC was also very good. \n\nSome niggling complaints about the game. The graphics are very good so when I see the things that I'm about to talk about it kind of pulls me out of the realism of the game a bit. When you walk up to some birds outdoors they fly away if you get too close. If you do that indoors, they fly up into the ceiling through the wall. The characher you protect and you follow around or she followsd you, casts a shadowm but you don't. Sort of understandable since you don't have a body, look down, nothing. But that's common. The pother NPC's with very minor roles, just seem like stiff mannequins. \n\nAgain nothing major, just there. The world is linear but BIG, I can't expect full realism even with such a hiugh quality game. Oh also the sound was INCREDIBLE! Amazing music, dialoge, and other ways to immerse you. \n\nOther than that, the game never crashed on me once, and I never saw a single graphic glitch.\n\nSo yeah, great sotry, great game, great graphics.

Основная идея о множестве миров, разные мелочи, а концовка (и слёзы по щекам)! Я начал полностью соотносить себя с героями. И это всё сопровождается глубокой атмосферностью. Сюжет не подвел.\n\nГеймплей тоже хорош, но не настолько, в 1 BioShocke был лучше (или просто привычнее), но это не чуть не портит впечатление.\n\nА отдельная тема это персонажи... Начнём с Элизабет: я не смогу выразить, на сколько это прекрасный персонаж. И в сюжете, и в процессе боя.

Второй - длительность... конечно, всё хорошее затягивает, и время летит быстро, но это не утешает. Слишком мало Элизабет, так как в следующих сериях игры она врядли будет, это печалит (хотя этот минус усиляет все плюсы).","timestamp_created":1417011620,"timestamp_updated":1417011620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13088169","author":{"steamid":"76561198067168794","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1309,"last_played":1560291281},"language":"english","review":"You can shoot fire, tentacles, crows and more from your hand after drinking some drugs.

The gameplay is so bland and one dimensional compared to previous Bioshock titles. Two weapon system and scarcity of ammo brings a big change, no longer will you pull out the best weapon for the situation on the fly, you really just use what has ammo. Vigors just seem less integral to the gameplay compared to plasmids from previous games. In general, they removed the depth from the combat and level design. The whole thing tends to feel more like a shooter of the week title than the successor to one of the best fps games in history.\nAnd I know, \"you can't just say it's bad because it's not as good as Bioshock\", but think about it like this. What if this wasn't called Bioshock? What if the original never came out and this was the first in the series?

The action is just as fun and interesting as before, with some new powers through Vigors and cool combinations you can set up with them. Half of the game is an escort mission, but unlike in other games, the person you're escorting actually helps you, stays out of the way and takes care of herself during fights, which is a very refreshing change of pace. Fighting in the streets and skies of Columbia is an incredibly fun experience, knocking people off the edge of the city, jumping around on cargo hooks before landing on an enemy and crushing their skull, facing overwhelming odds until you have Elizabeth call in an auto-turret to shoot and distract your enemies.\n\nAnd then there's the story. You probably already know that this was one of the most talked-about stories of 2013, and it definitely deserved to be. You've got everything from time travel to alternate realities to a twist worthy of the original Bioshock, and it's a great ride the entire time. One caveat I would mention, though, is that if you are a fan of the full series of Bioshock, you should get the Burial at Sea DLC and play through that as well once you finish with Infinite. Infinite's story can stand on its own, but the DLC connects the entire series together in a way that was both very satisfying and very surprising. I'm normally fairly \"meh\" about DLC, but the ones for this game really added something, I felt.\n\nSo really, there's not much point in me writing this review: you probably already know if you want this game or not. If you've played other Bioshock games, if you like FPSes, if you enjoy a great story in your games with plenty of twists and turns, then just buy this game. If it looks like anything you might like, I can almost guarantee that you will.
