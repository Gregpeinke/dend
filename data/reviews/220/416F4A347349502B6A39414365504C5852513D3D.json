Gameplay is great, the scene is great. While theres no cutscene, i prefer not to when it comes to Valve because it gives us players a feeling to react just by looking and/or controlling when that scene happens. Though this is much more intense than the original, and sometimes it gets you the feeling you just stepped into a war. They added new stuff such as the meter which shows your oxygen, sprint, and flashlight. When its empty your character can either not sprint, lose air underwater, or flashlight is off. It can be all, and if used both things it wastes quicker.\n\nThe music is also good, giving us the feeling from the gameplay.\n\nNot sure if theres anything i should point out, besides this is Valve we're talking about. The game is really good, and plus you can get mods out of it just as the original. So, definitely buy it. If not for the game, do it for the mods. Theres many you can play from, most likely more than the original.","timestamp_created":1444531354,"timestamp_updated":1444531354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18419920","author":{"steamid":"76561198002718302","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1407,"last_played":1509200723},"language":"english","review":"ruinned my life to wait the third\n33/3","timestamp_created":1444521370,"timestamp_updated":1444521370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18419569","author":{"steamid":"76561198107884759","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1649295138},"language":"english","review":"No matter how many times i playthrough Half Life 2, I always am impressed in a different aspect.

As someone that comes from the Doom 1 and 2 school of FPS gameplay (tank through levels and frag everything that moves with the biggest gun you have), I must say that I was not a fan of the slower portions of the game, such as Water Hazard, Highway 17, and the first portion of Sand Trap. This was mostly due to the vehicle mechanic presenting a frustrating obstacle more often than not, especially due to various irritating \"idiosynchracies\" of the physics engine in relation to vehicles. This, more often than not, left me stuck on guard rails if I was not careful. I must say that the airboat portion felt much more orthagonal and navigable than the \"scout\" (dune) buggy, as I feel that too much time was spent trying to locate the exit from an area whilst being assaulted by fast-moving melee enemies in addition to ranged enimies (civil protection). Although the Tau Cannon is mounted to the buggy, it is more of a hinderance than a help should you try to use it, and I may have gotten four kills with it at most. \n\nThat being said, once you finally make it through the blasted \"grand theft half-life\" portion of the game, things become much more manageable, with standard combat mechanics becoming the norm once again, in addition to the fact that you are now able to dispatch a squad of very sharp, large, alien insects to do your bidding. This is very amusing, and well worth the time spent to get the bug hunt achievment should you want to.\n\nIn summary, this is a good title, should you be willing to spend the time to get through the very tedious beginning, with lots of gameplay, amusing humour (should you pay attention to what various NPC's are saying, both to you and to others).\n\nI would also like to note that the soundtrack for HL2 versus the original Half-Life, and Episode One (I have yet to start E2) is rather lacking if you should want an action soundtrack.","timestamp_created":1444326706,"timestamp_updated":1444326706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18382553","author":{"steamid":"76561198092737611","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":790,"last_played":1444321330},"language":"russian","review":"Нечего сказать .

And what really makes this game stand out is just how well it gives you a sense of immersion into the plot and setting; it does a great job at making you feel like you're really there and care about what happens.\n\nThe game's combat and mechanics are quite good and slick and using the unique weapons such as the gravity gun is quite a blast.\n\nIf there's any con to this game, it's that it occasionally feels a little empty, as the player will travel through vast expanses of cityscapes, caves, plains, and deserts and only occasionally run into a hostile encounter. There are also no \"bosses\" to speak of, and the final encounter isn't particularily challenging. (The additonal chapters however ramp up the action aspect of the game quite a bit compared to the original)\n\nThe game can also take quite awhile to complete, and you'll be so immersed in the plot and seeing it through that it'll be hard to put it down.\n\nIf you have about 20-30 hours to invest in a game, I recommend giving this one a shot, and seriously doubt you'll regret it (save the fact that the final chapter ends on a cliffhanger, and the sequel promised over 10 years ago has still yet to be released).","timestamp_created":1443933378,"timestamp_updated":1443933378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18319455","author":{"steamid":"76561198113106666","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1507680723},"language":"english","review":"Wow!

Czy jest to gra warta uwagi? Cóż według mnie tak ponieważ mimo iż możliwość podnoszenia przedmiotów walających sie po podłodze i Interaktywne guziki itp. są już przestarzałe to gra jest dobra równierz z innych powodów. Mimo niezbyt powalającej grafiki (Lepszej Niż w HL1) gra jest świetna pod wieloma względami np.:\nRzucony przez wroga Granat można podnieść za pomocą Gravity Gun'a i rzucić mu z powrotem. Można go równierz zabić za pomocą beczki a jeśli to zombie to można (Co jest super extra) zabić go nawet piłą! Postacie są genialne tak samo jak fabuła. Co prawda fakt że jak zabijesz kolesia i potem twój przyjacielski NPC przejdzie przez jego ciało to gra nie jest taka zła. Co prawda jeśli chcesz pograć w Multi musisz kupić HL2:Deatchmatch oddzielnie (Ale jeśli w fabułe z kolegami to możesz sobie ściągać Synergy i droga wolna i darmowa) ale nawet jeśli Multi nie ma w grze to naprawde warto ją kupić i zagrać.
