Suppose N is the size of a population of radioactive atoms at a given time t, and dN is the amount by which the population decreases in time dt; then the rate of change is given by the equation dN/dt = −λN, where λ is the decay constant. Integration of this equation yields N = N0e−λt, where N0 is the size of an initial population of radioactive atoms at time t = 0. This shows that the population decays exponentially at a rate that depends on the decay constant. The time required for half of the original population of radioactive atoms to decay is called the half-life. The relationship between the half-life, T1/2, and the decay constant is given by T1/2 = 0.693/λ.","timestamp_created":1629489748,"timestamp_updated":1629489748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97936679","author":{"steamid":"76561199125676295","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":16,"last_played":1660582842},"language":"spanish","review":"Me enseñó que nunca tengo que llegar tarde al trabajo","timestamp_created":1629487863,"timestamp_updated":1629724811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97932486","author":{"steamid":"76561198435108484","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1606,"last_played":1656174353},"language":"english","review":"Old is Gold :)","timestamp_created":1629481946,"timestamp_updated":1629481946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97931224","author":{"steamid":"76561199122655655","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":753,"last_played":1629480114},"language":"russian","review":"Обязательно сыграйте в эту легендарную игру несмотря на старую графику!","timestamp_created":1629480213,"timestamp_updated":1629480213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97929756","author":{"steamid":"76561198192755490","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2433,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":280,"last_played":1645659895},"language":"spanish","review":"Un clasico donde los haya, un juegazo que aunque ya no luce graficamente como antes, es un portento.Compralo, no se porque lo estas pensando cuando podrias estar jugando además es barato","timestamp_created":1629478299,"timestamp_updated":1629478299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97925360","author":{"steamid":"76561198359410900","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":22,"playtime_at_review":262,"last_played":1660571324},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1629472846,"timestamp_updated":1629472846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97921891","author":{"steamid":"76561199154152242","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":107,"last_played":1650482114},"language":"turkish","review":"yarım hayat 1","timestamp_created":1629468667,"timestamp_updated":1629468786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545825779438018799","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97919189","author":{"steamid":"76561198984016193","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":828,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":817,"last_played":1644142373},"language":"english","review":"Old but gold.

About to be 23 in a few months. Here's my story.\n\nWhen I was 14, I got struck down with depression. This led to me missing a lot of school in highschool and ultimately finishing 9th grade with a single credit.\n\nI spent the rest of my teens trying to play catch up, finally receiving my high school diploma by age 19.\n\nBut when things seemed to be going well at 19, I was attacked and nearly raped. By the same relative who molested me my entire childhood. I became suicidal and was diagnosed with PTSD a year later.\n\nAt age 20, my mom died from cancer. She was a single parent and raised me all on her own since my deadbeat father left when I was 1.\n\nI was now suffering from daily flashbacks due to my disorder.\nGrieving the loss of the only parent I ever had.\nAnd sobbing regularly thanks to the horrific things my father said to me while my mom lay dying in her hospital bed.\n\nAt 21, I dropped out of university.\nI spent the rest of that year taking odd jobs at factories to pay my bills.\n\nWhen I turned 22, I thought for sure it was my time to shine and begin living my life...\n\nAnd then COVID happened.\n\nI turn 23 on Dec 11.\n\nI know I didn't waste my early 20s since I was suffering from so much traumatic ♥♥♥♥ in the span of a few years that others experience over a lifetime, some never at all.\n\nBut as I begin my 23rd year. I feel lost.\nMy PTSD has been in remission for over a year. And I've healed from the loss of my mother... but I'm struggling to shake the feeling that I lost so much time, and will always play catch up with others in the same life arena.\n\nI don't really know why I wrote all this down, but I guess if there's any other lonely soul out there who happens to see my comment, I just want you to know that you got this.\n\nWe didn't choose our life circumstances.\nWe didn't ask for our lives to go off plan.\n\nBut we are alive\nWe're healthy\nWe've been blessed with another day\n\nIf you're the same age as me, our lives are only just beginning.\nIf you're older, you too can realize your dreams, escape the rigid safety found in your daily routine, and live the life you thought could never be possible.\n\nIf you still got a pulse, God still has a purpose.\n\nIf you're still hurting, talk to someone about it.\n\nIf you feel bored, get lost in a good book.\n\nIf you feel lost or confused, reconnect with that inner child and find time to spend doing the things you loved so much as a little one.\n\nI hope to revisit this review in a few years, perhaps before my 20s are up so I can update how my life has gone since then. Til then...\n\nTake care internet stranger.
