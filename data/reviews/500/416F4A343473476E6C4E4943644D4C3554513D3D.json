Not really bad in an objective sense, but bad by the insanely high standards and 5 second attention span-standards of this generation. Which means I get kicked a lot.\n\nLeft 4 Dead let's you kill a lot of zombies, and zombies are like the Nazi's..........&*^% that metaphor's been overused and is now firmly in the cliche territory. You must have been living in a cave if you haven't heard that metaphor before. &*^%.\n\nLeft 4 Dead is awesome and let's you kill huge hordes of zombies while working co-operatively with a group of fellow humans who get to use big guns in awesome film noir style and stick together until one big crescendo like finale, actually providing film like moments.\n\nFamously, Left 4 Dead uses software called \" the director\" which responds to your health and playstyle and how you are hammering the buttons frantically/ coolly knocking them dead to give you and your friends a kind of stress level. And the game will deliberately kind of mould an interest curve for you hitting you with millions of baddies when the your doing well and only hitting you with thousands of zombies when you are doing poorly.\n\nWhats interesting to me is like 10 years after release how few games have copied this idea, because it's absolutely brilliant. Well done, personalising the game like this has to be the way forward for the medium and it's nuts that more games don't try and give you second-by-second undulating difficulty like this.\n\nThis idea of a game that responds to the consumers (unconscious) preferences would probably piss Orwell off but in terms of a life where everyones different, where no ones happy for long and whereby people need constant variety I can't understand why more single player games haven't stolen this and created worlds that mould themselves to the players whim. But I digress.","timestamp_created":1454346334,"timestamp_updated":1454346334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20893565","author":{"steamid":"76561198271226243","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":77,"last_played":1501896777},"language":"spanish","review":"NO ABRE, ARREGLENLO :(","timestamp_created":1454335440,"timestamp_updated":1456890501,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.440251588821411133","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20892647","author":{"steamid":"76561198277359777","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2167,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1544571289},"language":"dutch","review":"Een supper game","timestamp_created":1454331241,"timestamp_updated":1454331241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20886916","author":{"steamid":"76561198262843657","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":596,"last_played":1652069814},"language":"english","review":"Left 4 Dead is the classic cooperative horror shooter from Value software. The game holds up remarkably well despite its age, and the maps are well tried and tested classics: well-balanced, replayable, and atmospheric. The game is darker (literally) and more serious than the sequel, and the campaign is clever enough to allow for some truly emergent gameplay. I would personally have preferred more of a story to link the 4 base campaigns, rather than the disconnected episodes we have here, but that's a petty gripe really. I've played dozens of hours on this on Xbox and, while 4 campaigns would be short for any other game, the fact that they are so replayable is a testament to their design. Versus mode is fun (playing as infected in actually my preferred option) but the few flaws in the game are evident in this mode. Survivors have the definite advantage and are able to camp quite effectively, particularly in the finale of the Blood Harvest campaign. The characters' minimal dialogue is well written and their voice actors (including Jen Taylor) do their jobs very well. A classic with superb replay value and a strong community online.","timestamp_created":1454298904,"timestamp_updated":1454298904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20882273","author":{"steamid":"76561198130869575","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":773,"last_played":1467953457},"language":"english","review":"Too much zombies.\n\n---IGN","timestamp_created":1454277179,"timestamp_updated":1454277179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20880815","author":{"steamid":"76561198280324023","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1459720649},"language":"polish","review":"Jedynka tak samo dobra jak dwójka.","timestamp_created":1454272397,"timestamp_updated":1454272397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20865696","author":{"steamid":"76561198123802113","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":260,"last_played":1466771303},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая кооперативная игруха!Тянет, даже на слабых компах!Збс!","timestamp_created":1454222777,"timestamp_updated":1454222777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531459152698516846","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20865067","author":{"steamid":"76561198009422264","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":588,"last_played":1519443404},"language":"english","review":"Classic! 10/10","timestamp_created":1454219610,"timestamp_updated":1454219610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479704797267913818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20863043","author":{"steamid":"76561197967272030","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":9491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6028,"last_played":1633580858},"language":"english","review":"Both L4D 1 and L4D 2 are great games and I would recommend these games to anyone that is not afraid of killing zombies lol","timestamp_created":1454210127,"timestamp_updated":1454210127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20858982","author":{"steamid":"76561198059783270","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":2993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1880,"last_played":1635881974},"language":"portuguese","review":"Tem muito o que falar não.

Мультиплеерное. Лучшая ко-оперативная игра года, а возможно и поколения. \"Turtle Rock\" сотворили настоящее чудо. \nПлюсы:\n1. Минимум оружия (и этого вполне достаточно для выживания).\n2. Хорошие персонажи. Причём у каждого из персонажей своя история и свои взгляды на жизнь.\n3. Никакой халтуры в плане Зараженных - боссов.\n4. Атмосферность, чувствуется что действительно настал апокалипсис.\n5. Хорошая реиграбельность, прохождение каждой карты каждый раз разное, а всё благодаря Режиссёру.\n6. Звуковое сопровождение, которое не надоедает, как в других играх, а наоборот помогает вам, ибо элементарно по звуковому сопровождению можно вычислить какой босс заспавнился еще до того, как этого босса услышишь/увидишь (ибо у каждого босса свой уникальный эмбиент, который нельзя спутать), а еще помогает определить на какого из игроков нападать будут во время волны и т.д., вроде как у того, кто должен огрести леща, должна играть более динамичная музыка, а у тех, кто под раздачу не попадает - более спокойная).\n\nМинусы:\n1. Малая посещаемость по сравнению со второй Лефтой, из - за чего как правило в мультиплеере меньше десятка лобби люди создают в кампании, несколько (2 - 3) - в Сражении, а в Выживание вообще редко кто заходит. \n2. Ну и пожалуй немного жаль что мало режимов (только сингл, кооп, сражение и выживание).

В игре присутствуют четыре персонажа: \"Билл\" - старый ветеран вьетнамской войны, \"Френсис\" - сильный и волевой байкер, покрытый татуировками, \"Зой\" - привлекательная девушка, выходец из богатой семьи, \"Луис\" - младший системный аналитик отдела информационных технологий. А так же есть несколько видов заражённых: \"Ведьма\" - она сидит на месте и плачет, и её лучше не трогать, \"Танк\" - самый большой и сильный зомби в игре, \"Толстяк\" - толстый зомби плюющиеся слизью, которая привлекает зомби, \"Охотник\" - прыгающий зомби, разрывающий выжившего на кусочки, \"Курильщик\" - притягивает своим языком и душит выжившего. В мультиплеере можно играть и за заражённого и за выжившего что очень оригинально. Игра класс, особенно если играть в неё с друзьями, потому что с друзьями так и так веселей. В игре есть несколько режимов такие как Кооператив, Одиночная игра, Сражение, Выживание. Кооператив смысл этого режима командная игра из четырёх игроков одну из кампаний или всей игры, в команде может быть от одного до четырёх человек, недостающие игроки замещаются ботами, с возможностью присоединения игрока-человека в процессе игры. Одиночная игра подразумевает собой игру только одного игрока и всех остальных ботов, боты следуют за игроком-человеком, стреляют по Заражённым, лечат, спасают, и помогают другим выжившим, но не могут открывать двери убежищ. Сражение в этом режиме четыре игрока берут на себя роль Выживших, а другие четыре роли \"Особых Заражённых\". Режим Выживания повторяет отдельные эпизоды из режима кооператива, когда выжившим, чтобы продвинуться дальше, приходится отбивать нападение орды заражённых большой группы из нескольких десятков зомби, включающей в себя одного или несколько \"Особых Заражённых\".","timestamp_created":1452540195,"timestamp_updated":1501273904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518539309501647949","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20474187","author":{"steamid":"76561197992669774","num_games_owned":934,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":1482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1474,"last_played":1573486136},"language":"english","review":"The best zombie game of its time, it's as simple as that.","timestamp_created":1452539995,"timestamp_updated":1452539995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20472609","author":{"steamid":"76561198092914367","num_games_owned":337,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":434,"last_played":1407985702},"language":"english","review":"I don't know what's happening.
