The story is iconic and leads into the critically acclaimed Half Life 2 that we are still waiting for the sequel of today. Weapons are all unique and fun to use in their own way and the map design is well crafted with an interesting and clever push on having you explore for secrets to gain that little bit of extra ammo.

Раньше бы такого вывода я не сделал, но что случилось сейчас - понятия не имею. Всё дело в том, что первая ОРИГИНАЛЬНАЯ Half-Life просто напичкана багами, которые руинят целое прохождение игры. Я очень люблю первую часть серии, как впрочем и остальные, и частенько сажусь перепроходить, начиная с первой разумеется. Недавно я вновь сел за прохождение и решил устроить для себя некий челендж - всего навсего пройти игру на последнем уровне сложности, чего раньше я не делал. В сравнении с самыми первыми прохождениями, персонаж перестал застревать в туннелях, где есть два выхода наверх, где бегает много солдат HECU и стоит танк (после их уничтожения открываются ворота, за которыми стоит бронетехника, стреляющая ракетами). Но появилось два бага, которых просто нет в Source версии первой части: На уровне с телепортами, где нужно активировать два вентиля и поднять воду - если крутануть два вентиля одновременно, вода поднимается до половины и вентили багаются, из за чего поднять воду выше становится невозможным. А этот баг часто можно встретить, если по привычке делать всё быстро. И второй баг, из за чего я и ставлю отрицательный отзыв - при битве с Гонарчем, когда паук убегает во второй раз и прыгает в пещеру, паук должен спрыгнуть на сетку в замкнутое пространство, где его и нужно убить, чтобы уйти с этой арены. У меня Гонарч остался наверху и никакие перезагрузки сохранений не помогли. Спустить я его так и не смог из за чего челендж остался не выполненым. Рекомендую Source версию этой игры, ибо там таких критических багов не замечено и игра отлично проходится.","timestamp_created":1598868467,"timestamp_updated":1598868525,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47755083441734314","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75212769","author":{"steamid":"76561199039264069","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":146,"playtime_forever":1220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1184,"last_played":1617660820},"language":"turkish","review":"bu oyunu 19 saat'İçinde bitirdim ve görüşlerim,İse oyun konusunda şöyle oyun iyi bir nostalji oyunu tavsiye ederim şuan 1. oyununu bitirdim opposing force ye geçecem opposing force hakkındada yorumlarım altta olacaktır ama eger almak istiyorsanız alın tavsiye ederim","timestamp_created":1598867982,"timestamp_updated":1598867982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75209061","author":{"steamid":"76561199029282158","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1307,"last_played":1599693184},"language":"spanish","review":"es un muy buen juego que marcó un antes y un después, no lo termine aun, pero es una gran historia, lastima que no me va a dar el PC para el HL3 :(","timestamp_created":1598860826,"timestamp_updated":1598860826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75207040","author":{"steamid":"76561198806260054","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":327,"last_played":1657884894},"language":"turkish","review":"oyun zaten oyunların efsanesi bunu oynamadım diyen bne oyuncuyum demesin\n","timestamp_created":1598856602,"timestamp_updated":1598856602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75204340","author":{"steamid":"76561198998082956","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":6475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":55,"playtime_at_review":540,"last_played":1659385482},"language":"english","review":"it's half life (1)  good combat, cool puzzles, and fun levels 100% recommend playing","timestamp_created":1598850969,"timestamp_updated":1658727444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75199899","author":{"steamid":"76561198126116670","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1599240003},"language":"english","review":"its fun","timestamp_created":1598842419,"timestamp_updated":1598842419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75194764","author":{"steamid":"76561198313353250","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":808,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":805,"last_played":1600887542},"language":"spanish","review":"El Half Life es un clásico que nunca falla.\nBuena historia y buena jugabilidad, sabe mantener la tensión y a pesar de ser un juego que ya quedó viejito los gráficos son bastante buenos.\nPuntos extra por lo poco que pesa, no tiene grandes requerimientos haciendo que sea un juego jugable en casi cualquier computadora","timestamp_created":1598832923,"timestamp_updated":1598832923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75191964","author":{"steamid":"76561198321481374","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2117,"last_played":1644307031},"language":"english","review":"I LAZOERD AN ALIEN AND MY WANOR GOT HARD AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","timestamp_created":1598827818,"timestamp_updated":1598827818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwY3koPQCfOnqngI="}
