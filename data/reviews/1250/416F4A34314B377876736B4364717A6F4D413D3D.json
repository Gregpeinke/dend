Another good alternative to other zombie shooters or to someone who loves those kinds of games. My evaluation is no different than the other reviews posted here. However, the real reason why I would say it is a waste of money is that there will always be issues to host a game. \n\nThe thing is, I tried to set up a multiplayer match in killing floor mode. I tried this out with my friend from Steam. We both were thinking what to try and finally decided on this game in hopes to play it co-operatively. \n\nThe first impression I got was mixed already. The design is great and suitable to play on those nights or on Halloween. When I tried to host the match, I would get 2 messages of caution. They were about enabling the ports or plug and play function, or allowing the game as an exception for the firewall. Everything looked fine until I set up the multiplayer match. \n\nMy friend and I live far apart, so our method of co-op play would be something like Internet play, not LAN. I do not know if there would be issues if we were playing at a closer distance using LAN, but the real problem is Internet play when trying to play with your friend.\n\nMy friend could not see my hosted game, even when he tried to join my game via Steam Friend list. Even invitations would not work. The firewall has got an exception on this game, so the issue is not with it. Other methods like tampering with functions inside killing floor.ini file, would make it even worse, leaving a message like this \"You must have a connection or Steam enabled to play this game\" (or something like this, since I've written this from my memory).\n\nMy suggestion is not to buy this game. Instead of wasting time and trying to figure out the intrinsic issues, it is better to find a game, that actually proves to be compatible with Steam Friend list, a game like Left 4 Dead where you can easilly join your friend in a co-op match. Old issues about ports have been solved in such games.","timestamp_created":1415448848,"timestamp_updated":1415448848,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48096078634262085","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12842791","author":{"steamid":"76561198086150921","num_games_owned":359,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1443466666},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor has put itself up there with the major competitors on my list of favourite Zombie games which is saying something since my taste is that of a man who loves gore and blowing off zombies heads! Killing Floor has truly made me hungry for more though, with it's hilariously made rounds and maps off the workshop which are mostly made amazingly with a couple of bugs but it can be said that they are incredibly fun to play, it's massive selection of weapons and skins make it a game worth buying! It also takes very little to run in it I find which is down to how old it is but still to this day this could be one of the best Zombie games I have ever played. However this game may not make the top spot on my list for now it will be at third place! Anyone who cannot run massive Zombie games should buy this!

Floor is a  wave defense, undead monster shoot-em up. Altough the game can be enjoyable at times (best with a multitude of friends or strangers; solo play is absolutely terrible), this game unfortunately falls into the category of \"hard.\" Here, the game feels artificially \"hard\", with combating most baddies not really based on any kind of skill. Notable enemeies include the chainsaw weilding \"Scrake\", the hulk-like \"Fleshpound\", and the enemy boss \"Patriarch\" at the end of the mission. These enemies just feel cheap, with the boss also falling into the category of \"bullet sponge.\" In general, these enemies fuck your shit up simply because there's no way of getting away from them (no cover, no sprint, no dodge; just your granny shuffle, a gun, and hopefully a fireteam backing you up). All of these enemies rush their intended target, so unless you can hop a fence to stay away from them, they are guaranteed to be in your face and will kill you unless you can beat them in the damage output race that will ensue (spoiler alert: you lose in most cases).\n\nAnother bone to pick is with enemy spawning. Either I'm just very unlucky, or the game prefers spawning enemies behind you. You can run through a previously cleared room, and upon reaching the other side, turn around to see a shitload of enemies right on your ass ready to gnaw it off. You can even get enemies to spawn on your ass by just turning around while near a door to a room.

Внимание! Внимание! Группа зачистки приступает к действию.\nKilling Floor - шутер от первого лица, целью которого является сурвайвл, то бишь убить всех зомби и выжить самому (или с командой, смотря какие цели вы преследуете). \n\nИгру можно приобрести в стиме, если вы хотите официально играть в мультиплеер с друзьями, безо всяких проблем настроить и запустить собственный сервер да и вообще, раз в жизни купить игру, оно того стоит. Нет никаких проблем с игрой, захотел - зашел, захотел - вышел, никаких обязательств играть или сидеть до конца нет и это плюс. В игре множество разнообразного оружия и видов персонажа, но все это за дополнительные денежки - это минус (хотя никто вас не заставляет покупать эти дополнения). Сам геймплей интересен, в игре нет прицела как такового, только настоящий целик-мушка, либо коллиматорный прицел. Накопить на оружие достаточно сложно, нужно хорошо отстреливать зомби и меньше умирать, так же можно попросить денег у товарищей. Интересно играть с друзьями, но проблемно если игра куплена не в системе стим, даже не знаю как можно аналогово играть в мультиплеер, кроме как купив оригинал игры.\nВ общем идея - супер, реализация -
