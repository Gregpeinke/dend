По сути, HL: Source есть ничто иное как порт первой халвы на движок второй, с сохранением старых моделей и текстур, но добавлением регдола, возможности таскать предметы по нажатию на E, что облегчает решения некоторых загадок, и реалистичным рендером воды, сто на фоне низкополигонального окружающего мира смотрится не очень уместно. Начнем, пожалуй, с минусов:\n\n1. БАГИ! КУЧА БАГОВ! Начиная с летающего ученого в комнате управления антимасс-спектрометром и заканчивая барнаклами с короткими языками, из-за чего замечаешь их слишком поздно, а вот они тебя хватают всегда вовремя.\n2. Болванистый ИИ - из-за деффектов в ИИ многие враги ведут себя крайне тупо, превращая серьезные (в оригинальной первой части) моменты в цирк.\n3. Скука - вообще, первый вопрос который возникает у многих пользователей - а зачем этот порт вообще нужен? Ведь помимо некоторых изменений, которые я описал в начале, больше ничего не поменялось, никаких новых уровней, ни изменения дизайна старых.\n4. Старые текстуры и модели - по идее, можно было бы вообще сделать полноценный ремейке первой игры на новом движке, но Valve думали иначе, и просто сделали прямой порт, не изменив в моделях ничего (хотя охранники вроде еще стремнее стали).\n\nНу а теперь о плюсах (да-да, они есть!):\n1. Эта игра совместима с G-Mod - а это значит, что если он у вас есть. то вам будут доступны все враги, неписи и декорации из Source-версии халвы (есть, конечно, вариант загрузить в воркшопе Half-life: Rennisaunce, но это уже дело вкуса).\n2. Эту игру МОЖНО пройти в G-Mod - Просто открываете меню создания игры, выбираете карты HL: Source и запускаете первую главу первый уровень (предварительно указав в параметрах игры смертность игрока. отсутствие оружия и костюма HEV, а так же реалистичный урон от падения). Причем в G-Mod попросту нет багов ни с ИИ, ни с текстурами, ни с барнаклами, ни с чем либо еще (однако загрузки при переходе из локации в локацию стали гораааздо дольше).\n3. В самой игре можно выбирать главу без пресловутой консоли разработчика, что, определенно, весьма удобно.\n4. Освещение в техническом плане стало гораздо лучше. ощущения \"фальшивости\" или \"картинности\" оно, в отличии от воды, не вызывает.\n\nИ так. вывод:\n1. Если у вас уже есть первая HL, а покупать G-Mod  вы не намерены, то смело пропускайте этот продукт мимо себя.\n2. Если у вас уже есть первая HL, и вы хотели бы купить G-Mod, то покупать HL: Source стоит ради пополнения библиотеки G-Mod оригинальными моделями неписей, объектов, оружия и т.д. (А так же ради возможности пройти HL в режиме песочницы).\n","timestamp_created":1626028587,"timestamp_updated":1632941016,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95553892","author":{"steamid":"76561199087939821","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125,"last_played":1626225230},"language":"english","review":"good for Gmod, ok for just playing the game.

Ну ладно,начнём по порядку. Графика: из изменений это освещение,тени,эффекты, частицы, скайбоксы , трупы стали физическими объектами и вода стала прозрачной. По сравнению с первой части конечно стало лучше,но текстуры,персонажи,модели и окружение осталось таким же,разве что геометрию немного улучшили Геймплей: он остался таким же,но пару вещей изменили. 1: У некоторых пушек увеличили отдачу,если у глока еще более-менее нормальная отдача,то с MP5 стало практически невозможно стрелять,пушку колбасит вверх-вниз,из-за чего кажется что ты играешь за алкаша который держит пушку в одной руке.2: Игра потеряла одну из главных фишек оригинала, а именно жестокость. В оригинале можно было разорвать противников в клочья да и крови было предостаточно. А что в Source: противников можно разорвать на куски,но это можно сделать пока они живы,трупы разорвать увы не получится. А вот крови стало меньше,хоть и стала лучше по качеству. Но самая главная проблема этой игры-баги. Их тут дохрена: Тентакли не могут нанести урон,вертолет который невозможно сбить,все ракеты пролетают сквозь него,физика порой странно ведёт,иногда объекты переворачиваются очень медленно,освещение тоже сломано,как будто все поверхности хромированные,особенно это заметно на пушках. А вот в моменте где надо пройти по конвейерной ленте,я сильно испугался. Я сначала думал что у меня произошёл отвал видюхи,а это был просто баг. А Valve видимо не собирается исправлять их,а зачем,всё равно схавают Итог: Half Life:Souce-это яркий пример того,что разработчикам абсолютно похуй на качество своего продукта и на игроков,и главное для них это срубить побольше денег .
