Il micromondo di Bioshock Infinite è una realtà a se stante, che a differenza di altri giochi che ripropongono scenari reali ma storie  bizzare a base di mostri, terroristi, zombie e alieni, propone invece un modesto sparatutto che affronta senza peli sulla lingua tematiche sociali adulte e ancora controverse. Il motore grafico del gioco non è dei più pesanti e ho potuto con l' ausilio di una nvidia 760 e di un Intel i5 giocare a 1080p con i dettagli al massimo sempre a 60 frame al secondo. Le sparatorie sono sempre godibili e le sezioni più belle e impegnative vi vedranno sospesi attraverso dei cavi d'acciaio che percorrono la città in lungo e in largo. Ad aiutarvi ci sarà Elizabeth la coprotagonista dell' avventura che durante gli scontri vi rifornirà del necessario per combattere. L'unica piccolissima nota stonata del gioco è rappresentata dai Vigor, i cosidetti Plasmidi dei primi 2 capitoli di Bioshock, i quali sembrano essere messi durante il gioco un po a casaccio e tranne un paio di occassioni non ci sarà alcun vantaggio ad usarne uno o l'altro pur essendo disponibili in numero cospicuo. Personalmente ho comprato questo gioco con i saldi di Steam e non ho ancora preso i vari DLC, consiglio di giocarlo e di finirlo, la narrazione del gioco è davvero ben fatta, ma ovviamente proprio per questo risulta poco rigiocabile. Assente una sezione dedicata al multiplayer.","timestamp_created":1386349645,"timestamp_updated":1386349645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7940463","author":{"steamid":"76561198060213147","num_games_owned":723,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":590,"last_played":1386413860},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1386348213,"timestamp_updated":1386348213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7940383","author":{"steamid":"76561198094461547","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2529,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":750,"last_played":1572687792},"language":"russian","review":"То, во что следует поиграть каждому.  \n","timestamp_created":1386347729,"timestamp_updated":1386347729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7940076","author":{"steamid":"76561198000690624","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1484317180},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game, Second best of the year after The Last of Us","timestamp_created":1386346334,"timestamp_updated":1386346334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7939988","author":{"steamid":"76561197967963487","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":118,"last_played":1402182930},"language":"english","review":"10 minutes NO SHOOT BULLET?!?!?!

This game was so great that I am legitimately concerned that I will not be capable of enjoying any other game even close to the amount that I loved this game. The AI actually has real intelligence. Elizabeth displays real emotions, and they're completely believable. She has face expressions, and they're spot on. The combat is very well balanced throughout. I never died through combat (only by falling off Columbia a few times). If you fall off Columbia, the game developers aren't terrible people. They don't cut your health in half, or remove some ammo. They simply respawn you instantly. It's wonderful! The storyline is incredible. The ending is genuinely awesome, in the truest definition of that word. It honestly inspires awe. This game is so very well done, and I'm so glad that I got it. I was very distraught by the ending, it nearly broke me mentally. It's so beautiful, all the way through. This game is emotionally involving, and you become attached! This game will quickly grow on you! I love it! Everything in this game was thought out and done for a reason. There's no \"well this happened to work out\" that you can tell. Everything is done quite intentionally, from the background, to the weapons, to the scarcity of resources (when there is scarcity). There are minor side missions (definitely worth doing!), hidden shops and areas, and there are no time limits. You can fight a battle, and then take as much time as you want exploring, without Elizabeth going bonkers on you (\"Hey! Listen!\" isn't a thing here). I have but one regret: I started playing this game just before finals. There goes all my studying. It kept me up late at night, took up my free time, and I don't regret a moment, honestly. I just wish I had started it after finals.\n\nTo Irrational Games - You guys are brilliant. You have stunned me. You have wowed me. You have amazed me. You have tormented me. You have loved me, hated me and cared for me. You guys are wonderful, and I love you all.\n\nTo Ken Levine - People don't get this smart. You're cheating reality. Keep doing that.\n\nTo gamers - Buy this game (don't torrent this one). Play it. Allow yourself to become truly involved in this game, and it will take you on an incredible journey.\n\nThis game took me on a journey like no other. I have never had this kind of reaction from any game at all. I've been excited, saddened, and \"meh\", but this is beyond explanation. It is a complete and total experience, for lack of a better term. It was incredible, as beautiful as the rest of the game, astounding, and (withheld for potential spoiler prevention).

By the middle of the game i really cared about the safety of Elizabeth and the downfall of Comstock. The gameplay was fantastic because of things such as the heavy hitter enemies (OHDEARGODAHANDYMANRUN), the weapon and recource catching system, plasmids' ability to ocasionally interact with the enviroment and damage baddies, the many varieties of tears that elizabeth can create, and the use of lockpicks to discover secret areas, each contaning a recording, which acted as the puzzle pieces of columbia's history. BioShock infinite had the ability to make you feel invinsible and hopeless the next just by throwing either new enemies at you or giving you a new person or thing to both fear and hate, such as Daisy Fitzroy or Elizabeth's bitchy side. The art stile of this game was beautiful in every way imaginable and made you feel like you were really back in 1912. Or whenever the game takes place. Whatevz. What I really loved was the addition of things that were social issues at the time, such as rascism and smoking, and how they put a little BioShock twist  on them.

It's a beautifull game. Now let me tell you why I didnt like it as much as previous episode. (so far) Bioshock franchise is about immersive experience, customisation, Magic & Guns, difficult choices, strong characters,  and exploration. I did not find the last three.\n\nYou will have no choice to make. Straight up line. up to the ending. I find quite ironic to have only one ending, considering the context (those who finished it will understand that).\n\nYou will know and will discover little about the main character (for future DLC ?). Protagonist are not develop more than a couple of sentence at begining of chapter up to it's conclusion. Tapes hidden around the levels are barely few words giving little of the context / goal of the characters. Only Elizabeth saves it by being a really valuable addition.\n\nThe higher pace and level design of this episode leave almost no room for exploration. No way you get lost. You just walk the (nice) corridors up to the next (beautifull) gun fight area. I think it's ok for a COD to be like this, but for a Bioshock it's not. So many question are let unanswered. Why the hell this city is here ? how does it fly, Why comstock is doing this ? I'm not even talking about the ending that will leave you with thousand more questions. \n\nDefinitly a great game you want to play, but not the greatest Bioshock. 16/20","timestamp_created":1386288519,"timestamp_updated":1386288519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7931966","author":{"steamid":"76561198094825416","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1168,"last_played":1401131348},"language":"english","review":"Good graphics and awesome storyline.

Man merkt von der ersten Minute an, dass es für Konsolen geschrieben wurde und das nervte mich insbesondere anfangs ganz gewaltig.\nDas Spiel reagiert gerne mal nicht auf den Befehl sich an eine Sky-Line zu hängen (Ein Transportsystem im Spiel und gelegentlich wichtiger Bestandteil in Kämpfen) bzw. braucht gefühlte Ewigkeiten um den Pfeil an der Skyline endlich anzuzeigen. Das macht das Spielgefühl teilweise unflüssig. Auch das ist vermutlich der Konsolenentwicklung geschuldet, Konsolenspieler ticken meiner Erfahrung nach bei solchen Elementen nämlich anders als PC-Spieler die schnelles Spiel gewohnt sind.\n\nWas mich aber überzeugt hat:\nDie Story! Sie ist herausragend gut. Ich habe seit langem keine so gute Geschichte erlebt. Hinzu kommt, dass vieles mit merklicher Liebe zum Detail entstanden ist. Das singende Mädchen in Finkton ist nur eines dieser kleinen Details die mich beeindruckten.
