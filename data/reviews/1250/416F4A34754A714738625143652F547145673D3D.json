While the enemies lack any real color to them for the most part, they do represent themselves in varying degrees very well in other manors. For instance the scrake being what appears to be a roided up dentist with a chainsaw for an arm, a REALLY bad attitude and a creepy laugh that puts your Uncle Frank to shame. Killing Floor is simple, but bearing this in mind it is also extremely fun with friends, however still manages to keep some form of camaraderie that bands together total strangers in an effort to make it through the \" waves \" of mutants in order to reach the end boss, the Patriarch. Killing Floor uses a \" Perk \" system, ( basically classes for the rest of us ) which all specialize in performing various tasks in the group. Things like Medic are obvious however things like the Support Specialist require a bit more finesse in order to perform your job properly. While they are good at crowd control the Support class also has another ability that makes it a cut above in supporting your team. In Killing Floor you have the ability to weld certain \" doors \" in order to hold the infestation of mutants off for a little bit longer. The Support Specialist is able to do this more efficiently than anyone else. Thus making their role more interesting than most. Your squad gains money by killing off enemy mutants, or assisting each other either in combat by helping to take down a mutant, or by healing each other. This increases the overall feeling of companionship between you and your ragtag team of survivors as it incentivises making sure that you keep an eye on your allies' HP values so you can get some extra profit out of the wave for that nice gun you are saving up for. In between each wave you are allowed to go to a trader in order to purchase new forms of slaughter to dispatch your enemies with. These range from flamethrowers, chainsaws, machineguns, and katanas, to medic guns that shoot healing darts, or shotguns that fire nails. While the game isn't particularly hard in the first three difficulty levels, those being beginner, normal, and hard, the game offers a bit more of a challenge to those among us who enjoy a good ass kicking every once in a while. The difficulties Suicidal and Hell on Earth provide a vast challenge and most parties are doomed to fail if they aren't well organized. This is a refreshing change especially once you've gotten the hang on the game and have some higher level perks. Overall the game will give many hours of entertainment, especially with the ability to extend your search to User Generated Content ( UGC ) which opens up more weapons, maps, skins, and enemy types. Unfortunately this game suffers with a lot of quite honestly pointless DLC that may leave some of you scratching your head asking why? Well you aren't the only one, in fact some of the DLC is downright pointless. A few of them are nothing more than weapon skins or character skins which is fine if you are into that sort of thing. However, there's a few of them that are supposed to unlock new and interesting weapons for you to experiment with and unfortunately, there's only a couple of them worth buying from a statistical standpoint. However, all that aside with Killing Floor 2 around the corner and with how often this game goes on sale, if you're on the fence about picking it up, give it a go.\n\nPros:\n\n- Lots of replay value \n- Many classes to choose from opening up the spectrum for the type of playstyles it can cator to\n- UGC is HEAVILY supported and encouraged\n- Plenty of achievements for those of you who are into that sort of thing\n- Great game to play with friends\n- Mindless fun that doesn't require too much attention\n- Higher Difficulties are available for players looking for a kick in the ass\n- Easy to make your own custom setup for you and your friends to enjoy custom content together\n\nCons:\n\n- Quite a bit of \" pointless \" DLC that seems rushed and pushed just to make a quick buck\n- Other than the cliche' tooltips there is no REAL tutorial, so advanced tactics like how to handle certain mutants are left up to either yourself to figure out, or other players to explain to you. This sometimes results in miscommunication amongst groups, even if it ends in hilarity sometimes.\n- Hosting a server can be a chore, and sometimes downright impossible for some people due to how the game handles it.\n- \" Join Session In Progress \" feature with steam is hit or miss. Quite often it will fail or refuse to try to connect requiring you to manually type out the IP address to the server to connect.\n- Once you reach a certain point with your perks they sort of just grind to a halt because of the INSANE requirements for some of them.\n\n\nOverall I've enjoyed this game day in and day out. It has been the product of many laughs, much frustration, and a lot of love.","timestamp_created":1327384444,"timestamp_updated":1417701943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511035144329071045","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66100","author":{"steamid":"76561197961021747","num_games_owned":658,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":2769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2663,"last_played":1398991995},"language":"english","review":"the graphics show its date, was originally a mod for UT2K4 but is still a fun and frustrating game.
