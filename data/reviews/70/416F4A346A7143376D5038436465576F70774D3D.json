It was a great experience, plenty of good visual storytelling and next to no hand holding, which is a nice change of pace when comparing to today's video game titles. I can see why there are plenty of people hailing it as one of the greatest games ever. But if you go into this game fresh, having never played it before, with that level of expectation, I think you might be setting yourself up for disappointment. In my opinion it's a great game that held up well, especially for a 1998 game. A solid 12-16 hour experience worth every penny. \n\nThis game made me want to try finishing Half-Life 2 next, and excluding the 4 hours I put in at the time of this review, the only thing I know about it is that people REALLY want Half-Life 3 for some reason, so I'm looking forward to seeing why.","timestamp_created":1645937153,"timestamp_updated":1645937153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111128103","author":{"steamid":"76561198374835226","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":640,"last_played":1655257360},"language":"english","review":"After completing the game, I just have to say that it was absolutely fantastic.
