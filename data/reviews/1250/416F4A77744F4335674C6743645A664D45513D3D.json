This game is predominatly multiplayer as it can get quite lonley wandering the streets with a shotgun looking for infected. To make this game even better, there are 7 perks(Field Medic, Beserker, Firebug, Sharpshooter, Support Specialist, Commando and Demolition) which take a while to level up to Level 6 but it is totally worth it!

Armas de todo tipo y mejoras para tu personaje. En mi opinión uno de los mejores juegos de PESADILLA que hayan sacado con un toque distinto al L4D. Juega con tu equipo o muere. Ya que ni siendo un megapro podrás sobrevivir solo. \n\nCosas que te ofrece el juego:\n\n- Escenarios muy bien logrados: Granjas, ciudades, sotanos, etc. bien elaborados para que el desafio no decepcione en ningún aspecto.\n- Monstruos: Una gran variedad de abominaciones te espera. Sobrevive 10 oleadas y enfréntate al Jefe Final, si consigues derrotarlo ganas, si no, mueres.\n- Armas y herammientas: Rifles, ballestas, lanzallamas y una gran variedad de armas no te van a faltar para que mates con una sonrisa en la cara. Las herramientas como el soldador, te permitirán cerrar puertas durante un tiempo, lo cual es una enorme ventaja contra las hordas.\n- Perks: Médico, Asalto, Apoyo, etc. Mejoras para tu personaje como para el armamento que lleves según vayas acabando con esos hijos de perra.\n- Sistema Táctico: Antes de que comience la siguiente oleada, decide con tu grupo el mejor lugar en el que atacar y defender.\n- Respawn de armas, armaduras y otros: Esto ayuda mucho, sin duda alguna.\n- Música: El heavy se pone de moda en K.F. y vas a escucharlo mientras le revientas la cabeza a esos engendros.\n- Gráficos: Muy adecuados para el juego. Puedes jugar hasta con la tarjeta gráfica integrada y un procesador de gama baja. El juego en éste punto es fenomenal.\n- Sonido: Acojontante. Compruebalo tu mismo.\n\n\nLo que falta en el juego:\n\n- Algunos bugs sin corregir, pero que no se notan demasiado.\n- Matar en sigilo: No vas a poder.\n- Carisma de los personajes bajo: Tienen carisma, pero no es lo mismo que en L4D, por ejemplo.\n- Sistema de un solo jugador: Creo que no existe.\n- Igualdad de condiciones de juego en grupo: Olvidate. Ganas dinero matando. Si eres un Harcore Gamer, tus compañeros se quedarán con las migajas.\n\n\nY recuerda, si has de morir, hazlo a lo grande!","timestamp_created":1340201494,"timestamp_updated":1426941730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.423434346914291382","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6388395","author":{"steamid":"76561198065218297","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1292,"last_played":1407054404},"language":"english","review":"this game ROCKS! its scary as hell but super fun and never gets old. you can choose what you wanna do, heal your team? snipe with pistols and rifles? blow their faces off with a shotgun? or a little rapid fire from automatic weapons. they have it all i highly encourage you to play this game. :)","timestamp_created":1340177109,"timestamp_updated":1340177109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2291536","author":{"steamid":"76561198005265585","num_games_owned":1412,"num_reviews":122,"playtime_forever":2677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1741,"last_played":1516455556},"language":"japanese","review":"狙う面白さ、何も言わなくともみんなが協力する面白さ。安いし人も多いし動作環境も手軽だし、いいんだけどレベル上げがマゾ・・・・。ゴニョゴニョも熱心に対策していらっしゃる様子。まあ、まだ抜け道はあるんだけどね。","timestamp_created":1340166224,"timestamp_updated":1340166224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480443269014358521","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4748701","author":{"steamid":"76561198041417830","num_games_owned":681,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":498,"last_played":1335855600},"language":"english","review":"I dont. the community is a bunch of fucks that dont share money and kill steal.  yes i suck at the game but when you get kicked from a server for choosing the shotgun lv 1 you have a problem..","timestamp_created":1340095602,"timestamp_updated":1340095602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4612469","author":{"steamid":"76561198039795254","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":7875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7400,"last_played":1408984828},"language":"english","review":"Very good zombie shooter it require teamwork.
