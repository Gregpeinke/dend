You rely on alex 70% of the time you are playing and she takes ages to get stuff done when in emergency mode. AI is quite trash but some scenes looked pretty. Inside the citadel is very very boring and hard to navagate hallways that feels the same each and every time this makes it easy to get lost.\nThere are practically zero subtle clues to know what to do. I just discovered that you need to put cars on the antlions holes to make them stop spawning when you are trying to open a valve-ed door. What bothers me is that Gordan sucks at doing anything in this game. You get a OP weapon at the beginning, no crowbar just the gravity gun but it is supercharged. You get a gun very later on into the game and for the rest of the game you are talking to Alex and letting her do everything for you. She is the lead focus of the narrative in this game and you are not.\nGraphics are ok I guess they are not as good as Half-Life: 2 but same engine, same look. But now the flashlight is more utilised and not pointless because you will be using it 1/3 of the game whilst Alex nags at you for turning away your light. There are again, good looking scenes but they have very little screen time.\nThe thing I do like is the puzzles, the puzzles are mild at best but in my opinion the best times of the game.\n\nIn the description it says \"Half-Life 2 Not required.\" This is lying in fact you need to have half life 2 installed to even run episode 1 and 2. So if you are buying this without half life 2, tough you now need to buy that too.\nThe level design is pretty lazy not gonna lie. There are quite a few dynamic props/pickups/crates/etc but again the games level design does not give you clues on what to do making the game frustrating with many rooms in the game being to serve no purpose and rather to give you supplies. These supplies are not hidden and are easy to find just goes to show that they did a terrible job at balancing. If Gordan needs to use this many health kits to stay alive then I don't think that is very good balancing.\nI get why they had to make zombines but why? Why make them explosive resistant and bullet sponge-like? They literally take 4x more bullets/explosives to kill. Some of these are suicides because headcrabs can control the combines muscle-less hands to carry a grenade. This enemy is my biggest dislike of the game personally.\nJust such a shame what a \"Cash-grab\" valve had produced when you rely on alex to drive the story. The story revolves around her I guess because she wants to get back to her parents? Then what is the motive for Gordan? Nothing!","timestamp_created":1546428802,"timestamp_updated":1546428802,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48022450","author":{"steamid":"76561198201192295","num_games_owned":344,"num_reviews":132,"playtime_forever":157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1500148051},"language":"turkish","review":"[h1]Devam..[/h1]\n\n- Half life 2 nin devamı ne kadar kısa oyun süresine sahip olsada insan oynamadan edemiyor ^^.","timestamp_created":1546374481,"timestamp_updated":1546374481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48015755","author":{"steamid":"76561198291053059","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1625504653},"language":"german","review":"Wunderbare Fortsetzung.

Breen também) da Cidade 17, antes da destruição onde, além de ter DR. Breen, tinha Alyx e Gordon parados em frente a explosão, o Government Man (Mais conhecido como G-Man) para o tempo e pôe Gordon novamente em stasis, como se seu objetivo já estivesse completo, e que no futuro seria usado novamente para as \"ofertas\" dele.\n\nMas para a alegria de muitos e tristesa de poucos, Os Vortigaunts (que no Half-Life 1 eram seus inimigos, não por escolha, e sim por que eram escravos) conseguem tirar Alyx Vance da explosão, e a colocando em um lugar seguro fora da torre, onde Dog a encontra e ela tenta ter algum sinal para poder ter contato com seu pai e Dr. Kleiner, enquanto isso, Os Vortigaunts, novamente, vão resgatar outra pessoa, dessa vez sendo Gordon, interrompendo a fala do G-Man, e o impedindo de fazer algo com Gordon, e tirando-o do Stasis e o colocando no mesmo lugar onde Alyx esteve, onde Dog e Alyx estão procurando por ele, com Dog o achando.\n\nDepois de ter pêgo sinal e conversado com seu pai e DR. Kleiner, a missão de Alyx e Gordon é entrar novamente na torre (agora com boa parte destruida) para impedir que algo de pior aconteça, com Alyx confiando em Gordon pois sua HEV o faz com que passe por alguns obstáculos que ela sozinha não iria conseguir por altos niveis de radiação.\n Com o objetivo cumprido, a única coisa que eles precisam agora é..... Escapar da cidade, com a ajuda de vários rebeldes que encontram no caminho, e de Barney.\n\nUma bela continuação, eu diria, não tô tentando exagerar na hora que for falar bem pois sou bem biased pelo jogo, mas é isso.
