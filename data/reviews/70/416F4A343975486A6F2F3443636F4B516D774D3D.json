Up until the release of half life in 1998 by valve corp and published by seria studios, games were just spawn and shoot; not really any story. Half life added an entire story with a fun multiplayer that you could play for hours. The story has an amazing storyline and very fun puzzles. With new enemies to encounter at ever corner, to zombies taken over by head crabs turned into a human host, to hazardous environment soldiers and the black ops unit!

The gameplay is pretty good, though sometimes can be...don't play on hard mode basically.\nGraphics are fine, temper your expectations, it's literally from another century, but the way they are made, set up an atmospheric style that is really effective at some points.\n\n\nFor a cons section, the default fov is pretty garbage, I'd recommend bumping it up by like an extra 20 (\"default_fov 90\" is the command to change it). Also, at certain points I started getting...nauseous? If you start playing for extended periods and start getting a headache, GET OFF! At least for like an hour or two because that nauseous feeling is pretty bad, I've never had that happen with a game before. Lastly, there are some glitches, geometry being number one, but they're few and far between, just make sure to save often as the autosaves in this game are pretty hit or miss.\n\nAll in all, a worthy purchase if you're going in with the right mindset, I personally bought the Valve-whatever-the-fuck-bundle, and I'm getting a pretty good mileage out of it.","timestamp_created":1642082024,"timestamp_updated":1642082024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107921082","author":{"steamid":"76561198972138003","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1055,"last_played":1647790628},"language":"spanish","review":"Awesome fucking game, if you dont play it you are a pussy","timestamp_created":1642081942,"timestamp_updated":1642081942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107919751","author":{"steamid":"76561199014456449","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":596,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":596,"last_played":1635006682},"language":"russian","review":"я доволен)","timestamp_created":1642080410,"timestamp_updated":1642080410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107918660","author":{"steamid":"76561199033146477","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1642490929},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏很多人都说过了，我就不说了，这个游戏的多人模式值得一玩\n（为什么地图那么大？非得挤在一个核弹室里啊喂","timestamp_created":1642079039,"timestamp_updated":1642079039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107917901","author":{"steamid":"76561199106098939","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3847,"last_played":1642109270},"language":"brazilian","review":"o jogo é bao\n","timestamp_created":1642078024,"timestamp_updated":1642078024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107917468","author":{"steamid":"76561198884327899","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1642243212},"language":"swedish","review":"Best game ever!!","timestamp_created":1642077403,"timestamp_updated":1642077403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107907318","author":{"steamid":"76561198873492018","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":951,"last_played":1642060453},"language":"english","review":"What an amazing, yet frustrating experience!","timestamp_created":1642060819,"timestamp_updated":1642060819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107906294","author":{"steamid":"76561198090590064","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1367,"playtime_at_review":1479,"last_played":1660541657},"language":"spanish","review":"Best shooter of all time, never get tired of it, played it like a hundred times","timestamp_created":1642059127,"timestamp_updated":1642059127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107904933","author":{"steamid":"76561198085048178","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":798,"last_played":1652554959},"language":"english","review":"Don't buy the source version.

The platforming is awful and your character is on ice, the sound design is at first charming and quickly becomes jarring. Especially when you are in the metal tube with the tentacle monster. The encounter design is really good, and I had fun in some parts, but it cannot compensate all the little things that make this game so annoying.  The number of times I got stuck in a wall or an object cannot even be counted with my hands. Sometimes it's just snipers that I couldn't kill and others, it was the level design totally confusing me and the countless time I just didn't know where to F***ing go!\n\nI want to like this game, and I do like most of the fight encounters, but it's not enough, I hate it so much...

которой вы можете по инерции упасть даже там где вроде бы не должны.

Ya que en años anteriores al lanzamiento de Half-Life se estrenaban títulos que hoy son clásicos entre los FPS, juegos como Doom (1993) por ejemplo, este último siendo un pilar sumamente importante en el genero Shooter y su posterior masificación. Resumiendo muy escuetamente la jugabilidad del titulo anteriormente nombrado, esta misma era básicamente aparecer en un mapa en su totalidad cuadrado aunque con tramos laberínticos y limpiar el cuarto antes nombrado de demonios, según el poco contexto que se nos da todos los acontecimientos de Doom ocurren en Marte, más específicamente en la UAC, una conglomeración multi-planetaria.\n\nCon lo que respecta a la historia que se nos cuenta en el primer Half-Life, si bien esta no tiene la complejidad que la saga Metal Gear, tiene su propia manera de ser contada mediante científicos de las instalaciones de Black Mesa, que nos dicen por ejemplo, que los militares vendrán a salvarnos, para luego ya más avanzado el juego temerlas a estos últimos. Esto es un muy importante en la revolución con respecto a la historia y narrativa en los shooters que supuso Half-Life, ya que sin la necesidad de cinemáticas o interrupciones en el gameplay Valve pudo contar una historia completamente fluida todo desde el punto de vista de Gordon Freeman (protagonista del Juego), que por cierto, no habla en todo el juego, esto para que el jugador se sienta identificado con Gordon y que se sienta realmente en su historia.\n\nCon respecto a los enemigos, la IA de estos es para su época es muy buena, por ejemplo, los soldados de H.E.C.U se resguardan hasta detectar al jugador para posteriormente atacar, si están heridos correrán a cubrirse, lanzan granadas a cubierto y si el jugador le lanza una correrán lejos de la misma. Si bien estos comportamientos de los H.E.C.U pueden parecer básicos, son perfectamente verosímil, es decir, son bastante creíbles si así se quiere. En cambio la IA de los Xenianos sin contar a las Lapas no es muy destacable, los Vortigaunts y los Alien Controller simplemente se limitan a atacar sin cobertura y suelen ser sumamente fáciles de eliminar.\n\nPasando al diseño de los NPC, hablando desde la subjetividad, me parecen aceptables, no perfectos, pero aceptables valga la redundancia, los Xenionos sobre todo en lo personal tienen un muy buen diseño y se ven \"acorde\" a su entorno a pesar de ser cada especie de Xen no originaría de esta.\n\nPasando con los científicos de Black Mesa, estos únicamente tienen 4 diseños, lo que le puede jugar una mala pasada a la narrativa, el caso más claro es el del científico afrodescendiente que en el primer capitulo nos da la misión de ir al Lambda Core. Este mismo científico en Half-Life 2 se nos presenta como Eli Vance, se presenta como un viejo amigo de Gordon cuando trabajaba en Black Mesa, esto se conoce como \"retro-continuidad\"\nque se traduce como cambiar acontecimientos pasados de una obra para dar paso a nuevos acontecimientos u otras situaciones, en este caso se nos presenta a Eli como un viejo amigo cuando nosotros no teníamos ni idea que Gordon lo conocía.\n\nHalf-Life, si bien tiene muchos aspectos positivos este peca en poseer tiempos de carga, lo que no esta mal en su totalidad, lo malo en esto es que al ser Half-Life un juego tan verosímil con respecto a su narrativa, el parar al jugador para cargar un mapa puede sacarlo al mismo de la experiencia, esto sumado a que en algunas ocasiones, si esta sonando parte del Soundtrack del juego y se llega a un punto de carga, la pieza musical que esta sonando puede cortarse, lo que si bien no es muy grave, genera una desconexión tan artificial que, valga la redundancia, puede sacarnos de la experiencia.\n\nPuntuación: 9.5/10 | Extremadamente recomendable\n\nGracias por leer hasta el final, si tienes alguna sugerencia para esta reseña déjala en los comentarios.","timestamp_created":1641970104,"timestamp_updated":1659635077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605863213539123535","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107837480","author":{"steamid":"76561198449857767","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1642738998},"language":"spanish","review":"Que
