The shopkeeper's sexual references are as subtle as a sledgehammer to the baubles, look out for that - or don't; you'll get them regardless :D \n\nI also enjoy the fact that the levels are designed in a manner that teamwork is ESSENTIAL to survive to the final waves. \n\nThe purchasing mechanic can be quite clunky but with a team that can share funds, this feels more true to a deathmatch, where as L4D2 does not. L4D2 however, has a 'flow' to it that is uninterrupted by the 'waves of enemies' mechanic, which I am not quite fond of, but understand in terms of a first person multiplayer battle arena.\n","timestamp_created":1387843982,"timestamp_updated":1387843982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8237797","author":{"steamid":"76561198012799966","num_games_owned":585,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":17633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9708,"last_played":1483239178},"language":"english","review":"Freaking Fantastic with consistent update of new content!","timestamp_created":1387842575,"timestamp_updated":1387842575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8237536","author":{"steamid":"76561198014263134","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":656,"last_played":1387904605},"language":"english","review":"For those who like to kill zombies , this is one of the best games to do it !!","timestamp_created":1387841744,"timestamp_updated":1387841744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8236719","author":{"steamid":"76561198037340055","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1267,"last_played":1429392767},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game, really fun to play.","timestamp_created":1387839229,"timestamp_updated":1387839229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8236595","author":{"steamid":"76561198044427763","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":39067,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24196,"last_played":1609678521},"language":"russian","review":"норм игра","timestamp_created":1387838863,"timestamp_updated":1387838863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8234600","author":{"steamid":"76561198054499944","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4260,"last_played":1533628085},"language":"russian","review":"Мне это надо","timestamp_created":1387833204,"timestamp_updated":1387833204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8234583","author":{"steamid":"76561198013205326","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":7100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6937,"last_played":1640799931},"language":"english","review":"The support from Tripwire on this game is amazing, seriously worth getting into.

Team classes are all unique, and each one of your team members will matter a great deal especially if you are to beat the map on Suicidal or Hell on Earth. There's just something so satisfying about blowing the brains out of flaming zombies, or Specimen as they're called in this game. The graphics look like they should for a game released in 2009. The one annoying thing I found with the game is that only 32MB of memory is allocated to it by default, and so the game lagged constantly. I then had to scour the killingfloor.ini file to find that line of code so I could increase the amount of RAM allocated to the game. An overall great game.

Floor is an incredible co-operative survival shooter. You can play solo, or join up with up to 5 other players to face waves of specimen trying to kill you. The specimen are enemies with big variety. Some are weak but can be tough in groups. Some are tough and can kill your whole squad single-handedly if you're poorly prepared.\n\nAfter each wave the game will progressively become harder, and tougher specimen will spawn. Between each wave the trader will open up her shop and you will be able to purchase a variety of weapons. You all have a perk that gives you bonuses and makes you more effective with certain weapons and levels up as you play. For example Support specialist are good with shotguns, commandos with assault rifles, berserkers with melee weapons and so on. After all rounds are complete you will face the final boss, the patriarch, and your teamwork will be put to the test.\n\nThe game can get rather difficult. One big part about this game is the progression and the long learning curve. You won't be able to beat every map on the first try. You will learn about the enemies, the maps, the perks and the weapons as you play. And after mastering a difficulty you can move on to a higher difficulty and the rules will change. You will need new spots to defend at, new weapons to use and new tactics. This might be a drawback to some, but to somebody who likes long learning curves, it's perfect.\n\nThe graphics are very good but not the latest. The game is from 2009 but still has impressive graphics. It's well optimized and can run well on decent hardware. The maps varies in quality but some are very well made and makes for a very good atmosphere. The game has quite some gore. It is well made and can be enjoyed during the Zed time. Zed time is when the whole server goes slow motion for a few seconds. Watching a Fleshpund blow to pieces right before you just as he about to shred you to pieces in slow motion is nothing short of awesome.\n\nThe audio is also very good. The sound effects and the music are well made. The music changes from map to map and really adds to the atmosphere. It's fast-paced during the waves and makes shooting specimen a lot more fun.\n\nKilling Floor also has season events, three times a year. Every summer, halloween and winter all skins of the specimen change  during the event. New maps, weapons and achievements are also introduced. It keeps the game constantly fresh and always fun to come back to.\n\nKilling Floor is a really great game. It has improved a lot since it was released and still does wth constant updates. I highly recommend it.","timestamp_created":1387797057,"timestamp_updated":1388496728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612732112407684326","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8220225","author":{"steamid":"76561198024898551","num_games_owned":369,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":676,"last_played":1464273757},"language":"english","review":"fun to play with other people","timestamp_created":1387793167,"timestamp_updated":1387793167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8219467","author":{"steamid":"76561198029507565","num_games_owned":256,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":16637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9781,"last_played":1505327990},"language":"french","review":"Just awesome !","timestamp_created":1387789702,"timestamp_updated":1387789702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8219412","author":{"steamid":"76561198046755672","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5834,"last_played":1407519006},"language":"german","review":"Hammer geiles Spiel, wenn man im LAN oder im Multiplayer Spielen möchte .

If you die, you are punished and have everything taken away from you - if you die more than a few levels in, it's likely you won't get enough money to purchase anything useful and will thus spend the remaining rounds being killed over and over again and being punished by the game for the fact that the game itself just sucks.
