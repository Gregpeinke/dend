But more impressive are the visuals, even with today's graphics this game looks incredible. All the nature and mechanical workings make this even more atmospheric than the original.\n*Writing-- Yes, Portal had great writing, but Glados' voice was always pretty creepy. I was scared of her rather than laughing with her. In this game, that has changed, probably due to more voice actors. Wheatley and Cave Johnson are great voices, and made me laugh much more than Glados did in the original. Also, somehow Glados is less scary and more funny in this game. The fantastic writing and voice acting make this game really funny and clever \n*Content-- Longer Single player campaign with creative puzzles and plotpoints? Check. Multiplayer campaign with equally good puzzles? Check. A test chamber maker where you can make any type of puzzle you want? Check. The ability to share those levels online so you can play other peoples' levels alone or with friends? Check. And developer commentary, trailers, and more extras?

I spent nearly 29 hours on the game alone, without the Co-op, and even if, this game works a charm online.\nMuch of Valve's trademark personality went into this game, and you can tell, plus the developers got really creative with it.\nOne of the many great things about this game that it benefits from everything Portal's one and a half hour singleplayer mode, and expanded MUCH more on that, with nearly 15 hours in my playthrough.\nIt introduces so much, that even MANY years later, it still holds up Gameplay-wise and Graphical-wise.\nSeriously, like the graphics this game pulls off with the physics engine is AMAZING.\nEspecially with parts like the opening scene, that was a combination of good Physics, modeling, texturing, animation, and you name it.\nEven the personality cores, like Wheatley. They have a lot of charm and realism to their design, that you can't help but smile whenever Wheatley moves or something, it's funny as all hell.\nOh and don't get me started about the comedy, a lot of this game radiates Sass. It's honestly impressive.\n\nIn conclusion, why wouldn't you buy this game?\nIt's portal 2, it's absolutely worth every penny you get it for.\nIt's amazing in every single aspect, plus at least 5 hours of my playthrough were spent on the test chamber creation tool on its own.","timestamp_created":1587490215,"timestamp_updated":1587490215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67768761","author":{"steamid":"76561198973210262","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1234,"last_played":1590008669},"language":"english","review":"a vary fun game! i recomend this to other people! vary fun,messing around with portals,and creating test chambers or cheaking others test chambers and meny more.\n(nice job valve :)","timestamp_created":1587490018,"timestamp_updated":1587490018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67768582","author":{"steamid":"76561198852938789","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":429,"last_played":1655003240},"language":"english","review":"Really good game.
