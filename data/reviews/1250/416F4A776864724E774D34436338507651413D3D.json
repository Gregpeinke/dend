Allerdings fehlt Killing Floor der besonders spaßige Versus-Modus eines Left 4 Dead, und zum Schluss eines Abschnitts müssen die Spieler nicht auf Rettung harren, sondern schlicht ein Bossmonster umlegen.\n\nMan schmeißt Ihnen normale Mutierte (die sich teils unsichtbar nähern) in den Weg und eine Reihe Spezial-Monster, die zwar äußerlich denen aus Left 4 Dead ähnlich sind, allerdings längst nicht deren Gefährlichkeitsgrad erreichen. Heulende Hexenwesen pusten Sie mit einem Schuss um, ebenso springende, an Hunter erinnernde Zombies.\n\nLediglich Gift spuckende Fettklöpse und zwei größere Gegnervarianten (eine mit Kettensäge) halten mehr aus. Und natürlich der Bosszombie, den Sie zum Schluss umlegen müssen. Der ballert auch als Einziger mit MG und Raketenwerfer auf Sie und kann sich ebenfalls temporär unsichtbar machen. Allerdings ist der Bursche kein Vergleich zu dem, was Ihnen in Valves Koop-Shooter am Ende entgegen geworfen wird.\n\nDass Killing Floor ursprünglich eine Modifikation zu Unreal Tournament 2004 war, erkennt man schon am seltsamen Gleiten der Spielerfiguren. Überhaupt kommt der Titel gerade in Sachen Animationen nicht an Left 4 Dead heran. Und auch die Spielmechaniken sind in Valves Infiziertenspiel deutlich ausgefeilter und variantenreicher, allerdings kostet Killing Floor mit 18 Euro auch nur einen Bruchteil von dem, was Sie für Left 4 Dead hinblättern müssen. Trotzdem bleibt Tripwires Zombiehatz nur etwas für fanatische Fans von Untoten plus Koop.\n","timestamp_created":1437535539,"timestamp_updated":1437535539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17166222","author":{"steamid":"76561198055639474","num_games_owned":312,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7295,"last_played":1545461946},"language":"english","review":"No other game has had me coming back this consistently over this much time.","timestamp_created":1437531225,"timestamp_updated":1437531225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17165856","author":{"steamid":"76561198032790221","num_games_owned":324,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1640836612},"language":"english","review":"Shoot zombies.","timestamp_created":1437529031,"timestamp_updated":1437529031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17164210","author":{"steamid":"76561198116597856","num_games_owned":555,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":16818,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1202,"last_played":1623649373},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games in history of gaming.\n\nGore: Check.\nFun: Check.\nFun Voice Lines: Check.\nDosh: Check.\nLoad OF Money!: Check, Check.\n\n666/Dosh","timestamp_created":1437519001,"timestamp_updated":1437519001,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17163373","author":{"steamid":"76561198146021480","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108,"last_played":1446395123},"language":"russian","review":"Игра классная советую всем ) главное играть с друзьями так веселее)","timestamp_created":1437514925,"timestamp_updated":1437514925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17162174","author":{"steamid":"76561198017501575","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":20087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19650,"last_played":1487345711},"language":"english","review":"With my 300+ gaming hours of KF...

I played coop with a friend on our own private server and it was okay. We both played Commando and played each of the maps a few times. We struggled to beat it on normal long. What I didn't realize then was the depth that this game actually presents. By playing as only commando we had completely neglected the other classes. We had thought the berserker to be useless and we didn't even know about the healing dart that the medic guns had. It wasn't until late 2014 that I picked it up again and played in the public server with my friend. I learned that I loved medic and he loved support. We loved the challenge of it. Before where it was just a simple zed shoot'em'up now it was a challenging team based game. \n\nThis game is what you put into it. You have to take time to learn some of the finer mechanics. Even though this game is old and is beginning to show its age (especially with the second one out now), it is still a great game with a ton of content and amazing maps. The challenge is real to beat it on the higher difficulties. I came close to beating it on Hell on Earth once, but alas it did not happen.

It was wont to crash from time to time but not excessively, or beyond my own tholing. The graphics are from the mid 2000s. Nevertheless, the murderoushood of the game hove a height of murder that was bloody fabulous! You get to kill zombie-esque \"specimens\" over and over with shotguns, bipping pistols, flamey flames, slinging grenades, and my favorite, brrrrt brrrt Bertie Wooster assault rifles! You're off to London, lad, to cleanse the streets of demented filth! No time for dilly dallying amid the Drones, old boy. Yessir! Thump a specimen on the ol' 'ead with a katana and bung a grenade up 'is arse for good measure. THEN it's off to the Drones Club, old boy.\nThe 6 man--6 PERSON (the DLC has wifely characters) squads fight together or not at all. It makes for sore tedious playing when *alone* since you quickly find your back against a wall, often concrete or steel, which straight away is all decked out with your mushy remnants. Therefore, the back watching must be done.\nThe boss is unique because he's always the same sick son of a bitch in need of a lozenge. And physically he's as unique as if Howard Stern had had a baby with Rush Limbaugh and the abomination arose from their mutual hate to become Caitlyn Jenner. Just kidding! The Patriarch is a sadistic science bitch's reanimated specimen with a rocket launcher for an arm and a grapple sucker for a sternum. You can tell thereby a strongly implied Dr. Who influence. The obvious anatomical reference is to the plunger bearing Daleks, of course. It's a fact which I wouldn't waste a moment checking.\nJust one slight problem. I haven't leveled up since March 2013 even though I played it into July 2014 half-regularly. Last week in July 2015, I downloaded it on a new computer and played a half dozen games. Of course I earned no experience. It highlights the greater futility and meaninglessness of experience earning in games. Such a pathetic waste of human life in the end. Hence, I only played the game for the experience of playing, not the experience of gaming. Ya KNOW! Yeah...never play a game only for in game experience.\nRECOMMENDED to ream out your life's sorrows through vicarious knightly murder of dystopian nightmare demons. Play with others and be nice...stick a syringe in 'em. They will thank you for sharing needles. Sharing is caring.\nSo ends the story of the gameplay of the thing.","timestamp_created":1436990670,"timestamp_updated":1436990670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17059172","author":{"steamid":"76561198167885398","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1500013882},"language":"schinese","review":"爽","timestamp_created":1436962014,"timestamp_updated":1436962014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17047195","author":{"steamid":"76561198015059009","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":167,"last_played":1444845839},"language":"dutch","review":"probeer deze game te spelen ,maar krijg telkens bericht over een ini.file ?
