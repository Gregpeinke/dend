The original was one of the most original and successful puzzle games ever made...was it possible to keep the spirit and integrity of the original, while making new changes to keep the game fresh? That answer is a resounding “yes”. Portal 2 is not only a worthy sequel to Portal, but it also surpasses its predecessor in quality, design, and gameplay.\n\nMuch of what made Portal a success returns in Portal 2, with a few wonderful additions and changes. To those who have played the first Portal, Portal 2’s gameplay is a reunion with a dear old friend. The level and game design, however, are even better than the original, with more varied environments to explore, plenty of easter eggs to discover, and amazing scripted scenes. The special moments add a new level of excitement to the gameplay, and I always looked forward to what was coming next. There are also cool new design elements to many of the puzzles. Portal gave us cubes, turrets, and deadly goo, but Portal 2 gives us hard-light bridges, excursion funnels, propulsion gels (my favorite), and many more. The iconic humor also makes a welcome return, and is sillier and quirkier than ever.\n\nWhat really makes Portal 2 a true step forward from Portal, however, is the new co-op mode. Portal puzzles are fun and mind-bending by themselves, but playing a puzzle made for two creates a whole new meaning to “fun with science”. The amount of communication and teamwork that these puzzles require is astounding. To give a few examples, players must perform actions at the same time, rely on one to help the other reach an object or location, and figure out a way to get both players to the same location. This is one truest forms of co-op that I have ever played. In most co-op games, if one player is inactive, others can still play without too much of a hiccup. That is not the case in Portal 2. Since there are only two players, and the puzzle solutions require both players to work together, if one player doesn’t participate, there is no way to complete the puzzle. Because of this, I highly recommend this co-op experience to anyone seeking to improve trust and team-building skills with a friend. \n    \n    Though not available when the game first released, Portal 2 now has a level creator for both single player and co-op test chambers. Couple this with flourishing support by the Steam Workshop community and there is no shortage of quality player-built single player and co-op maps to download. I’ve tried my hand at creating chambers myself, but level design is not my forte. For those who fancy themselves as the next big game designer, though, do not hesitate to try your hand at creating some content!\n\nI have yet to play a “perfect” video game; yes, even with this glowing review, I do not want the reader to feel that Portal 2 is perfect, although I will confess, its flaws seem few compared to some games I have played. \n\nPuzzle games are not known for their stories, and Portal 2 is no exception. The plot is somewhat different than the first game, but ultimately ends up being quite similar. The beginning and ending of the game are fantastic, but the ending is directed at those who played the first game. I wonder exactly how much gamers who did not play the original Portal will understand.\n\nAlso, one big element to the Portal series is the fact that the player is never truly alone when they complete puzzles. Indeed, in basic form, there is always someone--or something--commenting about you or your environment, often to the player’s amusement. While Portal 2 has an even better, sillier, and more diverse cast of characters this time around, there is one--albeit small--section of the game where player is in fact left all alone in a rather bland environment, with no one and nothing commenting about their performance. This may be my personal low of the game, but it leads into my very favorite section of the game which more than makes up for this low. I do hope that if Valve is planning any more installments in the Portal series (which seems unlikely) that they keep the humorous commentary coming. Portal just isn’t Portal with dead silence.   \n\nOther than those minor quibbles of mine, Portal 2 is a fantastic experience. Like its predecessor, I heartily recommend it to puzzle lovers looking for a fantastic brainteaser, to anyone who tires of blowing things up in first person shooters, and now also to those looking to build a strong bond with a co-op partner, and those looking to create some fantastic level designs to add to their portfolios. If you seem to have “The Itch” for testing, Portal 2 is ready to help you scratch it.
