Segundo, ele adicionou um modo que muita gente conhece em outros jogos, o Co-Op, ou para os brazileiros como eu, Modo Cooperativo. Nele você entra na maquinaria(saco a indireta? Entra na pele, entra na maquinaria?) de um dos dois robôs mais carismaticos da historia da valve, perdendo para a nossa querida GLaDOS, Atlas e P-Body, cujo quem é quem é escolhido ( no caso de jogo entre amigos steam) entre que convida quem quem foi convidado. Quem convida entra na maquinaría de Atlas (azul), um robô com aparência baixa e redonda, e o convidado é a P-Body (cor laranja), uma robô(sim isso está certo, umA robô) com estatura alta e magra, naqule padrão da comédia, alto magro e baixo gordo.\nVocê ainda pode customizar seus robôs da maneira que você quiser, desde um chapéu de Team Fortress 2 (aviso: não são todos, como o Boné da Mann.

You work in a laboratory and have to solve small (or sometimes big) testchambers, but they are all different so it doesn't get boring. Before you buy this game, you should buy the first one-the story goes on.\n\nMy opinion: This is the BEST game of the world. You can have endless fun (with or without your friends) ,because there are millions of maps, which are created by other people. The first part was also good, but it´s short. The second part is perfect: A long story, you can create your own maps and play the maps from your friends.
