Нам придется решать всяческие задачи, преодолевая пропасти и ловушки хитрым образом, активировать кнопки и механизмы. Бонусом (в отличие от первой части) здесь придется использовать специальную краску, так, например, поверхность, окрашенная в синий цвет, позволит вам прыгать выше, оранжевая набирать большую скорость при беге, а любая ровная стена покрытая белым цветом становится пригодной для создания на ней порталов.\n\nВот отличие от первого Portal’а здесь очень хороший и проработанный сюжет, которой обязательно стоит пройти! Приятная графика, анимации, озвучка и вся стилистика игры. И самое главное, на мой взгляд, это кооператив! Все продумано для комфортной игры вдвоем: отличные разнообразные миссии с интересными и смешными сенами, статистка, удобная система жестов и указателей, возможность смотреть от камеры партнера. Вообще мне кажется это лучшая кооперативная игра, которая определенно стоит внимания каждого! И на последок здесь есть редактор уровней с поддержкой Steam Workshop, а следовательно большое количество необычных пользовательских карт для одиночной и кооперативной игры – можно замозговать на долгие месяцы!\n\nЯ очень доволен этой игрой, не жалею о пройденном сингле, очень доволен игрой в кооператив с друзьями, часто нахожу новые пользовательские карты благодаря которым игра остается для меня интересной и полезной.
