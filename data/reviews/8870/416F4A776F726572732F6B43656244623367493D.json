I like the floating city and the setting. The issue is that the story is random. The tear feature is random and is not innovative at all. There are too many things that seem too random and not very believable. It is just not very gripping at all. It was quite a chore to get to the end, and the ending... well, it's random and makes no sense.\n\nThe combat is not very engaging either, especially with a certain Vigor...\nThere is a ranged vigor that makes an enemy fight for the player. It is hilarious to watch an enemy soldier turn against his kin, and then shoot himself in the head when the vigor wears off. Instead of treating the combat seriously, I spent a lot of time firing the vigor at the enemy then hiding and laughing as the shots rang out. Hilarious yes, but it took the fun out of the combat and I felt my protagonist was overpowered.

This game makes you think, in a good way.\n\nEasily the greatest single player story ever conceived to date and yet to be topped.\n\nThis game is akin to the Matrix in terms of waking up to a reality as if a veil has been covering everything you knew. You experience this vantage point through the main character who quickly becomes an The main antagonist to a seemingly paradise city built on propaganda.\n\nThis game is a reflection of the american dream or \"making it\" in modern capitalism and how the origins were built from breaking the backs of those the founding fathers predecessors and successors stepped on.\n\nThis plotline however is not only politically deep. It dabbles into metaphysics and concepts such as time travel, multiple dimensions, fate, destiny and the notion of waking up to a greater reality in a spiritual context.\n\nThe girl you save is a symbol of an pure innocent spiritual being who is used for profit. You don't know this going in as the main character. All you know is your job as a bounty hunter type, is to save the girl with a no bullshit approach. He knows something is screwed up with the situation and he's gonna save the girl no matter what is thrown his way. He is viewed as an enemy of the state who has gone on a reckless rampage, yet his anti-hero shenanigans really speak to taking a step forward and pushing through the hate and lies as an individual in the reality he is experiencing as he dives further into the rabbit hole with no fear.  You get to experience this man's journey through a twisted fate of sorts, saving the day, but not knowing why. He follows intuition, not knowing exactly what is going on or why he is even there. There is more woven in to this story, but for the sake of time and spoilers, I will end it here.\n\n","timestamp_created":1620998098,"timestamp_updated":1620998098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91977272","author":{"steamid":"76561198365920115","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":654,"last_played":1621152499},"language":"schinese","review":"从懵懂到杀疯再到懵逼\n","timestamp_created":1620994414,"timestamp_updated":1621153624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91976199","author":{"steamid":"76561198274845491","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":770,"last_played":1621352531},"language":"schinese","review":"射击感很好，情节设计很有创意，充满时代感的音乐和场景","timestamp_created":1620992838,"timestamp_updated":1620992838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91974427","author":{"steamid":"76561199166814720","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":274,"last_played":1620989925},"language":"english","review":"it
