Jump to \"Personal thoughts\"![/b]\n\n[h1]Like Left 4 Dead 2, but actually good[/h1]\nSurvive up to 10 waves of zeds and then kill their Patriarch in a wide variety of maps. There's also an objective mode if you wanna do different kinds of stuff.\n\n✓ Wide variety of maps and enemies\n✓ Great soundtrack\n✓ Addicting and rewarding\n✓ 7 perks, each with a different playstyle\n✓ Plenty of mods\n✓ Challenging: 5 difficulty modes\n✓ Great server browser\n✓ PC Master Race: in this PC exclusive, both controls and UI aren't dumbed down for consoles\n\n✗ Getting any perk to lvl6 will require A LOT of grinding\n✗ Camping Floor: most maps have a sweet spot that will be abused for camping\n✗ Plenty of cheaters and scrubs (see: every multiplayer game ever)\n✗ The insane amount of achievements will overwhelm you at times\n✗ Hosting a friends-only game is an absolute nightmare to setup\n✗ Only 3 maps for objective mode (compared to the 28 available for wave mode)\n✗ Objective mode is WAY too hard with strangers, you have to play with a team over Skype/TeamSpeak so everyone's in sync\n\n[h1]Personal thoughts[/h1]\nThis game is hard. If you wanna get into it, [url=http://www.kf-wiki.com/wiki/Main_Page]read the wiki[/url] and invest 10 minutes of your time to learn the advantages of every perk and the weaknesses of every zed. Such a simple thing will save you from dying hundreds of times in the future.\n\nThe mechanics are simple: more players = tougher zeds. Up to 6 players in the party. The tough zeds start coming from wave 5. Did you finish wave 10? Congratulations!

NO ONE wants a lvl4 or below on Suicidal/Hell on Earth, I can assure you that\n    [*]Salty scrubs are easy to spot: they're lvl6 berserkers, they use their mic a lot, their voice sounds like they've got a penis in their mouth and they insult players whenever someone dies.

If I had to say two words about this game, it's that it's Fucking Awesome. Yeah, I get it, the perks are a pain in the ass to level up, but once you level up the perks, each one of them literally makes the game more fun to you. Every single perk has their strengths and weaknesses, which makes the game more fun and challenging. It also encourages teamwork and cooperation because the perk system encourages the team to be balanced. Now, don't get me started on the perks, but these perks can pack a punch to the clot's brain if used correctly. The field medic for example, is primarily made for support and for healing their team effectively. The commando is made for spotting stalkers and for crowd control. The list goes on and on as the perks open new doors to new strategies and techniques. Even the DLCs are worth buying because some of the weapons can actually change the tide of the battle quickly. Also, one of the characters sound pretty sexy. That ends my review, as I would say that you should Definitely get this game.

Killing Floor is sickness, a wicked one at its finest. Teamworking wave by wave your way up to face the horror itself is a great fun. Although, game itself is coated in black humor, which is swirled inside small popular culture and steampunk references. Not everyone's cup of tea at that, but I assure you everyone can take the joy of killing mindless clone armies even it's given in a literature covered struggle in vain and desperation.\n\nGame is hard, I'll give you that and it takes time to get used to some patterns, but once you get used to it; they will become habits like the game itself. More you play, more you will seek about its balance and mechanics and it will sink you deeper into it. Because getting better and everything resolves in teamplay.\nIf you're into black humor, survival co-op, hidden popular culture references and mindless killing fest where you are the actual prey; you gotta buy this game and play it.\n\nOddly, there's almost nothing attracting the modern casual players here despite game is built upon a genre meant to be casual and fun. Unlike most similar titles in the scene, KF1 is a brutal experience with its trial and error attempts with no failsafe methods.\nOnce you made a mistake someone have to take the consequences and you can not recover from bad positioning easily either. You won't heal back quicker without any help neither you can not shoot at the other end of map with near perfect accuracy by spray'n pray. Game will reward controlled fire and recoil compensation as much as twitch shots paired with depth perception.\n\nBeing an arcade-like game as it rewards being swift, resolving and sharp-eyed; Killing Floor also infamous about punishing impatience and being disorganized at times you least expect it. Which can be a frustrating and long-running experience to get ahold of. Zeds have nasty habits of flanking you often or interrupt your teammates as they're busy with high threats, if you ever let your guard down.\n\nGame conductor system that most co-op shooters are familiar with somewhat exist in this game too and it wouldn't hesitate to punish you from blind spots if you dare to cheese the game.\nAt these times it's better to stand close and watch each others' behind and cover fire for each other. Yet being cluttered like that may lead to a quick death if you fail to gain ground for a long time or watching the same direction at the open. In other words, team formation really matters, trust is important and tunnel visioning gets you killed.\n\nGame also require discipline of ceasing fire without panicing and engaging priorities in a mayhem by letting the capable perks handle it. As difficulty goes higher, methods that we know as speed kills to dispatch big specimen quicker before them being a nuisance gets into play. By that, certain underlying mechanics that is never hinted towards the player along the gameplay should be utilized too. KF1 expects you to learn all of the tricks up its sleeve by looking and learning.\n\nAfter a long round even if you fought your way through the hordes of zeds you can get overwhelmed by the difficulty spike of infamous last (10th) wave, or get slaughtered by the beast called The Patriarch.\nHe's pretty much designed in the shadow of 80's slaughter movies for an endgame boss and really gives you a quick rundown about that era. In the end you'll have lots of fun moments and laughs about how you failed it and fell prey to the slaughter or good memories about how you prevailed the carnage.\n\nLate edit: well... I still recommend this game but compared to many titles in the market right now, it will feel primitive but it's a very well designed game with ups and downs. If you wanna get into it, guess you are way late but it still can offer you hundred hours of fun.
