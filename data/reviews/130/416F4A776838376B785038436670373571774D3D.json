preface, when i say i recommend the game, i exclusively mean to those who want more half-life 1 style content. this is a very skippable entry however.\n\nlet's start with the pros: it's an expansion of half-life 1, a game i found so enjoyable, so the mechanics being mostly the same definitely made me enjoy it more. plus, the continuity between this game and the base game are fun to see. unfortunately, i did have more negatives with this game than i did the original.\n\nthe game took me 3 hours to finish and probably could've taken less if i hadn't made myself dinner midway through the game, leaving it idle on my pc. it's so short that you dont really get the chance to appreciate anything until the credits roll. this doesnt make the game bad, per se, but compared to the 15 hours i took in base half life, it was extremely underwhelming\n\nadding onto that aspect, the last couple chapters felt very much like a chore. [spoiler]xen felt better than in half-life 1, but the last 2 chapters where you're trying to get the charged battery just felt very tedious and not as fun as the rest of the game.[/spoiler] it kind of felt like padding, as if they needed to reach some sort of playtime quota. a short game, especially as an expansion pack, can still be really fun, but feeling the need to expand this by 2 whole chapters that really didn't need to exist just made the game feel so much more arduous to complete.\n\nthe weapons were also very lackluster. [spoiler]since you arent playing as gordon, but rather as \"b. calhoun\" who is a security guard, thus only really having access to a pistol for a good portion of the game. you do get the shotgun, smg, and some explosives later on, but the experimental and alien weapons were inaccessible (except for the snarks, which i never use). i know that's for lore and continuity purposes, but it was still upsetting to only have some pretty basic weaponry.[/spoiler]\n\noverall, yes i do recommend it, as it was very fun, but i would not classify it as a must-play if you are trying to get into half-life. there isnt much lore present here that wasnt already known from the first game and as such, it's very skippable. if all you care about is seeing the events of the black mesa incident from the point of view of that security guard you see on your tram ride, then this serves exactly that purpose. 6/10","timestamp_created":1648774137,"timestamp_updated":1648774137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113121751","author":{"steamid":"76561199079922020","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":165,"last_played":1644834001},"language":"russian","review":"----- СЮЖЕТ -----\n☐ Это заменит тебе жизнь\n☐ Запоминающийся\n✓ Интересный\n☐Не скучный\n☐ Лучше иди поспи\n☐ Сюжет?\n\n----- ГРАФИКА -----\n☐ Реальность выглядит хуже\n☐ Сочная\n✓ Хорошая\n☐ Приемлемо\n☐ Плохая\n☐ Там что-то есть?\n☐ Опасно для глаз\n\n----- ИГРОВОЙ ПРОЦЕСС -----\n☐ Этим можно заниматься вечно\n✓ Интересен\n☐ Просто геймплей\n☐ Ну такое\n☐ Лучше просто сидеть на месте\n☐ Похоже разрабы забыли, что делали игру\n\n----- АУДИО -----\n☐ Экстаз\n☐ Очень хороша\n☐ Хороша\n✓Сойдет\n☐ Ваш голос звучит лучше\n☐ Играй без звука\n\n----- ДИНАМИКА -----\n☐ ЧТО ЗДЕСЬ ПРОИСХОДИТ?!\n☐ Очень динамично\n✓ Интенсивно\n☐ Умеренно\n☐ Спокойно\n☐ Можно даже заснуть\n☐ Может она просто зависла?\n\n----- СЛОЖНОСТЬ -----\n☐ Продайте душу сатане\n☐ Это будет тяжелый путь\n☐ Просто научиться / стать мастером тяжело\n✓ Средне\n☐ Иногда нужно будет играть двумя руками\n☐ Press \"X\" to win\n\n----- АУДИТОРИЯ -----\n☐ Новорожденные\n☐ Дети\n✓ Взрослые\n☐ Люди\n☐ Точно НЕ люди\n\n----- ТРЕБОВАНИЯ к ПК -----\n☐ Ждите квантовый компьютер\n☐ Мощный\n☐ Нормальный\n☐ Первый компьютер пойдет\n☐ Калькулятор сойдет\n✓ Она запуститься, даже если вы просто подключите электричество\n\n----- ПРОКАЧКА -----\n☐ За одну жизнь не справишься\n☐ Переизбыток гринда\n☐ Иногда можно заскучать\n☐ Это просто игровой процесс\n☐ Только если вы хотите стать показушником\n✓ Тут нечего прокачивать\n\n----- ВРЕМЯ ИГРЫ -----\n☐ Бесконечность не предел!\n☐ Довольно длинная\n☐ Средняя\n☐ Короткая\n✓ Вы не успеете моргнуть\n\n----- ЦЕНА -----\n☐ Тебе некуда девать деньги?\n☐ Не стоит трат\n☐ Можно подождать скидки (я бы даже сказал нужно)\n✓ Цена оправдывает ожидания\n☐ Бесплатна\n\n----- БАГИ -----\n☐ ОСТОРОЖНО!

The HD models; They just don't look that good. But I do think they fit better into the context of Blue Shift than they do in Half-Life, which makes them slightly tolerable here. \n\n2, The story isn't that great. I haven't played for much longer and the story is really basic. It's just Half-Life 1 from Barnie's perspective, I know Half-Life: Opposing Force is just HL1 from a HECU soldier's perspective, but the thing that made that game so good was the new content, the new enemies, weapons, and environments just make it way better than this.\n\n3. This game just feels like extra levels for the base game of Half-Life. I know Opposing Force is also \"technically\" just extra levels, the reasons I listed above show why Opposing Force is just a better game.\n\nNow, just because there's some things I don't like about it, doesn't mean you shouldn't buy this game. Its a pretty good game if you've beaten Half-Life 1 and want something else to play. ]\n\nDecently good game, 6/10 from

Overall though, I think the constant freezing and crashing ruined the game for me, I could have seen myself replaying it but frankly I dont want to even try because like the first it happens way to often.","timestamp_created":1647316411,"timestamp_updated":1647316411,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494486391544342041","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112217601","author":{"steamid":"76561198389345180","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1647314726},"language":"english","review":"compared to Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force, Blue Shift is pretty short. I don't know if that's because it was originally gonna be in the Dreamcast version of Half-Life before it got cancelled, Besides that, it's overall not a bad game. there's something so real about just being a security guard trying to make it out of the facility.

Во-первых, она короче в отличии от первой части и opposing force. Во-вторых, нововведений здесь практически нет. В-третьих, урезано оружие. И в четвёртых, динамика стала слабее, потому что геймплей был сделан в угоду головоломак нежели перестрелок. Но эта игра важна для серии. Ведь во-второй части главный герой сыграет важную роль и  тут его надо было раскрыть. Также было приятно вернуться в Чёрную Мезу. Побродить по некоторым старым и по новым локациям.\n Снова повоевать с прищельцами и военными. Лично мне это дополнение к первой части понравилось хоть у неё есть спорные вещи. Можете купить и попробовать поиграть.","timestamp_created":1647288988,"timestamp_updated":1647288988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112186645","author":{"steamid":"76561199114075396","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":331,"last_played":1646844505},"language":"english","review":"Really makes you feel like a security guard","timestamp_created":1647284200,"timestamp_updated":1647284253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112183790","author":{"steamid":"76561199166650616","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1647281876},"language":"english","review":"great DLC from the great game itself","timestamp_created":1647280550,"timestamp_updated":1647280550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh87kxP8Cfp75qwM="}
