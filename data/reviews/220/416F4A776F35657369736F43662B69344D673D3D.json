I will give it my recommendation for that alone.  The A.I. is so frustrating though.  The enemies always respond the same way and can see you instantly from any distance-- even if you are crawling through weeds a quarter-mile away.  If you can see them as a speck on the horizon, they can see you and start shooting.  The A.I. is just as bad for your allies that are more in your way than helping you.  Getting upstairs is nigh impossible if you have four of these losers riding your coattails.  Thank the developers for giving us the gravity gun so we can barricade them in a room where they will sit tight and not get themselves or you killed.  The incredibly annoying A.I. makes the game seem very repetitive and one-dimensional because you can never change the way you engage them.  Sneaking up on them is pretty much never going to happen, unless they have purposely designed a scene where you come into a room behind an enemy focused on something else.  Wouldn't it make more sense for a physicist like Dr. Freeman to take down his enemies in a more methodical and most times clandestine way?  In this game you are kind of forced to go in guns-a-blazin' all the time.  Perfect Dark and a host of other games that are older had better A.I.  Maybe a mod could fix this and give the game some replayability.","timestamp_created":1418270840,"timestamp_updated":1418270840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13313056","author":{"steamid":"76561198073899785","num_games_owned":392,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":7091,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6852,"last_played":1641512704},"language":"spanish","review":"Half-life 2 la continuacion del aclamado Half-life 1 y el primer juego en estrenar el motor source.Es un gran juego tiene una historia extensa y muy entretenida,por supuesto aclamada por muchos gamers y la comunidad.Nos enfrentaremos a la Alianza junto a los rebeldes para liberar a ciudad 17 del dominio del doctor Breen el antiguo administrador de Black Mesa y uno de los culpables en causar la secuencia de resonancias,Volveremos a ver a personajes de la anterior entrega como Barney,Eli,etc.Conoceras Armas nuevas y una jugabilidad bastante distinta a la entrega anterior.Te enfrentaras a nuevos enemigos y conoceras nuevos personajes en esta historia de ciencia ficcion mas aclamada.No solo eso tambien usaras veiculos y de una manera mas dinamica y divertida.Hace no tan poco salio un pequeño remake de este juego que mejora la calidad de texturas y los shaders son un poco mas intensos.\n\nNt:El sountrack de este juego es gratuito descargalo para escuchar las canciones de este gran juego.\nTened Un Buen Dia y Buen Gaming","timestamp_created":1418270579,"timestamp_updated":1516425689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13310711","author":{"steamid":"76561198066243725","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":949,"last_played":1630895462},"language":"english","review":"I really enjoyed the story.

This time, however, the invaders have effectively taken control of every resource and major population center on Earth. The prowess of the invaders is staggering, at least until Freeman manages to obtain another crowbar. After meeting with some old allies,  a terrible mistake exposes Freeman to the dictatorship in control of Earth, which leads to the mobilisation of all available units with the sole purpose of destroying Freeman.\nWithout giving too much away, mayhem awaits.\n\nThe plot of Half-Life 2 really is quite impressive, especially when considering that Half-Life had only a simple story. Half-Life 2 branches off from the original in an impressive manner, showing off the impressive writing talents of the Valve team. The plot is discovered through typical Half-Life fashion: your surroundings. While it's no Dark Souls in terms of plot, it doesn't obviously point out all the plot points, nor does it pause your game to tell you insignificant amounts of information.\n\nGameplay in Half-Life 2 is similar to the original, except with a new arsenal and significantly larger environment. While restrained to the Black Mesa facility in Half-Life, Freeman is free to explore the world in the much largr sequel. This leads to more epic fights, environments and strategies.\nThe new space is well utilised in most cases. Helicopters must be shot down, yet can do significant damage to any areas where you may hide. The Combine will attempt to ambush you whenever possible, which leads to surprises.\n\nThe enemies and environment are impressive. The environment depicts what happens to Earth after being completely dominated by atechnologically superior force, and the aliens fit into areas apropriate for them, such asthe Antlions whom live under sand in beaches.\n\nOverall, I would say that Half-Life 2 builds on the original game in every way, yet it does not replace it. It creates an amazing world and great cast of characters that you will feel attached to, even the silent protagonist Gordon Freeman and the seemingly omnipotent G-man. I highly recommend this game, for its story, gameplay, characters and everything else that makes it amazing.","timestamp_created":1417847021,"timestamp_updated":1417847021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515503883361816406","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13245888","author":{"steamid":"76561198000726083","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":411,"last_played":1434196500},"language":"english","review":"I tought i was on LCD when i played this lunatic game.11\\10","timestamp_created":1417829561,"timestamp_updated":1417829561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13245040","author":{"steamid":"76561198084237684","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1541806763},"language":"brazilian","review":"\"A prova de que um FPS não precisa ser só atirar em tudo que se move\"\n10/10","timestamp_created":1417823711,"timestamp_updated":1417823711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13244829","author":{"steamid":"76561198138320726","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":876,"last_played":1463862531},"language":"english","review":"Always great for a replay.","timestamp_created":1417822474,"timestamp_updated":1417822474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13242528","author":{"steamid":"76561198063791563","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9862,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3374,"last_played":1657058547},"language":"english","review":"Well, never actually played the HL1 and extensions to HL1, but I must say that this game is [b]awesome[/b].\nPerfect story, perfect engine (bit old, but still a masterpiece) and perfect map desing.\nI really the story detail like [spoiler]7 Hour War[/spoiler] texts.\nIf you love games due to the story, you must buy it.","timestamp_created":1417810437,"timestamp_updated":1417810437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13242355","author":{"steamid":"76561198159935561","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":48,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1425743260},"language":"english","review":" Great for gmod! :D","timestamp_created":1417809567,"timestamp_updated":1417809567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13241393","author":{"steamid":"76561198021524876","num_games_owned":940,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":815,"last_played":1588602020},"language":"italian","review":"Davvero stai leggendo le recensioni?
