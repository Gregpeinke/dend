Floor is a Round-based Multiplay Survival Horror Game. Its great enjoyable to play this Game with a full Team up. The Quotes are funny, the Weapons are nice, the Gunseller misterously appears on random Spots, however she travels safely arround and that fast... but whatever. \n\nTeamplay is sometimes really important in this Game. What makes this Game more difficult? When you die, and what happens when you die? you are losing your Guns and the Money you paid for them.

While i like the default maps i prefer the Steam Workshop content, mainly the maps. \nI really like the guns and the ways that every round has a time for you to buy guns and stuff. The soundtrack is awesome.\nBut there are a few problems i HAVE to point out. For one, what the f**k is up with enemies spawning behind you? Not the invisible ones but those huge flamethrower ones. A long open field, i see no enemy behind me so i kill the 2 that are coming at me then i turn around and there are 3 surrounding me, not letting me move or the fact that a couple zombies get stuck on the scenery f**ks sake, one of the largest maps in the game and i have to find a crawler that got stuck on a box somewhere in the huge dark field with more than 300 m of size.\nBut despite those problems, there are a lot of guns some quite creative, there is also a potato that supposidely does a bunch of stuff, i haven´t got it yet. The maps, despite my bitching, are good, the zombies are also creative, carrying chainsaws, going invisible, screaming, jumping and those fat ones that are very slow and spit poison at you. Quite good, also, this game isn´t for everybody. It doesn´t do the \"appealling to a wider audience\" thing. \nIf you like tons of shooting, have patience, can get imersed, are not dependant on hand holding (some call of duty players for example) then i think you will like this game.\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1425205236,"timestamp_updated":1425205236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14704969","author":{"steamid":"76561198134090634","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":17199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10264,"last_played":1584169942},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego, su jugabilidad es facil de aprenderse y adictiva. \nGraficos pasables aunque a mi se me hacen muy buenos.\nBuena dificultad ya que tiene 5 dificultades que si estan muy bien balanceadas a mi parecer.\nEl objetivo es muy sencillo el cual es matar zombis, ganar dinero, comprar mejores armas y sobrevivir hasta terminar la oleada de zombis, asi consecutivamente hasta llegar con el jefe del juego que a mi parecer se me hace buen jefe. \nTienes 7 clases a tu dispocisión que tienen sus propios tipos de arma, tambien subes de nivel con cada clase, no es muy sencillo ya que te pone un tipo de objetivos como \"causa daño con este tipo de arma\" y te ponen una cifra muy alta pero invirtiendo muchas horas podras llegar a conseguirlas y subir de nivel.\nLo que no me gusta mucho es de que tiene muchos DLC y la mayoria no se me hacen muy originales aunque claro puedes comprarte el paquete completo en oferta y pues ahi es muy pasable pero aun asi no lo dejaria de recomendar.","timestamp_created":1425193805,"timestamp_updated":1425193805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14704693","author":{"steamid":"76561198203965288","num_games_owned":277,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":22108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3150,"last_played":1537975160},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I've ever played - Super Addictive, graphics are MUCH better than screenshots online, as it's been updated alot with Direct X features that were never a part of the Unreal 2 engine before.

With the amount of positive reviews I figured how could one go wrong? Glad I made the purchase because it's literally the only MP I play now pretty much. Yeah, a 6 year old game! It is very team oriented so if you're a solo hero you probably won't like it too much. But if you enjoy playing with a few competant other people that know their roles (friends on teamspeak is much more fun as well as easier to rely on) then you'll have a blast. Does get mildly repetitive after 2-3 games but what FPS doesn't, really? The perk system is pretty cool as well and for the most part pretty well balanced, My friends and I are playing on Hard at the moment after starting from beginner briefly and moving to Normal. The jump from Normal to Hard is quite noticable, so do not think you will be able to melt everything instantly. One tip I can give to new players is to READ GUIDES! There are hundreds out there if you take the time to look. This will help you immensely and avoid squad wipes.

And Dosh. Lots of Dosh.\n\nKilling Floor is a game that is simple in it's representation, yet can be difficult to master. With a backstory of a shady organization experimenting on humans and other creatures to create horrid monstrosities, no one is saying that this story hasn't been done before. But the Killing Floor experience is less about the plot, and more about the gameplay.\n\nThe game, meant for multiplayer, drops players in the midst of the zombie apocalypse as fresh-eyed, hopeful mercenaries hoping to earn a pretty penny. What ensues is a 6-player killfest, with a heavy focus on teamwork and the ability to cooperate in order to survive against the ever-expanding hordes of zeds, along with the destructive power of the Patriarch at the end of each game.\n\nKilling Floor runs on a class-based system. Players can choose from multiple classes, with Sharpshooter, Firebug, and Medic to name a few. Each class has their own perks, special weaponry, and play style to give them an edge based on their preferred position in the squad. As the players accomplish goals in the class' experience path, they gain levels in their respective classes to further their abilities, decrease the cost of weaponry and gear, and make themselves all the more badass.\n\nA big apppeal that Killing Floor holds is it's mod community, with heavy encouragement on creation of maps, mods, mutators, and other content. This idea of freedom to the players makes Killing Floor a customizable experience that can appeal to a wide variety of gamers, from the kind that want a hardcore zombie slaying experience, to the more relaxed kind that want to have a crazy time killing things. The game's content tends to lean more towards the latter.\n\nIf you're looking for a serious zombie game, you might want to steer clear, however. Killing Floor is a game that is vulgar and crass in it's presentation, and isn't afraid to be silly. So for the folks out there who want a serious zombie experience with more focus on story or survival, Killing Floor isn't the best game for you. But for the people who want a solid experience in a game that is one part shooting things, one part insulting your teammates, and one part throwing money around, you've found a winner. Just watch out for Fleshpounds.","timestamp_created":1425117138,"timestamp_updated":1425117138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14687104","author":{"steamid":"76561198166624325","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":77,"last_played":1433945354},"language":"english","review":"This game is absolutely incredible!

огромных армий зомби предшествовали определённые события. История началась с корпорации Horzine Biotech, которая получила от государства заказ на создание идеальных солдат. Учёные долгое время пытались улучшить показатели обычного человека, но лишь одному удалось добиться успеха. Учёный по имени Кевин Кламели сделал прорыв в области восстановления, научился клонировать людей и управлять их волей. По случайному стечению событий учёный теряет своего сына, но отказываясь принять судьбу, клонирует его. В семье возникает проблема, и жена разводится с Кевином, в ответ на это он создаёт её клона, а настоящую жену убивает. Учёный продолжает трудиться над своими достижениями и создаёт целую армию мёртвых клонов, которые управляются только мыслями безумного гения. С такими возможностями он решает захватить целую страну и начинается всё с Великобритании. В прохождении игроку предстоит взять на себя роль одного из выживших и начать битву с бесчисленными зомби, но в итоге надо добраться до учёного, чтобы остановить этот кошмар.\n\nИгровой процесс\n\nСкриншот игрового процесса\nИгра имеет режимы одиночной и многопользовательской игры, a также две игровые модификации: Killing Floor Mod и Objective Mod. Каждый игрок должен выбрать один из семи перков (англ. Perks), которые дают бонусы в обращении с оружием данного перка и различные другие бонусы и дополнительные возможности.\n\nKilling Floor Mod\nШестеро человек (максимальное число игроков) оказываются заброшены на карту, чтобы уничтожить мутантов и ученого. Они должны выдержать некоторое количество волн (4, 7 или 10), после которых появляется сам ученый, Патриарх (англ. Patriarch). Игроки отбиваются от волн мутантов-клонов. Каждая следующая волна включает в себя увеличенное количество обычных и появление особых противников. После окончания волны игроки бегут к Торговцу (англ. Trader) в магазин, в котором осуществляется покупка различного вооружения и экипировки. Убивая врагов игроки получают деньги, а также накапливают опыт, переходя на следующие уровни перков. Чем больше игроков в команде, тем больше противников нападает на них и тем сильнее особые противники. Матч заканчивается тогда, когда игроки уничтожают босса игры, который идёт после всех волн. Одиночная игра отличается от многопользовательской лишь тем, что в ней игрок один отбивается от волн врагов.\n\nНа данный момент выпущены 33 официальных карты:","timestamp_created":1424803543,"timestamp_updated":1424803543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14637246","author":{"steamid":"76561198127880963","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":2452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2329,"last_played":1642439852},"language":"russian","review":"хорошея игра ,жду вторую часть !","timestamp_created":1424803211,"timestamp_updated":1424803211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14634902","author":{"steamid":"76561198123882184","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7493,"last_played":1648698880},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo antigo mas ainda assim excelente!
