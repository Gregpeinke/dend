The most this serves is just to establish the 'common, everyday man' that Gordon Freeman is apparently is... because having a PhD in Theoritical Physics is a common, everyday kind of thing.\n\nAlso, the story isn't really ever truly given to the player due to there being no cutscenes other than that tram ride and the very end of the game. You can get some of it if you pay attention but the most you'll figure is that you are apart of an experiment that accidentally caused waves upon waves of alien beings to teleport onto the Earth and that the government of this particular Earth is stupid in thinking that you can cover up such an incident at all.\n\nAbout as much as I can say.

pues por donde empezar Half Life es un juegazo aunque tenga 19 años de haber sido lanzado, sigue siendo entretenido y pondre los pros y contras de este gran juego.\n\nSI QUIERES UNA EXPERIENCIA VISUALMENTE MÁS ATARCTIVA Y CON OPCION DE ESCOGER LOS CAPITULOS EN EL ORDEN QUE QUIERAS ADQUIERE LA VERSION SOURCE (aunque no tieen multijugador. pero practicamente ya casi no es utilizado)\n\nPros:\n\n-No es un FPS generico: aunque hoy en dia eso paresca poco probable realmente no lo es ya que no solo es matar y ya, no tambien tiene niveles de plataformas y su estrategia ya que tu salud no se regenera.\n\n-Tiene un buen nivel de dificultad: No es muy fácil ni muy dificil simplemente en la dificultad intermedia te supondra un buen reto ya que como mencione no se regenera salud, ni escudo y los enemigos causan una buena cantidad de daño.\n\n-Armas originales: si bien no faltan las clasicas de todos los FPS´s tieen armas bastante originales.\n\n-Buena duracion: La duracion es buena ya que el juego lo terminaras de 15 a 20 horas.\n\n-Modo multijugador: tiene modo multijugador de hasta 32 personas.\n\nContras:\n\n-Poca variedad de enemigos: el tiempo que tiene lo justifica pero si esperas muchos enemigos diferentes aqui no los tendras no son muchos tipos de alienigenas o soldados pero su numero es suficiente para este gran juego.\n\n-Errores graficos: Son pocos pero estos son los carteles se oscurecen cuando te acercas o alejas y los eimpos de carga cuando pasas por algunas zonas el juego carga por uno o dos segundos ya que se tieen que cargar las zonas y si no has jugado titulos viejos te desconcertara al principio.\n\n-Multijugador muerto: No puedo decir en que consiste el multijugador (que seguramente e s solo matar a tus contrincantes) ya que no hay nadie en los servidores por lo cual si quieres jugar online hazlo con amigos ya que seguramente solo asi podras jugar online.\n\nPara finalizar Half life es un indispensable si o si y que tienes que jugar por lo menos una vez seas fan de los FPS´s o no y esta a un precio muy accecible sobretodo en las ofertas de steam.","timestamp_created":1505259661,"timestamp_updated":1505260376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34908853","author":{"steamid":"76561198041543540","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":73,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1558767450},"language":"english","review":"if

hace un tiempo que habia jugado este juego, concretamente el 2013, y con la salida del \"Epistle 3\" caí en la nostalgia y decidí jugar esta saga completa, como se merece.\n\nHalf-Life fue lanzado por Valve, y si bien tiene ya sus años (1998) es un juego, que siendo honestos nadie me podrá rebatir el argumento que fue una saga que marcó un antes y un después en el género de los Fps y de los videojuegos en general.\n\nDesempeñamos el papel de Gordon Freeman, un cientifico adjunto del MIT que trabaja en una instalación secreta en Nuevo Mexico llamada \"Black Mesa\" en donde se te es asginado al Departamento de Materiales Anómalos, y por un accidente en un experimento toda la instalación se ve invadida por seres extra-dimensionales. En medio de este caos, freeman debe luchar y abrirse paso para volver todo a la normalidad.\n\nSus controles son insufribles (sobre todo en los saltos, y espacios cerrados), pero no son imposibles.\n\nSus gráficos algo viejos dan mucho que desear (aunque con juegos como \"Half-Life Source\" y el mod \"Black Mesa\", no hay por donde perderse).Su banda sonora casi es inexistente, y solo destaca en momentos clave de la trama lo cual hace que pase sin pena ni gloria. Pero lo que mas destaca half-life en mi opinión solo hablando de su aspecto técnico es el arsenal de armas que nos presenta para combatir a nuestros enemigos.\n\nLo otro destacable es su contexto, half-life es, un juego correcto que salió en una fecha adecuada, fue un bombazo en sus años, sigue siendolo y da mucho de que hablar ya a sus 19 años de vida.\nPor mucho que lamente, half-life no fue parte de mi infancia en comparación a muchos otras personas, pero me hubiese encantado haberlo jugado mucho tiempo antes.\n\nNo dudes en jugarlo, porque llega a tener un status de \"culto\".","timestamp_created":1505249914,"timestamp_updated":1505249914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34907486","author":{"steamid":"76561198269635020","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1247,"last_played":1505496681},"language":"russian","review":"+\n1) Атмосфера.\n2) Сюжет.\n3) Интерактивность.\n4) Живой мультиплеер.\n5) Искусственный интеллект.\n6) Боссы.\n7) Необычная подача сюжета.\n8) Оружие.\n-\n1) Нет русской озвучки.\n2) Иногда не срабатывают скрипты.","timestamp_created":1505245903,"timestamp_updated":1518554813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34897618","author":{"steamid":"76561198049490615","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1507333879},"language":"english","review":"Half-life is an outstanding video game series that broke ground in the industry and claimed numerous awards. Normally i'd write individual reviews for all the installments in the series, i've instead decided to take a much more interesting route for such an interesting line of games. I am going to review every single game in chronological order as one giant review. If this has already been done then take it as pure adulation for the original.\n\nNow without further ado...\n\nHALF-LIFE<\n\nHalf-life, the first in the series, is an FPS unlike any other. Its combination of story and level design brought interest and awe ever since its release in 1998. If you are looking for what half-life gave inspiration to in the world of today, just take a short look around the FPS genre and you'll find ample examples.\n\nPROS:\n-The story is very well paced and put together very nicely. You play as Gordon Freeman, an MIT graduate working at the science and research facility of Black Mesa for years, going through a normal day at work when an experiment goes incomprehensibly wrong. Not spoiling the rest in case you haven't picked up a copy in the 20 years its existed.\n-The environment is very immersive as it is a long seamless road to the end of the game with, as the definition of seamless implies, zero cutscenes or immersion breaking interruptions. Give or take two particular instances.\n-The gunplay is as much as anyone would expect from a first person shooter. The wide arsenal available is pleasently loud, very powerful feeling, and quite fun to use when eliminating the enemy.\n-The ending, the cherry on top of every game, is absolutely perfect. Sets up a sequel in what i would consider the least forced way possible ever.\n-Has an HD reskin to give a fresh coat of paint to this forefather of gaming.\n-Comes implemented with a multiplayer arena.\n-Moddb is your best friend when your bored of the campaign.\n\nCONS: (Not even half-life is safe from sin, sorry) Please note that i am extremely aware that this game is an oldy.\n-Controls feel floaty and thats not very great to say when this game is a puzzle platformer.\n-While the guns feel and sound powerful, one or two show otherwise. In my numerous playthroughs of this game i've always had to unload nearly an entire clip of assault rifle into a soldier before he eventually died. Found every other gun to be fine though but it should be all of them working together with zero outliers.\n\nI am glad this game came around when it did and i am glad i got to enjoy it back in 2002 when i first played it. Sure i didn't really understand what it was at the time but i enjoyed it as much as everyone that came before and after me. I might speak the brutal truth when i say that if this game came out today it wouldn't have been as influential as it is. It would be praised heavily for its story and gameplay but eventually it would become one with the ever growing pile of first person shooters we're stuck with today. This isn't a shot at the game by any stretch, just a little two sence is all.\n\nAs for the game though, this is a must must must have to me. I picked the entire series up in a frantic buy a summer sale or two ago and it honestly kinda lives to its retail price. I don't expect you'll have any trouble deciding what to choose when the time comes again.\n\n10 crowbars out of 10\n\nNext up is Opposing Force.\n\n(temp note: this review was written at 2am and will be revised and probably rewritten.)","timestamp_created":1505208121,"timestamp_updated":1505262085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34897134","author":{"steamid":"76561198278632368","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":36,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1483207902},"language":"turkish","review":"Where is the Half-Life 3 Gaben ?","timestamp_created":1505205330,"timestamp_updated":1505205330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495098024606704712","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34895367","author":{"steamid":"76561198154961500","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":645,"last_played":1590630326},"language":"english","review":"It's a classic that I'm glad i had the chance to get into thanks to a friend and i would recommend it to anyone.","timestamp_created":1505193544,"timestamp_updated":1505193544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34894073","author":{"steamid":"76561198204507685","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":114,"playtime_forever":1040,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":956,"last_played":1660265345},"language":"english","review":"I change my mind about this peice of shit game. srsly the graphics are like minecraft who can enjoy this dusty peice of shit","timestamp_created":1505184810,"timestamp_updated":1513395625,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.427792996168136597","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34893348","author":{"steamid":"76561198054913415","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":5206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5067,"last_played":1539477825},"language":"english","review":"[b]+[/b] If you are a moviegoer and you are considering your first video game with a plot, [i]Half-Life[/i] is the perfect choice. In this epic sci-fi thriller, without saying too much, it starts with a theoretical physicist named Gordon Freeman en route to a scientific research facility, Black Mesa, to use an alien artifact to open a portal to the alien world of Xen, which results in a deadly disaster that would create a rift between Earth and Xen, essentially fusing the two previously distant dimensions. One of the direct survivors is Gordon, and it is all up to him to use whatever resources or personnel he can find to end the catastrophe. In terms of storywriting, it is told entirely from one point of view, and unlike traditional storytelling games, cutscenes are replaced by absolute control of the player. With that in mind, Gordon can do anything not limited by the game mechanics, whether it is jumping on people during a conversation, cutting the dialogue short by running away or silencing them, or falling into mischief by pressing sensitive buttons or not following instructions. Gordon is a silent character, but he witnesses all of the events in person to know the entire situation. With that in mind plus his constantly being separated from his friendly team and battling horde after horde of aliens and (unsurprisingly for a science fiction) HECU soldiers trying to contain the accident just to travel from one side of the facility to the other and then into the mysterious Xen world alone to battle a mastermind that looks like an enormous hovering fetus, Gordon's internal emotions absolutely match those of the player, and that more often than not makes the player feel like a part of the game and sometimes makes the game more about the character's player than about Gordon or itself. The secondary characters, namely the scientists and Black Mesa security guards as the primary source of dialogue, tell Gordon intelligence as it is and with practical responses I would expect in real life, and the more focused but frequently appearing and more important G-Man with a strange and idiomic vocabulary and never fully revealing his personality or intentions gives rise to an endless series of countless fan or conspiracy theories that all imply that there is something mysterious and sinister in nature of the game that may never be fully explained.\n[b]+[/b] It is the next and advanced [i]Quake[/i] with regards to gameplay, and everything that makes a modern FPS what we know of today. It is fast, destructive, focused, witty, and hyperbolically gory, the \"focused\" part coming from how the story plays it safe and careful; instead of throwing in everything in haste, it is limited to only telling what Gordon witnessed throughout and voice-acting and scripting that anyone can definitely find parallel to the real life, whether it is inside a research facility or a crisis involving combat. The spirit of the game comes from using 14 weapons like pistols, a shotgun and a rifle, an RPG, grenades, mines, and energy cannons to shoot or explode enemies into dismembered fragments and making use of physics to solve puzzles. One of the weapons is the iconic crowbar, which I can simply use to break boxes or plenty of cylindrical metal containers with a few hits. Combat is anywhere from being on foot or airborne to underwater or on a ladder, and from tanks, helicopters, and soldiers with grenades and rifles or shotguns to any Xen creature, the shortsighted enemy's means of exploitation is a combination of their own weapons and unhesitant aggression. The level progression for a game with only one story much like a canon film or novel is ultimately linear of course, but the basic formula of the game is that every area has multiple ways to progress and the game always figuratively asks questions as about what choice to make and the layout of the levels. \"You did what you were supposed to do, but did you know you can also do this or this instead?\" \"Did you find any secret or near-secret areas like the one [here]?\" \"Did you forget to do anything mischievous or bizarre?\" \"Did you know you can skip [what you are supposed to do] to progress?\" \"And most importantly, how will you use your range of arsenal, and will you use them to save a friend who may then help you in return?\" With that in mind, it seems that every time I play [i]Half-Life[/i], I discover something I have not found before, like a near-secret area or a G-Man sighting. It is physically fun as a [i]Super Mario[/i] game, where players shoot through breakable vents and get to interact with props in whatever way possible, and the jumping mechanics from controlled landings to long jumps are spot-on. Playing and transitioning from buildings to air ducts to outdoors to underwater is never enough.\n[b]+[/b] A staple feature of [i]Half-Life[/i] is the GoldSrc engine, which lead to perhaps the first game to feel like reading or watching a novel or a film. It deserves a spot in the history books of gaming, and the capabilities allowed numerous opportunities for events of scripted sequences and pathing, such as running into a \"trigger\" in an area of Black Mesa and causing a panicked scientist to attempt to escape as a means of story progression. It could play 16-bit sounds with digital effects for echoes or other distortions like footsteps and also had a strong sense of nVidia graphics with regards to the 32-bit graphics, the lighting, and a destructive atmosphere so immersive that I can almost breathe in the environment, and by \"destructive\", I mean that I can destroy almost any prop into bouncy debris and dismembered parts from trash cans, ordinary or flammable boxes and tables, and radios to aliens and HECU soldiers by using explosives or already beating up their corpses. Even more fun is interacting with some of the props like pushing boxes, and if you cannot find a key to unlock a gate or a door, turn to your weapons to generate loud bangs and booms or find a healing scientist or a combative security guard to unlock it because you never need a key anyway. As an advantage of being a PC game, [i]Half-Life[/i] is easily modifiable, and it has spawned some of the greatest mods on Earth due to the capabilities of the engine (remember [i]Counter-Strike[/i] and [i]Team Fortress Classic[/i]?). It is like a sandbox to an already powerful and playable game with occasional updates.\n[b]+[/b] Also important is that Valve did not forget multiplayer. It seems that networked multiplayer had been a trend among first-person shooters since id Software's [i]Doom[/i], and Valve managed to integrate the mode in this game very well. The only main game mode is Deathmatch, but that is better than nothing, and mods may help.\n[b]-[/b] Though versatile, the artificial intelligence seems a little too easy to exploit, and in unrealistic ways for a dark story. Running too fast often causes scientists and security guards running on the player's side to lose track and fail to follow, and I find it annoying having to go back to locate them. The enemies on the other hand are limited in two ways. One: the pathing has it where they can go anywhere as long as the two waypoints are on the same floor or platform without any obstructions and they do not really climb ladders or jump from platform to platform (except of course one type when the player stands too close), and two: enemies take more than hearing guns or explosives around corners, seeing their friend in danger without seeing their enemy, and even receiving damage from a hiding attacker to respond and take action. All of this makes the game a little less challenging in an unrealistic way than it should be. At least the scripting helps, and there is some exploitation, or this game would have been hard on easy and nightmare on hard.\n\n[b]CONCLUSION:[/b] With a powerful 1998 engine and cinematic storytelling, [i]Half-Life[/i] is the landmark of modern FPS games and everything a modern FPS needs to be.\n\n[b]96%[/b]","timestamp_created":1505180317,"timestamp_updated":1539552935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34892850","author":{"steamid":"76561198001779896","num_games_owned":1377,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":47,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1505177012},"language":"english","review":"I remember having played the original version of [i]Half-Life[/i] during my [i]Quake[/i] and [i]Duke Nukem 3D[/i] phase.
