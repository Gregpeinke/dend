It’s an absolute gem of a game, albeit a little short - I’m very slow but it only took me 14 hours to complete on the first run. But no matter, it felt perfectly paced; not [i]too[/i] short.\n\nIt just gets better and better and more fun the more you progress. The pièce de résistance is the portal mechanics. Once you get the hang of how this works, particularly how to increase your path trajectory, it blows your mind as to the various possibilities for moving around. A bonus for me was that I didn’t need any walkthrough cheats (I usually need one or two in most games). All the puzzles will submit to logic if you can open your mind far enough.   I hope Portal 2 is as good – I bought both in a cheap bundle.  10/10 recommended.

Now over 10 years old, the game has aged remarkably well. Despite my familiarity with the game, its slogans, and a part of its storyline, I actually had never played it before. I started it, finished it in two sittings, and quickly realized why it has long been so well liked. It is simply an amazing game. If you've gone this long without any spoilers to the game, I won't be the one to give anything away, so I'll keep this vague. You play a character that is inside Aperture Science Laboratories and you progress through increasingly difficult levels and solve the puzzles that each level has. Though this sounds simple, the game has great storyline, amazing voice acting, and a great atmosphere. It is immersive and easy to get caught up in the world. Though not really a scary game, simply due to some moments with stellar atmosphere and/or voice acting, there was more than once that I got genuinely creeped out. The puzzles are perfectly balanced between being accomplishable and being challenging. The ending is perfect and left me pleasantly surprised. Plus, the graphics are great for the game’s age. Don't be like me: stop procrastinating and waiting for the right time to get this game, just play it!!
