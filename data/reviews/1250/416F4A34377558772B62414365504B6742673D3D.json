The gameplay.\n\nThis is not a game that's worth much conversation so I'll make this review short- It's an easy pick up and play shooter. The rank and experience awards give the game some much needed feelings of variance, depth, and longevity as the awards come at a slow and methodic pace, making you feel as though you earned every reward, and the rewards are enough to shake up gameplay to your favor enough to make the game feel like a variable of itself and the rewards become a ddicting to get. Because of this, you will want to play multiple sessions over and over again despite that the gameplay should feel repetitive; but thankfully it never does.\n\nI haven't played this game in a while, but I guarantee I could get back on and be just as good as I last played thanks to the simplicity and substance this game has. It's a game you'll never forget how to play, but it will still be difficult to master, offering a veteran player not only the motivation, but the opportunity to play again without feeling a sense of loss, and re-treading old ground.","timestamp_created":1309798907,"timestamp_updated":1514843783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3720035","author":{"steamid":"76561198026553826","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":3122,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3084,"last_played":1378961202},"language":"english","review":"It's fun to play with friends who don't suck or to play with randoms named Rada who can't hit anything, take all the ammo, and then say 'u mad bro' when you start laughing at him.","timestamp_created":1309798150,"timestamp_updated":1309798150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2498590","author":{"steamid":"76561198008317733","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":31708,"playtime_last_two_weeks":280,"playtime_at_review":22922,"last_played":1659957052},"language":"english","review":"A class based \"zombie\" killing game.\nTechnically theyarent zombies more genetically engineered freaks.\nEach class you pick has certain perks/ weapon discounts which level up as you do.\nGood saml team based fps action with a team of up to 6.\n\nGore factor ++++\nWeapons are varied from the conventional SA80, AK47 flame thrower chainsaw and pipebombs.\n\nEvery now and again an event will happen such as the current one which gives special acheivement and skins.\n\nA great game\n","timestamp_created":1309798091,"timestamp_updated":1309798091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3516455","author":{"steamid":"76561198024049666","num_games_owned":990,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1369,"last_played":1423007165},"language":"english","review":"Fun Multiplayer game.
