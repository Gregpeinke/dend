Half-Life Source is a half-measure that updates a few things but leaves the game largely untouched, so you have blocky 1998 character models and props with super realistic smoke and water effects and the result is just incongruous. The updated light and shadows sounds like a good idea on paper, but given how blocky and angular the models and rooms are the shadows make everything look way more stark and overly dark. The added ragdoll physics is neat, but you can't gib enemies with the crowbar anymore which is small, but it's always been a part of the fun of the original, More seriously, there are lots of random bugs that weren't present in the orignal, so even if you like the meager visual updates, this is still worse.","timestamp_created":1617107365,"timestamp_updated":1617107365,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89357491","author":{"steamid":"76561198837234544","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":412,"last_played":1617091411},"language":"polish","review":"Gra ma dużo bugów z każdymi update Source Engine, doktorek lewituje lub dużo błyszczących propów, ale ogólem spoko","timestamp_created":1617090405,"timestamp_updated":1617090405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89334122","author":{"steamid":"76561198217233821","num_games_owned":359,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":6164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6164,"last_played":1617049369},"language":"english","review":"If you want to play this game get the original GoldSrc version, this port is just terrible, bugs everywhere...

Every texture has a gross chrome shine to it, the lighting is inconsistent, looking better in some places and worse in others. Gordon moves slightly faster and jumps slightly higher, making certain segments (like the cliff where the funny valve song plays) more difficult. The enemy AI is atrocious. Houndeyes and the HECU were especially butchered. Barnacle tongues don't render properly, so I got grabbed more often, thinking nothing was there. The tentacle monsters in Blast Pit, Surface Tension, and Interloper are all perfectly harmless, making their segments boring. The skyboxes are broken on certain chapters, most notably outside the warehouse in Surface Tension. Residue Processing is borderline unplayable because of all the visual glitches blocking your view. It's a crime that this game costs as much as the original.

Valve veröffentlichte nach der Deindizierung die ungeschnittene Fassung in Deutschland auf Steam. \n\nHalf-Life: Source ist eine digital neu überarbeitete Version des überaus erfolgreichen PC-Spiels. Dank der Source-Technologie konnten Physiksimulation, verbesserte Effekte und vieles mehr integriert werden. im Grunde genommen ist es das gleiche Game wie das Orginal nur halt aufgehübscht. \n\nObwohl Half-Life technisch auf einer typischen Ego-Shooter-Engine aufbaute, setzte das Spiel durch die Hinzunahme von Elementen aus den Genres Adventure und Jump ’n’ Run Maßstäbe. Beispielsweise muss du in vielen Situationen mit Geschick Hindernisse wie Stromkabel, Ventilatoren, tiefe Abgründe oder giftige Abwässer überwinden. In anderen Spielszenen müssen beispielsweise verschiebbare Kisten richtig positioniert werden, um auf höhergelegene Positionen zu gelangen oder die Auslöser von Haftminen zu umgehen. Das Spiel umfasst auch computergesteuerte Figuren in der Rolle von Wachleuten und Wissenschaftlern, die für den Fortschritt des spiels notwendig sind (beispielsweise durch das Öffnen von Türen) oder dem Spieler durch Feuerkraft oder medizinische Unterstützung helfen.\n\nDu übernimmst die Rolle von Gordon Freeman, eines MIT-Physikers, welcher in einer fiktiven, zum Forschungskomplex ausgebauten Raketentestbasis namens Black Mesa, in der Abgeschiedenheit der Wüste des US-Bundesstaates New Mexico streng geheime Forschungsarbeit betreibt. Als ein Experiment zur Erschließung einer neuen Energiequelle mit Kristallen außerirdischer Herkunft misslingt, wird die Forschungseinrichtung mit Dimensionstoren von einer Parallelwelt überflutet. Gordon Freeman sieht sich nicht nur mit Horden fremdartiger Kreaturen aus einer anderen Welt konfrontiert, sondern auch mit U.S. Marines, die den Auftrag haben, jeden zu beseitigen, der das Gelände verlassen will. Da die Marines nicht in der Lage sind, diese Situation zu meistern, wird das Black-Ops-Spezialkommando nachgeschickt. Dessen Befehle lauten, in Black Mesa ausnahmslos alles Lebendige auszulöschen. Das Spiel wird vorwiegend unter Zuhilfenahme von realen, aber auch fiktiven Waffen (wie etwa dem Gaußgewehr) gelöst. Immer wieder begegnet Freeman auf seinem Weg aus Black Mesa dem mysteriösen G-Man, einem Unbekannten, der Freeman anscheinend prüfen will und ihm am Ende des Spiels einen Job anbietet.\nGlas klare Empfehlung.
