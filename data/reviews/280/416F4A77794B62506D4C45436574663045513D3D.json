Valve took everything I loved about the original Half-Life: the excellent and capitivating story, the brilliant enemy AI, the polished gunplay, and the at times mind boggling puzzles, and shoved it into a slightly prettier package with sharper textures, not-so-HD models (that, while clearly not HD, look better than the original), cleaner particle effects, death ragdolls, and water that actually looks like water. I recommend this game to anyone who does not have the original, as it is the superior version. However, I can't recommend this game to anyone who does own the original unless they own Garry's Mod- since this game is in the Source engine, you can mount it in Gmod and use props and NPCS from the game. The only downside is you can't use original Half-Life mods like Half-Life Zombie Edition or Natural Selection, as they weren't designed for the Source engine.

The game never cuts away to cutscenes, instead having the story and events happening around you as you play. I miss when PFS games were like this. Health doesn't regenerate, you can carry every weapon at once, etc. But that may make the game feel strange to those raised on modern FPS games. But this game is still loads of fun today.
