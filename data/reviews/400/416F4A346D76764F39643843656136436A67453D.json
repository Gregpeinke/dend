Questo grazie ad elementi molto semplici come pulsanti che aprono porte; sfere di energia da trasportare in dei condotti che azionano passerelle; sfruttare le leggi fisiche conseguenti l'interazione coi portali, ecc.\nIl sistema di comando è quello degli fps e il gioco riprende pari-pari quello di Half Life 2 in tutti i controlli. Non ci sono armi, ma si possono tuttavia sollevare dei cubi da poter spostare a proprio piacimento. Non si possono ovviamente creare più di 2 portali: con il tasto sinistro e il tasto destro del mouse avremo a nostra disposizione due varchi elissoidei collegati, sufficienti a far passare la nostra persona e qualunque oggetto prendibile all'interno delle ben nitide e spoglie camere test. Si potrà, tuttavia, spostare i due capi del portale ogni volta che si desidera (ad eccezione delle prime camere test). Il giocatore potrà morire, ma non c'è una barra della vita. Cadere da grandi altezze non comporterà alcun danno, poichè il personaggio è dotato di degli stivali-protesi specificatamente concepiti per attuttire qualunque caduta (questo perché nel gioco si precipita in continuazione), tuttavia si morirà sul colpo se immersi nell'acqua sporca, se sfiorati dalle sfere di energia o se colpiti per troppo tempo in una volta dai droidi-sentinella. Si riinizierà dall'ultimo checkpoint auto-salvataggio. Le regole del gioco sono molto semplici, non c'è nient'altro da dire.\n\nChiaro e nitido è il gioco, tale e quale è l'ambientazione, quella che dalle prime frasi viene dichiarata implicitamente come una sorta di centro benessere chiamato \"Aperture Science\". Pareti bianche, totale assenza di mobilio o qualsivoglia elemento superfluo, si avanzerà in dei claustrofobici e futuristici assetti totalmente sterilizzati e lievemente opprimenti nella loro compostezza essenziale.\nPer tutto il corso delle camere test è totalmente assente qualunque forma di vita e ci terrà compagnia una voce campionata robotica fuori campo che, con formale cordialità, ci \nguiderà in modo sintetico spiegandoci le funzionalità dei test.\nTutt'altro che invadente, la voce femminile campionata (Ellen McLain, prezzemolina della Valve) è la vera e propria anima di Portal e costituisce il fulcro su cui ruota la storia, scritta da Erik Wolpaw con i toni di una commedia grottesca, un dramma auto-ironico di una rara leggerezza, lineare e semplice ma molto evocativo. Questo anche grazie ad un'eccellente regia, d'altro canto uno dei punti di forza degli Half Life. Non ci sono cutscene e interruzioni temporali o spaziali, salvo gli ascensori tra le camere test che possono implicare dei caricamenti. Ogni cosa è vissuta e raccontata dal mero percorso.\n\nGraficamente il gioco è pulito, ma appare come una sostanziale mod di Half Life 2 in tutti gli elementi. Texture, suoni e persino alcuni modelli ambientali sono ripresi e appiccicati. Frutto di una politica di risparmio però tutto sommato abbastanza ponderata. La fisica è la stessa, ma è debitamente rielaborata per tutto ciò che concerne i portali.\n\nIl game design è squisito. Tuttavia la difficoltà degli enigmi è relativa all'adattamento mentale del giocatore, dal momento che si basa praticamente solo sullo schema logico intrinseco delle limitazioni e delle cause-effetto dei portali. Un po' come un gioco di parole: una volta afferrato il trucco, il resto è automatico. Ma non è detto che il nostro cervello si adatti. Una cosa è certa: se si ha già giocato il secondo capitolo, questo primo gioco risulterà di una banalità sconcertante. È infatti indispensabile giocare Portal 2 a seguito del primo capitolo non solo per la cronologia della storia, ma principalmente perché lo schema di gioco è una diretta conseguenza e rielabora, approfondisce e complica lo scheletro del suo capostipite. Purtroppo, ciò è anche legato alla durata del gioco: una media di 3 ore. 6 ore per i giocatori che prendono tempo. In velocità si può finire in un'ora. Questo però comporta che le prime 10 camere test, su 19 test totali, siano solo dei tutorial.\n\nAl di là di questo, non trovo personalmente legittima nessuna critica. Può piacere o può non piacere il genere ma Portal è e rimane, anche a mio parere, un capolavoro. Pronto anche ad essere rigiocato con piacere finchè non lo si conosce a memoria. Si merita il suo successo.","timestamp_created":1511522555,"timestamp_updated":1511529526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37311831","author":{"steamid":"76561198245794018","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1502717387},"language":"brazilian","review":"Ótimo jogo.","timestamp_created":1511522513,"timestamp_updated":1511522513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37306781","author":{"steamid":"76561198027001619","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1580554274},"language":"english","review":"For science","timestamp_created":1511520467,"timestamp_updated":1511520467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37306379","author":{"steamid":"76561198421204216","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":104,"last_played":1530198400},"language":"schinese","review":"虽然有点年头了，但还是很有意思的解密游戏，我就看不得摄像头，你拿我怎样","timestamp_created":1511520302,"timestamp_updated":1511520302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37305956","author":{"steamid":"76561198314109615","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":752,"last_played":1541865758},"language":"russian","review":"Класс","timestamp_created":1511520134,"timestamp_updated":1511520134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37303679","author":{"steamid":"76561198237832420","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":52,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1511871040},"language":"english","review":"Mind Blown.

is another Grade-A game by the boys at Valve, but is it as god-like as people say.\n\n[b]The Positives[/b]\n\n- Very original concept.\n\n- Totaly unique game mechanic.\n\n- Graphics IMO hold up better than some of the other older Source games like CSS or DoD: Source. Play with HDR enabled for the full effect, the lighting is amazing.\n\n- A very subtle story that is not told really throught the main game but more through the many secrets hiding behild the pearly white walls of Apeture Science.\n\n- The game can get challenging, but not really in the unfair way, this game requires you to think things through and to take your time, it is a puzzle game after all.\n\n- For the most part the game has great pacing, there are only 1 or 2 spots in the game where I feel the game slows to a crawl or feels tedious.\n\n- The game is easy to pickup and play, and after your first or second playthrough you could easily breeze through the game like it was nothing.\n\n[b]The Negatives[/b]\n\n- After chamber 13, the game's difficulty spikes up unexpectingly, so for your first playthrough it can be a bit of a shock.\n\n- The last chapter in the game is a bit too long. They buildup the confrontation of GLados alot. And in the last chapter the puzzle are not really hard or too interesting. It kinda kills the pacing for me, I would not have a problem with the game slowing down a bit at the end to build hype, but that blends into my next issue.\n\n- The battle with Glados is not hard at all. The payoff for all the stuff you went through is lackluster. Here is how the battle goes. Hit Glados with a rocket, knock off core, grab it, put it in a cremator. Rinse and repeat 3 times and you win.  I'm not saying Glados is not an interesting villian, i'm just saying that the fight against it is kinda bad.\n\n- The length of the game is a bit too short. 19 chambers, a chapter dedicated to escaping the test chambers, and a final fight with Glados. That is all you get for the campaign. Even for a first timer like me it will take anywhere from 3-4 hours to beat the game. There is a time attack mode, and some advanced courses, but I will be generous and say they will add another 5 hours of gameplay. You have at the most about 10-11 hours of gameplay. Pitiful for a Valve title.\n\n- The game does not have too much replay value. I bet by your 3rd playthrough you will know each chamber like the back of your hand, and you could plow through the game.\n\n- Screw chamber 19, that is the only unfair hard part of the game for me.\n\n- Ganeraly I think the game is kinda bare bones once you look past the portal mechanics and the pretty aesthetic.\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\n\nOverall, I think I can look past some of the glaring flaws, because beyond the few blemishes the game is excellent. It is just a game I would not see myself playing again and again.\n\nI give Portal a very solid 8/10.","timestamp_created":1511489689,"timestamp_updated":1511489705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":48,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.785371840000152588","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37247538","author":{"steamid":"76561198123203711","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":287,"last_played":1559000164},"language":"spanish","review":"Amo este juego :$ Tienen que jugarlo :D","timestamp_created":1511489598,"timestamp_updated":1511489598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37246875","author":{"steamid":"76561198202505911","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1775,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1775,"last_played":1500034033},"language":"japanese","review":"短い作品ですが、余計な味付けが少なくて、\nシンプルにワープパズルゲーを楽しめる。\n\n途中、やきもきするコースもあるでしょうが、\nやり終えてみると、中々いい思い出をくれるゲームです\n\n実績解除も、ちょうど良い歯ごたえで良いです。\n全部やるとPortalの作りこまれた世界を十分味わえます。","timestamp_created":1511489257,"timestamp_updated":1511489257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37246683","author":{"steamid":"76561198280099258","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":260,"last_played":1499642450},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bom, otimos puzzles, referencias e jogabilidade apesar da \"idade\" dele.
