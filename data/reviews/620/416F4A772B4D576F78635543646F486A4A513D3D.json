The gameplay is nearly flawless, and the idea is brilliant. But first let me addresss everything the naysayers about this game say. 1: Predictable storyline. Hmmmmmmmmmmm I would agree with you there... except you didn't play the whole game. Seriously, almost everyone who says this has not played the whole game. And for the few who did, you clearly did not watch your surroundings enough. The point of the story was to make you want to play more, and it certainly did well on that note. 2: Not very hard. Again, play the whole game first. True, the game was not THAT hard, but I cannot think of a  puzzle game that executes the gameplay as well as portal does. While the game itself was not terribly hard, the community has certainly made some head scratching test chambers that will make you want to eat your own words. 3: Crashes. The game does not crash anymore (except on windows 8 so far) so ignore those reviewers who say that because their review is now irrelevent. \nFinal score 9/10","timestamp_created":1398216822,"timestamp_updated":1398216822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9905258","author":{"steamid":"76561198116281442","num_games_owned":312,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":656,"last_played":1610761518},"language":"english","review":"I bought this game today on Steam.

Aperture Laboratories tests humans capability to endure physical puzzles while using a portal gun that will allow you to create portals, 2 portals to be accurate. When you are far into the game you are being supervised by GLaDOS who is a incredible piece of artifical intelligance, GLaDOS is not very friendly too you because you killed her in Portal 1, not to worry though because you have a little robotic friend named Wheatly to help you along the way.
