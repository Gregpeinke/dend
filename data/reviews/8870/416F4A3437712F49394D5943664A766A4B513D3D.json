Красиво, атмосферно, и... скучно. Несмотря на якобы открытые пространства, игра гонит нас по узким коридорам, с которых никуда не свернуть. И если в подводном городе предыдущих частей это воспринималось как естественное и обоснованное ограничение(всё же город под водой), то среди облачных  высей небесного города это реально бесит. Введение воздушных трасс должно было разнообразить игру, увеличив количество измерений, в которых перемещается игрок, но этого не случилось. Спрыгивать можно только в отдельных, заранее определённых точках, а от попыток в полёте разглядеть цели, которые палят(и попадают) в тебя с огромного расстояния болят глаза. Твой выбор, несмотря на жалкие попытки разработчиков сделать сюжет более-менее ролеплейным, ни на что не влияет - рельсы и ещё раз рельсы. Спойлерить о концовке не буду, расскажу только свои главные ощущения: удивление и разочарование. Хотел бы сказать больше, но для этого придётся спойлерить, а я не хочу портить игру, тем, кто все-таки решится её купить.

Nach dem man diese befreit hat wir man von allen verfügbaren Kräften gejagt und als der \"falsche Hirte\" im neuen Eden propagandiert. \n\nWirklich sehr schön gemachte Story mit einer ausgesprochen interessanten Atmosphäre. Ich will nicht Spoilern, aber ich kann dieses Spiel nur empfehlen. \n\nViel Action, Geballere, Blut, Spezialkräfte um Gegner Platt zu machen. Verschiedenste Waffen die man durch (im Spiel gefundenes) Geld optimieren kann. Viele Dialoge und eine sehr detailreiche und liebevoll Gestaltete Welt. Humor, Ernsthaftigkeit, eine schöne Entwicklung der Charaktere... das Spiel hat einfach alles was man sich wünscht. \n\nIch persönlich halte nicht viel von Ego-Shootern, die sich darin versuchen eine Story unterzubringen, da diese meist nur Nebensache ist... hier hat man aber einen shooterlastigen Singleplayer mit viel Geschichte die einen wirklich fesselt und die ein offenes Ende hat, welches einen zum Nachdenken anregt.\n\nDie 8 Stunden Spielzeit habe ich am Stück durchgejagt.

Pun intended.\nBeautiful visuals(even though my graphics card is shite), gameplay-wise is fun, FPS shooter with a \"twist\" and story-wise is one of the best you'll ever play, ever. \nGame lead and writers are geniuses, never seen a story that had so many plot holes and just when you couldn't understand anything anymore, they introduce a huge plot twist at the end that actually reveals that you are not human and you are a chicken. Yes. A chicken that plays videogames.
