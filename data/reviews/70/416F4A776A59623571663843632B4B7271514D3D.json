I wanted to see how good it compares backwards rather than forwards to see if it offered a more unique perspective on the game\n\nHonestly this game is great, I can see how it became such an industry changing title the second it released.\n\nHowever, Black Mesa is just a better game. Before any pitchforks get raised at me, let me just explain that Black Mesa spent years in development, finely recreating every single part of this game into a wholly optimised experience. Black Mesa also had 2020 technology to build its game on, and this game didn't even have 2000 tech. Half-Life 1 just cannot compete with Black Mesa, and tbh that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's amazing that we got two great games out of this, but when it comes to which one someone should play, honestly I'd say Black Mesa. \n\nThe only reason I recommend Half-Life is that if you want to see just how important this game was, keeping in mind this is a game from 1998, absolutely DO play this game. It IS worth your time. But if you just want to play a fun game and have a good time, while you can find that here, you'd have a better time in Black Mesa.\n\nEdit: Also I played the whole game on hard difficulty. Turns out the game isn't all that hard, people probably just suck. Pro-tip: Use more than one weapon. Don't be afraid to use the magnum even though you really like your SMG/M4.","timestamp_created":1646653173,"timestamp_updated":1646653579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111734702","author":{"steamid":"76561198856558954","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1646720620},"language":"english","review":"This game is a classic!

In this context, it's a fantastic game, and at its core, it still holds up as a fun game, instead of a mere historical curiosity. However, as many transitory pieces of art which redefine genre conventions, many of its aspects, both design and technical, have dated as well as milk, making it a quite frustrating experience.\n\n7/10\n\n\nThe good:\n\nOne of the innovations that Half Life brought to the table was its commitment to seamless storytelling and realism. Its levels flowed into one another without interruptions, and without ever taking control away from the player. All the story was conveyed through character dialogue and scripted events, never using non interactive cutscenes. It basically took the complete opposite approach to storytelling to Metal Gear Solid, a game from the same year. The entire game is viewed through one seamless take from a single camera, Gordon Freeman's POV. This is something that games boast and market themselves on, like 2018's God of War, and yet Half Life did it very effectively 20 years prior. It's very immersive, and it helps the player really inhabit the character, who is appropriately enough of a blank slate, for players to express themselves freely through him. Black Mesa is a very interesting environment, being realistic enough to be believable but fantastical enough to allow for clever and versatile level design. There's also a surprising number of memorable, distinct environments, given that most of the game takes place in a single location. The pacing is very good, switching between exploration and resource gathering, to combat, and to light puzzling often, without it becoming tiring. The enemy AI is very sophisticated for the time, and holds up fantastically to this day. The human soldiers are especially impressive through their use of squad tactics, and grenades. Gordon's weapons arsenal, while not the most balanced (the assault rifle is pretty OP), is quite satisfying to use, and allows many different approaches to each situation.\n\nThe meh:\n\nThe game's commitment to realism also translates to its level design in a very impressive way, but it also creates problems. Often, the way forward is not communicated very well to the player, and I stumbled around a lot looking for how to progress, often relying on a walkthrough. This obtuseness however, can simultaneously be rewarding. Thinking of the environment in imaginative ways is the name of the game, and it can be surprising to see what the game expects you to do to progress. I found myself thinking that I had found an exploit, or a bug, only to realize that I was following the intended path all along. In a way it reminded me of my first experience with Super Metroid, or the final stretch of Portal. Fantastic highs, and super frustrating lows. Some enemy attacks, especially those with hitscan weapons, are pretty cheap as they deal massive damage very quickly. While that adds frustration, it also helps put the player in Freeman's shoes. He is up against an alien invasion, and an entire army, of course it's not a fair fight. You have to survive using your wits, employing on the fly guerrilla tactics, and your luck. Also, the game's mysterious unresolved ending can be quite underwhelming, or add to the game's vibe, depending on the player's engagement with the story, and the subtext about the hubris of mad science. \n\n\nThe bad:\n\nMy frustrations with Half Life are mostly centered around one thing. Platforming. The game designers lean heavily into platforming segments during exploration, which the controls simply aren't built for. Gordon Freeman runs too fast and has a sense of momentum in controlling him, which combined with the first person view makes for a very janky and imprecise platforming experience. This is further exacerbated in the game's final stretch [spoiler] in Zen, where platforming is emphasized even more, with the addition of space gravity and a long jump ability. During the final boss, I often found myself jumping into the air only to find myself dying from the fall damage. [/spoiler] Also, climbing ladders in this, and other Valve games, is straight up garbage. Other than that, the bosses are pretty bad, either being complete pushovers or frustrating as hell. Finally, the most surprising thing about the game that annoyed me, were the bugs. From getting stuck on terrain while crouching, to broken scripted events, to audio and music tracks stopping abruptly, there was a significant number of times where I had to load a previous save to restore the game to working order. Considering that this is Valve's first game, and one of the hallmarks of PC gaming history, and that it's on Valve's own platform, where it has been patched multiple times over the years, this is unacceptable.","timestamp_created":1646600617,"timestamp_updated":1646600617,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111703675","author":{"steamid":"76561198165991670","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1655920688},"language":"norwegian","review":"Yes, Story and online mode are fun af","timestamp_created":1646599898,"timestamp_updated":1646599898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111699643","author":{"steamid":"76561199249424465","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1649275447},"language":"english","review":"v good game","timestamp_created":1646595631,"timestamp_updated":1646595631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111698199","author":{"steamid":"76561198950773252","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":152,"playtime_at_review":1854,"last_played":1660537034},"language":"english","review":"hahfflf life","timestamp_created":1646594160,"timestamp_updated":1646594160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111693947","author":{"steamid":"76561199052216802","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":187,"playtime_at_review":1172,"last_played":1660488715},"language":"english","review":"worst game if'e played in a while \nthe graphics are amazing \nbut the gameplay is monoton and unbalanced.\nwhile i had no problems with bugs or chrashes\n the movement was to slow and the guns were poorly animated\nand my casserole got ruined while i played so 0/10","timestamp_created":1646590024,"timestamp_updated":1646590024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111688392","author":{"steamid":"76561198263125190","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":471,"last_played":1646581520},"language":"russian","review":"\"ЭТО ЗНАТЬ НАДО, если ты учился в шестом училище.
