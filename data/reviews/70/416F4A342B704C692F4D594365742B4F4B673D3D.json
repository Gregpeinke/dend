A história de Half Life me fascina.\nNesse jogo, assume-se o papel de Gordon Freeman, um cientista com Ph.D em Física Teórica que trabalha no laboratório Black Mesa. Gordon é encarregado da manipulação de um cristal desconhecido em um experimento no setor de materiais anômalos. Durante o experimento ocorrem várias explosões e vários portais são abertos em diversos locais do complexo Black Mesa. Os portais acabam trazendo criaturas estranhas que vão acatando as pessoas e promovendo o caos no complexo. Gordon faz uso de diversas armas, adquiridas no decorrer do jogo, e da sua HEV Suit para tentar escapar do complexo. Além de ter que lutar contra as criaturas dos portais, ele ainda enfrenta soldados e agentes enviados para eliminar quaisquer evidências do incidente.\nEm determinado momento, Gordon encontra alguns cientistas que o convencem a ser teletransportado para Xen, local distante no espaço de onde estariam vindo as criaturas pelos portais. Eles altertam Gordon que algo (Nihilanth) em Xen estaria mantendo os portais abertos e precisava ser eliminado. Gordon vai a Xen e acaba por derrotar Nihilanth.\nO jogo termina com Gordon sendo teletransportado para um elevador e ficando frente a frente com um cara de terno e com uma maleta na mão (Gman). Gman fala muitas coisas confusas mas deixa entender que está no controle dos acontecimentos e que estaria contente com os serviços de Gordon e gostaria de contratá-lo.\nRecomendo assistirem no youtube as traduções dos diálogos e resumos da história de Half Life para compreensão do game, especialmente discursso de Gman no final do jogo.\nJogar Half Life é o mínimo que um gamer que deseja conhecer a franquia deve fazer. Em Half Life temos o acidente em Black Mesa, o maior acontecimento da história da franquia, praticamente tudo no enredo está direta ou indiretamente ligado a este acontecimento.","timestamp_created":1405656022,"timestamp_updated":1407265173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637987792491912842","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11296502","author":{"steamid":"76561198059862122","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1281,"last_played":1641857498},"language":"english","review":"I really liked this game!!\nThe only 2 bad things I have to say is it was a little repetitive, and sometimes confusing/hard at some points.\nOtherwise a great game, and I can't wait to get into Half Life 2!!!\n","timestamp_created":1405644628,"timestamp_updated":1405644628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11296124","author":{"steamid":"76561198107782211","num_games_owned":363,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":2293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2292,"last_played":1531545622},"language":"english","review":"Its Fucking half life, what are you doing in the reviews!?\n\n10/10\nPros\n\nCreative, Fun\nGREAT NPCS\nawesome Story\nGood Voice Acting\nMade by valve\n\nYou may find this review unhelpful, because it doesnt contain a ot of info, but really with half life you just have to play it to get why I gave it the score it did, it is one of my favorite shooters and single player experiences ever.","timestamp_created":1405642203,"timestamp_updated":1448518123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11289693","author":{"steamid":"76561198028080098","num_games_owned":479,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":5667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5518,"last_played":1515049110},"language":"spanish","review":"HALF-LIFE, el primer juego de la empresa estadounidense [b]Valve[/b] y que creó una legión de fans, en el momento de su publicación en 1998 (más de 15 años ya), sorprendió a propios y extraños del género de los FPS, pues hasta aquel momento, ningún FPS había contado con una historia tan absorbente e intrigante como el juego que nos ocupa.\n\n[h1][b]HISTORIA[/b][/h1]\nLa acción del juego se desarrolla en el \"Black Mesa Research Facility\" (claro homenaje al ÁREA 51), donde se llevan a cabo todo tipo de experimentos, pero algo sale mal y de repente, las instalaciones de Black Mesa se ven asoladas por una invasión alienígena, entonces el gobierno de los E.E.U.U. decide enviar a los militares para acabar con dicha amenaza, e incluso silenciar a todo testigo de lo allí acontecido. Eres Gordon Freeman, un joven y prometedor científico asignado al equipo del experimento fallido, desde que este sale mal, te ves obligado a colaborar con los guardias de seguridad y otros científicos que encuentras por el camino, así como a luchar contra militares y todo tipo de aliens que han invadido BLACK MESA para sobrevivir. \n\n[h1][b]DESARROLLO[/b][/h1]\nEn [b]Half-Life[/b] la dificultad va aumentando de forma gradual, sin desesperar en ningún momento, pero no es un juego fácil y si queréis un reto de verdad, probar a jugarlo en el mayor nivel de dificultad la segunda vez que lo juguéis, este es un FPS de la vieja escuela de finales de los 90, eso quiere decir que no hay coberturas desde las que matar a todo enemigo que aparezca en la pantalla, si os quedáis agazapados, los enemigos irán a por vosotros y no duraréis ni un suspiro.\n\n[h1][b]MOTOR GRÁFICO / DISEÑO ARTÍSTICO[/b][/h1]\nHalf-Life hace uso del motor gráfico Goldsource, una versión personalizada de Valve del Quake engine, motor de ID Software. Aunque han pasado 15 años ya, el estilo gráfico del juego no decepciona a nadie, y es que con los años, Valve, ha ido dotando al motor del juego de nuevas características, como los modelos High Definition portados directamente de la versión Dreamcast, las texturas detalladas y la posibilidad de poder cargar contenido personalizado sin tener que sobrescribir los archivos originales del juego, un ejemplo de esto, lo podéis encontrar en mi guía para aplicar al juego texturas detalladas y modelos Ultra Definition, del MOD Half-Life GOLD y del grupo Trusty Crowbar respectivamente, lo que supone mejorar el juego a cuotas inimaginables, cuando salió el juego allá por 1998.\n\n[h1][b]LEGADO / MODS[/b][/h1]\nGearbox Software se encargó de portarlo a PS2 y a Dreamcast, así como de desarrollar las dos expansiones oficiales de PC, Opposing Force y Blue Shift, además de Decay, la tercera expansión oficial que salió junto a la versión de PS2 y portada a PC en 2008 por modders europeos.\n\nHalf-Life aún hoy en día, tiene una legión de modders increíble, que aún siguen creando MODs, modelos, música y más para este fantástico juego y sus expansiones, además, sin este juego, nunca habríamos conocido Counter Strike o Day of Defeat, actualmente son juegos oficiales de la compañía pero empezaron siendo MODs de Half-Life, u otros como Afraid of Monsters y tantos otros que hay que me resulta imposible enumerarlos todos en este análisis, un buen lugar para consultar/conseguir MODs para Half-Life, es la web [b]Mod DB[/b], donde podéis encontrar todo tipo de material.\n\n[h1][b]BANDA SONORA / SONIDOS FX[/b][/h1]\nLa música suena en los momentos adecuados, y eso en mi opinión, le otorga otro punto a su favor, pues los fantásticos efectos de sonido de enemigos, personajes secundarios, armas y demás, son suficientes para crear la ambientación necesaria en un juego de este tipo, cuando avancéis por un almacén y no oigáis nada de nada, estar atentos al más mínimo ruido, advertidos quedáis.\n\nDesde la implementación de [b]STEAM MUSIC,[/b] Valve regala la \"Banda Sonora Original\" del juego, el único requisito para obtenerla es tener el juego en vuestra biblioteca de Steam.\n\n[h1][b]COLECCIONABLES / EXTRAS / REJUGABILIDAD[/b][/h1]\nHalf-Life no tiene objetos que encontrar o salas ocultas como otros FPS contemporáneos, es acción pura y dura por doquier, en cuanto a su rejugabilidad, el mayor aliciente es terminar el juego en el mayor nivel de dificultad, todo un reto sólo apto para los maestros del género. \n\nOs recomiendo que primero juguéis con los gráficos originales o con los modelos High Definition y que después probéis los modelos Ultra Definition y texturas detalladas de mi guía, de este modo, apreciaréis mucho mejor todos los cambios realizados.\n\n[h1][b]VALORACIÓN FINAL[/b][/h1]\nUn FPS que no puede faltar en vuestra biblioteca de Steam, no sólo por ser el primer juego de Valve y uno de los mejores FPS de la década de los 90, su legado o su increíble legión de fans, simplemente tienes que tenerlo y jugarlo porque es uno de esos juegos que hoy en día están considerados como un \"IMPRESCINDIBLE\", tienes que tenerlo.\n\n[h1][b]NOTA: 10 sobre 10[/b][/h1]\n\n\n[h1][b]APORTACIONES DE RASKAIPIKA[/b][/h1]\nPara hacer mas satisfactoria vuestra experiencia con Half-Life, os dejo el enlace a las guías que he

But a few minor corrections added to the configs made me happy again. Probably there are Hi-Res textures somewhere on the internet to solve even the looks of it.","timestamp_created":1405336000,"timestamp_updated":1405341828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11229974","author":{"steamid":"76561198132154687","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1030,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":835,"last_played":1405284987},"language":"english","review":"A true masterpiece.

I highly recommend this game for ANYONE! Most modern gamers shy away from Half-Life because of it's 1998 graphics but if you look past that you'll find an amazing experience... You play as Gordon Freeman a scientist working at the Black Mesa facility when an experiment that you're a part of goes terribly wrong and opens up a portal linking Earth and Xen (Zen) from there on, hoardes of alien's invade the place and you're goal is SURVIVING... Game play wise it flows well and I don't have any complaints about the game play EXCEPT their is way to much jumping in this game... This is just a minor complaint I did love the parkour puzzles because they worked in the game flawlessly as you're traveling through the complex.... The parkour PUZZLES were fantastic but navigating through them proved to be a little difficult and taxing at times... But don't overlook this game because of this minor problem because you'll be missing out on an amazing game! I also like Half-Life because it had great interactive story telling... I mean, sure you could just ignore the scientist and fly right through the game but then you would miss out on the extraordinary experience which is really what Half-Life is all about (and be completly lost and confused by the end of it aswell)... Half-Life has a great beginning even though it is a little boring but I loved that first 20 minutes of strolling through the office and talking to you're co-scientist because it gets you involved with the game.... Half-Life has great narrative pacing which you just don't see in games anymore today..... I also loved Half-Life because the enviroments are so detailed... I have played Half-Life three times already and I still keep finding new room's and compartments in Black Mesa that have ammo and health packs in them.... But although the setting and events of the game are entirly fictional, the detail in first person shooter's had never felt so absorbingly real at the time that it was realised..... So we can blame it for every other thing done in the name of \"realism\" every since.... I'm talking about Call of Duty, Battlefield, and all the other shooter games that now control 80% of the freakin industry today.... Which I don't hate shooters but Half-Life used it for innovation in gaming, shooters today could care less about quality as long as they're stealing your money.... So just to recap Half-Life has an incredible interactive story, fantastic enviroments with impeccable details, and has suprises and jump scares that you won't see coming even if it is you're second or third time playing the game.... Half-Life is only $9.99 on Steam and if you haven't already played it YOU NEED TO! Even if you aren't in to FPS games and especially if you are.","timestamp_created":1404764304,"timestamp_updated":1434042704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11120307","author":{"steamid":"76561198112576693","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":130,"last_played":1437545552},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая","timestamp_created":1404753573,"timestamp_updated":1404753573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503597140312194824","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11114135","author":{"steamid":"76561198034574598","num_games_owned":348,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":403,"last_played":1574067317},"language":"english","review":"God of 3D FPS genre.

Und als wenn eine Alien-Invasion noch nicht genug des Übels wäre will die Regierung auch noch alles vertuschen und schickt Soldaten aus um die Anlage zu „säubern“.\nSo kann man Half Life in etwa zusammenfassen und die Umsetzung dieser Story konnte den Titel damals(1998) von den üblichen Ballerbuden-Shootern absetzen. Zwar gibt es viele Schießereien,dennoch sind auch Jump and Run Elemente vorhanden und es wollen einige Rätsel in der Black Mesa gelöst werden. Auch steht Freeman nicht gänzlich alleine da,seine Wissenschaftlerkollegen helfen ihm aus wo sie können,wenn man sie im Gegenzug beschützt. Das Sicherheitspersonal der Black Mesa hingegen unterstützt Freeman auch im Kampf ,jedoch sind sie mit ihren Pistolen recht unterbewaffnet. Glücklicherweise findet Freeman im Laufe des Spiels genügend Waffen,die das Überleben erleichtern vom Brecheisen über Militärarsenal bis hin zu Energie- und Alienwaffen.\nDie Geschichte von Half Life läuft komplett ohne Zwischensequenzen ab,man sieht die Welt also nur aus der Sicht von Gordon Freeman. Sein Aussehen wird zwar preisgegeben, jedoch bleibt Freeman während des gesamten Spieles stumm damit der Spieler sich besser mit dem Protagonisten identifizieren kann.\nBemerkenswert ist die Modding-Community von Half Life,so das man auch nach dem Beenden des Hauptspiels mit Mods wie beispielsweise Neil Manke's „They Hunger“ noch lange Spaß mit dem Titel haben kann. Desweiteren ist Half Life der Urvater von Mods wie Team Fortress und Counter-Strike die auch heute noch(wenn auch inzwischen als eigenständige Spiele)existieren.\n\nIn der deutschen Version darf nicht auf Menschen geschossen werden. Hier zeigt Half Life auf kuriose Weise wie stark damals noch zensiert wurde bei Dingen die mittlerweile einfach nur schräg erscheinen. Wissenschaftler und Wachpersonal setzen sich bei Beschuss kopfschüttelnd auf den Boden und das Militär wurde durch „Regierungsroboter“ ersetzt.\nGlücklicherweise gibt es eine Möglichkeit,diese Änderungen rückgängig zu machen. Wer die „unmodifizierte“ Version spielen möchte, der sollte sich diesen Guide mal näher anschauen.

I'm pretty sure I'm not the first to say that, but it really feels like one. Many things in this game make it what it is. First, the gameplay in this game is just marvelous, you can't feel closer to the game with its amazing mechanisms, shooting, jumping and everything you can do, it just feels right. It seems like it's really you that controls the game and that the final result, good or bad, is always the product of your moves. With great shooting and movement mechanisms, everything feels right.\n\nSecondly, another thing you can't complain about this game: its story. The story of Half-Life, the one that gave birth to this amazing franchise, is just a beautiful piece of work. It fully accomplishes its mission to take you to another world. With the fact that, Gordon Freeman, the character which you control, is entirely in your possession feels like you are in this story and you have the power to change it. The game doesn't even have cutscenes so everything is seen from your point of view. The story is captivating; it treats the alien subject differently from most stories told on this subject. It contains a government trying to hide the alien-incident, a mysterious G-Man (the man who always watches you) and a chaotic man vs alien battlefield. Maybe after all, they're not what we thought... So many questions will fly around your head and will give you the desire to continue this mysterious story.\n\nThirdly, I have to talk about the graphics and the level design. Those both, like everything I said before, are just truly great. While the graphics may be considered \"ugly\" or \"old\", they are for me still beautiful even if this game is from 1998. The game has great details, textures and colors. Just imagine how it felt back in the days. For the level design, nothing as changed. What I mean by that, is even after more than a decade, the levels are still pure genius and are so well used that you need to think and to familiarize with them so you can use them as your advantage. I have to tell you that this game isn't like most of the games today and is longer, which is really nice, because you'll want this game to never end. There is also a multiplayer mode which can be fun, but, as you guessed it, is mostly dead. \n\nFrom a negative point of view, I don't have a lot to say. For the people that won't like the graphics, you can always buy the Black Mesa game, which is the same thing, but updated for the new generations (or old time fans). All I can say in the end, is that this game is a must!","timestamp_created":1404401938,"timestamp_updated":1479943730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11050566","author":{"steamid":"76561198108226639","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":541,"last_played":1481390084},"language":"brazilian","review":"Sem comentários sobre este incrível jogo, só compre você não vai se arrepender, HALF-LIFE um dos melhores FPS do mundo.","timestamp_created":1404398552,"timestamp_updated":1578973633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11049933","author":{"steamid":"76561198070256423","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":400,"last_played":1501335562},"language":"english","review":"The game is fun at first but then I gets really bloody hard and glitchy and then It's impossible.

Now, when I start playing it, I felt that this game has alot of riches and opprtunities that everyone will enjoy and no wonder Half-Life 1 has over 50 Game of the Year Awards.\n\nFirst is for the pros, which this game has alot of them, the backstory and the characters behind the game are interesting, the gameplay is enjoyable and I have a good time with powerful weapons and the graphics are so breathtaking such as the canyon scene I saw, it was very unique and cool and for the planet Xen, I cannot believe that world was so out of place and drag me in behind the bizarre biological life that the aliens have. For the best part is that it doesn't feel the modern Call of Duty games such as Black Ops and Modern Warfare, its a different character as being a  scientist not a hardcore soldier that's how it is for this game, it's uniquely different and the Half-Life experience is totally out of this world.\n\nWell, its not perfect, there are a few minor mistakes behind the game, sometimes when I interact with certain people and ask them to follow, they would rather stay in place and lose me whether I go and I became frustrated for it wastes time for my progression in the game. So, these were minor problems that Valve will improve throughout the new versions of Half-Life.\n\nIn the end, I got to say that this game definitely worths my time and money and I can't wait to enjoy other Half-Life expansions such as Opposing Force and Blue Shift. Also for its sequel, Half-Life 2 and it's remaining episodes, 1-2.\n\nFor the scale from 1 to 10, I'll give it a 10/10.\n","timestamp_created":1404353898,"timestamp_updated":1404353898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11040250","author":{"steamid":"76561198050050838","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":918,"last_played":1528325699},"language":"english","review":"5/5 nice gramphics, gud story, instant klassic","timestamp_created":1404345817,"timestamp_updated":1404345817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+pLi/MYCet+OKg=="}
