One things for sure, the days of custom maps are over, and if you missed them, you'll never know how much you missed. Still, give this game a shot. I'm sure you just got it with a bundle, and yeah, mostly hardcore fans will be playing. That just shows their dedication to a game worth reviving, though even I got a little frustrated the last time I played.
