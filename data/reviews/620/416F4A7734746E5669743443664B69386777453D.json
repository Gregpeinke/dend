have to say the ending was the best part for me.\n\nI loved the realizations at the end of the first game, but story wise this one is far superior on the last page.\n\nOverall, another freaking fantastic Portal game. I can only dream of Portal 3 now...\n\nLot of insanely good voice talent in this game, so if you're a fan of movies/TV you'll be hearing a few familiar voices.\n\nStephen Merchant was a PERFECT CHOICE FOR THIS GAME.","timestamp_created":1503619463,"timestamp_updated":1503619463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34469863","author":{"steamid":"76561198211667331","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1345,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":441,"last_played":1548514595},"language":"turkish","review":"Portal 2..
