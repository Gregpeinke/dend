Up to 6 players in online co-op mode, or just you, on your own, playing the Solo mode. The aim - cleanse each area of zombies, in waves, until you get to the last one. The Big One. The Patriarch. Then exterminate him, too. Actually, they aren’t \"zombies\". They are the left-over \"specimens\" from a cheap and dirty government program to clone soldier-monsters. The basic ones will just munch on your arm and try to disembowel you. The bigger ones were the first ones they tried arming. Nothing much. Just a chainsaw or a blade for starters. They had just got on to the chain gun and rockets when the government tried to secretly shut down their secret program. But, in the typical way these things go, the program didn’t want to be shut down. The specimens got loose. No-one was left alive to turn off the specimen-cloning equipment. And now they are running amok. Well, some of them are running amok. Others are shambling amok or even jumping amok, but you get the idea. The police were sent in, but that wasn't even a challenge for the specimens. The first army units hadn't been warned what to expect. The screams of its got a bloody chainsaw!\" over the radios probably didn’t do much for morale, as whole units were chewed up. Quite literally, in some cases, of course. And now, there is just you. And a few friends. The few survivors from the first police and army units thrown in. Of course, you can’t tell anyone anything, because that would be a breach of the Official Secrets Act 1911, 1920, 1989. And that would be a disciplinary offense. So just get in there and do your bit for Queen and Country. Zombies. Lots of them. Big ones, little ones.

On a serious note though, this game is absolutely amazing especially given how old it is (or looks rather since the graphics are just a bit better than minecraft xd). I'd say it's comparable to L4D2 minus the insane amount of personal cool mods you can get (you can get them for this game too however it's a bit of a pain to get them to work, atleast for me) and well plus 2 extra players that can play alongside you.\n\nAND OFCOURSE THERE'S MORE. The amazing perk system, I can't even! It's what literally keeps me going, I don't know maybe I'm a sucker for these sort of levels, goals and achievements and such but it really makes it worth playing over and over and not just when you've got 5 other friends to play with (that is obviously in any case a huge plus) but you can actually just chill around in single player or with randoms over the community and have a nice time since almost 80% of the players you'll find are not trolls hell-bend on ruining your gameplay using any means necessary. (Unlike any co-op game that happens to be playable with randoms it seems)\n\nTo sum it up:\n\nGraphics: 5/10 (this is obviously in comparison to games of today but compare this to the time it was released and you'd get a much higher rating)\nStory: N/A (doesn't have any. There is however an objective mode which is somewhat close to the feeling of a story mode)\nCo-op: 10/10 (Yes, I can not ask for a better co-operative experience than this, or maybe I could but I won't be doing it)\nPay-to-win: Uh, sadly a few really [i]high end cool[/i] guns are DLC only which kinda sucks major testis but other than that there's nothing that anyone who has only purchased the base game can not get their hands on. Most of the stuff is just camo or another sort of variant of the same gun but that's just cosmetic and doesn't affect the gun's performance in anyway whatsoever and other than that there's characters and stuff which are obviously just for the extra lines and change of face I guess.\n\nThis game gets my ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) seal of approval.","timestamp_created":1466778320,"timestamp_updated":1466778320,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23756927","author":{"steamid":"76561198277556109","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1501423360},"language":"russian","review":"в ней можно играть с другом не понравилось то что нельзя сменить язык в игре на русский и играть в мультеплэере","timestamp_created":1466776820,"timestamp_updated":1466776820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23753922","author":{"steamid":"76561198210478307","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":363,"last_played":1496413100},"language":"english","review":"Im surprised for first time playing this game, \nVery enjoying this game","timestamp_created":1466770023,"timestamp_updated":1466770023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520873069763183594","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23749604","author":{"steamid":"76561198284362334","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":11712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2364,"last_played":1595794626},"language":"english","review":"Great co-op game, especially with 5 other people, it gets pretty crazy.

Bought like 2 weeks ago and have already 45 hours+ gameplay. It's fun to play in co-op and get all the achievements. It takes some time to get used to  maps and to know wich weapons you prefer. Still have a lot of hours to do before i get all perks on level 5 or 6. Doesn't get boring.","timestamp_created":1466395495,"timestamp_updated":1466395495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23658841","author":{"steamid":"76561198084552747","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":46018,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44464,"last_played":1429476538},"language":"english","review":"Still better than KF2","timestamp_created":1466370126,"timestamp_updated":1466370126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554046630859375","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23653677","author":{"steamid":"76561198311678124","num_games_owned":0,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1466351372},"language":"english","review":"nice game nice zombie nice human :D","timestamp_created":1466351545,"timestamp_updated":1466351545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23647532","author":{"steamid":"76561198041675662","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1443209908},"language":"russian","review":"1/10","timestamp_created":1466326536,"timestamp_updated":1466326536,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.404361635446548462","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23646278","author":{"steamid":"76561198066046954","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1632,"last_played":1466321504},"language":"english","review":"LOVE IT Better the 2nd one","timestamp_created":1466320564,"timestamp_updated":1466320564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23644493","author":{"steamid":"76561198073595604","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2856,"last_played":1536297840},"language":"english","review":"JUST FUCKING BUY IT ALREADY, ITS SO FUCKING GOOD.","timestamp_created":1466309072,"timestamp_updated":1466309072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499230355024337769","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23643372","author":{"steamid":"76561198060688035","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1466301879},"language":"brazilian","review":"Chera meus ovo.
