The main goal of the game is to work together with a team to kill a certain amount of zeds in each wave in order to get to wave 11 and kill the patriarch. Without working together with your team and forming a plan of some kind, you will die. That's one of the best things about Killing Floor, and one of the reasons why I love it so much. However this doesnt mean it's without its flaws.\n\nThere are 7 perks aka classes to choose from and they each play a specific role in your team. You'll level up after doing enough damage, getting headshots or killing a certain number of zeds. The higher you level up, the more benefits you recieve such as lower weapon costs and a starting weapon. However this isn't necessarily a good thing since it puts a big gap between newer players and the long time players. The perks themselves seperate Killing Floor from a bunch of other games since each one plays differently.\n\nGuns are a plenty in Killing Floor with around 7 or so weapons per perk (more with dlc). Each perk weapon is special with the amount of damage it does, how fast it shoots, and the reload speed. Each weapon also has a different sound effect which really gives each weapon a unique feeling to them as well as making some weapons really statisfying to kill zeds with. This doesn't mean that all weapons are good though, some are unbalanced and are either too costly for it's own good, or not being better than some of the higher end guns. The berzerker perk however doesn't feel as fleshed out as the others since you're basically slapping the zeds while trying not to get hit.\n\nAlong with the many different guns, maps, and perks this game offers, there's also many different zed types. In total there are 10 different zed types including the patriarch and each of them behaves differently. Because of this, some perks and the weapons they use work well against certain zeds, another thing that makes Killing Floor one of my favorites. However, this requires you to memorize different strategies to use for each of the zeds resulting in a slightly difficult learning curve for newer players. Although memorizing the paterns comes naturally to some people since the behaviors correlate with the sound cues they give, so it isn't too big an issue.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging fps game, you should definitely give this game a try. While Killing Floor 2 is already out and similar, the original Killing Floor feels like a different game entirely with different strategies than the second game. If you know anyone who plays Killing Floor, you should play with them as playing with friends makes this game much more enjoyable. You can usually find this game for under £7 during sales, or you can get it in the Digital Deluxe version of Killing Floor 2, but it suffers from a ton of bugs that ruin Killing Floor 2 (Microtransaction drops are bugged despite already being such a controversial feature, gg tripwire).\n\nPros:\n► 7 perks / class to choose from\n► Tons of weapons and maps\n► Weapons sound great and each kill is satisfying\n► Difficulty and zed count ramps up as more people join (teamwork is essential)\n► A nice and fitting soundtrack\n► Multiple types of zeds that behave differently\n► Hilarious british accents\n\nCons:\n► Unbalanced Weapons\n► Melee isn't fleshed out as it could've been (fitting pun)\n► There is an objective mode, but it only includes 3 official maps (you can however find some on the workshop)\n\nHit / Miss:\n► Learning curve requires you to memorized what works against each zed, which might ward off newer players\n► Somewhat slow start\n\nPersonal Rating:\nAvoid at all costs\nPick up during a sale\nWorth Playing\nMust Play","timestamp_created":1452691006,"timestamp_updated":1452691006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20503582","author":{"steamid":"76561198058794537","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1452688662},"language":"french","review":"Un bon defouloire contre les zombies mais aussi un bon jeu coop entre potes","timestamp_created":1452686239,"timestamp_updated":1452686239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20499346","author":{"steamid":"76561198263215673","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13461,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11258,"last_played":1458670419},"language":"koreana","review":"말이 필요한가.\n직접 플레이 해봐야만 중독성과 재미를 느끼는게임\n쓸대없는 DLC가 많다고 생각하지만 DLC머스켓은 일단 무조건 사고봐야하는 DLC이며\n드워프?!도끼로 좀비들을 날려버리는 쾌감은 이루 말할수없을 정도로 즐거움.\n오리지날을 추구하는 입장으로써 킬링플로어2는 아직 해보지 못했지만\n킬링플로어1을 충분히 즐겨본후 킬링플로어2를 구매해볼 예정\n항상 그래픽만 보고 게임을 결정하던 자신을 크게 반성하게 만드는 게임.","timestamp_created":1452657393,"timestamp_updated":1452657393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20499129","author":{"steamid":"76561198034177173","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":17974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13341,"last_played":1642045941},"language":"english","review":"Played on the Helm's Deep map with four friends.\n\nThe Patriarch shows up, we've already welded ourselves into the keep, and I've placed eight pipe bombs at the door.\nAfter a few minutes, without any Patriarch, I decided to go up to the door and see if I could hear anything.\n\n[b][u]\"ONE IN THE PIPE\"[/u][/b]\n\nSo, understandably, I screamed at the top of my lungs, for the door was about to blow open.\nExcept, rockets have splash damage, and at quite a large distance away, apparently...\n\nYou know those pipe bombs?

This is a horror survival team based game which uses tactical advancements into defeating the game. You need to work with each and every perk differently against every zed (the \"zombies\"). The perks are very dedicated to each role but yet not limited to it. As you play with each perk you progressively become stronger in its speciality.\n\nThe zeds all have different appearances, behaviours, personality and abilities. Every zed is a different type of threat against each and every perk. Some have resistance, some have cloaks, other simply grabs you. Some perks are easier to deal with some zeds etc.\n\nWeapon quality in this game is outstanding. Physics is old but good. But hey, it's from 2009. Sound could been better in terms of surround, it works, but it's not as strong as today's games. Support for mods is a plus. Amazing custom servers with so much flexibility. Some servers makes me think, \"I thought I'd seen everything\", but nope. If there is something to complain about at all (considering it's from 2009 and built upon Unreal Tournament 2004) it's the server management in terms of searching for servers. It can be laggy sometimes. Considering that's the only thing I can really complain about, it's a pretty darn good game.\n\nThere is no other game that offers the type of gameplay as Killing Floor do. It got all the good from all the corners. The core system does not resemble any one game at all. You got the perk system, you got the different zeds with personality, you got highly realistic weapons and it's heavily team based where tactics is the key, as introduced above.\n\nThe game is taking place in London where Horzine Biotech, a biotechnology company is centered. This company specializes in mass cloning and genetic manipulation for military purposes. But things goes wrong where the human subjects exhibits mutation and disfigurements. These \"zeds\" breaks out and it's up to you to take em down.\n\nThe game sounds easy, but it is not. If you want a true challenge however, play Hell on Earth difficulty. This is true horror which also requires heavily reliable teamwork. It's going to test all your abilities as a teamplayer, skills, tactics, survivability and knowledge of the game.\n\nI dearly recommend this game to anyone, it's fun, competitive, and offers great experience and with an amazing community and workshop, you can never go wrong.","timestamp_created":1452638561,"timestamp_updated":1452800575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20491500","author":{"steamid":"76561198047382238","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2509,"last_played":1595185711},"language":"polish","review":"~ONE IN THE PIPE\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1452623144,"timestamp_updated":1452623144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20486937","author":{"steamid":"76561198022793072","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7065,"last_played":1524012932},"language":"english","review":"badboy game xo","timestamp_created":1452606356,"timestamp_updated":1452606356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20483403","author":{"steamid":"76561198184499299","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1466873986},"language":"russian","review":"хорошая игра","timestamp_created":1452585453,"timestamp_updated":1452585453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20482766","author":{"steamid":"76561198028657203","num_games_owned":291,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":16950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16348,"last_played":1497963401},"language":"english","review":"This is the only game I've seen that lets you kill bloodthirsty gingerbread men with a chainsaw while wearing a chicken suit and screaming YOU'RE ALL FUR COAT, NO KNICKERS BITCHES. 10/10 would u w0t m8 again.","timestamp_created":1452581048,"timestamp_updated":1452581048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20481523","author":{"steamid":"76561198064804121","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":707,"last_played":1575116561},"language":"english","review":"I don't have any friends with this game but it is still insanely fun to just play random maps and destroy some zombies, easy recommendation! 100/10","timestamp_created":1452572831,"timestamp_updated":1452572831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20481282","author":{"steamid":"76561197994567313","num_games_owned":429,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":14583,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13568,"last_played":1641265500},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor is one of my all-time favorite co-op FPS's.

Dieser ist tödliche im Nahkampf und schießt mit MG und Raketen, ist also ein ordentlicher Brocken der schon so manch hart erkämpftes Vorankommen in Runde 11 eiskalt beendet hat. Außer dem Patriarchen gibt es sechs andere Gegnertypen von leicht bis schwer zu besiegen, die je nach Typus in unterschiedlicher Anzahl auf der Map erscheinen. Über die Maps kann man sich nicht beklagen, sie sind in ausreichender Zahl vorhanden und per Steam Workshop gibt es weitere zum download. Die offiziellen Maps reichen von großen Bauernhöfen über Krankenhäuser bis zum dichten Dschungel, für Abwechslung ist also gesorgt.   \n\nZur Wahl stehen sechs Perks (Sanitäter, Unterstützer, Scharfschütze, Kommando, Berserker, Pyro und Sprengmeister), die alle mit ihren spezifischen Waffen (und dazugehörige Boni) bis Level 7 gelevelt werden können. Ein Scharfschütze Level 7 macht pro Schuss also mehr Schaden als einer Level 2. Das Aussehen der Spielfigur kann man im Prinzip frei wählen, dafür gibt es viele offizielle Charakter Skins und Hunderte aus dem Steam Workshop. \n\nDen Reiz des Spiels macht einfach das Kooperative Zusammenspiel mit anderen Spielern aus, sich allein durch die Gegnermassen zu schießen macht eben nur halb soviel Spaß wie zusammen mit fünf anderen. Besonders auf den höheren der fünf Schwierigkeitsgrade ist Teamwork Pflicht. Jeder getötet Gegner bringt hierbei das Level des gewählten Perks durch den ausgeteilten Schaden höher und bringt einem zusätzlich Geld für neue Waffen ein. An unterschiedlichen Waffen mangelt es dem Spiel ebenfalls nicht, nach den Perks unterteilt gibt es Waffen die wenig Schaden machen bis zu Waffen die viel Schaden machen, natürlich zu aufsteigenden Preisen.\n\nFür jeden der Spaß an Kooperativen Videospielen hat, gerne Shooter spielt und sich gerne auf Erfolgejagt macht ist Killing Floor motivierend über sehr viele Stunden hinweg. Ab dem „Normalen“ Schwierigkeitsgrad gibt es für jede der 33 offiziellen Maps einen Erfolg, macht also schon 132 Erfolge nur für das erfolgreiche Abschließen der Maps.
