Resident Evil, Dead Rising, Dead Island, all these other games are either slow-paced, clunky, gimicky, or just plain not fun to play. Left 4 Dead has always been to me a mix of the greatest elements of zombie shooters. The mechanics are beautiful, as all Valve games seem to be. The story presents depth, but not so much that it seems daunting to a casual gamer. And the violence is gory, but tasteful; Valve didn't take it over the top for shock value like other games, including the sequel, seem to do. All-in-all, one of my favorite games of all time.

The sequel is great, but so is this, in its own ways.\n\nAbout 12 years ago (going back from 2022), I was visiting a second-hand shop when I stumbled upon a selection of 4 console titles. They were pretty cheap, so I bought the two most interesting ones. Left 4 Dead being one of them. Outside of a couple minute long test run, the game would continue to sit on the shelf for a couple months before I'd actually take a proper crack at it.\n\nAfter I finished my first playthrough of No Mercy, I was hooked. Spent hours upon hours playing the game. Some time later, when I finally got a proper game-capable PC, I knew I had to get this game. To this day I still play it every now and then. I genuinely did not expect to get so much single player mileage out of Left 4 Dead, but here we are.","timestamp_created":1389498842,"timestamp_updated":1647756193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8671319","author":{"steamid":"76561198056853052","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2129,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2052,"last_played":1429644471},"language":"english","review":"Muito bom, meu jogo favorito da steam.","timestamp_created":1389488612,"timestamp_updated":1389488612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8669758","author":{"steamid":"76561198115745296","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":479,"last_played":1428288505},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game.Fine grafics.And good wepons.Just wish there was more apocolipse. :-D And pro tip...bring friends.","timestamp_created":1389480594,"timestamp_updated":1389480692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8668672","author":{"steamid":"76561198104098286","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":7680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1060,"last_played":1652297758},"language":"russian","review":"Left 4 Dead - это классический survival-horror, действие которого разворачивается в современном мире, пораженном смертельным вирусом.

Уровней сложности несколько. \nКроме обычных зомби, которые были как пушечное мясо, есть еще и особые зараженные - к ним в первой части игры относится: \nОхотник, Курильщик, Толстяк, Танк и Ведьма.\n\nОхотник всегда неожиданно напрыгивает, Курильщик притиягивает жертву за шею своим языком, Толстяка постоянно сташнивает на персонажей и от этого ничего не видно, к тому же его рвота привлекает орду зомби, Танк - это своеобразный босс, у которого много жизней и которого довольно сложно убить, он ходит и кидается камнями, расталкивает машины, убивает быстро, Ведьма убивает с первого прикосновения, главное - не светить в нее фонарем. \n\nОсобые зараженные выглядят, конечно, мерзко. Больше всех меня напрягал всегда Курильщик, потому что он все время находился далеко и по сути расформировывал всю команду.\n\nВ заключение стоит сказать, что лучше всего играть в компании нежели одному.","timestamp_created":1389068323,"timestamp_updated":1389068445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8600798","author":{"steamid":"76561197964474528","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"the most repetetive load of shit I've ever accidentally played, this is a good title for modern-newfags who think zombies are awesome, play bumper cars 1.6 instead, suck a d i c k you hipster S H I T I O T S","timestamp_created":1389067259,"timestamp_updated":1389067307,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476505160331726074","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8600295","author":{"steamid":"76561198051284174","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18890,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3743,"last_played":1497994152},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogabilidade muito boa!","timestamp_created":1389064271,"timestamp_updated":1389064271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8599123","author":{"steamid":"76561198046129540","num_games_owned":657,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":437,"last_played":1324281600},"language":"english","review":"Left 4 Dead is Left 4 Dead.\nI prefer the second one though.","timestamp_created":1389052534,"timestamp_updated":1389052534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474595904350280762","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8583425","author":{"steamid":"76561198041716935","num_games_owned":344,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":298,"last_played":1435440810},"language":"russian","review":"The best game!","timestamp_created":1388968400,"timestamp_updated":1388968400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8579423","author":{"steamid":"76561198042625652","num_games_owned":438,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":64,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":64,"last_played":1375654295},"language":"english","review":"Honesly, the second was a whole lot better in my opinion but I'm not saying this game is bad.

Among the best co-op, always providing something important for all four players to do(cover an angle, use a throwable while the others hold zombies off, etc.) and making them depend on each other(Special Infected tend to immobilize one of the four, and one of the other three will need to help them). There is no \"beating the zombies\", there is only holding them off until you reach the next Safehouse; and yet levels don't feel linear, and the drive to get to safety propels players forward. The \"Director\" AI controls the mood, with each match being unpredictable and partly randomized(and still, it never overwhelms) - basically, at any point, you could be attacked by a Horde(which is exactly what it sounds like) and/or Special Infected. Immersive and atmosphere-laden co-op/multiplayer. Limited carry capacity makes you use items and guns carefully. Challenging, and with four difficulty settings *and* off-line, AI-aided campaign mode, this is open to players of different levels of skill.\n\nCons: Once you've played for a few hours, tried the different guns, levels and modes, there isn't anything \"new\" there - guns  and items can't be upgraded. While the four characters speaking can help the atmosphere, they do eventually get repetitive,  and they can't be turned off.

The re playability of Left 4 Dead is phenomenal.\n\nGameplay- Left 4 Dead's core gameplay is an incredible amount of fun, and if you've ever played zombie mods for other multilayer shooters and wondered what the most awesome ungodly combination of zombie gaming would be, this is it. Basically you and three teammates (AI or human) go through these campaigns together fighting off hordes of zombies and specialized monsters all while being tormented by the mysterious and much vaunted AI director. Well the director is quite talented at mixing it up. Even on your hundredth playthrough of a given campaign, you won't know where the attacks are coming from exactly. The game does get a bit predictable in terms of spawn points, but that's really only limited by the mapper and the overall feeling is one of scared confusion, perfect for a zombie game. I could describe Left 4 Dead's core zombie gameplay for hours but it's really something you just have to play. It's very intuitive and a whole lot of fun. A few complaints are legitimate, however. In total there are 5 guns besides your side arm(s): shotgun, auto-shotgun, assault rifle, smg, and sniper rifle. A bit more variety and customization would have been nice, though these weapons all work just fine. Also, although you wouldn't know it now, valve has been slow on patching this game up to what it should have been at release, doing things like unlocking all campaigns for versus, and adding survival mode. Ultimately, they will continue to support Left 4 Dead, but they get marked down for being slow.\n\nGraphics- It's a late build of the source engine, but it's still the source engine: nice, but not anything special in 2008, let alone 2009. it does the Job and they have spruced up the lighting and dismemberment effects quite a bit.\n\nSound- The sound in this game is a lot of fun. The aural cues given off by special infected and the musical crescendos that precede major fights are things you only tune into the more you play. The weapons sound and feel satisfying, and some of the special infected noises are just gross, or even disturbing. Very fun.\n\nValue- Left 4 Dead is a game to be played online, preferably with friends. The bots will give you your money's worth, but the true longevity of this game is in both competitive and cooperative online play. Valves updates both past and possible future ones will continue to add content for the players. All in all, a much better value than meets the eye.\n\nTilt- I love zombie games and movies, so what might have been an 8.7 on the old scale becomes a 9 on the new one.","timestamp_created":1388516563,"timestamp_updated":1388516563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8456749","author":{"steamid":"76561198059889098","num_games_owned":709,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":15,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1411965868},"language":"german","review":"With the release of all 4 campaigns from L4D1 into L4D2, there is now no reason to own L4D1.

During the console shooter craze, gamers like me needed something a little more. Valve promised a fresh twist on teamwork and A.I. that spawns zombies differently everytime you play the game. It was Valve, they said co-op, and they said zombies. We were sold already!\n\nPlot 7/10\n\nWell....it's a zombie game....what; it's a zombie game. Everyone's a zombie but you, now go kill them and escape! Zombie plots are inherently lame, so I'll be gracious. Most of the L4D's points in the plot department come from the playable characters. Each one is voiced to perfection, and have fun personalities. Hearing them discuss plans or bicker back and forth is always fun to listen to. \"Valve quality voice acting\" is all you need to know. There's Zoey (the obvious fan favorite, being that her facial model was based off of often-posing-nude super model, Sonja Kinski), a high school chick that's living the horror movies she's always loved, Francis: the rogue, nihilist biker that comically \"hates everything\", Louis: the everyday business manager who refuses to part with his optimism, and my favorite; Bill: the noble, battle-hardened, Vietnam Veteran that can still show the young people how it's done. The plot can also be confusing to non-existant when every campaign starts with the 4 being stranded, and ends with them fleeing to safety. For a zombie game though, it works well enough.\n\nSound 10/10\n\nThe series has a very clever use of sound and music. Certain piano clips warn the Survivors of certain \"special\" infected (that are controlled by other players on the enemy team in multiplayer.) Having abnormal mutations due to the infection, these zombies have powerful abilities to make the Survivors journey a living hell, so alerting players to the danger is important. For example, a tune of five, deep notes warns that a Boomer is ready to spawn into the world. Music ties in very closely with the gameplay, so it's difficult to put this part in either/or. Another clever use is how music is non-existant during most gameplay, but ONLY if something potentially dangerous shows up will the Survivors get a music warning as well as fast paced \"OMG HORDE OF ZOMBIES\" tune during what's called \"panic events\". Gun sounds are distinct and satisfying to shoot. Good thing too; you'll be shooting a lot. The grunts and growls of the zombies - especially during panic events - is pretty scary. Each special infected also have very distinct voices from the talents of Dee Bradly Baker and others that not only fit them perfectly, but again, inform the Survivors of who's out there. Speaking of voices, the 4 Survivors also are well-voiced and casted. Every voice fits their character like a glove, and performances cover every emotion with outstanding acting. They sell every line they deliver from \"Hey, stop shooting me!\" to \"I....don't think....I'm gonna make it...\". Excellent performances from the cast; maybe even legendary. From car alarms and rifle-butts beating out the brains of infected, to the growling of zombies, to the carefully selective music,  and the voices of the Survivors, the sound is superbly immersive; flawless.\n\nGameplay 7/10\n\nThe concept and excecution of the gameplay is awesome. Certain attacks will leave Survivors stunned and taking steady damage. They can do little to nothing for themselves, so it's vital that the team keep an eye on eachother. The game loses points on lack of content. There are very few weapons available and only a handful of maps. L4D has very little depth or content to explore. Combine this with horrid Survivor A.I., and you will stop playing Campaign in about 10 min. Co-op won't please you for long either, so it's up to MP to make it all up. Unlucky for L4D, MP is littered with bugs, glitches and exploits to the point where they are your main weapon; not your firearm. Valve has patched most of them, but the game lost my interest by the time they did. The coup de grace: this is the 2nd worst, most ego-centric, immature, and laughably stupid community I've ever seen, second only to League of Legends. The basic MP run goes like this: \n\nYou spawn as Survivors, no one says anything, one guy rushes out the door WAY ahead of the team and gets attacked. He's so far away, you can't save him. As the team rushes to save him before he dies, the rest of the infected kill the 2 running Survivors. They look to the 4th guy - the diasterous team's last hope - who never left spawn; he's been AFK. Zombie team: LOL gg noobs ez. You now switch teams to the zombies: the Survivors BLOW their way out of spawn at blazing speeds spamming the \"laugh\" and \"no\" commands, your team attacks one at a time getting reduced to swiss cheese in .1 seconds while they religiously chant \"WE NEED TO ATTACK AT THE SAME TIME!\" Everytime the opponent kills one of  you, they leave an offensive spray-picture on your corpse of God-knows-what and call you a baddie or say \"fail\". In 60 seconds, all Survivors have blurred their way into safety without as much as a minor inconvenience. Finally, as the Survivors say \"LOL gg noobs ez\", everyone on your team quits. You may now 1) stay and fight 4v1 or 2) quit yourself. THAT'S. IT. In one paragraph, you just read all you will see in MP.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nL4D boasts excellent and much needed innovations to the ever-crowded zombie genre in music, gameplay, and voice cast, but the shallow pool of content and unbearable community ensure SP, CO-OP, and MP won't last long. Final score 6/10  It's a pretty good game and cheap nowadays; you should get it and give it a whirl. L4D has earned that much, but MP? The vicious cycle repeats - over and over, my friend. 'Til you log out of L4D, and never log in again.","timestamp_created":1388344966,"timestamp_updated":1388377796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.316933274269104004","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8402944","author":{"steamid":"76561197960625328","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9167,"last_played":1609365751},"language":"english","review":"Fun to cause people to rage quit.","timestamp_created":1388341310,"timestamp_updated":1388341310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8402537","author":{"steamid":"76561197966596648","num_games_owned":600,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":8030,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8030,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"The Zombieapocalypse hit the cities and the figtht for survival is on. 4 player coop and 4v4 humans vs. infected.
