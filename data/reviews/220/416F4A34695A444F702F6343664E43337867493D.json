Sometimes it was confusing to see where to go next, even to the point where I missed out on hidden stashes because what I thought was a hidden pathway, was actually the real way forward. I played a good number of hours on this, definitely not a short game. The story was alright, with fairly memorable main characters. \"Gman\" still creeps me out. I love the small comedic moments like interactions between NPCs and all the stuff they say when you talk to them. I think my favourite line is \"Sometimes I dream about cheese.\" Same, fellow random citizen, same. You gotta love the vortigaunts in this game too, I find them very lovable. (Mild spoiler) [spoiler] It's a shame they're enslaved in this game. [/spoiler]\nI loove fucking around (exploring) a lot in games and it was pretty easy to do that.

Where other games like Resident Evil 4 and even the first Mass Effect are starting to show their age, there's just something about Half Life 2 that refuses to get old.\n\n1. Graphics. The graphics certainly aren't what I would call modern, being a nearly 20 year old game. But there's a lot of polish to them, cull distance for example is simply non-existent, likely hidden behind clever level design where level transitions allow for a sort of visual trick that you never actually see or notice the next part of the level loading in. There's also no texture popping, a problem that seems to have actually gotten worse over time in modern games. The character models still look great, something that some games still struggle with, and animations overall are pretty fluid, and fit well into the universe. Enemy designs still hold up, from the shambling headcrab zombies to the hanging barnacles waiting to pull you up. This was one of the best looking games of all time in 2004, and it still holds up where many of its time have aged.\n\n2. Gameplay: This is the part where Half-Life 2 really refuses to age. The combat and shooting is as tight as ever, but it's the physics engine that really pushes the gameplay above and beyond what most first person shooter games are accomplishing even today. There's little stuff like weighing down a ramp so you can walk up it to advance, or stacking boxes to reach a ladder, cool stuff but can come across as gimmicky. Where it really shines is when you get the Gravity Gun, allowing you to launch objects at enemies, like red barrels, manhacks, even their own grenades. With the impressive arsenal, environmental cues and the gravity gun, there's a lot of opportunity for each gamer to experiment with combat differently, so it never feels like the same fight in another room. Overall, Half-Life still has more compelling combat than most modern FPS games, matched only by games like Bioshock and Dishonered. \n\nIf there's anyone out there who hasn't played this game yet, you must. It's not as dated as it might seem, and might just feel more modern than you think.","timestamp_created":1612024818,"timestamp_updated":1612024818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85634915","author":{"steamid":"76561199004080721","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1014,"last_played":1612482524},"language":"english","review":"it gud","timestamp_created":1612023616,"timestamp_updated":1612023616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85634270","author":{"steamid":"76561198400389338","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1828,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1237,"last_played":1616121515},"language":"english","review":"The game that started it all. 10/10","timestamp_created":1612022916,"timestamp_updated":1612022916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507042229175567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85633603","author":{"steamid":"76561198316642924","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1261,"last_played":1646577535},"language":"english","review":"First game that managed to look good AND run on my old really awful computer.

It improves on the already great game that was Half-Life 1 and adds an extra layer or detail to it that at the time was groundbreaking for the industry. I wanted to give my in depth thoughts on this game as I have mixed feelings when it comes to a few aspects in the game. \n\nFirstly, let's start off with the plot. Half-Life 2 picks up right after Half-Life 1. After the resonance cascade of the first game, Gordon is employed by the Gman and is put in stasis until he’s needed again. You start the game with a short monologue from the Gman, stating that your time has finally come again. You then get transported into a tram sequence, similar to the first game: however this time, very different. You arrive in a city overrun by an alien species known as the Combine. The Combine are a force to be reckoned with within Half-Life, they grounded every military on earth to dust within 7 hours. The game from here is you and the resistance (a group who has taken on the task of eliminating the combine) trying to weaken the combine so you can finally get them off earth for good. The plot is easy to follow, yet complex in many ways; the further details given to you about the combine throughout the game really make you feel like this is a world in need of an uprising; it motivates the player to continue fighting with the resistance. The plot is very good and would only get better as the series progressed. Even though Half-Life 1 had very good story telling, it can’t compete with the narrative that Half-Life 2 conveys. Out of everything in Half-Life 2, this is the part I have the least problems with. \n\nSecondly we will talk about the gameplay. The gameplay of Half-Life 2 is largely similar to Half-Life 1. You gather an arsenal overtime to help aid you take down the enemy. This is a simple example of ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. The weaponry in Half-Life 2 makes you feel so powerful, almost on a similar level to how Doom makes you feel when you're killing enemies. The gunplay feels great. Every weapon is unique and will always help aid you in many different ways. You also have a Health and Power which act as a key in your survival. Health is standard like in most games and Power is more of an Armour feature where it can block damage. I know that they are simple features, but they compliment each other so well. You will find however that you will lose health, power and ammo quite quickly; this will make the player constantly scramble to find them two things. This was also in Half-Life 1 to an extent, however in Half-Life 1 it was annoying not because of the feature itself, it was mainly due to the fact that when you die you would have to go back a large chunk of the game if you didn’t save. The same thing happens here in 2, however you can just spam quicksave every 10 seconds which is what I mainly did. Another aspect to the gameplay that I really liked is the physics Half-Life 2 holds. I cannot explain how fun it is to kill enemies with the Gravity Gun or just explode a random barrel to kill 3 Combine Soldiers in a row. The physics compliment the fighting in the game and it honestly makes you feel even more powerful than before. \n\nThirdly, I want to discuss puzzles in the game. This is the aspect I had the most issues with. In Half-Life 2 (just like Half-Life 1), it will slow you down to solve a puzzle every once in a while. These puzzles can range from either good to just irritating. Some of these puzzles are just so cryptic that I kept having to look up guides for multiple puzzles in this game. It’s not to say outright crap or make the game worse because of it. Generally once you have done the puzzle, you’ll be back to strafing around enemies in no time. It’s just something that really bothered me and it honestly just slowed the pace of the game down a lot for me.\n\nI overall like Half-Life 2.
