Not only will it take hundreds of hours to unlock everything, but the grind holds you back from playing on higher difficulties. Unlike other games where a grind will usually just unlock new gear that is at least arguably a sidegrade, you get a bonus to every stat for each perk (class) that gives higher level players a direct advantage over lower level players. There's no good reason for it either. Lower level players can still play on higher difficulties, so it doesn't prevent new players from joining harder difficulties than they should, it only makes it even harder to win when they do join. The levelling might be fine if it was shorter, but for each individual perk it takes probably a little less than 50 hours to grind out on average. (Things like sharpshooter and medic level up relatively quickly, things like Commando or Support take absolutely forever and frankly skew that average to higher than it probably would be otherwise.)\n\nConclusion:\n\nI would still recommend it in the end, but keep in mind that it's probably going to eventually become something you lose interest in with the repetitiveness. Just keep in mind that while it is a gem, it is greatly flawed gem.","timestamp_created":1404624184,"timestamp_updated":1480989903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53239065408706665","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11096011","author":{"steamid":"76561198079329777","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":370,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":146,"last_played":1513589158},"language":"english","review":"You need to get the game if you like zombies and monsters","timestamp_created":1404623280,"timestamp_updated":1404623280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11095959","author":{"steamid":"76561197992255629","num_games_owned":386,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":235,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"It's a really fun and simple game, stripped down to the core of what's fun about just running and gunning down monsters without all the waffle that packs many AAA titles.

It's AI is notparticularly (well no: it's just completely not) complex, just a horde zombie game with a bunch of monsters massing on you, this is no Left 4 Dead. However the monesters are varied greatly in looks, attacks and ways to kill. Some are best killed with burst damage, some are better killed with a continuous stream of DPS. Some are hard to see, others instill fear with their giant glowing parts. Variety and depth of the zombies themselves make up for the boring horde AI.\n\nThen there are weapons. Weapons are great. They sound great, look decent for an indie title, and feel FUCKlNG AWESOME! Some of the best gunplay ever done. You thought Battlefield has good gunplay? You've got another thing coming, Killing Floor outmatches almost all shooters in the world in that particular aspect. It seems like the developers not only know what makes a gun fun to use, they also know exactly how to utilize game aspects to simulate it in the best way. \n\nGuns have awesome recoil. Not frustrating, just awesome. It feels natural and satisfying to compensate and every weapon has a good flow to it. Every hit spawns some gory particles and kills spawn flesh pieces and a really awesome sound of impact from the bullet or bones cracking from explosion. Heads explode on headshots, slow-motion pops up just at the right times when the whole team is looking at that awesome shot that just happened. It's just joyful and it will make you feel like a maniac for enjoying the carnage so much.\n\nNow bad things. The first and biggest con of Killing Floor is the movement. Diabolical 10cm high jumps, invisible walls, running at a pace of a Brachtiozaurus, all are in. As a fan of games like Mirrors Edge, Brink, Tribes, Unread Tournament and such, this is real bummer for me. Now granted this is not just an oversight, the movement is integrated into the gameplay, and is used as the primary way of creating challenge, BUT I would much prefer that they rather increased mobility of enemies, made more natural hazards and traps and enabled enemies to slow you down or stop you at range with special attacks, rather than gate the movement as much as they had in Killing Floor. It is REALLY really restrictive and really slow and the first few hours it felt TERRIBLE, I could not get my mind over how slow and clunky I am.\n\nSecond bad thing is the graphics. The game does not look good and for a game that does not look good, it doesn't run well enough. Often during explosions you will get big fps drops due to overdraw, open areas as well as corridors packed with enemies also have frequent drops. The game will still run on low end PCs, but expect fps drops to occur regardless of hardware. And well as I said: it's quite ugly in terms of fidelity. I care about graphics a lot, so it's a significant flaw for me just like movement, although the game in the end did make up for both of it's flaws.\n\nAnd finally the game has account progression which is quite grindy and annoying and really limits your ability to play at first (limits the variety by gating content behind unlocks). However there are ways to bypass that progression to explore all that the game has to offer without gating. But some may like that it's there, whatever. Your call.\n\nThis is a solid game that is still being updated with content. I would not listen to the fanbois that praise it to the heavens and say it's the best game ever, because it really is not. It's just a very good one. Go in expecting a very satisfying, challenging horde mode experience, but nothing that will place you in awe and make other shooter seem bleak in comparison, and you will not be disappointed.\n\nWishlist for Killing Floor 2:\n1) Better movement!\n2) More tactical and interesting AI\n3) Improve the graphics and add more brightness and colours\n4) Better movement!!\n5) Better movement!!!\n\n(this review was copypasted and edited from the one I have written on metacritic ages ago)","timestamp_created":1404580101,"timestamp_updated":1404580101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519392907619476318","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11087464","author":{"steamid":"76561198136591250","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":261,"last_played":1556786477},"language":"russian","review":"Игра просто класс,но одному играть скучно!!!","timestamp_created":1404579975,"timestamp_updated":1404579975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11087403","author":{"steamid":"76561198095653409","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1561750716},"language":"russian","review":"Игра на самом деле классная.
