game gave me gas and diarrhea. No really. Unlike the first Portal, the movement and environments in this game gave me motion sickness, which is more common than you think within the world of FPS style games, not that this is an FPS, but you catch my drift. Actually, I never understood that idiom. \"Catch my drift\"? What the hell does that come from? Well, I'll tell you. It was slang from decades ago about farting. Did you know that? Now you do. So basically, \"did you catch my drift\" was actually asking \"did you smell my dreadful bowel odors\". And how apropos is that within the subject matter in this review?\n\nBut I digress.\n\nSo ya, I got ill. Basically, the environment and movement gave me intense vertigo, which in turn made my stomach upset, as is the case with anyone having a motion-related reaction.  As a result, my body started producing vast amount of gas, which is also common with motion-sickness. I got the vapours something dreadful. And the smell? Wretched! And for the icing on this foul cake? DIARRHEA!\n\nI should consider legal action to replace several pairs of designer pants which were soiled as a result of this horrid game. SHAME ON YOU, VALVE! I can still smell the mud, which was easy enough to remove from the floor, but what about my clothes, area rug, and expensive ergonomic office chair? How about that, Valve??!! Answer THAT and stay fashionable!\n\nNot to mention the overwhelming shame I felt when my girlfriends showed up right when the stool hit the fan….almost literally. Oh the mess! Oh the smell! Oh the shame! They acted sympathetic at the time, but only days later I started seeing and hearing mockery related to the incident.  Twice now, I’ve been around the dorms when “Stephy Stephy…poo poo pants” was subtly being chanted on another floor, loud enough for me to hear it. I even started getting spam from companies selling products for incontinence. Thanks Valve!!!!!\n\nSure, not everyone will get explosive/projectile diarrhea from playing this highly over-rated game, but some will! And because of this, THERE NEEDS TO BE A WARNING! Cmon, entire product lines have been dropped or recalled because of a single injury. We, the people with weak bowels, aren’t asking for a damn recall, just a simple warning! Something like:  “Caution, playing this game may cause anal leakage”. See? Simple and to the point.\n\nAdditionally, I can’t say I enjoyed the game much. Even between waves of the chocolate-tsunami, I do remember I was not entirely impressed with the levels, the VO work, or the writing. It wasn’t horrible, but it certainly lacked a lot of the charm which the first installment had in spades. Why do we refer to something which has a lot of something else, as having it in “spades”? I find that offensive.\n\nSo in closing, a pair of Depend adult undergarments might be the only way to play this game with any confidence if you have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a spastic colon, or a predisposition towards visually-induced motion sickness.

game.\n\nThe start is interesting to learn the basics of, but later on it turns into challenging rooms that will make your brain hurt. It gives an urge to just google how to do a chamber, yet you also want to find out for yourself.\n\nIt's not a game you can just sit in front of for a few hours. One multiplayer course can take an hour or two, and the frustration from some chambers can lead to ragequitting quickly, but if you pace yourself, you will love this game.","timestamp_created":1422592084,"timestamp_updated":1422592084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14235335","author":{"steamid":"76561198067198295","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1427334610},"language":"english","review":"This game will make you think, it's really fun and funny with great voice acting.

Compared to Portal, it has soo many new things that make my excitement meter go crazy. First of all, there are more puzzles. I can beat Portal in half an hour, this would take a considerable amount of time, and even when I play it the second, third, etc. time, it's still quite fun. Another great thing is the soundtrack. Before buying this game, you can go the Portal 2 website and take a listen. I got is during the midweek madness in the summer of 2014, and I hope that you catch it then, 'cause it's only CAD $5 then. Try it out; it's worth your money and time. NOTE!!! I highly recommend playing the first game (for the story; it's important).","timestamp_created":1422585416,"timestamp_updated":1422585416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14234125","author":{"steamid":"76561197998584983","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":442,"last_played":1406249966},"language":"english","review":"A wonderful puzzler. It carries on the charm and wit of the original's mechanics and story and improves upon them.
