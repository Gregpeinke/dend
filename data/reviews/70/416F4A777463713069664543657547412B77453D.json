Its level of creativity and execution is rare even now. Its atmosphere and story is compellingly suspenseful, serious, and intriguing; its design and pacing is balanced, original, and effective; its gameplay is accessible, challenging, and engaging. Half-Life's age is apparent, and only occasionally frustrating, but never enough to outweigh its other attributes.\n\nPlay this game all the way through and immerse yourself in the thrilling ingenuity of its time.\n\nEnjoyment: 4.5 out of 5\nCritique: 4.5 out of 5\nTotal: 9 out of 10\nSummary: Must-Play\n\nP.S.

Che dire. Ora capisco perché viene considerato un caposaldo dell'industria. \nHo iniziato ad affrontare la saga di Half-Life solo tre giorni fa, e nel momento in cui sto scrivendo questa recensione ho appena terminato Blue Shift, pronto ad iniziare il mio viaggio a City 17.\n\nHalf-Life è ancora perfettamente godibile nel 2020. \nI controlli sono perfettamente responsivi (anche se a volte il protagonista tende a \"scivolare\"), gli eventi narrati si lasciano seguire senza alcun problema e la totale assenza di tutorial (per imparare a giocare c'è la Stanza di Addestramento, poi sarete completamente soli) o indicatori di obiettivo non nuoce affatto all'esperienza, anzi, giova all'immersione del giocatore.\nI livelli non sono mai troppo grandi per perdere la strada e non sono mai troppo piccoli per diventare dei semplici corridoi: l'esplorazione viene sempre ricompensata con salute e munizioni extra, risorse limitate e sempre indispensabili per sopravvivere. \nI puzzle ambientali richiedono una buona dose di ragionamento, anche se non tutti sono proprio intuitivi.\nLa scelta delle armi, infine, è eccellente e vario al punto giusto. I combattimenti possono essere affrontati in modi diversi, e il giocatore ha sempre la possibilità di utilizzare il suo arsenale in modo creativo per sconfiggere i nemici come meglio crede: non temete rallentamenti o ostacoli dovuti alle limitazioni tecniche del gioco, Half-Life non vi impedirà di divertirvi, di eseguire una grande varietà di manovre e di pianificare le vostre strategie anche tenendo conto del livello di difficoltà selezionato (personalmente ho completato il gioco a difficoltà media, e l'ho trovato una sfida perfettamente equilibrata. La maggior parte delle volte che sono morto è stato per colpa mia, e la restante minoranza è stato per colpa della già citata \"scivolosità\" dei movimenti del protagonista).\n\nHalf-Life è un capolavoro assoluto che, come Super Mario 64, ha resistito fieramente al passaggio del tempo. \nUn gioco divertente, coinvolgente e soprattutto memorabile. Le 12 ore che ho impiegato per completarlo sono state 12 ore di pura gioia, e non vedo l'ora di iniziare Half-Life 2. \n\nVe lo consiglio con tutto il cuore, sia per il suo valore storico che per il suo valore come videogioco in sé.\n\nP.S.= Lo consiglio anche e soprattutto a chi (come me) possiede un computer dalle specifiche molto basse e poco adatto al gaming moderno.\n\n","timestamp_created":1585222331,"timestamp_updated":1585222331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65849199","author":{"steamid":"76561198417699536","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2291,"last_played":1641669882},"language":"turkish","review":"Ne haddime eleştirmek","timestamp_created":1585220658,"timestamp_updated":1585220658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65848275","author":{"steamid":"76561198180973118","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":892,"last_played":1612083236},"language":"schinese","review":"梦开始的地方，CS系列、CSOL的生化模式、求生之路的割草玩法都可以追溯到Half-Life。Valve在思考如何大把大把赚钱同时，也在思考着如何改变世界，祝Alyx大卖，Half-Life不朽。","timestamp_created":1585219620,"timestamp_updated":1585219620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65847322","author":{"steamid":"76561198144401334","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":710,"last_played":1599515625},"language":"english","review":"A great and fun classic fps game.

Floaty movement combined with platforming force you to spam Quicksave and Quickload. Some enemies are annoying to fight. Several enemies have slow death animations which make kills less gratifying. At-the-time revolutionary features such as soldiers fleeing make fights frustrating. Headcrabs feel awful to fight without Auto-aim enabled. Longer fights on Normal make the pacing dip, and on Hard makes you to spam Quicksave/Quickload. Only the crossbow and the experimental guns feel truly great to use. Bigger fights feel messy. No FOV slider - use command \"default_fov 100\" in the console Console instead. No crosshair settings.\n[b]Further playing:[/b] If you enjoyed the gameplay, check out Halo 2 and 3. If you enjoyed the story, check out the S.T.A.L.K.E.R and the Metro series.","timestamp_created":1585161018,"timestamp_updated":1602499137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65801777","author":{"steamid":"76561198067968576","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2772,"last_played":1658186834},"language":"english","review":"its the best game to play and the graphics are good \n","timestamp_created":1585160684,"timestamp_updated":1585160684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65799842","author":{"steamid":"76561198003326345","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":2129,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1858,"last_played":1588065759},"language":"french","review":"Valve a réputation pour ce jeu, splendide, j'ai le seum de l'avoir fini maintenant....","timestamp_created":1585158848,"timestamp_updated":1585158848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65799706","author":{"steamid":"76561198283221194","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":674,"last_played":1585342952},"language":"english","review":"Do I really need to waste 5 seconds of your time explaining why Half-Life is good?","timestamp_created":1585158706,"timestamp_updated":1585158706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494627416133880615","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtcq0ifECeuGA+wE="}
