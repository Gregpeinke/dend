If Black Mesa didn't exist, I would be writing a positive review and giving this game a thumbs up. I really did have fun with it, but there are some parts that are frustrating by today's standards. The way you slide on the ground, even on surfaces like concrete, makes some jump puzzles really annoying. Also, the game is REALLY HARD. You will die a lot. Save often. I'm saying this as someone who played the game on the easy difficulty. The final boss is pretty anticlimactic compared to how he looks in Black Mesa. Just play Black Mesa.
