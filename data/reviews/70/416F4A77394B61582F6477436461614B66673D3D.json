For this game you are Freeman and Freeman is nothing more than you. This mixes very well with the one of half lifes greatest atributes, the atmosphere.  Half life's level design seems to be based around 1 (3 if you count certain events that split up the map) which gets more strange and exotic the more you venture into it, with gordan (or more acurately you) becoming more and more of a action hero while venturing deeper into the maze.

Such a shame that we had a no clue about it and later every single time even when I hear the word of \"Half\" it automatically reminds me of Half Life that was our childhood hero and I almost to cry. Neither this review is about the game's  mechanics nor its script. It's just about the guy who had great times and memories with one of his close friend in his childhood.
