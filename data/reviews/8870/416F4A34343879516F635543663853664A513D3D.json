THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF BIOSHOCK INFINITE. \n\nThis is without a doubt the best DLC I've ever played. I liked Burial at Sea Episode 2 more than BioShock Infinite itself. Maybe the reason why I enjoyed this so much is because I'm a huge fan of the original BioShock, but at the same time I really liked Elizabeth's character and the way she interacted with characters from the original game. \n\nThe Schrodinger's Cat stuff is still present due to this being an expansion of BioShock Infinite's story. This doesn't really bother me, though, seeing as the story is presented in a way where the player can actually take a moment to digest everything that's been happening - as opposed to BioShock Infinite. I'm not into the whole multiple dimensions thing, but if I absolutely had to have a story with it - this is how I'd want it done. \n\n\nPros\n- Stealth combat that feels fresh after BioShock and BioShock Infinite's manic gunplay.\n- A plot that isn't as hard to swallow as BioShock Infinite's.\n- Great atmosphere - fans of the original BioShock will love it.\n- A couple new vigors/plasmids are introduced for the first time.\n- A great wrap-up to BioShock Infinite and a fantastic prequel for the original BioShock.\n- Sheds light on a few previously unseen areas and factoids of Rapture.\n\n\nCons\n- The plot can seem kind of far out sometimes.\n- Plot holes, depending on how hard you want to look.\n- The Peeping Tom plasmid can kind of break the game's stealth mechanics. \n- The fact that the game tries to push you into playing stealthily as opposed to all guns blazing.\n- Going back to Colombia.\n- I wish it were longer!\n\n\nOverall, this is an amazing DLC that is definitely worth the admission fee. If you liked the first BioShock and didn't care too much for Infinite, this is basically a love letter to you from Irrational Games.

A lot. It's a game that I had fun exploring the intruging world of Columbia, while abusing the hell out of the skyhook to kill monsters. So what made this game really interesting? Let me just critque it..\n\nGraphics: Testing this game out on a 1920 x 1080 setting on Ultra makes this game extremely gorguous to see and feel. I like being introduced to new places, or locations that are easy to get lost in places like the Welcome Center, or Battleship Bay. I really think it's cool to see floating towns in general! Enemies look really detailed ( and Scary )! I'm more tempted to take down a Handyman than a Patriot, since Handymans are scarier in my opinion. Vigors are awesome. Enough Said.\n\nSound: I love the sound of this game. The Trilogy of Bioshock has never surprised me with their use of vintage music from the early 1900's. I love songs such as \" Will The Circle Be Unbroken \", or the Barbershop Quartet song of \"God Only Knows\" too. I recommend it if you're in search of new music. Shots and the use of Vigors sound really accurate. Troy Baker and Courtnee Draper did a suprerb job as Booker and Elizabeth also.\n\nGameplay: If you played the past Bioshock games, it's almost the same with the exception of Skyhooks. You can now execute enemies which is gruesome to me. Sky executions are also fun to do as well since you can jump back and forth in any direction to go to any rail whenever you want. Elizabeth herself is the best part about combat. She's a very smart person; she can hand you some coins, some ammo/health, and can even open up Tears to assist you. There's so much different ways to approach combat where I want to experiment if a certain combo works ( example: Shock Jockey and Shotgun ). Exploring is self explanatory; you can flesh out the story if you collect Voxophones which give depth to characters in the game if you're ever curious about their motives. You can also have Elizabeth pick lock doors too; it makes exploring more rewarding and can help you upgrades the things you need for your next fight.\n\nOverall: Just get it. You won't be bored because Bioshock Infinite wants you to enjoy every minute of it, and make you wish that such worlds like Columbia exist. The ending can confuse you, but for such a complicated game like this.. it's very well thought out.","timestamp_created":1397173710,"timestamp_updated":1397173710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9782710","author":{"steamid":"76561198021512406","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1646091839},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games of all time.

There were a few times where I forgot the game was even in my collection, so it took a while to finish due to time and family, but I finally did it.\n\nI've been thinking on how to make a review for this game, since I'm only partially known for making reviews for flash animation and artwork on NewGrounds, this is entirely new territory for me to review a AAA+ game.\n\nBut anyway, on with the review:\n\nBioShock Infinite is a beautiful game.  And when I say it's beautiful, I mean it.  This game was made with a modified version of Unreal Engine 3, which is pretty impressive with the amount of scope, detail, and texture detail.  The BioShock games have always looked really great, and this game is no exception.  I love the art direction, the city design, and I have always loved the idea of a city in the sky, and it really made me feel like a kid, exploring this beautiful yet dark city.\n\nAnd then there's the story, which I really don't want to spoil for people who haven't finished this game yet.  BioShock Infinite is about a private investigator named Booker DeWitt, who has a pretty large gambling debt to pay off, and some mysterious guy come in and goes \"Hey, Booker, I got a way you can pay off your debts, n' stuffs, you just go up to this magical city called Columbia and rescue this girl\"  and he later says this line that's repeated throughout the game's dialogue and trailers \"Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt\"  and Booker gets to the city by boat from going inside a lighthouse, flies up to Columbia, and finds Elizabeth (who looks an awful lot like Belle from Disney's Beauty and the Beast btw) and they happily explore the city, as they attempt to unravel the dark secrets of Columbia and stuff.  Well, at least that's my version of the story from how I played it.\n\nOh yeah, the the gameplay is pretty bland FPS gameplay, nothing too special about it, to be honest.  And when using this thing called the Sky-Hook, that is basically a game mechanic that makes the combat look like some ride at DisneyLand, whcih can be either a good thing, or a bad thing.  I have watched quite a number of reviews for this game on YouTube, and one I watched happened to be TotalBiscuit's review.  I whole-heartidly disagreed with TotalBiscuit's points with the game, because I actually enjoyed the combat!  In fact, I love the Sky-Hook, it's a pretty cool and useful mechanic that makes the game more fun in my opinion.  Yeah, the shooting is bland, yeah Elizabeth giving you ammo and Salts made the game piss-easy, and yeah, there were flaws with the gameplay.  But all the problems TotalBiscuit had with this game I found to be extremely minor flaws and thanks to that review, when I first played the game I was a cynical bastard at first.  And then I realized that I was having fun.  So, yeah, in my own opinion, I love the combat.  It's a ton of fun and I fucking love throwing balls of fire on dudes and summoning crows from my hands.  Oh, and I think BioShock Infinite's combat is a far cry from the first game's combat.\n\n*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT, DON'T READ THIS PART OF THE REVIEW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPILED FROM THE ENDING OF THIS*\n\nThe ending.  It was mind-blowingly interesting in so many ways.  The ending was intelligent, crazy, and down-right brilliant.  Nothing could have prepared me for what was to come of the ending, and I was surprised, dumbfounded that a game managed to make me think really hard with what I witnessed.  I really didn't expect this game to have a multi-universe ending that ties the original to Infinite, and what Elizabeth says about there always being a man, a lighthouse and a city, immediately made me go \"Oh, shit\" because I honestly didn't expect this game to have anything to do with the original BioShock at all, but I was wrong.  Hell, near the end Elizabeth takes Booker to Rapture and says \"It's a gateway\" and it brought back so many memories of when I first played the first game back in 2007, but I was also asking \"Why the hell are we in Rapture!?  Why is this a gateway?\"  and that question was answered as soon as Elizabeth said there is always a man going inside a lighthouse and going to a mysterious city.  The ending left me confused, and made me wanting more.  \n\nThe ending of the game made me want to buy the Season Pass, which no game has made me want to buy a Season Pass until recently.  I want to know what happens to Elizabeth and Booker in Rapture, I want to know how the actual game ends.  A hate DLC with a fiery passion, especially when it's something like an important piece of story, and The Last of Us did the exact same thing.  I haven't bought the Season Pass yet, and have no plans to purchase it since it's out of my price range right now, but I have been tempted more than once about buying that.\n\nI have never played the Burial at Sea DLC, and I probably never will at this rate, unless the price comes down a notch, I will never know what happens to Booker and Elizabeth in Rapture, which is unfortunate, but that's the modern gaming industry and corporate greed, I suppose.  So, I hereby reccomend this game to lots of people!  I reccomend either waiting for the price to come down, or waiting to get this at a sale like I did because in my opinion, £20 is not a very good price for this game in terms of content and length, it's well-worth buying it either way, though. ;D\n\nThanks for reading this review, and I hope this brought-up some interesting discussion on the ending of BioShock Infinite, and what could improve the game any further.\n\nHave a wondeful day! ~Retro","timestamp_created":1397168244,"timestamp_updated":1397168426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9781718","author":{"steamid":"76561197993279492","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1133,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1133,"last_played":1397651834},"language":"english","review":"For me, this was my first BioShock game and let me tell you, boy, I was NOT disappointed.\n\n*This would be my first review and I will try to make it as brief as possible.\n\nGraphics\nThe art and the attention to detail is just stunning. You get completely immersed into the game from the moment you set foot in Columbia. It's breathtaking and makes you crave more.\n\nWhat I personally would've liked to see, was a more diverse crowd in Columbia. There aren't many NPC models and it sometimes make you feel like you've passed or killed the same person just a moment ago. Again, this is just a minor aspect which won't bother most people.\n\n\nStory\nIf it's something that truly makes Bioshock Infinide stand out, it's not just the gameplay, the story plays the biggest role in what makes you love this game. The story of the game is the fuel that drives you to progress, to want to see what comes next.\n\nShortly put, you start as a Booker Dewitt, a private investigator who is heading towards a light tower, and then Columbia, in order to find the girl, Elizabeth and repay your debt. \n\nThe story becomes more and more complex as you progress within the game and it all culminates in an ending, that you will never have thought of - Leaving you speechless and with more questions that you can imagine. \n\nThe story has such a deep effect, that even after finishing the game, you think back and it really gets you thinking of the choices one makes.\n\n\nCombat and Gameplay\nThe combat in the game is determined by your choosing of the playstyle.\n\nYou are offered a huge variety of both weapons and vigors. These can be combined to your pleasing in order to get insane damage throughput whilst also having fun. It's totally nuts!\n\nTake a look at the options you have:\n\nWeapons\nRPG, Sniper Rifle, Pistol, Shotgun, Heater, Carbine, Burstgun, Hand Cannon, Crank Gun, Volley Gun, Hail Fire, Machine Gun, Repeater and lastly, the almighty Sky-Hook that allows you to glide on Sky-lines and crush your oponents in the face!\n\nVigors\nPossession, Murder of Crows, Devil's Kiss, Bucking Bronco, Charge, Return to Sender, Shock Jockey, Undertow.\n\nThey're all unique in their own way and trust me, they really turn the tide in your battles.\n\nIn addition to the above, we get even more!\n\nSky-lines aren't there just for transportation and to get to places you would otherwise be unable to reach. They also allow you to fight while travelling but also enable executes. These are perfomed by you whilst riding on the Sky-Line and locking onto an enemy then pressing Space.\n\nAnd then there is Elizabeth. Suffice to say the game wouldn't had been the same without her.\n\nHer powers allow you to open \"Tears\" in the heat of the fight to help you out.  You can bring in Wall Covers, Hooks to grab onto and perform Sky-Line executes, Decoys, Minions to fight alongside you and even ammunition or health packs. \n\nIn addition to the above, she will often throw you Ammo, Salts and Health Potions. \n\nOn the downside, Bioshock Infinite lacks an actual map but I didn't find progressing more difficult because of it. The game is more or less linear, with minor optional tasks that would make you go back to a previous location. And if you really find yourself lost, you can always tap N and an arrow display will guide you to your objective.\n\nConclussion\nIt was a blast for me to play through the world of Bioshock Infinte and its ending really left me speechless. Not going to spoil it for you because it's too damn epic. \n\nAll in all - It may have its flaws, but heck, not even diamonds are perfect.

TL:DR@bottom.\n\n\tThere are a lot of games out there today, all types, good and \nbad. Memorable... Forgettable... and there are some that we'll tell our \nkids about. The legends. Bioshock Infinite is the latter of these. \nFew games can convey what Infinite did. Everything was presented  \nin a way that it added to the atmosphere to create a truly unique  \nenvironment. The floating city of Colombia. A sky city, if you will, sets \na fascinating setting of buildings floating individually. They bob about \nweighting-ly to the whims of the apparent wind currents and output of \nthe energy that keeps them afloat. The city is bustling with life and \nthere are all manner of activities and shops to see. Events and \nattractions.\n\tThe story... oh boy, the story. I can't say much about it without \nrunning the story but very much like how the first Bioshock was or how  \nthe movie Inception was this game portrays so many movie/story elements  \nthat a trilogy of movies could be made with it. Of course that's not  \nnecessary as you're playing Infinite anyway but still, maybe one day \nit'll make it to the silver screen as a reboot 10 years from now. \nInfinite begins as most games would that provide substance in the story. \nNot much information is provided to you other than your name is Booker \nDewitt and your tasked to \"bring back the girl and the debt is repaid\". \nThings even progress in a slow rollercoaster climb, showing you \neverything that Colombia has to offer. It's set in a very \n\"Victorian/Steampunk\" sort of way. It's worth mentioning that the \ngraphics are really good for its era of release. \n\tAfter about a quarter of the way through it really picks up.  \nYou're soon diving in and out of cover shooting anything that moves.  \nInfinite doesn't try any new or special with shooters. Fire gun, reload,  \naim for the head, etc. That's not to say that there aren't some good  \nideas, I personally just felt that they were not fully realized. Take  \nElizabeth for example, she is the one you are rescuing. Throughout most  \nof the game she is following you. She offers you money, health, ammo,  \nwhen needed at certain times, finds lock picks and picks locks. She can  \neven use her abilities (opening up these rifts in space) to bring things  \ninto your plane of existence. This is fantastic but not always useful.  \nThe most use I got was getting ammo from her. My idea of the better  \nversion of this is for Booker to tell Elizabeth to focus on finding ammo  \nonly or open rifts automatically when in combat. A simple interaction  \nmenu would have sufficed for this but again it’s just my opinion. The Air \nRails were a nice addition for game play. Colombia uses them primarily \nfor transportation and you can use them too but I hardly did in combat. \nIt just didn't make sense to be dangling from the rail while being shot \nat. Again just my opinion. The Vigors also felt a little underdeveloped. \nTo me at least. I was able to complete the game using the Vigors only a  \nhandful of times and I was playing on hard. In the original Bioshock the  \nPlasmids made me feel like a god running around making no sounds, turning \nBig Daddys to fight for me and vanishing when I stopped moving. In  \nInfinite my primary was the shield absorption and occasionally the \nbucking bronco one. \n\tThe game does a fantastic job of getting the story through the  \ncharacters. Though this beautiful world is not open world the  \narchitecture and designs never felt respective of dull. As I mentioned,  \nit's very Victorian looking but also shows some industrial steampunk and  \neven Olympian style sculptures. So over all this game is great for  \nsomeone looking for an amazing story in a shooter, a genre that has  \nalmost forgotten what story is. If you fancy first-person shooters and  \nlike games with story, even though it doesn't seem to take advantage of  \nall of its’ great ideas, this is still one of the best single player  \nshooters for years to come. \n\t\n\nTL:DR version\n\nPlay it if you like single player shooters with story and atmosphere.\n\nThe Good\n-Fantastic story and atmosphere\n-Beautiful graphics for its’ time\n-Gameplay is straight forward, mostly\n-Story is to die for\n\nThe Bad\n-Game mechanic ideas fall short of greatness.\n-Some might not find Vigors useful\n","timestamp_created":1397162801,"timestamp_updated":1397162801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9781195","author":{"steamid":"76561198120569137","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1124,"last_played":1397158485},"language":"czech","review":"Super hra pribeh hratelnost a mod 1999 je proste smazba :)","timestamp_created":1397159245,"timestamp_updated":1397159245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9781121","author":{"steamid":"76561198059945720","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1396,"last_played":1396798673},"language":"japanese","review":"最近になってダウンロードしてゲームをプレイって流れを知り、セール品をちょこちょこ買ってプレイしてみたけど、やっぱり洋ゲーは字幕が多くてなんだか目が疲れてました。\nでも、この作品は日本語吹き替えがあって安心してプレイできましたね。それに、作りも良くて世界観も良かったと思います。\nただ、FPSのゲームってよくやらないから知らないんだけど、あんまりFPSって感じがしなくて、ストーリーを楽しむ感じだった印象です。\nDLCも吹き替え版出してくれたらうれしいです。","timestamp_created":1397158623,"timestamp_updated":1397158623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496852487325668335","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9780806","author":{"steamid":"76561198060953889","num_games_owned":458,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":823,"last_played":1396793853},"language":"german","review":"Bioshock Infinite.

Burial At Sea part 2 not only provides unique and mature content, but shows how DLC can be just as significant as the main game.\nWhen Burial At Sea Episode 1 ended it was possible to feel slightly let down. The content was of good quality but no real risks were taken. Episode 2 mixes up the gameplay, gives us the chance to play as Elizabeth and in the process tie up loose ends regarding Rapture and Columbia.\n\nAlthough the story follows on from Burial At Sea episode 1 you could be wondering why, as Elisabeth, you wake up in Paris with an opening set piece that's very similar to Infinite's. Walking down the street you see a beautifully crafted world, with locals greeting you in French and going about their day to day business. But Elisabeth doesn't stay in this wonderland for long. Before you know it you are back in Rapture and trying to rescue Sally. It wont be easy though, Sally is being held as ransom by Atlas, who is more calculating and sinister as ever.  \nBeing a veteran player of the Bioshock games wont help you here. The gameplay is significantly changed from everything gone before. Elisabeth is weaker not able to open tears or see past doors thus limiting what she can do. Realising early on she wont win in a gun battle Elisabeth relies on her wits and outsmarting the enemy. You can kill or take down splicers but it's a slower and more tense experience. Its essentially a stealth and explore game, forcing you to duck, hide and stay out of sight while collecting scraps of information, trying to meet Atlas's demands. You know the task at hand is never as easy as its first made out to be but seeing the twists and turns of several storylines unravel in front of you is fantastic.\n\nPlaying as Elisabeth is genuinely a new experience making you look at levels differently and adapt your play style to match your gear. Certain sections aren't dissimilar to challenge style rooms forcing you to think on your feet and cover all angles of attack. If your spotted you wont be fighting your way out of it. Laying traps and using stun darts tactically are the order of the day almost forcing you to be more absorbed in Raptures world as you play at a different pace. If you ever wondered how Elisabeth picked those locks, then it's answered here in the form of a mini-game where you can either get a noisemaking dart to aid you or set off an alarm which alerts nearby splicers. Its not complicated, simply being a test of reflexes but its better then simply needing enough lock picks to proceed.  Burial At Sea episode 2 doesn't have that much backtracking although the main portion of the game takes place in a \"hub\" of sorts giving you freedom to roam as you see fit. Follow the story and you will see most of what this DLC has to offer, yet even with the game basically telling you to explore and discover its still possible to miss that door code via audio log or that nod towards previous games hidden in a corner. Just by chance opening a door which was almost missed and not  part of any objective, led to a whole new area with upgrades and supplies. Another time curiosity may reward you with one of the biggest jump scares in recent times, almost seeming like Bioshock is saying \"told you so\".  Out of all of Bioshocks content on offer Burial At Sea part 2 nails the atmosphere perfectly. There are many areas of Rapture that are beyond eerie, and being forced to take your time due to your abilities only heightens the tension. Some very limited assets are re-used but they never seem shoehorned it to simply lengthen the DLC. Everything on offer here is present for a reason making Burial At Sea as powerful as any of the main Bioshock games.\n\n\nEpisode 1 was very generic in its approach to Rapture giving you only a hand full of tools and a style of play seen many times. Episode 2 does not make the same mistake. There are a very few minor missteps like re-spawning enemies from time to time or the odd difficulty spike. You have plenty of weapons at your disposal to fall back on but the slower stealth mechanics of Elisabeth makes sense and it forces you to play differently. Also seeing parts of Rapture that easily surpass that of anything offered in Bioshock 1 or 2 was a huge welcome, being able to observe the relationship between Big Daddy and Little Sister evolve  or realising the ties between Rapture and Columbia go way deeper then ever thought possible, Burial At Sea Episode 2 is worth the season pass asking price alone. Clocking in at over 3 hours this DLC a massive fan service to both Infinite and the original Bioshock games that no-one should miss.\n\nPhenomenal Plot\nEerie Atmosphere\nTies up loose ends\nFitting Conclusion\n\n5/5\n","timestamp_created":1397117308,"timestamp_updated":1397117308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9777008","author":{"steamid":"76561198080452099","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":705,"last_played":1474043791},"language":"russian","review":"Игра нормальная, собирал все что можно, искал нычки, а про сюжег забыл и как итог в конце было мало что понятно(.","timestamp_created":1397116927,"timestamp_updated":1397116927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9776885","author":{"steamid":"76561198075889668","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1458,"last_played":1397113846},"language":"english","review":"WHAT THE F***.......

The game I played was remarkably different than what was described.\n\nThe voice acting was excellent, and several principle characters were well fleshed out. The game is visually pretty at least at the very beginning. An interesting world is presented at the start, and the combat in theory seems fun and engaging.\n\nBut...\n\nOnly a few characters were actually explored, and several that were explored ended up making little sense (including the protagonist and antagonist). The game is visually stunning only at the beginning. Soon enough, you're thrown into darkness and sooty streets that resemble a stereotypical dungeon. There is little to no interaction with the environment or the NPCs of Columbia. The world ends up being unengaging because it's only the background. Yes, you can find recordings, but the recordings only address the central characters, not the society of Columbia. It is a massive untapped potential to actually immerse the player in Columbia. The two warring sides of Columbia are hardly touched upon; we hear only about the conflict in how it relates to Comstock and Elizabeth, and the war simply does not matter by the middle of the game. Civilians are not a part of Columbia. After the first act, they literally disappear except with a few scenes involving singing.\n\nThe combat is ridiculously long, annoying, and repetitive. Only two vigors are efficient enough to use regularly, and the guns are all generic and boring. There is no sneaking system, no real cover, and the skylines are hardly worth using at all because of how vulnerable you are on them (and they aren't present much of the game). The upgrades that existed do nothing to alter gameplay; they either increase your ammunition or damage. The vigor upgrades were much the same, only expanding the explosiveness or decreasing the salt costs. There is no easy way to see or find enemies; they blend in with the background (another statement to how dull Columbia becomes). I would often have to stand out in the open to draw fire just to find the last enemy in an area. Mini-bosses are only bullet sponges. \n\nDon't get me wrong; I enjoy combat in video games, but I dreaded this combat not because of difficulty but because it was so boring.\n\nThe real kicker is that this campaign only takes 10 hours. I'm a slow player; I like to explore nooks and crannies and double back to make sure I didn't miss anything. For me to beat this game in 10 hours felt like an insult to the amount of money I paid. Short campaigns are expected with, say, the Halo franchise, because Halo is defined by its multiplayer content. With Bioshock Infinite, the game's value is based entirely on its campaign. I could forgive 10 hours if they were enjoyable hours, but the majority of that time was taken up by previously described boring, repetitive combat.\n\nPerhaps this would have been worth it if the story was worthwhile. It was not. Bioshock Infinite's storyline plays out like it was written from finish to start to middle based upon two thoughts: \"It would be cool to write a story in which the final enemy is the player himself\" and, \"Wouldn't it be cool if there was this society based on worshipping the founding fathers of the US?\" These two links tie together about as well as can be expected at first glance: they don't. I easily guessed the relationship between the characters in the game, but I was still befuddled by where the game took me. It did not make sense.\n\nThe central themes of the game contradict each other messily. The theme of infinite timeline possibilities directly contradicts the game's central conflict:  that one man only has two futures, which are keyed upon one event in his life. It has to be so for the story to resolve neatly:  resolution via one contrived event. That, however, is again contradictory to the theme of infinite realities based upon small changes in each timeline, which is inherently messy and should be.\n\nThe ending in and of itself is written not to naturally end the game but to create a pretentious 'edgy' ending that simply does not fit into the game's themes. This game was not written for itself; it was written for its own vision and it takes itself far too seriously. The beginning and ending were predetermined, and the middle was scraped together to try to tie them into a whole story, whilst ignoring logic, human nature, and any aspect of realistic development of a man like Comstock and a society like Columbia.\n\nLong story short:  I would be able to forgive the awful combat if the story were worth slogging through thousands of enemies, but the story strives to be so ground-breaking all it manages to be is ostentatious. Save your money and buy a game that's actually fun to play.","timestamp_created":1396999323,"timestamp_updated":1397001448,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9766444","author":{"steamid":"76561197962335200","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1572,"last_played":1555790491},"language":"english","review":"My new favorite story driven FPS since Half Life 2. \n\nThis game will leave you feeling empty after the curtains close.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1396996389,"timestamp_updated":1396996389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9766216","author":{"steamid":"76561198126896705","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1580174166},"language":"english","review":"THIS GAME IS FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO PLAY GAMES LIKE TF2\n","timestamp_created":1396994079,"timestamp_updated":1396994079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9766179","author":{"steamid":"76561198003142121","num_games_owned":363,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":539,"last_played":1396111006},"language":"english","review":"Great fps, even better story line.

Like Rapture, the world around you tell a story of its own.\nWhile the original BioShock was about objectivism and Rand ideologies, Infinite is about racism, nationalism, patriotism, religion and \"social classes\", but it also presents these topics without preaching to you what is right or wrong.Its more or less a backdrop stage for the story to take place in.And oh boy, the story.\n\nI love a good story, and Infinite got a fantastic story.Its well paced, the characters are interesting and engaging.Elizabeth is a wonderful character, her design is spot on, her face is animated just enough to easily convey emotion without looking cartoonish, voice acting is also great overall. The story can be described as a giant puzzle and with every step they give you a new piece to place, and when the ending comes the final piece comes into play and everything starts making sense, its a moment of realization that really stuck with me.Also, the way the story is delivered is amazing.It knows the story it wants to tell, it takes your time to tell it, and it uses the fact it is a game to its advantage, this is a story that can only work in a game, not a movie or a book.\n\nThe gameplay is very distinct from the other BioShock games. While the original was about being trapped in a decaying utopia full of maniacs, Infinite is in a lively utopia and the gameplay changes to be more of a swashbuclking adventure that is very familiar, but also adds new mechanics like Tears and the Skyhook which is refreshing and makes the action that much more enjoyable and fast paced. You also won't find much backtracking in this BioShock, while the original more often than not would send you to find something to open a door and continue the story, Infinite is more linear but keeps the story going at a more engaging pace.Another thing to note is that the gameplay also reinforce the story and the relation between Booker and Elizabeth. I was afraid Elizabeth would just be an escort quest, but she is just as essential to the gameplay like she is to the story.\n\nBut then, this game is divisive.If you're expecting \"like-BioShock 1 game\" or \"complex mechanics\" this isn't the game for you.This is no BioShock 1, it feels like a BioShock game, but its also very different in the mechanics and tone.If you're expecting System Shock 2 levels on complexity, this isn't the game for you. If you don't like plot twists or some plot holes, this is a story about parallel universes and time travel, of course there is plot holes if you look too hard, what matters is how much that bothers you.I, for one, didn't noticed any plot holes that ruined the experience and i didn't noticed any while playing, its that thing people point out on forums, debate over and find explanations, but i couldn't care less.\n\nI really enjoyed my stay with BioShock Infinite, the DLC is also really good.\n\nIts the first game i wished never ended.It stucked with me.It made me feel connected to the characters.It made an emotional impact on me when it ended.You know what? If a game can do that to a person, it can't be bad, and BioShock Infinite isn't bad, it isn't flawless, but it is damn near perfect.\n\n\n*UPDATE for Steam Awards*\nI find it deserving of a Art Design award, Columbia is just a gorgeous to look at!","timestamp_created":1396991211,"timestamp_updated":1480004556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9765321","author":{"steamid":"76561197974790350","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":6856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4611,"last_played":1408110839},"language":"german","review":"Great Graphic ...
