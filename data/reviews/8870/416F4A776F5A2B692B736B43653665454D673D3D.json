Based on prior knowledge, this Bioshock was somewhat different from the others. Elizabeth was one of the main reasons I decided to play this game. Reviews at the time rated her one of the top helpful Ai characters of the time. The game felt like a Disney movie at times, but then It ended up blowing my mind.

I got it on a steam sale,  so the price talked me into grabbing it and im glad i did. Make sure to watch all the credits through to the ending. If its under 20$ I reccomend this game highly, but it was sadly much shorter than you would want. \n\nThe music was done well and sounded great and visually the game looks fantastic and runs well 3840 x 2160. They did a really good job with Elizabeth and all the different ways she interacts with things throughout the game if you lead here to different spots. Makes her feel less of a bot and more of a real charecter.

Здесь нет ничего лишнего — ни «приклеенной» RPG-составляющей, ни надуманных сюжетных поворотов. Геймплей, сценарий, графика, музыка в синхронном звучании создают поистине потрясающую стимпанковскую атмосферу. Когда ты проходишь по солнечным улицам парящей над небесным сводом Колумбии, слышишь приятную музыку, раздающуюся из каждого радиоустройства, подбираешь всякую дребедень, а твои действия сопровождаются характерным «биошоковским» треском и хрустом, то понимаешь, что мир Infinite совершенно уникален, и одно лишь нахождение в нем становится настоящим праздником.\n\nДизайнеры уровней проделали, не побоюсь этого слова, грандиозную работу. Внешний облик Колумбии заставит трепетать сердца даже самых притязательных любителей графики. Локации разнообразны, декорации на протяжении всего прохождения постоянно меняются, каждый квадратный метр города полон каких-то мелких деталей.

As a diehard fan of this series, I might be a little overcritical of it, with the knowledge that content was cut to make release, but that doesn't stop the content that is presented from being incredibly compelling. For people wondering if they should play this game that have played (and liked) the previous bioshock games, I would unquestioningly reccommend this game, but if previous installments hadn't yet been played, I'd first reccommend Bioshock 1, as a grand start, and 2 and Infinite in equal footing afterward. And if they were still ravenous for more, and didn't mind dated graphics (or had the computer knowhow to convene with the modding community and make use of new models), System Shock 2 is (at least in my nostalgic mind) the high point in the series. But the step down from its heights to Bioshock Infinite are so minute that I am merely knitpicking, now.
