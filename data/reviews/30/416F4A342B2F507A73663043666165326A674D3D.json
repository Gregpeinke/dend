Try not to misunderstand me however, it's essentially Counter-Strike yet set in The Second Great War time, with each group getting their separate weapons to battle with. With the vast majority of my time I've figured out how to find 2 seperate networks, basically PvE (players against bots in the contrary group) and I've stayed with that. However I'm certain the interactivity is static among that and the conventional PvP battles that you would expect out of Counter-Strike.\n\nTHE Upside:\n\nThe Interactivity:\n\nAs conventional as it sounds, the by and large ongoing interaction circle is still similarly as reviving as could be expected. Indeed, even almost 20 years after the fact the game can feel similarly as amusing to play as it did when it came out. However while you are restricted to an unmistakable measure of firearms (as I'll indicate beneath) it doesn't degrade as much from the overall feel of the game.\n\nThe custom substance:\n\nWith the age of any game comes the expectation that capable fans will go along and give additional player-made substance to a game, and with Day of Rout this is particularly so. There are Huge loads of extra guides that you can insight. It's totally an or more that the game exists in the Goldsrc motor as there's an abundant measure of individuals that are anxious to give new substance that everybody can appreciate.\n\nThe Tasteful:\n\nThis is more for individuals who long for a more established day. While indeed, my recess with this game is undeniably later than a heap of others that actually play this game today (I've placed in just ~6 hours as of this audit) this game actually gives a somewhat quieting and nostalgic stylish on account of its age and its general feel, something I would like over its more present day (and more famous) partner, Counter-Strike.\n\nThe People group:\n\nWhile this offers a great deal with the abovementioned, it's likewise truly ideal to experience truly cordial and inviting individuals to have the option to partake in the game with. Huge and sweeping, it's great to observe that a many individuals that play Day of Rout will more often than not be on the more pleasant side, making my time in Day of Rout significantly more agreeable. Each time I bounce on, I anticipate playing with individuals I've become acquainted with!\n\nTHE Terrible:\n\nThe Weapon Choice:\n\nIn Day of Rout you're compelled to pick one out of a few classes, which is genuinely commonplace, however rather than getting a decision of loadout you're left with preset weapons on one or the other side. A shooter is ordinarily stayed with his separate quick firing rifle, an Expert Sergeant is left with his individual SMG, etc. While it's fine having the option to pick between classes, it's not difficult to see that the decision between weapons overall is somewhat poor.\n\nThe Age:\n\nThe most concerning issue that this game countenances is that, clearly, it's very nearly twenty years old. On par with what it is, you'll need to become acclimated to the substance with no guarantees, in light of the fact that there's positively zero chance of Valve returning to add more substance. While you'll in any case have the option to get a very sizable amount of player-made substance, it's conceivable you'll never see a legitimate game update for Day of Rout again.\n\nTHE End:\n\nWhile it's exceptionally obvious that this game is matured and it slipped close's mind, the networks that actually exist in the game keep it particularly alive. While it isn't quite so flourishing as most games in this age, at the cost it will be it's unquestionably worth the outing back on schedule to partake in some exemplary 2000s trickeries.","timestamp_created":1641760912,"timestamp_updated":1641760912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":31,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.764121472835540771","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107687965","author":{"steamid":"76561199103729523","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5,"playtime_at_review":51,"last_played":1660420460},"language":"spanish","review":"muy

Don't get me wrong though, it's pretty much just Counter-Strike but set in the World War 2 era, with each team getting their respective weapons to fight with. With most of my time I've managed to find 2 seperate communities, primarily PvE (players against bots on the opposite team) and I've stuck with that. Though I'm sure the gameplay is static between that and the traditional PvP fights that you would expect out of Counter-Strike.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nAs generic as it sounds, the overall gameplay loop is still just as refreshing as ever. Even nearly 20 years later the game can feel just as fun to play as it did when it came out. Though while you are limited to a very specific amount of guns (as I'll specify below) it doesn't detract as much from the general feel of the game.\n\nThe custom content:\n\nWith the age of any game comes the hope that talented fans will come along and provide extra player-made content for a game, and with Day of Defeat this is especially so. There are TONS of additional maps that you can experience. It's absolutely a plus that the game exists in the Goldsrc engine as there's an ample amount of people that are eager to provide fresh content that everyone can enjoy.\n\nThe Aesthetic:\n\nThis is more for people who yearn for an older day. While yes, my playtime with this game is far more recent than a load of others that still play this game today (I've put in only ~6 hours as of this review) this game still provides a relatively calming  and nostalgic aesthetic thanks to its age and its overall feel, something I would prefer over its more modern (and more popular) counterpart, Counter-Strike.\n\nThe Communities:\n\nWhile this shares a lot with the above, it's also really nice to encounter really friendly and welcoming people to be able to enjoy the game with. As big and expansive as communities for most Goldsrc games can be, it's nice to find that a lot of people that play Day of Defeat tend to be on the nicer side, making my time in Day of Defeat a lot more enjoyable. Each time I hop on, I look forward to playing with the people I've gotten to know!\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nThe Weapon Selection:\n\nIn Day of Defeat you're forced to choose one out of several classes, which is fairly typical, but instead of getting a choice of loadout you're stuck with preset weapons on either side. A rifleman is typically stuck with his respective semi-auto rifle, a Master Sergeant is stuck with his respective SMG, and so on. While it's fine being able to pick between classes, it's easy to see that the choice between weapons in general is rather poor.\n\nThe Age:\n\nThe biggest problem that this game faces is that, quite obviously, it's almost 2 decades old. As good as it is, you'll have to get used to the content as-is, because there's absolutely no chance of Valve coming back to add more content. While you'll still be able to get more than enough player-made content, it's possible you'll never see a proper game update for Day of Defeat again.\n\nTHE CONCLUSION:\n\nWhile it's very apparent that this game is aged and near-forgotten, the communities that still exist in the game keep it very much alive. While it isn't as thriving as most games in this age, for the price it is it's certainly worth the trip back in time to enjoy some classic 2000s shenanigans.","timestamp_created":1639291911,"timestamp_updated":1639291911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579066634178161621","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105463951","author":{"steamid":"76561199063851420","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1638971143},"language":"turkish","review":"1 KURUŞ HAKETMEZ İNTERNETTEN ÇÖP ADAM AÇIN OYNAYIN DAHA İYİ..","timestamp_created":1638971211,"timestamp_updated":1638971211,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105439741","author":{"steamid":"76561198038324496","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":548,"last_played":1658088784},"language":"brazilian","review":"como eu posso falar desse jogo ?\n\né de guerra entre os americano e os alemão (não é um simulador óbvio), é legalzinho mas tem muito viciado, eu mesmo que não manjo de day of defeat apanho, não tem servidor brasileiro, apenas gringos e acho que só isso.\n\nrecomendo comprar em promoção, mas o source é melhor e tem servidor brasileiro.\n","timestamp_created":1638927809,"timestamp_updated":1638927809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105367954","author":{"steamid":"76561199093326431","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1638818557},"language":"english","review":"Battlefield ama sudan ucuz","timestamp_created":1638816296,"timestamp_updated":1638816296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483271360397338867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105303343","author":{"steamid":"76561198969313504","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1638095243},"language":"english","review":"güzel bu arada","timestamp_created":1638722312,"timestamp_updated":1638722312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483271360397338867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105281918","author":{"steamid":"76561198928624932","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1659025907},"language":"schinese","review":"v社的宝藏游戏，直到今天依然有可玩性","timestamp_created":1638700991,"timestamp_updated":1638700991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105213470","author":{"steamid":"76561199174728233","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":654,"last_played":1658260962},"language":"turkish","review":"oynanır.sunucularda toplamda 60-70 kişi oluyor ama sarıyor","timestamp_created":1638623869,"timestamp_updated":1649850892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105181353","author":{"steamid":"76561198210505668","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":272,"playtime_at_review":1878,"last_played":1660492240},"language":"english","review":"Great game.

Servers now are few and far between, so I thought I'd write a review before its demise. heheh","timestamp_created":1638084629,"timestamp_updated":1638084629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104445959","author":{"steamid":"76561198973018721","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":571,"last_played":1642111154},"language":"turkish","review":"2 cisini alın bundan daha iyi o","timestamp_created":1638057901,"timestamp_updated":1638057901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104444541","author":{"steamid":"76561198419867303","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":28,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1638060008},"language":"spanish","review":"esta muy bueno :)","timestamp_created":1638057091,"timestamp_updated":1638057091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+/Pzsf0Cfae2jgM="}
