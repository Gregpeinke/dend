Now I know what you all think, \"But Yulaw isn't Killing just like Left 4 Dead?\" and you'd be right, except these aren't Zombies their mutants and sorry but I find mutants to be far cooler and scarier than Zombies.  (Not that that's got anything to do with me being a mutant or anything!) In fact from what I've found out Killing floor came out long before Left 4 Dead starting as a humble little mod.  This game is just so much fun to play with different character classes and loads of big beefy weapons like Flame thowers, Chainsaws, buzzsaw firing crossbows (no I did not make that up), rocket launchers, energy weapons and even classic pump action, double-barrel and automatic Shotguns to choose from.  All I can say is forget Left 4 Dead and the Zombie mode in COD black ops this is the real Co-op survival shooter right here.  Its even gotten better due to new DLC and added weapons and maps, and two objective modes.  Now while the game is ugly as sin (it is using a slightly moderfied Unreal engine after all) its how it plays.  As I mentioned in the begining there are different classes, 7 infact to choose from all with their own unique strengths, weakness, weapon load outs and can be leveled up as you kill or perform tasks.  Team work is still key, with the goal of the game to survive to the final wave and fight the end boss the Paitriark and yes that is a minigun and rocket launcher stuck to his arm.  Or if your playing the objective mode then its performing tasks.  However, while team work is encurage in the game, it tends to eccurage more of a compedative way of playing, which is sort of a disadvantage to this games premiss, one time you find your self in a team full of people working together, while most of the time you'll be in a team full of idiots who just what to play the game like a Call of Duty title or just be dicks with themselves and others.  Despite this though its a great little game and I couldn't recommend it enough, and with the possibility of a sequile in the works why not give this game a try.","timestamp_created":1341882087,"timestamp_updated":1396921201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5866612","author":{"steamid":"76561198055720267","num_games_owned":527,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1243,"last_played":1417365811},"language":"english","review":"get this game please","timestamp_created":1341877152,"timestamp_updated":1341877152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3050709","author":{"steamid":"76561198016588674","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":7054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2342,"last_played":1502220405},"language":"english","review":"There are few games that can match up to Killing Floor for shooting zombies' shit up with your mates.
