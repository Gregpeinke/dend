Сколько в неё играл небыло ни багов , ни вылетов , ни фризов идеально! Настолько атмосферная игра что в неё хочется играть и играть , проходить раз-за-разом. Графика тут бесподобна(конечно если сравнить с теперешними играми , но на тот момент игра выглядела очень красиво , да и щас она для меня в списке красивых игр). Очень красивая игра , какая тут всегда солнечная и приятная погода ну просто сказка. \n\nНа этот раз мы оправились в город Колумбия так называемый \"Небесный город\". Это же надо додуматься совместить дирижабли привязать их и построить на них дом , прям гении! Уже с первых часов игры , она затягивает тебя и ты все больше углубляешься в неё. Мне нравится 2 главный герой игры Элизабет , настолько невиную и добрую девушку сделали , что её хочется спасать всю жизнь) Еще забавно когда умираешь у вас нет надписи вроде \"DEAD\" или \"Вы умерли\" , \"Продолжить\" , а вас эта миленькая девушка спасает , делает масаж сердца и тем самым спасает вас!\n[list]\n    [*]Геймлей - тут конечно не может не радовать , он всегда разный! Будь вы метким стрелком херачте из разных пушек , или вы увлекаетесь магией и хотите стать черодеем , тогда способ убийств с помощью магии для вас! У вас в распоряжении целый выбор заклинаний которые можно использовать против врагов! Будь то смертоносные сороки которые пожирают все на своем пути , до маленьких кристаликов которые поджигаю все и вся. У нашей так называемой невинницы есть способность открывать какие-то разрывы куда мы можем переместиться , она что телепорт?)(на этом можно сэкономить деньги на путешествиях)\n[/list]\n[list]\n    [*]Саундтрек - тут чисто для патриотов , и если вы считаете истинным патриотом Колумбии то вы обязаны встать на защиту саундтрека и прослушать все иммеющиеся данные композиции!\n[/list]\n[list]\n    [*]Атмосфера - еще раз повторюсь , но атмосфера в игре очень приятная и душевная. Что стоило зайти в подвал взять гитару и Элизабет как давай устривать пляски и напевать песню) Вечные их терки кто прав кто не прав , как они ведут манеру общения и в итоге каждый доверяет ему свою жизнь и они начинаю все ближе и ближе сближаться друг с другом.\n[/list]\n[list]\n    [*]Сюжет - сюжет в игре очень интересный , сильный , интригующий. С самого момента как мы спасаем Элизабет начинается полная варкханалия , [spoiler]За нами гонится какая-то огроменная железная птица , которая хочет разарвать меня на куски! Поднимается вся стража колумбии чтобы не отпустить нас[/spoiler]. По ходу игры мы узнаем что Комсток не такой уж и добренький дяденька каким его считают. \n[/list]\n    В Bioshock Infinite должен поиграть каждый , даже если вы не играли в предыдущие части ничего страшного! В игре я как понимаю новая история , новые герои.

Some better than others. This is a \"spiritual\" successor of the first BioShock. The setup, gameplay, and story is very reminiscent of the first yet manages to be its own unique entity. Even though I enjoyed playing this game more than the previous BioShock, the first one is a more complete game and story.\n\nWhat's amazing about the first BioShock is how it tells the story in everything it does -- gameplay, enemies, NPCs, environments, etc. The level of detail is amazing. Infinite is similar in scope and scale yet there are many things that go unexplained. The simple explanation of your powers is not covered at all. And why don't any of your enemies have the same powers? There are a lot of glaring omissions like these throughout the game, yet it's only because the game tries to tackle so many things that most games, movies, and even books don't even come close to.\n\nWhile with its own faults I found the world of BioShock Infinite a world I constantly wanted to return to. The first Bioshock is completely terrifying. I remember playing the first one for 15 minutes and not picking it back up months afterwards because it was so terrifying. Infinite, while sinister, is much more colorful and ideallyic. Your side character does a lot to carry the burden. She's remeniscent of Disney's Belle from Beauty and the Beast. It's an amazing attempt at creating a side character that doesn't get in the way and is also likeable from start to finish. The failings of the side character feel more like the the constraints of the technology and less so than the constrainst of the creatives. Overall it works.\n\nAt its best, gun fights are a blast. You'll swing from skylines, have brutal melee kills, and the powers your acquire are more lethal than ever. About half way through the game it becomes a little monotonous and easy the more powers you acquire. While still fun, it never transcends is core mechanic. The environments and set pieces get really creative and exciting. But it feels like the creatives behind Inifinite are tired of this same old shoot 'em as well and are more interested in fleshing out the rest of the world. The burdnes of creating a AAA title.\n\nThe most interesting parts are when you're walking through a town and seeing the citizens go about their daily business. \"Social norms\" are turned on its head; pulling and blending from historical past and fictional altered futures. The expansion of the world is also executed through many collectible audio-tapes and viewable old timey movie machines. While creative and well-done in their own right, I don't feel like these break up the overall flow of the game. They become more annoying that enriching. That being said I'm glad they're in the game, I just wish there were more scenes that you play through, rather than 'recordings'.\n\nThe ending, that I won't spoil, is terrific. It really does save the game from being a rehash of the first. It easily goes down as one of the all time best endings of a game. The ending is enough to replay the game to see it with new eyes.\n\nBioShock Inifinite is a great game that feels shackeled by the confines of AAA pressures and constraints. If only those shackles were released would we be getting a game that defies expectations. I'm glad Ken Levine and company have moved on to new pastures as their newest work is bound to be ahead of them.","timestamp_created":1463324235,"timestamp_updated":1463324235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23000881","author":{"steamid":"76561198105803309","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":569,"last_played":1463317425},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock infinite... to start off, Bioshock infinite has upgraded a lot of his previous games.

There are two things that it does that are absolutely outstanding and make it unforgettable: the overall atmosphere, and the character that is Elizabeth.\n\nStarting with the atmosphere, the game takes place in the sky city of Columbia in the early 1900s. Led by the charismatic prophet Father Comstock, the city is a utopia for people to reinvent themselves and repent while serving a higher purpose as they are being led by Father Comstock and, eventually, the Seed of the Prophet to the Promised Land. Booker DeWitt, the protagonist, has come here to find Elizabeth, the aforementioned Seed of the Prophet, to wipe away his debt. As you progress through this utopia, you are condemned as a \"false shepherd\" who is trying to lead the people back to sin and take away their lamb, and you must fight through the city to retrieve the lamb from these fanatics. The gold covering of this city slowly comes unraveled, and you see the rotten underbelly that is the power structure, and that this utopia is the result of manipulating events to brainwash vast quantities of people. As the story comes to its conclusion, it becomes rather mind boggling. I've beaten the game twice and still have a hard time understanding everything, but if you put in some research, it is actually a very well conceived, yet convulted, plot.\n\nThe other shining star is Elizabeth. Part of the way through the game, she joins you in your quest through Columbia, and is extremely helpful. She scrounges up money all the time, will toss you ammo, health, and salts in the heat of combat when you most need it, pop open locks to help you find a mountain of money with some upgrades next to it, open tears to give you a tactical advantage, and call out important targets during combat, from firemen to snipers to patriots. It stands out in stark contrast to the good old days of games like WoW where you had to hope that your complete idiot of an NPC wouldn't aggro 6 mobs at once; escorting NPCs in those instances was a nightmare, whereas Elizabeth keeps you from getting massacred by the hordes of Vox and fanatical Columbians. On top of her usefulness, she is an exceptionally intelligent person. She grew up in a cage, and has self taught herself many of the skills that make her an asset, as well as becoming a brilliant thinker, while still having that childlike awe and desire, as evidenced by her desire to travel to Paris. \n\nAlas, the gameplay is not on par with the rest of the game. The gunplay is pretty ordinary, and vigors (special powers akin to magic that have been fabricated with some ridiculous science that is akin to some damn good drugs) are mostly underwhelming. They are quite useful in ordinary fights, but they just don't do anything useful against patriots or handymen. The skyhook makes for wide open firefights with lots of options whenever a sky rail is available, but most using it as a melee weapon just isn't going to cut it. On top of this, the game is effectively a corridor. Kill a room of baddies, collect loot, go open a side door to get a voxophone and some money, continue following the corridor to the next group of baddies, interact with this NPC, BOOM more baddies just spawned where you just killed them.\n\nPersonally, I loved Bioshock Infinite. I can't remember meeting a more interesting character than Elizabeth, and the gameplay, while pretty annoying, is bearable due to the extraordinary world there is to experience.

Aslında buna oyun demek ne kadar doğru bilemiyorum. Bir yerden sonra hikayesi, görselliği, sesleri ve yaşayan dünyası ile içinize işleyen bir sanat eseri gibidir bu yapımlar çünkü.\nBioShock Infinite, kabına, ismine ve onu karşılayan çoğu tanıma sığmayan bir hikaye fakat bundan önemlisi BioShock Infinite “derdi” olan bir oyun. Ken Levine ve Irrational Games ekibinin bir takım sıkıntıları var dile getirmek istedikleri, bu insanları yapımcı olarak, üreten olarak yaşamla ilgili rahatsız eden şeyler var ve bunun sonucu parasal kaygıların ötesinde söylemek istediklerini korkmadan ifade eden bir yapım olarak ortaya çıkıyor.\n\n\nBioShock Infinite, oldukça sevilen ve benzer konseptte üretilmiş BioShock serilerinin devamı niteliğinde fakat bu hikayesel bir devamlılık değil. BioShock nasıl System Shock serilerinin ruhani takipçisi ise, BioShock Infinite’te, temellerine sadık fakat BioShock oyunlarıyla farklı bir evrende geçiyor.\nInfinite’in hikayesi, daha önce BioShock serilerinde olduğu gibi alternatif bir dünya tarihini kapsıyor, özellikle Amerikan tarihini alıp, değiştiren ve güzeller güzeli uçan şehir Columbia’yı bu akışa entegre eden Infinite ekibi, gerçekten çok başarılı bir dünya çıkartmış.\n\n[i] Infinite’in dünyası, Ayn Rand’ın Objektivizm felsefesini kendi içine katıp yoğuran, korkutucu, büyük, olasılıkların sonsuz olduğu fakat bir o kadar ışıl ışıl bir dünya. Amerika’nın karanlık tarihini olduğu gibi alıp, ırk, din, cinsiyetçilik ve bunun gibi pek çok tabu olan konuyu korkusuzca işleyen Irrational, bu konuda ayakta alkışlanmayı hak ediyor doğrusu. Gökyüzünün ötesinde uçan mucize şehir Columbia’ya ilk ayak bastığınız vakit burasının bir cennet olduğunu düşünmeye başlıyorsunuz, insanları, yaşamları ve kimlikleriyle gerçek anlamda yaşayan bir yer Columbia. [/i]\n\n\nİlk defa kendimi bir şehrin içinde böylesine kaybettim. Yeryüzünden yukarıda, bambaşka bir gerçeklik içerisinde varlığını sürdüren Columbia, yapıları, mimarisi, heykelleri, sanat eserleri ve teknolojisi ile sizi girer girmez büyülemeyi başarıyor. Infinite’in en önemli yanı bunu size verirken, birden bire almayı bilmesi. “Burası fazla iyi, fazla güzel, burada ne gibi bir macera yaşayabilirsin ki?” diye sorduğunuz vakit, Columbia’nın Columbia olması için yapılan seçimlerin karanlık sonuçları ile karşılaşıyorsunuz. Infinite ilk etapta Amerika’nın kirli geçmişi ile dolu sandıktan “ırkçılık” konusunu çıkartıyor ve çat diye önünüze koyuyor, bu geçiş öyle hızlı oluyor ki, oyuncu olarak durumun alenenliğinden rahatsız oluyorsunuz, oyunlarda bu tarz konuların işlenmesine alışık olmadığımızdan, bu tarz bir rahatsız olma reaksiyonu ile ilk kez karşılaştım.\nInfinite’in işlediği tabular, belki sahip olduğu muhteşem görselliği olmasaydı bu kadar dramatik gelmezdi, ilk BioShock’a selam veren girişinden itibaren, oyunun dudak ısırtan görsel tasarımı ile birlikte karşımıza çıkan parıl parıl Columbia, işlediği konularla öyle büyük bir tezat oluşturuyor ki, Irrational, Infinite’in oldukça karanlık konseptlerini karşınıza çıkarttığı zaman, bu insana iki kat daha ağır geliyor.\n","timestamp_created":1463162703,"timestamp_updated":1463162703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529607057571411133","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22959229","author":{"steamid":"76561198152038214","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":1051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":753,"last_played":1467691049},"language":"schinese","review":"一句话～物超所值，这游戏剧情是我见过的游戏里比较好的一个（点题～无限）不剧透了，慢慢玩吧，祝大家玩的愉快","timestamp_created":1463162050,"timestamp_updated":1463162050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506437778472900391","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22958742","author":{"steamid":"76561197987188643","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1038,"last_played":1445073443},"language":"english","review":"I'm not fond of dark games, so I had difficulties with the previous games of the series.\nAfter having seen several bright presentation videos of this one, I couldn't help but buy it.\n\nI never quite adopted the gameplay, but somehow, through the story, I always went further.

It warms my heart only writing about it. So good. First, the game looks very good, and the best thing about it is the warm color palette. Plus a very intresting art style. And killer facial animations. And that's about it about the graphics.\nBut u aren't buying Bioshock Infinite for the graphics. You're buying it for an amazing universe, with breathtaking vistas of a floating city. For a great background. For a great story, that will mess with your brain. For real characters. For a lot of action and speed (except when you don't get any of the two).\nMy real problem is that you just don't get enough combat.

For the record, there is a great deal here to like, but it has plenty of problems that were not present in the previous games.\n\nThe graphics are honestly some of the best I have seen to date. The art and technology combined really bring Columbia to life. Truly incredible stuff. Elizabeth, her relationship with Booker, and the story surrounding her are amazing. Her AI is quite good too (although her \"vending machine\" antics broke the immersion for me). As far as the port is considered, I think it is nearly top notch with very, very few issues. Also, the gunplay was overall a step up from Bio1.\n\nAlthough I didn't go in with high expectations overall after hearing Totalbiscuit's impressions, I was really disappointed with the linearity of the level design. Not having stacking health and eve/salt like Bio1 and 2 means you will be frantically racing around the level if Elizabeth doesn't happen to have anything good to throw at you. Although Columbia has tons of NPC’s that converse, virtually none of them will speak to you (through for some awkward reason, many of them seem inclined to speak at you) rendering their existence one dimensional. Speaking of dimensions, the way the “tear” ability is used in combat is totally arbitrary and situational; sometimes you will have many options at your disposal, and sometimes you have few options when they are needed most.\n\nIt isn’t really a bad game per say, but it has more gameplay mechanics removed from previous titles than added to really flatten the combat significantly. The best I can say for this game is that it is a visual marvel most of the time, and Elizabeth is a showcase of great game AI that helps build a truly compelling character. The worst I can say? In 2007 I think Bioshock was a 10/10. It hasn’t aged perfectly (gunplay is a little clunky), but it has virtually none of the issues I listed that Infinite has. I just can’t fully recommend Infinite with so many other good shooters out there.","timestamp_created":1462939385,"timestamp_updated":1462939403,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49542689323425293","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22904244","author":{"steamid":"76561198088251284","num_games_owned":510,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":749,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1462980692},"language":"english","review":"A great game with a great ending, cant recomend enough.\n\n","timestamp_created":1462927673,"timestamp_updated":1462927673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22903617","author":{"steamid":"76561198032407917","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":634,"last_played":1545878214},"language":"french","review":"Je n'ai pas accroché aux premiers Bioshock et là je me suis dit que j'allais me lancer dans un autre univers.
