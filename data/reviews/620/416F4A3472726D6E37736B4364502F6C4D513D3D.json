It starts off slowly, re-familiarising you with the mechanics of the first game amongst the ruins of the Aperture Science facility, going through test chambers you played in the first game (albeit, a lot more dilapidated now). But soon, the game changes once again and you have to face more challenging test chambers, with a little help (but not much) from the core that woke you up and wants to help you escape, Wheatley (voiced by the brilliant Stephen Merchant). About halfway through though, the game changes entirely, widening the scope of everything entirely. You have to get to grips with some totally new mechanics, and you learn a lot more about the history of Aperture and GLaDOS along the way. A great game, with some amazing voice acting once again from Ellen McLain (as GLaDOS) and Stephen Merchant.

And I really do mean perfect. I first played it in 2011, and nothing to date has surpassed it for me. Don't believe me? Explanation: I first bought this masterpiece knowing nothing about the story or franchise. I just saw the commercial, and it kept mentioning science, so I figured it would be pretty good. Lord Gaben, was I wrong. It surpassed 'pretty good.' To call it that would be disrespectful. It gave me nerdgasms within the first minute. Why do I love it? Because it loves me. It touches on fields that are very dear to me, all with an awesome vibe. It explores robotics, psychology, chemical engineering, and art with a cynical-yet-unbelievably-intelligent voice. It is simultaneously an absurdist sci-fi game and a pshychological horror experience. Beneath the incredibly dark witticisms of GlaDOS, there is a somewhat disturbing theme of death and insanity, and in fact, this is actually the primary message in the first game. On a side note, people who scoff at Aperture's ridiculous policies that are too funny and bizzare to be true, think again. The founder of the company, the Venerable Cave Johnson, had a sense of humor and a disregard for the lives of his employees and for federal regulations, so, naturally, he built the facility to his meet his insane whims. I urge you to play the game from that standpoint. It is even better that way. Anyway, back to the actual review: the game also actually teaches you some science as Newtonian physics are often central to the puzzles, which led some schools to actually use the game as part of their science curriculum! I digress and ramble, so, to simplify and augment: This is a fantastic game with a fantastic story and first class writing and voice-acting that is actually perfect. Paired with a genius soundtrack, a ridiculously satisfying co-op, an innovative level designer and an astounding web-comic, this is a must-buy. Just get it. You'll thank me later.\n\n\n\nP.S.

At first when I heard that it was a puzzle game I was hesitant because I don't like puzzles and never have taken an interest, but this game has proven me wrong! The singleplayer and multiplayer sequences are like playing the game twice! Once you get into it each puzzle gets more complicated but more fun to complete!
