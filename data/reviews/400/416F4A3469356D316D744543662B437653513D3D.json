Isn't this Portal?\n\nSorry, I was confusing this game with Codename: S.T.E.A.M. (a game which I do not own and do not care about).\n\nAnyway, Portal is a cool-guy standalone game by Valve, obviously. Where were you when this game came out? Probably in your basement waiting for Half-Life 2: Episode Two (I don't know when that game came out, so maybe you were in your basement waiting for Half-Life 3, I don't know). This game was released all the way back in 2007, and for some reason I bought it seven years later when I already had and played the sequel.\n\nPortal's gameplay is nothing like we've ever seen before, something that has never been done before. It uses portals, NO DUR! It's got cool puzzles and cool mechanics, nothing more to say. The mechanics are innovative and easy to learn. The Portal Gun is the center object of the game, if you've seen the trailer you probably know what it does. Go in one portal, come out the other and move it around with the gun it come from (BRING IT AROOUUND TOWN SQUIDWARD).\n\nThe story is a bit under wraps, it's kind of hard to notice if you don't pay much attention to it. This game does have a somewhat noticable story, but you'll be focusing too much on the puzzles to notice (look for the Easter eggs, bro!).\n\nThe game, to be honest, is short. About 18 maps in total (as in maps I don't mean test chambers/levels, I mean actual Source maps). The game is very fun though, I'll tell you that.\n\nThis game started the very trend that Valve always goes through when creating video games: Make a game, make an awesome sequel to that game, stop, and make every person that played and liked that game ticked off and die of hype. \n\nThe only criticism I have with Portal is the short number of mechanics and the game being short in general. But all in all, Portal is a very fun game. In case you didn't know, this game has WAY less mechanics than Portal 2 does.\n\nPortal is very, very cool. It got an awesome sequel, a few mods both for that sequel and this game itself, and an ever-growing workshop for its sequel. But it just needs a little something, let me tell you what it is: ANOTHER SEQUEL. HEY VALVE, CAN YOU HEAR ME SCREAMING AT YOU, DEMANDING THAT YOU MAKE A PORTAL 3?!  Probably not, it's not like you'd care or anything.\n\nThank you for reading this somewhat short review on Portal. Have a nice day, and thank you for flying with American Airlines. PEACE OUT!\n \n9.0/10\n\n\nYEAH SCIENCE!\n","timestamp_created":1448658744,"timestamp_updated":1448658744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19315814","author":{"steamid":"76561198257402946","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":80,"last_played":1457735161},"language":"english","review":"It is a good game but a bit frustrating and one of the fun things about it is when you do an everlasting series of portals","timestamp_created":1448652191,"timestamp_updated":1448652191,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19313089","author":{"steamid":"76561198091421464","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1492663220},"language":"english","review":"The cake isn't really a lie.... unless it's a spy.","timestamp_created":1448645120,"timestamp_updated":1448645120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540560066699981689","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19313004","author":{"steamid":"76561198098660887","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":154,"last_played":1448648094},"language":"schinese","review":"相当有创意的游戏模式，非常适合一玩。","timestamp_created":1448644873,"timestamp_updated":1448644873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19312836","author":{"steamid":"76561198189662691","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":466,"last_played":1448980116},"language":"english","review":"I can't even beleive for almost a decadeI let myself be robbed of the utter joy I got from playing this game.

As I go through this review, keep in mind that this was an addon game to the Half Life Orange Box at first, not intending to be a stand alone game.\n\nThe beautiful Source engine is put to major use here as you navigate through a convoluted (and darkly hilarious) maze, the only reward being Delicious Cake and Grief Counseling. GLaDOS is one of my favorite villains, using only psychological manipulation to harm you. \n\nThis is one of those games that you are going to need your sound on for. The puzzles do seem simple at first glance, but many are much harder then one might imagine, and have many unthought of solutions. By using certain techniques you can prop open doors and even avoid killing companion cube (sadly, I couldn't find a way to take him with me...).\n\n[b][u]The Doctor's Final Report: 10/10[/u][/b]; Yes, the game is short.

Mein Herz schlug etwas höher als ich schon das Valve-Logo gesehen habe und anschließend die dazugehörige Half-Life 2-Optik! Auch die Soundkulisse im Spiel stammt aus der Half-Life Bibliothek. Das gewohnt minimalistische Menü und dann dieses \"Portal-Gerät\", dieses Gerät, das, wenn es das Ding wirklich geben würde, mehr Wert wäre als Weißgottwas, oder wie es im Spiel heißt \"mehr als Ihre Organe, Testsubjekt XYZ\"! \nDieses faszinierende Tool erinnert an die Anti-Gravitationswaffe die man bei Half-Life 2 gegen Ende erhält. Jene Waffe gilt immer noch als eine der besten Waffen die es in einem Computerspiel je gab! Und aus denselben Studios kommt nun das Portal-Gerät: ein Gerät mit dem man ein Ein- und ein Austrittsportal erzeugen kann dank der man im Laufe des Spiels anfängt anders zu denken: gewohnte Barierren gibt es plötzlich nicht mehr, man bewegt sich ganz anders, man nimmt die Umwelt anders war. Zuletzt hatte ich so ein Gefühl bei Spielen wie Assassin's Creed, Mirror's Edge oder Just Cause. Spiele bei denen man sich anders bewegen lernt. Bei Portal ist das natürlich nochmal intensiver.\n\nVor allem ist Portal auch wegen der Story ein Hit: Das letzte Level ist wahnsinnig gut, macht richtig Spaß und rundet das Gesamterlebnis perfekt ab. Und auch der Anfang stimmt: man ist scheinbar ein Versuchsobjekt, gefangen in einer durchsichtigen Zelle aus der man rausgelassen wird, um sich mit der Portal-Technik vertraut zu machen. Man sieht nie eine Person, einzig eine Roboterstimme die man über Lautsprecher hört, gibt einem Anweisungen, denen man natürlich brav folgt. Dieser Stil war auch entscheidend für The Stanley Parable - die haben sich hier einiges abgeschaut!\n\nIch bin auf den zweiten Teil gespannt, vielleicht spiele ich bis dahin die Bonuslevel die es mittlerweile für das Spiel gibt!","timestamp_created":1448444570,"timestamp_updated":1448444570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.573720276355743408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19259188","author":{"steamid":"76561198129964437","num_games_owned":499,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":572,"last_played":1566694196},"language":"brazilian","review":"Portal é um jogo INCRÍVEL! Começando como um simples joguinho de passa-tempo no pacote Orange Box, Portal tornou-se um dos games mais divertidos, empolgantes e carismáticos da história! Provavelmente a Valve não tinha reconhecido o excelente trabalho que fez... E que empresa, hein? Até um passa-tempo quase gratuito conseguiu ser caprichado e divertido o suficiente pra ganhar a chance de milhares de jogadores pelo mundo! Eles não entregam qualquer besteira... Esse jogo me surpreendeu!\n\nO jogo além de ter uma trama sensacional e personagens minimalistas e extremamente carismáticos, consegue divertir, empolgar e desafiar todos os tipos de jogadores! Os fãs de estratégia vão adorar os puzzles, os fãs de suspense e horror vão adorar a atmosfera claustrofóbica, crua e com paredes repletas de mensagens de Socorro pelo cenário e os fãs de ação vão adorar as sequências eletrizantes envolvente portais e velocidade para sobreviver a diversas armadilhas! Se você pegar o filme de terror psicológico \"Cubo\" de 1997 e misturar com Half-Life, você terá Portal!\n\nOs gráficos são muito bonitos e ainda vem com fases bônus! Leve e barato, Portal é uma excelente pedida pra quem quer diversão, trama sensacional, diálogos engraçados, importantes e muito f*das no maior estilo The Stanley Parable, puzzles e muitos desafios! Portal parece só mais um jogo simples de quebra-cabeça, mas realmente não é!
