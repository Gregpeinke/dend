The bright, airy city of Colombia is such a refreshing departure from the dark, dingy buildings of Rapture, and it's really cool. I would absolutely reccomend Infinite to anybody.\n\nThat being said, I do have two main qualms:\n\n1) The Story.\nDon't get me wrong: I LOVE the story. I do, however, find its whole starting premise improbable. The floating city part I can believe, but the whole Booker/Comstock thing is not. Also, why would a hard rationalist scientist like Rosalind agree to help a slightly unhinged religious zealot like Comstock? The very last scene was baffling and left me kind of dissapointed, too. If you study psychology and/or love storybuilding, you might have this same qualm.\n\n2) The Auto-Save Mechanic.\nThis feature mysteriously departs from the original two games' save system. In Bioshock 1 and 2, the game auto-saved at the beginning of every level/map, but it also allowed you to save whenever you wanted. Infinite does not. This game forces you to complete a level/map fully before you are allowed to quit, lest you want to lose a good 15-20 minutes of gameplay. I guess it helps the story be less fragmented, but it's kind of annoying. So if you are looking to buy, be aware.","timestamp_created":1505418595,"timestamp_updated":1505418595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34955468","author":{"steamid":"76561198100479295","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":87,"playtime_forever":652,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":579,"last_played":1521618132},"language":"thai","review":"ระบบเกมทำดีมาก รวมทั้งเนื้อเรื่องที่โครตดี ตั้งแต่ยังไม่เริ่มเนื้อเรื่องจนกระทั่งจบเกม จบเกมแล้วยังต้องไปหาอ่านเนื้อเรื่องย่อต่อ","timestamp_created":1505416515,"timestamp_updated":1537130731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34952564","author":{"steamid":"76561198026544006","num_games_owned":735,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":594,"last_played":1475704051},"language":"english","review":"had potential but really wasn't fun","timestamp_created":1505408119,"timestamp_updated":1505408119,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489643305540084839","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34950621","author":{"steamid":"76561198263828295","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":625,"last_played":1550302226},"language":"english","review":"Elizabeth is an instant 10/10","timestamp_created":1505402582,"timestamp_updated":1505402582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34950523","author":{"steamid":"76561198202579731","num_games_owned":531,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":481,"last_played":1505193711},"language":"schinese","review":"非常魔幻的一个游戏，画风很魔幻，对于一个13年的游戏来说，这种画风让这游戏的画质看起来十分不错\n剧情也很魔幻，结局...也非常魔幻，甚至...有点烧脑子\n玩法是普通的突突突加上...魔法来辅助攻击，总的射击手感还不错吧\n\n然后，每次打开玩上15分钟都会莫名崩溃一次，重进游戏一次之后就好了\n\n总之，不错的剧情，不错的射击手感，游戏还是非常好的吧\n\n最后，一定要用魔法打败魔法","timestamp_created":1505402281,"timestamp_updated":1505402472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34949074","author":{"steamid":"76561198329452628","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":3659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1457,"last_played":1639038214},"language":"schinese","review":"神作，最喜欢的游戏。强烈推荐","timestamp_created":1505397826,"timestamp_updated":1505397826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34947687","author":{"steamid":"76561198205631075","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1638,"last_played":1572646221},"language":"english","review":"This is one of my favorite games ever.

Gerek bazı yerlerdeki o renk paletleri gerek Colombia'nın eşsiz manzarası sizi dakikalarca büyüleyebiliyor.\n2-Alışılagelmemiş hikaye\n  Çoğu oyunculara göre oyunun asıl can alıcı noktası burası. Hikayedeki eksiğe geçmeden söylemeliyim ki hikayesi gerçekten muazzam. Daha önce pek az rastladığım farklı ve güzel hikayelerden biri. Ancak sıkıntı hikayede değil hikayeyi anlatmakda. Oyunu bitirdikten sonra ne oluyor lan?! dedirttiriyor (ki iyi bir şey) ancak bu ''ne oluyor'' kısmı sizin anlayamamanızdan kaynaklanıyor. Dediğim gibi hikaye harika ama anlatımını şahsen beğenmedim ve her Bioshock Infinite oyununu bitiren gibi hikayedeki eksiklerimi tamamlamak için google da araştırmalara başladım.\n\nGelelim aşırı farklı olmayan ama yine de güzel kısımlara;\nMekanikler normal bir fps den pek farklı değil demek zorundayım. Aslında oyun boyunca çeşitli eğlenceli büyüler kullanabiliyoruz ancak çoğu zaman zevkine kullanıyorsunuz oyun sizi kullanmaya zorlayacak hareketlerde bulunmuyor ki benim beğenmediğim yönler arasında (mekanik oldukça hoş ama iyi yedirilememiş bence).\n\nGrafiklerine denecek pek bir şey yok gayet yeterli buldum ben.\n\n Yapay zeka (yapılması pek de kolay bir şey olmadığı için pek eleştirmeyeceğim) ortalama düzeyde. Her oyunda olduğu gibi bunda da sapıttığı oluyor ancak çok nadir gerçekleşiyor bu sapıtmalar.\n\nOptimizasyon gayet iyi.\n------------------------\nOyun gerçekten bir şaheser. Bu şekildeki oyunlar pek bulunmuyor. Oyunu kesinlikle tavsiye ederim. Her oyuncunun tatması gereken bir deneyim.

Games对虚幻引擎3的改造发挥到了极致，环境光遮蔽、后期处理、动态阴影、高分辨率纹理等多项DX11特效，留给中高端显卡充足的发挥空间，能够大大改善画质，而且除了后期处理之外，对性能要求都很亲和。                             \n\n[h1]这里推荐大家尽量使用较大的屏幕进行游戏体验，15.6寸笔记本和27寸液晶屏幕所带来的视觉冲击力真的可以非常大的影响到玩家对游戏的体验感受。[/h1]\n       游戏色彩偏暖，充斥着阳光，给人的感觉非常柔和。这种卡通与现实光线的混搭，营造出的童话色彩又与剧情里邪恶的部分产生强烈冲击，震撼的视觉体验是在所难免的。\n\n本体主线任务大约12个小时的流程，请大家缓慢优雅的完成主线，一周目不分心留给成就收集，如果您喜欢，一定会回来玩第二次。\n\n游戏的DLC相当良心，内容丰富程度不输本体，由于本人被其他因素剧透了一脸，所以请大家安利给朋友的时候留给他们完整的体验。\n\n[h1]在此也要提一点游戏的不足之处：屎一样的射击手感，希望大家忍耐一下吧。[/h1]\n\n另外本作与生化奇兵上代以及上上代作品没有什么直接联系，是独立于该系列的存在，当然有兴趣\n的朋友可以看看一代和二代，只不过画面的差距感可能会给大家带来一些负面的体验。","timestamp_created":1505316652,"timestamp_updated":1505317581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.716455399990081787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34921169","author":{"steamid":"76561198127136301","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":571,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":571,"last_played":1454141084},"language":"schinese","review":"艺术！就是！Elizabeth！","timestamp_created":1505314938,"timestamp_updated":1505314938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524886906147003174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34920396","author":{"steamid":"76561198265871741","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":235,"playtime_forever":1897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1897,"last_played":1505305676},"language":"koreana","review":"fps

I jumped into the game and found myself kinda confused and bored after 1 hour of gameplay. However, just like most great stories, the beginning was merely a setup for the rollercoaster of a journey that you end up embarking on. Bioschock 1 and 2 were some of my favorite games, but after I finished Infinite, I can confidently say that this series is my all time favorite of any videogames. The game has good combat and fun mechanics with the different abilites that you find throughout the game, but it could be better. With that being said, the story of this game is AMAZING. It takes a lot of devotion in that you should immerse yourself and pay attention to all the details that are so brilliantly dispersed into the world. You'll find yourself thankful that you did once you start to near the end of the game. The writing is fantastic, and the amazing voice acting only complements that. Honestly, one of the only games that I've played that I can say I'd rate 10/10. You should definitely play the DLC after if you enjoyed the game, because the DLC ties together all the games in a magnificent way that will leave you stunned.","timestamp_created":1505202184,"timestamp_updated":1505202327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34896655","author":{"steamid":"76561198012308333","num_games_owned":805,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":628,"last_played":1423160107},"language":"english","review":"Great gameplay, visuals and story, highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1505202015,"timestamp_updated":1505202015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34894061","author":{"steamid":"76561198406547171","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1579,"last_played":1529571388},"language":"english","review":"So I`ve heard this is the best game of the bioshock trilogy and since I`m a really big fan of the first 2 i was really excited.\nThe game is good, the idea , the story and gameplay are good,however I feel really let down, again, the reason I cant fully like it is because I compare it with the previous ones, so the game is ok, but lacking for me.\nGotta admit the ending was really good, but it dont make up for the whole experience.\nIts a good game and defenetly recommend it but its not what i expected.\n***Be  noted*** Again ,as a fan of the original games I really suggest play the \"burial at sea\" DLC`s\nthey connect the story with the games and tho short , have a really good story","timestamp_created":1505184736,"timestamp_updated":1505184951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34893572","author":{"steamid":"76561198200702853","num_games_owned":494,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":856,"last_played":1503783022},"language":"schinese","review":"这是一个著名的三部曲游戏系列。\n\n初代作品有着阴郁黑暗的氛围，受到了一致好评，被奉为经典。\n\n然而二代作品却交予他人制作，并因此备受质疑。\n\n幸而三代作品仍由原制作人接手，玩家打开三代，非常喜爱，但是结局时却发现，剧情好像和初代没什么关系？后来，三代的第一个剧情DLC发售了，看起来和初代剧情有关了，却非常的短。终于，第二个也是最后一个剧情DLC发售了，终于和初代剧情接上了。\n\n大家回顾这个经典系列时，虽然三代得到了更多的关注，但很多人认为初代>三代>二代。（注：这是PCGAMER在twitter上的投票结果，非本人偏心）\n\n没错，这就是大名鼎鼎的黑暗之魂，划掉，生化奇兵系列。","timestamp_created":1505181609,"timestamp_updated":1505181667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":52,"votes_funny":33,"weighted_vote_score":"0.816197216510772705","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34892864","author":{"steamid":"76561198334825899","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1509021348},"language":"schinese","review":"补票","timestamp_created":1505177569,"timestamp_updated":1505177569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34892702","author":{"steamid":"76561198242131380","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":966,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":803,"last_played":1603832177},"language":"spanish","review":"no sé","timestamp_created":1505176662,"timestamp_updated":1511444027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478065252304077148","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34890158","author":{"steamid":"76561198138125289","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":610,"last_played":1505097312},"language":"english","review":"The best ending i have ever experienced in a game i would delete my memory just to play it again.","timestamp_created":1505163351,"timestamp_updated":1505163351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34887858","author":{"steamid":"76561198107949035","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":528,"last_played":1628435120},"language":"english","review":"SK/CZ\nParáááda :)  Lepsiu hru som nehral.
