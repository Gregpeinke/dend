I'll start out by saying that if I had to rate the game, it would be a 9.5/10.  It's really that good (and, if I'm being honest with myself, that .5 deduction is hardly something that will bother most people).\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is a step up from the original Portal in every way.  From the storyline to the physics and controls, this game has upgraded all of it.  While the story in Portal was pretty short, this one is long and immersive, both in the single player campaign and the multiplayer campaign.  The voice acting is superb (and very often hilarious) and the level design is incredible (you'll notice throwback levels if you played the original). \n\nReplayability:\nOut of every game I own, this game retains the most replay value thanks to a built in level creator and steam workshop support.  You can build all of your own levels and map designs with in a super easy to use point and click editor.  It's literally as simple as connect the dots.  This includes both single player and multi player levels.  When you want to play new levels you just subscribe in the workshop and there it is.\n\nThis is where my .5 deduction lies.  If you want to create some of the elements you see in the single player campaign, you'll have to use the hammer world editor to do so, rather than the in game editor.  Most of these are purely aesthetic in nature (certain themes found in game such as overgrowth), but there are some mechanical designs I wish were available in the basic editor.  These include things like porous metal walls that you can shoot portals through (and stand on, etc) that are useful to create some more clever designs, the ability to trigger animations, etc.  Like I said, it's not like you can't make them if you really wanted to, it's just much more complex to pull off.  \n\nTLDR:  Buy this game and you might get cake.","timestamp_created":1413498454,"timestamp_updated":1413498454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12515683","author":{"steamid":"76561198156504167","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1643144374},"language":"english","review":"Great game, it's over before you know it, and that's a good thing.
