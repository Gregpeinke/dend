But... I won't spoil it for those who haven't played this gem yet.\nI don't really care about graphics, but this game has nice enough graphics for a game over a decade old. It will run very smoothly on any modern computer. The frame rate is below what we are used to see as of 2019, but, personally, I wasn't bothered by that.\n\nI recommend playing this game if you're passionate about videogames, if you're new in the gaming community, if you're looking for a challenge... I recommend this game to any player. (Also, if you like this game play [i]Portal 2[/i])\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\nAs I usually do, I'll finish this review by congratulating everyone who worked on this amazing game: [b]Congratulations, Valve![/b]\n\n[spoiler] The cake is a lie!
