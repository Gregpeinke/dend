Игра пойдет даже на бревне, ну сие и не удивительно ведь как я уже говорил она вышла очень давно. Онлайн не сказать что большой, но вечерами людей много, да и утром можно хорошо провести время с тремя человеками.

I get enjoying one over the other but putting down the other like it is complete garbage is just dumb, TF2 can, believe it or not, be as fun as TFC. Just like TFC has pros compared to TF2, TF2 has pros over TFC as it has had over a decade's worth of time to refine itself since 2007. It also probably seems a lot less appealing to newcomers due to -\n\n2. There is nothing else but Drippy's 2fort. You don't like 2fort? Fuck you, you get it anyway. Somehow this 24/7 modded 2fort server is the only consistently active server in the game. Sometimes there will be other servers alive but not nearly as alive or active as Drippy's. I would be fine with this if it wasn't the only server active 90% of the time in the entire game. I guarantee the TFC players that their player base would consist of more than 20-30 players at a time if their players did anything other than dick around on 2fort.\n\nI'm expecting to get salt in the comments from the few TFC vets for saying TF2 is better in some ways, so that will be fun.

If you like Team Fortress 2 or prefer more realistic shooters, you're probably better off sticking to that, because this isn't that. This game plays like the first several shooters of the 90's in pvp, you've got an arena, two teams, and flags. Damage isn't realistic, headshots are only important as a sniper, and most enemies will take a lot of firepower like explosives to take down, because it's directly based on Quake's gameplay and armor is very strong. So, it plays like a team-based id Software shooter with classes and capture the flag gameplay. Unlike those shooters however, getting a lot of frags isn't the goal. The goal is to help your team to win by attacking or defending, and if you win, you were working together. The amount of times you died in the process is pretty much irrelevant. Everybody has a lot of armor (up to a class cap, unlike Quake 1 deathmatch) at the start of their respawn, so you're going to need a lot of firepower. One good thing though, is that it's somewhat difficult to resupply health and armor in the field, so damage tends to last. Lastly, there are differences, like class-specific hand grenades- they're somewhat overpowered, and originally it was hard to resupply them. Now most custom maps (and most maps are custom) have grenade pickups aplenty, so you're going to have to get good at spotting and anticipating enemies to throw them, not to mention use your own against enemies. Expect every enemy to throw them every single fight, even if they don't. Another difference is that you don't scour the arena for weapons, armor, or health pickups- weapons are given automatically based on class, and TFC is very team based, so you can only resupply these things three ways. First, the resupply rooms in your base, that are very useful. Second, the medic class can heal injuries. And third, the engineer class can build dispensers that distribute ammo and armor to teammates that walk up to them- and a pro-tip not many people know, the engineer's wrench weapon can also give friendly players armor by hitting them. Otherwise, you're pretty much out of luck unless you find certain respawning backpacks on the map, which may have health, armor, ammo, grenades, or all 4 combined, but usually it depends on the map. Some maps are less forgiving than others, especially the original classic maps. The last difference is that some guns reload, unlike Quake- usually only secondary guns like the shotgun and super shotgun, but also the rocket launcher, the soldier's primary. That mostly adds the element of having to find time to reload while spamming shells downrange with a shotgun.\n\nBut, if you appreciate the golden age of shooters, where most of the time people were shooting AI monsters in gritty basement-like corridors with shotguns, this game is very much that mindset. It's just a multiplayer, class-based pvp version of that, and probably one of the first games out there that popularized capture the flag. This game definitely isn't typical Half-Life gameplay, it just uses the engine and some of the models. Basically... it's an id Software-style mod for a Valve game, made by the original creators of the Quake 1 mod. There are a lot of odd, id-style weapons like nailguns, shotguns, grenade launchers and rocket launchers, you have to figure out how to use them effectively as your chosen class. Since they're typically unconventional weapons, it takes a lot of getting used to compared to modern shooters that have set types like assault rifles and LMGs. Although it's a pretty good indicator that, if you like mods like Deathmatch Classic or games like Quake, you wont have much of a problem adapting.\n\nI'd have to give the developers credit, they did a pretty good job of translating the original Quake Team Fortress mod to Half-Life, with the quirks of Quake included. The only real differences are small, like the axe now being a crowbar, and a lot of the models/sounds being taken from Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1606540649,"timestamp_updated":1658293635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80771791","author":{"steamid":"76561198316484542","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":89,"last_played":1646058366},"language":"brazilian","review":"Comprei por curiosidade e me divertir muito.
