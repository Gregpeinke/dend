It also has some good reviews. But it mostly had reviews giving it 7/10, which is OK. If I were to give this game a rating, I'd say 8/10. It's a pretty good game. It is not like Left 4 Dead. There are numerous differences. For one, you don't rely on finding weapons lying around to gain arms. you go and buy it, which I think is not as good as finding random weapons, because the vendor moves every wave. Also, there's waves, instead of segment part things. And there's no storyline, or at least none that is obvious. I'm sure there are fan- created storylines for this game. Another difference this game has from Left 4 Dead is every weapon has ironsight. It's pretty cool.\nIt's really not scary enough to be a horror game, though more scary than Left 4 Dead. Well, not really scary, so much as startling. Espiecially in the Amusement Park map... I hated playing that. It was easy, but it was so eerie, I just don't want to play it again...\nThis game definately isn't for everyone. But if you loved Left 4 Dead, like I did, you will probably enjoy this game.\nThere are serveral different maps to choose from, but it seems they mainly relied on the community to make maps. And there are people on multiplayer, not a whole lot, but they're there. And, unlike Left 4 Dead, multiplayer isn't full of whiney little kids.","timestamp_created":1356422623,"timestamp_updated":1356422623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3486126","author":{"steamid":"76561198023563333","num_games_owned":319,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":124661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40292,"last_played":1656332851},"language":"english","review":"Best Game Ever.","timestamp_created":1356405796,"timestamp_updated":1356405796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.632396280765533447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5806567","author":{"steamid":"76561198055238878","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6541,"last_played":1454750833},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра, для задротов в самый раз","timestamp_created":1356392240,"timestamp_updated":1356392240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479452043771743774","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6527582","author":{"steamid":"76561198068214451","num_games_owned":519,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1684,"last_played":1420481929},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo e o Pipoco meu velho !\n","timestamp_created":1356382398,"timestamp_updated":1385415040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504727602005004883","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1935793","author":{"steamid":"76561197999958883","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":1600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1486,"last_played":1374018239},"language":"english","review":"everyone likes this except me","timestamp_created":1356378826,"timestamp_updated":1385423612,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.433578342199325562","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3435199","author":{"steamid":"76561198022672810","num_games_owned":945,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":7698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3997,"last_played":1437383667},"language":"english","review":"So much fun.
