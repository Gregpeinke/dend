Играть мне пришлось в кооперативе с незнакомым молодым человеком, который тоже еле понимал, что происходит. И так, два человека, дико не выспавшиеся, после дозы алкоголя играют в головоломку. На некоторые уровни уйти могло и по часу тщетных попыток разгадки. Когда сил уже не было смеяться, а мозг стал считать, что его владелиц больной убл*док с наклонностями садомазохизма, который не дает ему проспаться и заставляет напрягать последние не уснувшие извилины, снисходило озарение, в основном от молодого человека, который эту игру однажды играл, и с диким восторгом проходили уровень, чтобы потом опять начинать сомневаться в своих умственных способностях уже в уровнях повыше. Игра действительно интересная, как и одиночная, так и ко-оп, на деле не такая сложная, как показалась при первой попытке поиграть, но жутко увлекательная, Глэдос испускают шутки, которые могут ранить, но ей простить можно, все же она ИИ.

This game has a great way of making puzzles yet having a good story behind it! This game also has co-op which can be rage inducing if you play with stranges but when it comes to playing with friends, oh that's just pure fun or either just trying to kill each other.\n\n\nStory : 100/100 ( Spoiler Free!)\n\nThe story of this game is fantastic! and of course you will be needing to play the first Portal in order to understand the story of this game. This game's story is just amazing and entertaining there are no parts that are boring, at least for me. The story isn't vague and cryptic most of the time it's a right at your face as you progress-story.\n\n\nGraphics : 87/100\n\nThis game's graphics aren't very demanding in terms of power but at the same time looking beautiful for dem screenshots! There's not much to talk about graphics in this game but in general it looks pretty but it doesn't require a buffed up PC\n\n\nGameplay : 1000/100\n\nThe game's gameplay mechanics or just gameplay in general is amazing! It is a very special snowflake when you mention FPS this game is technically FPS I guess since FPS is a first person SHOOTER and in this game you SHOOT portals yes? Back to the topic, this game's gameplay is just super fun as you can screw around by making your own map in a laughable manner or just making a map to impress others. *scoffs* show-off.\n\n\nReplay Value : 97/100\n\nThe replay value of this game is completely depending on the person playing, but who could not find replay value with a fun story  & some silly co-op? Well if you're getting tired of the default maps / levels of those 2 luckily this game supports  the steam workshop, so we technically have infinite playtime due to the creativity level of the commmunity.\n\n\n\nOverall : 90/100\n\n","timestamp_created":1482903049,"timestamp_updated":1496117923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28740095","author":{"steamid":"76561198040266292","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1541397220},"language":"spanish","review":"Buena trama, buen modo de juego, desafiante y muy ilarante, totalmente recomendado como puzzle o como juego de plataforma","timestamp_created":1482902649,"timestamp_updated":1482902649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28739443","author":{"steamid":"76561198121097730","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1501835132},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情好赞，慢慢探索真相的过程真的很棒！难度适中就是有的地方十分考验眼力。。。\n如果你很喜欢1的话那2一定不会让你失望，以及与1一样满分的ED！","timestamp_created":1482901008,"timestamp_updated":1482901008,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28739334","author":{"steamid":"76561197979266678","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1304,"last_played":1428116558},"language":"english","review":"I didn't think Portal could get any better.
