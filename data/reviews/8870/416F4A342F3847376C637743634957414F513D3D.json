The story is exactly what I look for in a game. I want a world that is living and has its own things going on and I am thrown into it. I do NOT want a game where there are things happening and the whole world revolves around my character. The story of Bioshock Infinite is not about opression, racism or corruption. The story is about Bookers relationship to Elizabeth and Booker dealing with what he is capable of doing to the people he loves. This game is a spectacular increase of quality from Bioshock 1. I recently played Bioshock 1 for the first time and I don't know why everyone is so fanatic about it. The twist at the end was pretty predictable and quite frankly.. kind of poorly written.

The game does a wonderful job at tricking you into following a stable plotline, only to reverse everything you know at the most unexpected times.  I can't praise Infinite's writers enough, from the dialogue to the careful way they tie in the Infinite world with Bioshock I & II without tarnishing previously established plots, they really created something powerful.  I resisted playing Infinite for about a year after it was released because I was such a huge fan of the first two games, and was worried Infinite would ruin the world for me.  However, even though Infinite is a clear departure from the aesthetic and feel of Bioshock I & II, it's a fantastic FPS that absolutely manages to fill the rather large shoes of its predecessors.  Infinite offers various difficulties suitible for different levels of gameplay, as well as some excellent DLC.  If I have one criticism, it's that Infinite fails to have the scary moments you might be used to from the first two games.  Although, Infinite is also not afraid of grim storytelling, which is one of my favorite parts of the series.  As mentioned, it's visually stunning and inventive, and absolutely one of my favorite games.","timestamp_created":1426720841,"timestamp_updated":1444328277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14953116","author":{"steamid":"76561198052025047","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1167,"last_played":1623878884},"language":"english","review":"Great Game!

Эта игра очень красива, не смотря не на что, оптимизация тоже хороша. Начну пожалуй с физики игры и геймплея. На моих глазах за прохождение игры не было замечено не одного серьёзного бага, но могу заметить, что вы находитесь в Колумбии, город простороенный в воздухе, по началу я боялся упасть, пытался осторожничать, но на самом деле это все брехня, ты не когда не умираешь, а возвращаешься обратно на землю. При перестрелке та же самая система, у тебя кончаются жизни, ты типо падаешь, а потом во время боя Элизабет тебя поднимает на ноги или появляешься в бывшем кабинете Девитта и там проходишь в дверь и ты типо очухался, да это странновато. Везде валяются \"робототы-магазины\", там можно купить хилку, ману, патроны, зачем это вообще покупать, если после боя можно со всех трупов всё собрать? Так же там продаются улучшения для магии и оружия, единственное, что я там покупал. Самый главный плюс, во время боя, кончились патроны или на минимум хилка или мана, вам не надо с места на место бегать по трупам и искать, Элизабет сразу рандомно вам всё кинет.\n\nПоговорим о сюжете. Сюжет глубокий и запутанный, поэтому некоторым людям ненравится концовка или вообще сюжет, мне лично по началу всё было отчётливо понятно, что к чему, в середине уже началась мутнень, а концовка стала самой неожиданной интригой.\nВы Девитт (фамилию не помню), у вас накопился долг и вы должны его вернуть, вам дали поручение, съездить в Колумбию и забрать девчёнку (Элизабет), вы приехали в Колумбию и окозалось, что уже вас ждут, вы ложный пастырь, самый главный враг Клумбии, сами вы того не зная, делали свою работу, Элизабет забрали, довольно экстримальным способом. Элизабет - это главная героиня игры, Комсток её отец и скрывая от неё, держал в заперти всё жизнь, она была его наследницой Колумбии,да это уж похоже на какойто диснеевский мультфильм. Комсток - это главный злодей игры, имеет власть в Колумбии, он считается даже богом, в честь его молятся и выполняют самые безумные выходки. Так же во время прохождения будут появляться блезнецы (не помню имён), они основатели Колумбии, блогодаря им Колумбия взлетела в воздух, когда с ними встречаешься они немут какую то мутнень, которую я непонимаю, а потом резко исчезают. Элизабет всегда хотела уехать в Париж, поэтому по ходу прохождения она всегда об этом говорила и показывала в разрывах. Повстанцы начали войну с дискриминации в Колумбии, жестокую войну, а не просто бунты, забрали у Девитта и Элизабет их аэростат, который сами украли, повстанцы говорили, что его вернут, если они сходят к китайцу и попросят у него новые оружия, он оказался в плену и убытый полицейскими, как только наши герои нашли труп, близнецы сказали, что это только одна реальность и вы можете пройти в другую, они конечно ушли, повстанцы уже одерживали победу, Девитт оказался героем войны, предводительница востанцев (не помню имени) узнала, что Девитт жив и подумала, что это самозванец и поэтому сейчас стали все против наших героев, такими темпами они переходили из одной реальности в другую. Элизабет повстречалась с леди Комсток, своей мамой, сначала не поладили, был комфликт, ну или как сказать, просто Девитт расстрелял призрака. Потом наши герои пошли убивать Комстока  и тут откуда невозмись появился механический ястреб забрал её, и поэтому Девитт оказался один и вынужден был спасать Элизабет в доме Комстока, там жили миньёны и какой то всевидящий болван, как только Девитт зашёл в дом Комстока, время как то быстро начало меняться, повидался со старой версией Элизабет, видел разрушенный Нью - Йорк, она помогла вернуть время вспять и Девитт спас её во время, Комсток слинял на аэростате, там его хлопнули, он нёс там туже чушь, что и близнецы. Было бы так всё хорошо, но нет, Девитт и Элизабет оказались в мире врат. А дальше мои друзья, спойлерить не буду.\n\nЯ играл на русской локалицации, блогодаря творческому объединению студентов, они сделали локализацию на высшем уровне. Почти все названия были на русском, не было локализированно, только мелкие названия типо стикеров на одежде, названий на ящиках и такой особо ненужной мутни. Озвучка шикарна, все персонажи игры говорят на русском, у главных героев были все голоса отличные, а вот есть второстипенные личности у них немного было не в попад, типо стариков, которые говорят молодым голосом.\nОценка игре:\n9.8 из 10\nОценка локализаторам:\n9 из 10","timestamp_created":1426682380,"timestamp_updated":1426682380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":48,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.652853429317474365","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14944768","author":{"steamid":"76561198043524359","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":833,"last_played":1440205652},"language":"brazilian","review":"Sou fã de carteirinha de todos os Bioshocks, este jogo é incrível, Adorei!","timestamp_created":1426673722,"timestamp_updated":1426673722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14943208","author":{"steamid":"76561198144025430","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":65,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65,"last_played":1426432319},"language":"english","review":"9/10","timestamp_created":1426658112,"timestamp_updated":1426658112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468085110187530518","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14942793","author":{"steamid":"76561198118350797","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":902,"last_played":1581901898},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I have ever played.
