Vamos a mezclar todo hasta que esté bien incorporado. Pueden utilizar una batidora eléctrica o hacerlo a mano.\n\n2-Una vez que tengamos armada una especie de pomada, vamos a agregar las dos yemas de huevo y vamos a volver a batir.\n\n3-Llegó el momento de incorporar la harina y nuestra protagonista, la maicena. Si pueden hacerlo con un tamizado de por medio, mucho mejor. También vamos a agregar una pizca de polvo para hornear.\n\n4-Ahora sí, vamos a meter mano en el asunto. En el bol hasta que los ingredientes secos esté bastante incorporados con los húmedos y luego vamos a continuar en la mesada hasta que nos quede una masa bien homogénea.\n\n5-Vamos a dejar reposar nuestra masa unos 15 minutos aproximadamente.\n\n6-Pasado este tiempo, vamos a pasar al estirado de la masa. Para eso vamos a utilizar lo que en este canal nos gusta llamar: La técnica de los capos consiste en lo siguiente: Vamos a estirar una buena cantidad de papel film sobre la mesada. Por encima, colocamos nuestro bollo y luego por encima otra buena cantidad de papel film. Así, entre estas dos láminas, vamos a proceder a aplastar y estirar nuestra masa. Primero con las manos y luego con el palo de amasar hasta que esté bastante chatita.\n\n7-Retiramos la parte de arriba del film y con un cortante redondo (también pueden usar cosas similares como un vaso) procedemos a armar nuestras tapitas y a medida que lo vamos haciendo, las vamos colocando en un recipiente para horno. Tengan mucho cuidado al manipular las tapitas porque la masa es muy sensible y se pone a llorar por cualquier cosa. Van a ver que les sobra masa, en ese caso la vuelven a juntar, a estirar y así sacan más alfajores de maicena.\n\n8-Antes de llevarlas al horno y mientras este se calienta, vamos a llevar la masa a la heladera unos minutos.\n\n9-Pasado este tiempo, las llevamos al horno 180º por aproximadamente 10 minutos. Tengan en cuenta que la temperatura del horno es muy importante para que no queden demasiado secos.\n\n10-Una vez que vean que las tapitas están doraditas, las vamos a sacar. Una vez que estén frías, armamos nuestros alfajores de maicena colocando dulce de leche repostero sobre una tapita y colocando otra por encima. Si lo desean, pueden agregarle el coco rallado por al rededor.\n\n¡Y listo!","timestamp_created":1631206998,"timestamp_updated":1631206998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":18,"weighted_vote_score":"0.739210784435272217","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99053064","author":{"steamid":"76561198027629347","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1216,"last_played":1631093030},"language":"english","review":"For the Australians out there.

There is a long range of diffrent weapons to use and a fair amount of maps.\n\nSadly this game got no official server like Team Fortress 2, so you need to play on community servers that sometimes got weird maps and other stuff.\n\nIt's a classic game, I wish more people played it and Valve maybe added official maps and new maps too! 8/10.","timestamp_created":1630254562,"timestamp_updated":1652200704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98439851","author":{"steamid":"76561198190421015","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":170,"playtime_forever":26,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1630589774},"language":"english","review":"7/10 medal of honor volvo edition","timestamp_created":1630236509,"timestamp_updated":1630236509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98424314","author":{"steamid":"76561198214232616","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1705,"last_played":1653729594},"language":"english","review":"PEWPEWPEW","timestamp_created":1630213664,"timestamp_updated":1630213664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98391620","author":{"steamid":"76561198984723143","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":141,"last_played":1640874264},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyunu 2 saat oynadım ve inanılmaz, oyunun silah sekmesine alışık değilim ama grafikler hala bu çağdan bir çok oyunu sallıyor, ortam arkadaş canlısı, çoklu oyunculu oyunları pek sevmiyorum fakat bu oyun şiddetle tavsiye ederim.","timestamp_created":1630166967,"timestamp_updated":1630166967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98358891","author":{"steamid":"76561198204574629","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1647482027},"language":"english","review":"play it","timestamp_created":1630120719,"timestamp_updated":1630120719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98310244","author":{"steamid":"76561198002131469","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8200,"last_played":1658656363},"language":"czech","review":"_","timestamp_created":1630053145,"timestamp_updated":1630053145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98309433","author":{"steamid":"76561198289740382","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":7980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":33,"playtime_at_review":7230,"last_played":1660271135},"language":"english","review":"It's a great remake of the classic DoD with several improvements from the original game.","timestamp_created":1630051824,"timestamp_updated":1643823006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98304572","author":{"steamid":"76561198189604897","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7583,"playtime_last_two_weeks":40,"playtime_at_review":6274,"last_played":1660399822},"language":"russian","review":"va jouer à ce jeu","timestamp_created":1630043206,"timestamp_updated":1630043206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98296002","author":{"steamid":"76561198005032746","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":112,"last_played":1630065788},"language":"russian","review":"Игра, на которую компании VALVe действительно насрать.

Игру часто сравнивают с Counter-Strike. Поэтому фанаты CS точно оценят. \n\n[h1] Режимы игры [/h1]\nСтоит сказать, что у игры есть два режима: «Контроль над территорией» и «Уничтожение объектов». То есть вам не просто надо бегать и стрелять во все стороны. У вас есть цель. Захватить все флаги в определенных точках на карте или уничтожить технику и т.п. соперника.\n\nВообще, игра рассчитана на командную тактику. Поэтому лучше взаимодействовать с участниками команды, координировать и согласовывать атаку и защиту. К тому же, вступая в команду, вы выбираете себе роль – один из шести классов, где у каждого свои преимущества.\n\n\n[h1] Классы [/h1]\nСтрелок – отлично стреляет на дальние расстояния. Менее эффективен в ближнем бою;\n\nШтурмовик – незаменим при атаках в ближнем бою и в движении;\n\nПоддержка – используется для стрельбы на средние расстояния, в основном для обеспечения прикрытия;\n\nСнайпер – максимально эффективен на дальних расстояниях;\n\nПулеметчик – используется для стрельбы на большие расстояния, в основном для обороны;\n\nГранатометчик – уничтожает или, накрайняк, оглушает пулеметчиков и снайперов.\n\nНо по большому счету, разница у этих классов только в наборе оружия.\n\n\n[h1] Важные моменты [/h1]\nСтоит сказать, что, в отличии от своего \"родного\" конкурента, все бойцы умеют ползать. И этот навык очень полезен. Потому что даже не очень высокое укрытие способно спасти жизнь. Импульсивно и хаотично стрелять очередями с криками не получится, так как оружие обладает очень мощной отдачей. Например, пулемет для начала нужно установить на сошки, без этого ствол задирается вверх и толку никакого. В этом и заключается некая самобытность и отличие от того же Counter Strike.\n\nСобственно, это всё. Если вам наскучило сидеть днями на de_dust2, можете приходить в Day of Defeat. На многих серверах сидит неплохое число настоящих игроков, поэтому заняться тут есть чем.","timestamp_created":1629919466,"timestamp_updated":1629919466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.607843101024627686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98207552","author":{"steamid":"76561199001243604","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1657914715},"language":"spanish","review":"yes\n","timestamp_created":1629897443,"timestamp_updated":1629897443,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98177164","author":{"steamid":"76561198302994235","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":461,"last_played":1630285343},"language":"french","review":"nice
