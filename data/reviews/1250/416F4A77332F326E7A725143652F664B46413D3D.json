This comes from an old Unreal 3 engine mod made retail. When first released the graphics were not top notch, but they aren't ugly. The animations are well done and when you reload it feels like you are actually reloading; not that Modern Warface \"click clack shoot\" crap. Teamwork is not required. It is needed. My only other player Online Co-op is Left 4 Dead, but trust me when I say that going solo will bite back hard. To clarify, for every player that joins a map, the enemy becomes stronger by X times so you'd better work together or be ready to watch the stare at the screen again. Then again, reaching the Patriarch is more satifaction to make up for any fuck ups. Enough talk! Buy the game, pick your perk and for the love of god play on normal the first time.

You are part of a 6 man squad and must kill all enemies every wave until you reach the final boss.\n\nBits of story are scattered throughout the base maps, however, with the inclusion of new content (survival and objective maps) we get a more in-depth look at this world. Basically, there's an evil organization called Horzine that created monstrous specimens (ZEDs) and it is up to you and your squad to stop them. It is nothing amazing, but it is serviceable - it feels like a low budget 80s slasher movie.\n\nThere are two types of gameplay - \"Killing Floor\" and \"Objective Mode\". \nIn \"Killing Floor\", you must clear waves of specimens that gradually grow more difficult, until you reach the final boss. With each kill and wave, the player gets money to spend in the shop, where they can purchase armor, ammo and new weapons.\nIn \"Objective Mode\", you must complete a vast array of tasks, whilst also being attacked by ZEDs.\nBoth modes are enjoyable, however, I still prefer the original wave-based mode - the objective mode requires you to move around a lot and, on harder difficulties, it seems a bit overwhelming.\n\nThe amount of content in [u]Killing Floor[/u] is simply amazing; sure, some cosmetics are DLC but all players get access to all maps and that is a good business practice in my book.\nThe game has 7 perks (think of them as classes), each specializing in a different area - there is the Field Medic class that focuses on healing and tanking, the Firebug who deals damage over time, the Sharpshooter who focuses on bigger, more powerful threats with unmatched precision, the Commando that specializes in killing small, more numerous ZEDs, etc. The player can level these up, each needing a certain amount of damage dealt with certain kinds of weapons in most cases. There are some exceptions, where you must heal your teammates or kill specific types of ZEDs instead. While getting the level up notification feels great, grinding damage for it to happen is not as fun. It certainly is not a total grind-fest; but leveling up classes you do not like to get an achievement might prove very bothersome, as it does take quite a while.\nEach perk has a certain amount of weapons it excels at - Support Specialists, for example, have a vast number of shotguns at their disposal and deal extra damage with them. Everyone can, however, use any weapon - though effectiveness will vary.\nThere are around 50 weapons in the game, promoting a lot of experimentation. All of them have their pros and cons, however, learning which one suits each playstyle better feels great.\n\nZED variety is also good. The specimens range from the numerous clots (pretty much slow, weaker zombies) to towering Fleshpounds (gigantic, Hulk-like specimens that require tons of damage to go down) - each of them poses a threat and requires a different approach; a clot might be easy to kill, however, if he grabs you, all other specimens will close in on you; a scrake, for example, is better dealt with with a single powerful headshot - weaker weapons will only anger him, making him charge your team and most likely getting a person or two killed. Some nullify grenades, some are invisible... The list goes on. The player should never feel safe and overconfident, failure is always a possibility and it only takes a single mistake, like being out of position, to ruin a match.\n\nThere are almost 30 official maps in [u]Killing Floor[/u] - farms, offices, hospitals, amusement parks (rightfully called Abusement Park), castles, space stations; this game has it all! They do have a lot of invisible walls, as you cannot climb most short fences or cars - that is one of the most obvious gameplay limitations; however, after playing it for a bit, I grew used to it. \nIt is frustrating, however, how little mobility you get. Your character moves very slowly in general, only getting a minor speed boost by equipping a knife or choosing a faster class.\n\nWhile freedom of movement around the maps and character speed might be slightly annoying, these shortcomings are easily countered by everything else. You have a huge variety of options regarding maps, classes and weapons in a game that offers unmatched replay value and a truly challenging experience (some might say the difficulty borders on unfair).\nEach map can be completed on five different difficulty settings (and must be if you want to get all achievements). However, the lower difficulty achievements do not unlock when you complete the highest difficulty one - which is unfortunate; I managed to finish all \"Hell on Earth\" achievements and still had to go back to finish maps on \"Normal\" and \"Hard\". Each map takes around 30/45 minutes to complete - with an ever present possibility of failure, having to start over.\n[u]Killing Floor[/u] also features Workshop support; a ton of extra maps and skins are available for free, increasing the replay value indefinitely.\n\n\nNow that I have (finally) finished talking about the gameplay, it is time to move to [u]Killing Floor[/u]'s audio.\nThe sound is great in this game. One of the many things I love about it is its personality and charm - something I feel is severely lacking in [u]Killing Floor 2[/u]. That is where the voice acting comes in. Is it good? No! It is actually quite bad. It is one of those \"some bad is good\" sort of deals. Most playable characters are voiced by the same guy and have the same lines - it is hilarious! They are all stereotypically british and say things like \"I'm trying to heal you, not shag you\" or \"You're all fur-coat, no knickers b*tches\". [spoiler][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP4qxRkhUF4] Here! [/url][/spoiler] The game embraces its absurdity and never takes itself too seriously.\nWhile the voice acting is of the \"so bad it's good\" variety, the rest of the sound is actually really good. Guns and explosions sound amazing; getting a headshot with a shotgun sound crunchy, powerful and visceral.\nThe soundtrack is also great - I usually do not like metal but the music just gets me here. It gets you in the mood to kill some ZEDs. It is loud, it is over the top, it is perfect.\n\nGraphics-wise... The game is definitely not a looker. That being said, I've been playing [u]Killing Floor[/u] since 2011 (back when [u]Killing Floor[/u] and [u]The Binding of Isaac[/u] were the only games I could run on my horrible laptop - maybe that is why they hold a special space in my heart) and the graphics do not really bother me. If you check the store's screenshots you might get a good idea of how the game looks.\n\nWhen it comes to the community, I must say, [u]Killing Floor[/u] has a pretty decent one. I have made numerous friends while playing it and we still keep in touch and play it from time to time. It is a fully co-op experience, meaning there is little to no room for toxicity (even though it has increased over the years). The community is still active and usually very welcoming to new players - just ask for help and you will most likely make a friend or two.\n\nI adore [u]Killing Floor[/u] - great gameplay, personality and amounts of content. It has not aged particularly well graphics-wise but that is ok. As usual, it is better with friends!\n\nFinal score: 8.5 out of 10.","timestamp_created":1326238745,"timestamp_updated":1595291837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587569355964660645","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"505853","author":{"steamid":"76561197971263130","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":276516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":97368,"last_played":1656036161},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor--the perfect amount of chaos and teamwork--it goes on sale for $5 occasionally","timestamp_created":1326225767,"timestamp_updated":1326225767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4266985","author":{"steamid":"76561198034764629","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":25727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18823,"last_played":1608129438},"language":"russian","review":"ч0ткая игруля","timestamp_created":1326203693,"timestamp_updated":1326203693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"865037","author":{"steamid":"76561197980462138","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6678,"last_played":1444659839},"language":"english","review":"Kick some zombie ass with your friends or seal them out of your room, leaving them as a chew toy for the zombies.

TripWire is constantly adding more content to the game too, which is great. The more friends you have who are willing to play this with you the better it is, though.
