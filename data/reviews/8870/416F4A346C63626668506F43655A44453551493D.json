A beautiful, detailed environment and a unique combat system.  The story and pacing are both done extremely well, without any nonsense moral decisions tacked on. The only reason to dislike this game is if it falls outside your personal tastes. This game is about the story and the ability to explore every corner and rooftop of the immersive environment of Columbia. Players who can appreciate these things will not be disappointed. In addition, elements like tears and skylines give a fresh new take on combat unlike the other 2 Bioshock games and this is enjoyable. Overall, an excellent game.","timestamp_created":1624033154,"timestamp_updated":1624033154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93958407","author":{"steamid":"76561198445553484","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":318,"last_played":1605461239},"language":"spanish","review":"⢀⡴⠑⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠸⡇⠀⠿⡀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡴⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠑⢄⣠⠾⠁⣀⣄⡈⠙⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡀⠁⠀⠀⠈⠙⠛⠂⠈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⡿⢿⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⢀⡾⣁⣀⠀⠴⠂⠙⣗⡀⠀⢻⣿⣿⠭⢤⣴⣦⣤⣹⠀⠀⠀⢀⢴⣶⣆\n⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣷⣮⣽⣾⣿⣥⣴⣿⣿⡿⢂⠔⢚⡿⢿⣿⣦⣴⣾⠁⠸⣼⡿\n⠀⢀⡞⠁⠙⠻⠿⠟⠉⠀⠛⢹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣌⢤⣼⣿⣾⣿⡟⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⣾⣷⣶⠇⠀⠀⣤⣄⣀⡀⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠉⠈⠉⠀⠀⢦⡈⢻⣿⣿⣿⣶⣶⣶⣶⣤⣽⡹⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠲⣽⡻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣜⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣷⣶⣮⣭⣽⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⠻⠿⠿⠿⠿⠛⠉","timestamp_created":1624032069,"timestamp_updated":1624032069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93958318","author":{"steamid":"76561198845467167","num_games_owned":1050,"num_reviews":350,"playtime_forever":1602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":639,"last_played":1624356664},"language":"english","review":"Masterpiece.\nMind-blowing.\n\nI like the concept of this game a looooooooooot,\nthat mainly world and time, detail must discover by the player themselves.\n\nAnd DLCs, must play, another experiences of Rapture.\n\nBeside of the game, this game need remastered version,\nto fix Elizabeth's dress not glitch and drive away anymore.\n\nNice Game.

Если сначала я смотрел на Элизабет, как на стандартное воплощение влажных мечтаний зумеров 12-14 лет ( милая, скромная, красивая и умная, ну прям идеал 10/10 ) и не обращал на нее особого внимания, думал, так и будет до конца, то в последствии же, узнавая историю, я просто влюбился в нее. Непосредственно геймплей обсуждать особо смысла не вижу, шутерная часть стала на голову лучше, чем в предыдущих частях, но мне она не особо важна и я не считаю ее особенной частью серии, все же биошок это про сюжет и атмосферу, а не про стрельбу.\nРекомендую ли я к прохождению Infinite? Однозначно - да, и не только ее, а всю серию, узнать эту историю должен каждый, это настоящая классика нашего времени и ее нужно знать и уважать (классика ведь бл*тб).","timestamp_created":1623910214,"timestamp_updated":1623910214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93887226","author":{"steamid":"76561198146964635","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1933,"last_played":1623923538},"language":"english","review":"absolutely amazing trilogy and dlcs, would recommend to anyone","timestamp_created":1623907180,"timestamp_updated":1623907180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93885349","author":{"steamid":"76561199112462351","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":678,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":554,"last_played":1644968135},"language":"spanish","review":"cada ves te atrae mas la historia, para saber el origen de todo lo que sucede.\n","timestamp_created":1623903109,"timestamp_updated":1623903109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93880024","author":{"steamid":"76561198163681604","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":2262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2082,"last_played":1629946093},"language":"english","review":"It's ok","timestamp_created":1623891515,"timestamp_updated":1624644957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93879802","author":{"steamid":"76561198309638927","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":929,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":929,"last_played":1623890384},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite games of all time.","timestamp_created":1623891064,"timestamp_updated":1623891064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93879666","author":{"steamid":"76561198291824229","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":860,"last_played":1624072644},"language":"spanish","review":"Alto Juego, la mejor saga.","timestamp_created":1623890770,"timestamp_updated":1623890770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526813864707946777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93878158","author":{"steamid":"76561198170073742","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":281,"last_played":1600352158},"language":"english","review":"the last of us","timestamp_created":1623887666,"timestamp_updated":1623887666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93866559","author":{"steamid":"76561198801170195","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1034,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1034,"last_played":1623868583},"language":"german","review":"The Story is finished in the DLC content, can only adivse to check that out! 10/10\n","timestamp_created":1623868662,"timestamp_updated":1623868662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93866371","author":{"steamid":"76561198282141562","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":785,"last_played":1623868020},"language":"english","review":"The gameplay has some pacing and gameplay issues that many gamers might ignore while others will find mindly frustrating.\nOn top of that the main campaign completly neglects the storytelling and narrative that bioshock is famous for.

(Just a little Context, I am playing the games out of order so this is my 1st Bioshock game, oh and I was playing on Medium)\n\nGameplay wise, I found it to be a little bit inventive with some concepts like Vigors/Eves and the Tear system (Primarily the base game) but it seems to be your typical early 2010s shooter. I only found myself dying towards the end in the main story but there was a massive difficulty spike in B@S Pt.1. I died more than I'd like to admit due to dealing with more tanky and hard hitting enemies with a severely reserved ammo pool. Granted you can carry more than two weapons so that alleviates that. B@S Pt.2 Made for a delightful change in pace with its focus on on stealth rather than Head on Combat. Overall, the gameplay is Great in some places but mostly nothing to write home about\n\nThe Design of Infinite absolutely beautiful. It's early 1900's architecture and artistry retrofitted with a Steampunk twist makes for, what I would consider, one of the most unique settings in fiction. From the tower that harbored Elizabeth down to the broadsider. Same thing said for B@S but instead following a more 1920s-1930s Style of Art Deco with stylized alternatives for the base game weapons, even adding its own weapons Exclusive to B@S.\n\nI come off as a simple man to those who Initially meet me. But the stories I love are anything but simple. If your like me, then you will love this clusterfuck of a story that deals with quantum physics, time travel, alternate universes, fate, and familial complications. Despite the story's relatively short duration, it was such a delightfully beautiful and shocking story that it had me sat there in complete silence at times, trying to process what the fuck I had done and bore witness to.  \n\n(Spoilers for Burial at Sea)\n[spoiler] Burial at Sea honestly broke me. I found myself physically recoiling when Atlas had Elizabeth ready for a lobotomy. Each tap of his hammer, making me want to look away more. And the ending of Burial at Sea was so... Bitter... This is likely because I have yet to play the other games but I felt a bit down after seeing Elizabeth die. But hey, an excuse to spend another $40!

This game has it all: high fidelity graphics, thrilling gameplay, philosophy, paradoxical beauty, and politics. While I fear this review may become too long, I would be remiss if I skipped over any of these topics. \n\nLet's start from the top, shall we? The graphics. Wow, it's not often you think you are watching a movie while playing a game, but it's a common occurrence while playing Bioshock Infinity. What strikes me most is the extremely high fidelity, if one was asked to guess what year this game came out I wager most would say after the latter half of the decade, and they would be wrong. I myself am a bit of an expert on these things and am able to pinpoint the game came out in 2013, though that's not to say it doesn't look extremely impressive for its time. \n\nThe gameplay is nothing short of the best of its generation. When I say thrilling, I really mean it. There are times when you are thousands of feet in the air, soaring above the Earth, while moving nauseatingly fast and in these moments you will need to keep a calm head and shoot your enemies. If that doesn't sound thrilling, then I don't know what does. Seriously more fun than most modern roller coasters.\n\nThere are several deep philosophical discussions present in the game, though since I do not want to spoil them for you I will focus only on one: imprisonment. At the core of the entire game there is a truth that lives with everyone. They are prisoners. Every citizen, every enemy, Elizabeth, even the player. Let me pose a question to you: if one wanted to be free of the floating city, how would they do it? There is no correct answer to this question, it was a trick. They are trapped in Columbia for the rest of their life. This game explores how a permanent state of imprisonment, and inability to become free, can change and mold a society. If you are curious how a society of prisoners living under the illusion they are free would grow, this video game is for you.\n\nParadoxical beauty is something that is difficult to put into prose, so bear with me for a moment while I turn to poetry:\nAuburn sunrays sail the skies\nwarming buildings of all kinds\nFor above the Earth a city flies,\ncitizens restricted to its confines\n\nAnd in this city of open lies\ntread carefully around the fragile minds\nAround the corner you hear their cries\nas they pay homage to their shrines\n\nIf you thought freedom the ultimate prize\nwitness Columbia and its sinister design\nFor in this city you will be fine\nshould you submit to its unyielding binds.\n\nNow, last but certainly not least, the politics. In all my years of playing video games, Bioshock Infinite has some of the deepest commentary you can find in any art. That's right, not just video games, but across all art. I do admit that at times it is not the most subtle of critiques but this does not hamper the effectiveness is any capacity. \n\nEarly on in your adventure, you will wake up in ankle deep water in a church. You will hear a beautiful hymn as you collect yourself and try to find a way out. On your first encounter with another man, you will ask about your whereabouts, and he will respond, \"In heaven\". You will soon learn much about \"the prophet\", who seems an immensely important figure to the people praying. As you make your way into the world, you will hear the citizens make remarks about Columbia, all of them considering it the greatest, the highest, nation on Earth. You progress more, winning a raffle with a, in our modern eyes, disgusting prize: the opportunity to stone a couple because they are of different race. The game does not shy away from demonstrating how racist the populace is, as they cheer for the opportunity to stone the humiliated couple surrounded by racist imagery. What is all this a commentary on? It should be clear that it is early 1900s America, which I'm sure was obvious to the learned individual. In this review I cannot dive as deep as I would like into all the intricate details this game elegantly explores, because there is not enough space and I do not wish to bore you. \n\nInstead, I implore you to play this video game with a critical mind. I think it would be wise to do some background reading, I suggest the following: The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander, The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism by Edward Baptist, and The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion by Jonathan Haidt. Armed with only these books as foundational reading you should be able to fully grasp what Ken Levine and his team have managed with this game. \n\nIncredible. 10/10, take notes Rockstar.","timestamp_created":1623812097,"timestamp_updated":1623855290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93831807","author":{"steamid":"76561198105033553","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":983,"last_played":1623810350},"language":"spanish","review":"BUENARDO","timestamp_created":1623810629,"timestamp_updated":1623810629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93828772","author":{"steamid":"76561198068564510","num_games_owned":983,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":639,"last_played":1624671082},"language":"english","review":"i had fun","timestamp_created":1623804947,"timestamp_updated":1623804947,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93827151","author":{"steamid":"76561198089907807","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1445,"last_played":1622943705},"language":"spanish","review":"Lejos en muchas cosas al clasico Bioshock pero no por eso es un mal juego.
