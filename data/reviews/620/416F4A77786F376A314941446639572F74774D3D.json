my humble Opinion this is valves strongest title, hands down. As someone who really isn't huge on puzzle games the fact that this game is in my top 5 games of all time is clearly an indicator that its done something right. It takes the simple formula from its predecessor and cranks it up to 11. The puzzles are Challenging but fair. That said sometimes finding where you need to go in certain levels is a bit of a pain and the level that plays the infamous \"Combustible lemons\" line I can never figure out for some reason and I don't know why. However besides those tinniest of hiccups the game design is perfect. \n\nOn a visual level for a game over a decade old the game is still incredible looking. This is both a testament to the art team of this game and the incredible versatility of the source engine. The aesthetics in the game are also have more variety than Portal 1 and have levels that I've loved since I was kid first watching this game on Youtube. While many of the levels still have that clean, laboratory feel to it we also get plenty of abandoned overgrown areas, rusted forgotten locations deep underground and a glimpse at just how massive the facility is as it is torn apart. The few character designs we get are perfect and GLADOS's new look is sleeker and better looking than before.\n\nSpeaking of GLADOS its time we mention perhaps the best part of this game which is the story and its characters. Despite this being an older game I will not spoil the story because if for some reason you have both avoided spoilers AND are trying to see if this game is worth it, the story is best enjoyed when you don't know the twists. The main story is 2-3 times longer than its predecessor but is vastly more enjoyable. We get more characters, more lore and backstory to the history of Aperture science including the history of GLADOS herself as well as a satisfying conclusion to chell's story. As for newcomers, the most beloved and iconic is Wheatley, The loveable, dorky, and idiotic personality sphere who is trying to free you from the clutches of Glados. Stephen Merchants voice work for him is iconic and spectacular making him feel truly alive. Without spoiling too much Wheatley has such a fun and unexpected arc in the story and his big twist moment about halfway through the game is expertly done. For our second new characer we have Cave Johnson, Founder of Aperture Science and eccentric CEO voiced by the legendary J.K Simmons. He is funny, assertive, yet comforting and provides an incredible insight to the history of his company. As for recurring characters we have GLADOS. Yes chell also is here but she doesn't have any significant changes. GLADOS is probably still the best character in this series despite some fantastic new characters, and she goes through a surprising yet memorable character arc. Re-Awoken after her destruction  in Portal 1 she is once again 'Still Alive' and this time she is crueler than ever. Ellen McLain once again reprises her role as the homicidal mistress that torments us and this time shes more human than ever. Her voice is much less robotic and lot more human this time and its a welcome addition. Cracking more jokes than ever and consistently assaulting Chell with either backhand compliments or at times flat out calling you 'Smelly Garbage' she is more spiteful than ever. Despite her new cruel stroke however she is also more human and sympathetic than ever after the mid-game plot twist. We get to learn about her tragic backstory and she begins to soften up to Chell. I will end the explanation there to avoid spoilers but truly GLADOS is one of the best video game characters in history and this game is the reason. \n\nThe co-op is also a fun addition to the game and while its stories are not as in-depth or deep as the base game, the focus more so is on you and your partner trying to solve puzzles together so an in depth story would have been hard to focus on as your drops you into acid for his own amusement. That said its still a fun little narrative and P-Body and ATLAS are 2 new little robots that despite not having any dialogue still have plenty of lovable charm. \n\nThe music and sound design is also great. From the sound of lasers, to your portal gun, to wall plates moving everything in this game sounds top notch and fitting. The soundtrack also has changed. In Portal 1, it was much more of an ambient drone but in portal 2 it has much more complexity and is welcome. The best way I can describe it is imagine a fax machine started making music. Its great and has some really good bits of music in it.\n\nOverall, this game deserved every award it got and more. It is one of the greatest games ever told and every aspect about it deserves praise. Besides some tiny annoyances it is a perfect game. It makes me want a portal 3 so bad but also the way it ends equally makes me ok with it stopping. If we never get another portal game that would be completely fine because this game is fine the way it is. That said Aperture desk job has shown me something I never considered. We don't need a portal 3. The story of Portal is over. I think we just need more stories within the Aperture facilities. Chell's story is over as is GLADOS's. While you could perhaps expand on Wheatley's it is far from essential. That's all I have to say, this game can be enjoyed by everyone and probably should\n\n10/10 its as simple as that","timestamp_created":1652119059,"timestamp_updated":1652119059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115216149","author":{"steamid":"76561199076671518","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1656179983},"language":"english","review":"its good","timestamp_created":1652118734,"timestamp_updated":1652118734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115214480","author":{"steamid":"76561198028861189","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1014,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":872,"last_played":1652447802},"language":"russian","review":"интересная игра, заставляет подумать","timestamp_created":1652116146,"timestamp_updated":1652116146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115214204","author":{"steamid":"76561198798592763","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":464,"last_played":1652115082},"language":"english","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1652115752,"timestamp_updated":1652115752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115213413","author":{"steamid":"76561198349373719","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":687,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":320,"last_played":1652391266},"language":"latam","review":"S","timestamp_created":1652114534,"timestamp_updated":1652114534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115211702","author":{"steamid":"76561198396993346","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":22302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22302,"last_played":1643648565},"language":"russian","review":"норм","timestamp_created":1652112106,"timestamp_updated":1652112106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115211617","author":{"steamid":"76561198195785267","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":767,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":767,"last_played":1629568438},"language":"english","review":"A brillantly simple puzzle game with intuitive mechanics, an simple but elegant story as you attempt to gain your freedom, with your portal gun in hand.\n\nit's good.","timestamp_created":1652112000,"timestamp_updated":1652112000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115211615","author":{"steamid":"76561199174673836","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":21,"playtime_at_review":276,"last_played":1660496391},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever.
