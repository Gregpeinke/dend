Instead of the indoor corridors of a base you now make your way across the russian countryside, complete with beaches, forests, plains and a river, until you arrive to the city at the end. The environment *seems* open, but it's jut a long corridor. A varied corridor though. There are also vehicle sections, but I found those less enjoyable than the rest of the game.\n\nThe story takes a jump from the previous game, both in terms of time and current events, and the game does not really do a good job at explaining it to you. Everyone is talking between them and then they tell you to go do this so that can happen. It is recommended to look up the details yourself after beating it. Also, there aren't any cutscenes in this game, all the scenes happen during the gameplay (not the shooting, mind you).\n\nAll the enemy soldiers have an instantly recognizeable scruffy voice while the friendly NPCs sound more calmed and soft, for the most part. This game also has some os the most well known scores for PC games (like the Nuclear Mission jam), and the weapon sounds are very well made.\n\nThe graphics, although impressive for the time this came out, are showing their age. The art direction is fantastic though, with very cool designs for anything alien related. All the weapons are unique and instantly recognizable.\n\nThe Episodes continue with the same trends as the main game, with the exception of more focus on the Gravity Gun during Episode 1. There are no radical differences between them and the main game.\n\nOverall, I have to admit I did not like this game that much. I can see that it is a good game obviously, but it didn't ring the excitement bell like others have. I still recommend everybody to play it though, this is one of those in the \"must play\" list.","timestamp_created":1419791698,"timestamp_updated":1419791698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13668212","author":{"steamid":"76561198075712576","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3233,"last_played":1621025590},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor jogo ever","timestamp_created":1419788611,"timestamp_updated":1574808001,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13666859","author":{"steamid":"76561198121524193","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":718,"last_played":1462700853},"language":"russian","review":"да","timestamp_created":1419785045,"timestamp_updated":1419785045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13666302","author":{"steamid":"76561198148220875","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":186,"playtime_forever":2363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2010,"last_played":1612746178},"language":"english","review":"pretty nice bro play half life 1 though or everything is gonna be confusing as hell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni made that mistake of not playing half life first.","timestamp_created":1419783508,"timestamp_updated":1513765772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13664985","author":{"steamid":"76561198115446340","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":959,"last_played":1418145552},"language":"russian","review":"Очень хорошая игра советую пройти кто этого не делал сам прошёл 2 раза))))","timestamp_created":1419779395,"timestamp_updated":1419779395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566666662693023682","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13664790","author":{"steamid":"76561197995739602","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":723,"last_played":1652777416},"language":"spanish","review":"El mejor fps que he jugado nunca, supera incluso al primero.

Sachant qu'on ne passe pas a travers, il arrive plus que trop souvent de vouloir échaper a une grenade, et de se retrouver piégé par ses propres équipiers. Donnez une intelligence a ces pauvres bêtes.\n- Les épisodes \"véhicules\" : Particulièrement longs, simples, sans trop d'interet, bref, assez ennuyant. Celui avec le jetski est encore bien pensé, mais celui avec le buggy est aggacent dans le sens ou le moindre obstacle bloque la voiture si les quatre roues n'y sont pas. En bref, si on se retrouves sur une branche on doit descendre du véhicule, le pousser avec le pistolet anti-gravité, et remonter dedans. Cela prend approximativement une minute et 50 points de vie sachant que les Fourmilions vous attaquent en masse dès que vous n'ètes plus en mouvement.\n\nSinon, bon jeu.

I enjoyed the immersive dystopian world that the game throws you in. The evident struggle and poverty the citizens of City 17 (and the outer regions) encouraged you to really help put an end to the Combines grasp on the people. The game was not distrupted by cut scenes, which in most games often have better animations / graphics than the actual game itself, but rather, in Half Life 2 the game and cut scenes flow as one. It made the game that more enjoyable and helped the story to flow. I found the main characters relatable and began to really care about them (including the many Rebels and Antlions who joined me along the way. R.I.P). The relationships between the characters seemed believable and natural, which added to the connecton you, the player, develops. Gameplay was diverse, whether it be driving numerous vehicles, being out numbered by Combine Soldiers, taking on Stryders or Commanding a group of Antlions. I was never bored, it's quite impossible to when the action and story is so rich and constant. The world was pretty but also visibly changed by the neglect, conflict and change that had occured over time during the Combine Invasion. There was plenty of mystery especially the end. You gain background story as the game progresses adding to your knowledge of history of current events. I found it an incredible game and an engaging story and as a keen player of FPS games I was not disappointed. I defiantly reccomend this game to anyone who hasn't played it. I can't believe it took me 10 years to even discover this game, then again I was 9 when it game out.","timestamp_created":1419756751,"timestamp_updated":1419756751,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13657579","author":{"steamid":"76561198081999308","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":681,"last_played":1419083309},"language":"russian","review":"Игра детства, отличный сюжет, прекрасный геймплей, любимая атмосфера, прохожу 4 раз с радостью!","timestamp_created":1419751450,"timestamp_updated":1419751450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502133727073669434","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13655196","author":{"steamid":"76561198041924169","num_games_owned":549,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":552,"last_played":1382224587},"language":"english","review":"Ooh a Valve game.\n\nSilent protagonist?

Eu joguei diversos FPS, e do mesmo ano, 2004, poderia citar CoD: United Offensive e Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault. Jogos que não conseguem, em nenhum aspecto, ser superiores a HL 2. Desconsiderando comparações absurdas com games da uma, duas gerações de consoles a frente, o jogo é simplesmente sem igual.

Não vi outro FPS que conseguisse competir com Half Life 2 até o lançamento de BioShock em 2007.

Doch wo id's Doom 3 vor allem gewohntes Gameplay bot und die neue (Grafik)Engine präsentierte, zeigte Half-Life 2 was Ego-Shooter spielerisch mehr bieten können: Passende und nicht aufgesetzt wirkende Physikrätsel, eine fesselnde Fortsetzung der Story des Vorgängers, eine perfekt aufeinander abgestimmte Welt, die eine unglaubliche Atmosphäre schafft, die noch immer fesselt. Und es in Zukunft wahrscheinlich immer noch tun wird.\n\nDanke für die vielen Stunden mit Gordon und Alyx, Valve! Danke für die grandiose Fortsetzung eines schon genialen ersten Teils.

O jogo começa a adicionar personagens que lhe acompanham a maior parte da campanha, tais como Alyx, Barney e Eli, que são extremamente carismáticos, e que realmente lhe faz criar uma forte afeição por eles. Ainda adicionando um novo antagonista, e vários outros inimigos, em um universo distópico onde a unica coisa que resta é lutar por seus direitos, criando uma resistencia contra tudo o que está acontecendo. O uso da engine Source foi extremamente ótimo. A imersão ao personagem que você controla consegue ser ainda mais intensa, e os desafios que você encara passando pelo vasto mundo em que é colocado são incrivelmente divertidos e desafiadores.","timestamp_created":1419504590,"timestamp_updated":1419504590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13583704","author":{"steamid":"76561197974815274","num_games_owned":396,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":1784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1580,"last_played":1546669568},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever!

That is the first time, after expressing great love for Portal (which I bought on friggin DVD at Target in 2008) that a friend of mine said \"You.  Half-Life.  Make it happen.\"\n\nAnd I did.\n\nEight years after the game was released, I was 10,000% floored by the game mechanics, the engine, the physics, and the dystopian feel.  It was incredible.  I had played Half-Life by that point, and while it was fun, it was dated.  Half-Life 2 even now looks and feels like it isn't all that old.  It still looks and sounds great, and the coding is a tribute to Valve's tenacity.\n\nThe gravity gun needs no explanation except to say that it is truly the most unique weapon I have ever used in a game.  The Portal gun is fun, but the ridiculous things the gravity gun is capable of doing on a now 12 year old game engine are nothing short of amazing.\n\nWhen one of my closest friends built her first gaming computer (like a week ago), my first though was that I'd hit the holiday sale.  She is now the proud owner of the Orange Box and Portal 2 for all of the reasons obvious to everyone who loves this game.\n\nFPS can be immersive, involve problem solving, and require strategy.  I know this because this one does.  FPS does not have to involve stupid kids screaming expletives and slurs at each other over a headset on December 26.  FPS can be a person, unique experience.  Half-Life 2 is very much that.\n\nSTOP READING THIS AND GO BUY IT!  But if you're going to buy it know that it goes on sale regularly, so you might save a few dollars.  The Orange Box is a graet way to go.","timestamp_created":1419487783,"timestamp_updated":1419487783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13582055","author":{"steamid":"76561198080720675","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":974,"last_played":1406178077},"language":"english","review":"If my super crappy computer can run a game on max graphics that looks great, too, it's most likely gonna be a 10/10.
