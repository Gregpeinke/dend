Although some fans may suggest the ending was 'underwhelming', as an initiate into Bioshock, beginning my journey at the end was a smashing success with Bioshock Infinite. A first person shooter game set in an alternative universe filled with alternate universes. This Bioshock promises a JJ Abrams 'Fringe' feeling of causes and consequences. You do not have to be a fan from the Bioshock 1 to love this franchise; in fact, i'm set to purchase the rest of the trilogy and have started on the first one.\n\nThis Bioshock links the previous installments and ties it up in a bow. Set in fictional floating city of Columbia, where all our futuristic fantasies of flying zeppelins as modes of transports take an even better turn with a floating building. You follow Booker De Witt, who unlike the previous installments, is independant and makes his own choices. A debt to be repaid and the honour behind it, Booker finds himself entwined in Bioshock's classic motifs of fanatism taken too far. Religious fundamentalism and its consequences surround Booker and Elizabeth, and the pair set out to find their own way and free themselves from tyranny. Along the way, action, sci-fi and emotional air-hook rides toss you into different realities where science is bent in 10 different ways.\n\nThe plot thickens like gravy, and just when you think you understand what you must do, the story turns a whole different way. Granted, the ending is a bit hard to comprehend, and there are moments when you think 'hold on, thats impossible', believe it, because you want it to be.\n\nGameplay is FPS, which means sometimes its hard to defend yourself on the hardest difficulty, and i still cannot get past 1998 mode and constantly having to restart checkpoints. Plasmids are fascinating and as always the classic favourite elements; fire, electricity and water make their repeat appearances in your strange abilities.\n\nApart from having to amp up your skill in FPS, there hardly feels to be a complaint in gameplay, aside from the impossible feats. The DLCs KILLED IT. Connecting Bioshock 1 to Infinite in a BEAUTIful arc, where you realise things are not as they seem and are exactly what they look. Your return to Rapture is a stunning moment for loyal fans and for newcomers like myself, a masterpiece of a new area underwater.\n\nI would vehemently recommend playing this game through and its DLCs, 3 times till you get all the achievements, because it is an emotional and psychological thrill to ride.","timestamp_created":1478694695,"timestamp_updated":1480091311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26498714","author":{"steamid":"76561198084492247","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1079,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":924,"last_played":1481635145},"language":"english","review":"I fall in love to a character that doesn't exist in the real world      ;-;","timestamp_created":1478663809,"timestamp_updated":1478663809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":56,"votes_funny":11,"weighted_vote_score":"0.701832354068756104","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26498274","author":{"steamid":"76561198109749443","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2108,"last_played":1538404671},"language":"english","review":"An amazing narrative with fantastic gameplay that I wish I could pay again for the first time.","timestamp_created":1478659841,"timestamp_updated":1478659841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26496507","author":{"steamid":"76561198202847179","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1200,"last_played":1514608200},"language":"spanish","review":"Es imposible no pasarse como 15 minutos contemplando los pechos de Elizabeth.\n10/10 IGN","timestamp_created":1478647134,"timestamp_updated":1542863981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26496278","author":{"steamid":"76561198161267564","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":713,"last_played":1640817514},"language":"brazilian","review":"Não é sandbox (não é um defeito, é só pra acabr com a dúvida que muita gente tem e inclusive eu tive antes de jogar e não achei em site nenhum um artigo sequer que respondesse a essa questão, nem mesmo pesquisando em inglês) e o final é esquisito demais, mas o jogo é bom pra caramba, embora curto, o cenário é lindo (os gráficos também, para um jogo de mar/2013 que acabam superando até mesmoos gráficos de alguns jogos atuais), os reflexos e as partículas são perfeitos, o jogo está muito bem otimizado (roda no ultra com minha Zotac Geforce GTX 970 Amp!

A variedade de armas não é enorme como a de GTA e Saints Row mas tem o necessário e o suficiente para um jogo não muito grande como esse: RPG, carabina, fuzil de precisão, etc. No total são 8 poderes mas eu acabei não usando todos eles. O game pelo que parece pulou uma párte de uma missão pra mim só porque eu morria muito e a cada 30 segundos e eu fiquei meio chateado porque era uma missão bem bacana. O jogo pode dar uma \"queda de FPS\" quando tá salvando automaticamente ou renderizando uma nova parte do mapa após entrar em algum lugar, etc, independentemente do quão boa sua máquina é .Mas enfim, o game serve de exemplo pros próximos games FPS que devem vir e também para amornar o fracasso do BioShock 2.

It hits every mark for the classical sci-fi of the early 20th century, and it does it beautifully at that. With that being said, it's a Bioshock game, so be ready to get creeped out, absolutely mind-f*cked, all the while trying to shoot people in the face while blasting them with... magic? Salts. Yes, this game has a lot of salt. But anyway!\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful graphics, giant floating cities never looked so pretty.\n- Storyline is intense, appropriately confusing and complex, mind-boggling, and very well paced. The ending is quite amazing too tying all of the brain-f*cking together and laying out in great detail the components of the plot, ending most of the loose ends in the story.\n- Gunplay is great, but will touch on that a bit later.\n- Atmosphere-wise, amazing as expected from a Bioshock game. The sound design is awesome, appropriately creepy when supernatural sh*t goes down, and the harsh lighting effects in the game's various environments contribute to the extra evil creepiness that is going on in the city.\n- The lore is amazing, and will have you properly pissed at various social issues from the 20th century that are replicated in the city of Columbia. The universe feels real, and there is legitimate empathy for some of the poor souls in the city that have been castrated by the dystopia.\n\n\nCons:\n- Too much shooting, not enough magic. Vigors are rather underwhelming, and combined with the lackluster assortment of guns (of which you can only carry 2 at a time), combat is rather repetitive and uninteresting compared to the in-game technical accomplishments of the city. While again, the guns do feel nice and punchy, in the end it's just another headshot for another kill, nothing too fancy.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone that loves a good story and some solid FPS gameplay, but I would recommend to get it on sale. The reason for that is this game is rather short. I completed it in 9 hours, spending a good amount of time searching for secrets and extras. On top of that, the game has very little replay value aside from experiencing the plot a second time around.","timestamp_created":1478477112,"timestamp_updated":1478477112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26464855","author":{"steamid":"76561198340215968","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2080,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1859,"last_played":1502407324},"language":"english","review":"This game is amazing. \nThe story is is second to none.\nThe combat is some of the best in the genre.\nMust buy for new comers and obviously fans will know to buy it.\n\ni personally think that the first game is the best bioshock and always will be, but infinite is still a very special game.\n\nand the dlc is amazing.","timestamp_created":1478468005,"timestamp_updated":1478468005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26463605","author":{"steamid":"76561198119679318","num_games_owned":328,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":1169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1011,"last_played":1536269196},"language":"brazilian","review":"Coloquei no hard achando que ia me dar bem, com esse fdp desse jogo, não aguentei 10 minutos de por.rada com ele já tava querendo desistir, fui masoquista e zerei depois de passar muito ódio e raiva sair gritando e xingando tudo e todos com umas situações beirando o rídiculo esse jogo vai te deixar 999% modo turbo concerteza!

My only complain is that there's no inverntory. So I can't carry any health kit. You'll only find the health kits/food to replenish your health after you're done with the enemies and are free to explore around, which is kinda useless if you need to replenish your health DURING combat. In addition, the amount of food is insane once you've found them. It'll be much better with inventory, then these food/health kits won't go to waste. Other than that, this game is pretty awesome.\n\nEDIT: Another thing... Why can't the game be saved manually??","timestamp_created":1478238618,"timestamp_updated":1483891382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26408149","author":{"steamid":"76561198321013660","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1001,"last_played":1515810471},"language":"spanish","review":"Graficas hermosas, historia genial, juegazo","timestamp_created":1478218172,"timestamp_updated":1478218172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26405640","author":{"steamid":"76561198137877700","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2064,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1359,"last_played":1627229995},"language":"russian","review":"Игра великолепна!
