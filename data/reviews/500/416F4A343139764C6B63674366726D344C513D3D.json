I'm very glad i bought this game, as it has been one of the most entertaining games i've ever played. And when you play this with your friends, family, whatever (in my case; my sister), the fun doubles.\n\nThe game is made to never be the same every time you play it. Everything is placed out randomly, and new zombies appear out of nowhere, sometimes in hordes. You really need to work together to survive.\n\nI highly recommend this game to everyone who like zombies, like multiplayer games and people who like games where the gameplay always is new and fresh.\n\nI give this a rating of 8-10 (could use more varied weapons, but this is fixed in L4D2. Also, the weapons models are kinda tiny compared to the hands)","timestamp_created":1409470932,"timestamp_updated":1409470932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11924298","author":{"steamid":"76561198054269052","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":42080,"playtime_last_two_weeks":90,"playtime_at_review":22658,"last_played":1660507372},"language":"english","review":"love it better than l4d2 \n","timestamp_created":1409421199,"timestamp_updated":1409421199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11912094","author":{"steamid":"76561198044428728","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":17069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17009,"last_played":1484077381},"language":"english","review":"0/10 no shrek","timestamp_created":1409339547,"timestamp_updated":1409339547,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.432938992977142334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ419vLkcgCfrm4LQ=="}
