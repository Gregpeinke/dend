The de-emphasis of gameplay “doing” to make the narrative move to instead to provide a cinematic or scripted plot point is a crutch. Many, maybe let’s say “most” games cannot handle the responsible of balancing these elements properly. However, I think Half-Life 2 does. Though Campster seems to belittle the sections of gameplay in HL2, I think it’s perfectly paced, even if shallow in scope. Half-Life 2 doesn’t seem to ask for the overwhelming cheers fans give it; it knows its bounds, a solid FPS experience with a cute story. Yet, such simplicity often yields greater appreciation of beauty. Half-Life 2’s singleplayer experience still holds up today for its clean graphics and sharp yet average gameplay. None of which are particularly damning, since most gameplay today is average or dulled down anyway, HL2 doesn’t just fit in with the contemporary design philosophy, it instead stands on top of the mountain looking down at those who fail at it saying “Slow down, breath, don’t make it harder than it has to be”.\n\nOn a side note, Campster on Bioshock Infinite rings through this as well, to wit: HL2’s gameplay is far better, even if gimmicky at times. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ2cSKBFBDQ\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1426846496,"timestamp_updated":1426846496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14969643","author":{"steamid":"76561198129695829","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":973,"last_played":1428144178},"language":"english","review":"One ticket to the waiting train please.\n\nValve is the mother of PC gaming and this game is her favorite child.\n\nA must-play for a PC gamer.","timestamp_created":1426839221,"timestamp_updated":1426839221,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14968063","author":{"steamid":"76561198067257778","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":656,"last_played":1426823432},"language":"english","review":"Very good game with prime graphics and story telling.","timestamp_created":1426823522,"timestamp_updated":1426823522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14965726","author":{"steamid":"76561198053452667","num_games_owned":660,"num_reviews":89,"playtime_forever":1973,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1973,"last_played":1416309113},"language":"french","review":"One ne présente plus half life...

Everything about this game, to the smallest detail is done perfectly for its time, allowing the creation of this masterpiece of a game. Despite my absolute respect for this franchise, I am completely pissed off how Valve left this game on a cliffhanger, with no real closure to the story, ending the game on a bad note, and I truly wish they would have expanded on the character development and Borealis storyline.\n\nFirst off, the game's environment is truly gorgeous, and, when combined with the soundtrack and characters with their interactions, gives the game a unique atmosphere, accomplishing the wanted result: An atmosphere of despair and helplessness, that towards the end of the storyline turns into feelings of hope and achievement.\n\nSecondly, the story is very interesting and presents the harsh reality of the in-game world, filled with struggling survivors, the conflict between the Resistance and Combine forces, including the dangers of the creatures of Xen. The story of Borealis would have been very interesting if Valve continued with Half-Life 3.\n\nMy last point is that the graphics are perfect for the game's early release time, 2004. The shaders and texture details are very well made and obviously had a lot of work and dedication put into them.\n\nAs a closure, I think this game may have been even better than it has if Valve released Half-Life 3. Despite how mad the community is, maybe Gabe Newell is just afraid of not reaching our expectations with the game? With that being said I still believe we did not deserve the game and its storyline to end in such a terrible way with no true completion.\n\nOverall score: 9/10","timestamp_created":1426184564,"timestamp_updated":1527960484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480353087186813354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14852498","author":{"steamid":"76561198136846811","num_games_owned":781,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":871,"last_played":1423312313},"language":"english","review":"Veri g00d g4m3","timestamp_created":1426178389,"timestamp_updated":1426178389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14851362","author":{"steamid":"76561198077384979","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":908,"last_played":1494074440},"language":"english","review":"In this game is is god water !!!","timestamp_created":1426172209,"timestamp_updated":1426172209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503326952457427979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14847266","author":{"steamid":"76561198022198593","num_games_owned":624,"num_reviews":210,"playtime_forever":174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":174,"last_played":1426134445},"language":"japanese","review":"度々セールになるのでその時に買いましょう。名作です。","timestamp_created":1426134830,"timestamp_updated":1426134830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14844139","author":{"steamid":"76561198169386206","num_games_owned":556,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":133,"last_played":1589015146},"language":"english","review":"its half life2 for crying out loud!\nyou get to use a gravity gun and the physic is ahead of its time with a pack of gunblazing action.\nyou must play it, nuff said.","timestamp_created":1426113313,"timestamp_updated":1426113313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14841857","author":{"steamid":"76561198040409959","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1930,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1114,"last_played":1589641143},"language":"italian","review":"Nonostante abbia più di dieci anni, questa meraviglia è ancora ai vertici del suo genere.
