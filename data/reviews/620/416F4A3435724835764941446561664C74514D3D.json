I’ll go ahead and say it here folks - [b] Portal 2 [/b] is one of the best games you can play in your lifetime. Is it my favorite game of all time? No, not at this moment. But it's a damn good time and something you absolutely should go ahead and start playing before reading the rest of this review!\n\nFor starters, the gameplay loop is completely preserved in this title, only its bigger, more creative, and more engaging. Levels feel much more wide open, they have stronger focuses on physics mechanics, and they’re more challenging as you progress. It feels like much of the game picks up from where [b] Portal [/b] left off, and while it still gives a nice tutorial, it doesn’t drag out its length. It lets experienced players play around with the mechanics much faster, and avoids keeping new players chained down in the fun department like the original game did. Additionally, there are some nice new mechanics to play around with. There’s more momentum based puzzles, new goo mechanics (blue for bouncing, orange for speed, white for new platforms to portal to, and water to wash it all away!). There are also light ramps that serve as platforms and for blocking dangerous obstacles. It gives the game loads of new content, risk, and creativity for test chambers without stripping the flow that the first game introduced - a good focus for a sequel to have.\n\nThe story is pretty good as well. Obviously not as great as the improvements in gameplay, but it gives a great backdrop and honestly gives you some good reasons to progress forward. Essentially, GLaDOS is alive again and you have to figure out a way to shut down Aperture Science yet again, but there is a lot of great lore and mythos introduced as well as some great performances from Ellen McLain (GLaDOS) and Stephen Merchant (Wheatley). It’s an engaging ride full of some fun twists and turns, and elevates itself nicely above the smart but occasionally stagnant story of the original. Good stuff all around!\n\nValve’s presentation is also top notch here yet again. While this title doesn’t contain the most cutting edge graphics of the time, it's still an easy game on the eyes. Chambers range from eerily spotless and white to dilapidated and rotting, with much in between. You also get to see new sides of the facility you would’ve never been able to imagine before. An even more impressive aspect is the sound quality, with creaks and moans emanating from the broken Aperture Sciences facility. As mentioned before, the voice work is top notch, but there’s an added depth given with the robotic, programmed manner of GLaDOS, the more irritating yet endearing style of Wheatley, and the looming, omnipresent, and hilariously dumb Cave Johnson (voiced by J.K. Simmons). Valve really takes care in making sure their singleplayer titles are rich and immersive, and [b] Portal 2 [/b] is up there with [b] Half-Life 2 [/b] in this aspect.\n\nWhat put this game in a whole other tier was its quality cooperative campaign. I expected something fun but sort of brainless, and thought there would be much more sloppiness that would take away from the experience. However, there is both online/local play, mod support, and a solid amount of levels to play through that all have very well tweaked puzzles for two players. It’s amazing that this was able to be pulled off, and it helps this game transition from a bite-sized experience to a full AAA title. I had a great time playing through this mode with my girlfriend, and it was a nice way to cap off the fun I had with this game!\n\nWith its awesome single-player campaign and great cooperative campaign, great presentation and voice work, and combination of risky gameplay mechanics and staying true to the [b] Portal [/b] formula, [b] Portal 2 [/b] may be the best sequel ever made. It takes a grand step in elevating [b] Portal [/b] from a groundbreaking new IP into a franchise with a premier AAA entry, and it's a shame that a sequel was never quite developed for this one. There are virtually no flaws with this game that I can think of, save for a few odd test chambers here and there that weren’t “as fun” as the others. This is a definite [b] Recommend [/b] for me, and anyone who enjoys video games (let alone first-person puzzlers) should play this one through at least once in their lives.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 10/10 (Masterpiece) [/h2]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my curator page for my thoughts on a variety of other games!\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/37542043-ADHD-Reviews/","timestamp_created":1651361202,"timestamp_updated":1651361202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114746961","author":{"steamid":"76561198391760350","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1328,"last_played":1654466167},"language":"english","review":"masterpiece \n","timestamp_created":1651359680,"timestamp_updated":1651359680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114744613","author":{"steamid":"76561199237180924","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":718,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1651355973},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic game","timestamp_created":1651355893,"timestamp_updated":1651355893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114744319","author":{"steamid":"76561198976173738","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1651955642},"language":"english","review":"fun with a friend","timestamp_created":1651355429,"timestamp_updated":1651355429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114742655","author":{"steamid":"76561198214249123","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":819,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":526,"last_played":1659385313},"language":"english","review":"splooge level","timestamp_created":1651353021,"timestamp_updated":1651353021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114742463","author":{"steamid":"76561198048315752","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":826,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":826,"last_played":1651349402},"language":"russian","review":"+++","timestamp_created":1651352769,"timestamp_updated":1651352769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114742204","author":{"steamid":"76561198987852213","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":893,"last_played":1651607664},"language":"russian","review":"да","timestamp_created":1651352413,"timestamp_updated":1651352413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114741949","author":{"steamid":"76561198293087641","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3820,"playtime_last_two_weeks":36,"playtime_at_review":2875,"last_played":1660415627},"language":"english","review":"If I could rate this game out of ten, I would give it ten.
