All the time there are 2 weapons you can equip and there is less focus on the RPG elements and more focus on fast paced shooting. They reduced the types of \"spells\" that you can use and introduced some more but I think they are not very exciting to use.  The floating city of Columbia has its charming moments but after a while it becomes very generic, the variety of enemies is lacking as well.\n\nThere are some really memorable characters and dialog, the story is very good and your companion - Elizabeth is  charming - beautiful, smart, compassionate, driven, spirited and she knows some tricks. During the game she sometimes picks up coins and offers you ammunition, health and salt  when you are running low. She does speak and comment on the situation fairly often.\n\nI suppose the gameplay would have been better if they simply removed the 2 gun limit.\n\n[h1]DLC - Burial at Sea Part 1[/h1]\n\nReturning to the city of rapture definitely gave me nostalgic vibes.  This time around you will see part of the blooming era of the city, before things went wrong. There are many references to the old games as the story unfolds just a bit before the events of the First Bioshock game. It's nice to see old characters return and to learn a bit more about their lives and ideals. This its true for the 2nd part of the DLC as well. \n\nGameplay wise - it seems they listened and they removed the limit of 2 guns. Now you can access all the guns by holding down the E key, but the amount of ammo you can carry around is less.  Guns feel less powerful, ammo is scarce at the beginning, the game has to be played more tactically. I liked the change of pace and the more tactical feel, lying down traps, luring in enemies, using the environment to your advantage.\n\nThe interaction between Elizabeth and Booker Dewitt is still very strong as this duo goes through an investigation in order to locate a lost girl.  It build upon the main story and can be considered as a continuation of it.\n\n\n[h1]DLC - Burial at Sea Part 2[/h1]\n\nFinally, the time has come to play Elizabeth, although it is not going to be the way most of you imagine. Without giving out too much spoilers, lets just say the gameplay requires a lot of stealth and sneaking around. Most of the time you are not required to get rid of the enemies but simple sneak by and get to your destination. \n\nThe story is still a huge appeal of this DLC and it continues directly where the first part ends.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe whole package is well worth to play.  Easily you've got one of the best companion [Elizabeth] in video games and an intriguing story  with a diverse cast of characters, fair bit of mystery and turns of events, all wrapped in with some quantum physics and concept such as multiverse and time travel.\n\nAfter finishing all the Bioshock games recently, here is my ratings from best to worse:\n1 - Bioshock\n2 - Bioshock Infinite + DLCs\n3 - Bioshock 2","timestamp_created":1622404415,"timestamp_updated":1622406567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92890567","author":{"steamid":"76561198215810333","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1258,"last_played":1623107290},"language":"english","review":"The final and most memorable last part of this master trilogy.","timestamp_created":1622403470,"timestamp_updated":1622403470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92889830","author":{"steamid":"76561199121958010","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":744,"last_played":1653788334},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is probably one of the best games I've ever played.

Esse jogo é incrivel, e por mais que no começo e meio do jogo vc pense que \"Infinite tem nada haver com os anteriores\", não se preocupe! No final tudo fará sentido mas tambem, é confuso de se entender tambem.\n\n- PROS\n\n-Gameplay fluida e rapida\n-Todos os plasmids são bons, não exista um plasmid que vc não irá usar no jogo\n-São diversas roupas (Substituindo os genetonics dos anteriores) e em sua grande maioria são bons, podendo te deixa indeciso em qual usar \n-A mecanica de vc poder só carregar duas armas de sua escolha é muito bom, te dando diversos estilos de gameplay e mudando varias situações do jogo\n-A Elizabeth é simplesmente MUITO, mas MUITO prestativa, ela te da vida, vigor, munição e dinheiro sempre que vc estiver precisando\n-A historia é muito boa mas tambem causa bastante confusão\n-As duas DLCs do Jogo são otimas, principalmente a Burial at Sea pt 2\n-A segunda DLC te traz uma experiencia totalmente diferente da trilogia Bioshock, controlando a Elizabeth e tendo um estilo de jogo stealfh (Tipo metal gear) que super combina com a personagem e é bem divertido tambem\n-As DLCs trazem Plasmids novos, bons e bem legais tambem\n-As fendas da Elizabeth sempre te dão algo muito util\n\n\nCONTRAS\n\n- É triste saber que a 2K partiu uma DLC em duas partes apenas para lucrar mais\n- As DLCs só existem para tapar buracos na trama e explicar algumas coisas\n- Desbalanceamento das armas na campanha, visto que 60% dela eu joguei com a pistolinha que simplesmente é a melhor arma\n- Burial at Sea pt 1 é uma DLC que não tem balas, vc SEMPRE fica sem munição (O mesmo da pt 2 mas eu até entendo a falta de munição já que as armas lá são para vc passar desapercebido)\n- O comando de coletar tudo no Bureal at Sea é pessimo, vc ter que apertar 2 botoes para pegar todo o Loot é ridiculo (Primeiro apertar o E para vasculhar e depois do F para pegar tudo) Pq eu n posso apenas floodar o E? é bem mais rapido e melhor. Sem contar que eu nn consigo mudar isso, é triste\n\nNo geral, o jogo é ótimo, super recomendo jogar caso queira só um FPS de tiro pra lá e tiro pra cá, ele como eu já disse é rapido, frenetico e tem diversas mecanicas legais. Recomendo que vc jogue primeiro o Bioshock 1 e depois vá direto pro Infinite e no final, vc joga o Bioshock 2 ou vc pode inverter a ordem do 1 com o Infinite que dá certo\n\nNota: 9.5/10","timestamp_created":1622305134,"timestamp_updated":1622305134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92807716","author":{"steamid":"76561198145026668","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1320,"last_played":1621866774},"language":"schinese","review":"重温经典，云端之上没有天堂，但有伊丽莎白，确实是这样的。","timestamp_created":1622304729,"timestamp_updated":1622304729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92807512","author":{"steamid":"76561198440353306","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":852,"last_played":1622303099},"language":"schinese","review":"推荐别玩海葬2，我裂开","timestamp_created":1622304542,"timestamp_updated":1622304542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92805835","author":{"steamid":"76561199129117942","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":224,"last_played":1627566332},"language":"schinese","review":"这不比买个电影票看速九有意义多了\n","timestamp_created":1622302942,"timestamp_updated":1622302942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws8yy3PkCe6yD4gI="}
