The player hosted servers are broken or extremely hard to set up or load into, so you have to play public matches\n2. Random people can join public matches at any time (including just before the end of the game)\n3. If you don't start the game at the start, you have almost no hope of winning. \n4. The kick voting system somehow doesnt kick a 2 on 0 vote but a 3 on 1 vote it does. \n5. There is FPS lag whenever you shoot a strong gun/fast weapon e.g. flamethrower.\n6. Solo game gets extremely boring and the zombie spawns are predictable\n7. A DLC weapon can do teamdamage allowing people to teamkill. \n8. The community has hardly any people and the people who do play it are mostly kids and people who either don't understand English or refuse to communicate.\n9. The number of zombies spawned and the spawn locations differ with different people, meaning if someone runs around without communicating to you where they are, zombies can spawn and surround and kill you.\n10. People who are maximum level joining normal games to crash them purposely\n11. People who are maximum level joining normal games and asking for money.\n12. People who are maximum level joining and killstealing/xp stealing from newbies/other players.\nThis is just the start of this, you can ask me if you'd like to know more.\nHowever, if it wasn't for the community and shitty design, I would rate this game a solid 7/10, but due to its poor design/matchmaking/community it only deserves a 3/10 at best.","timestamp_created":1483271946,"timestamp_updated":1483271946,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.420597553253173828","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28896602","author":{"steamid":"76561198166837757","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":6035,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3099,"last_played":1635207225},"language":"english","review":"Hahahahhaha, blood and guts what more could a gamer want","timestamp_created":1483263700,"timestamp_updated":1483263700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499875009059906006","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28891795","author":{"steamid":"76561198130921833","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":940,"last_played":1540039061},"language":"thai","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1483248021,"timestamp_updated":1483248021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28878810","author":{"steamid":"76561198264243422","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1497138385},"language":"spanish","review":"Very good game, recommended 100%","timestamp_created":1483210911,"timestamp_updated":1483210911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28869526","author":{"steamid":"76561198048425875","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3913,"last_played":1657563615},"language":"russian","review":"водка, пивас, клёвый расколбас","timestamp_created":1483192754,"timestamp_updated":1483192754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28866307","author":{"steamid":"76561198213476532","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1599,"last_played":1528953504},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1483186094,"timestamp_updated":1483186094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28865211","author":{"steamid":"76561197984180355","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":41,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41,"last_played":1483183541},"language":"english","review":"I never wrote negative critics (or any other per se), but there is a first time for everything.
