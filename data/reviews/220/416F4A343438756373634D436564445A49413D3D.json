The game was released in North America, Europe and Australia in October 2008, and in Japan in December 2008 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\nFallout 3 takes place in the year 2277, 36 years after the setting of Fallout 2 and 200 years after the nuclear apocalypse that devastated the game's world, in a future where international conflicts between the United States and China culminated in a Sino-American war in 2077, due to the scarcity of petroleum reserves that ran the economies of both countries. The player character is an inhabitant of Vault 101, a survival shelter designed to protect up to 1,000 humans from the nuclear fallout. When the player character's father disappears under mysterious circumstances, the leader of the Vault initiates martial law and sends security forces after the player, who is forced to escape from the Vault and journey into the ruins of Washington, D.C. to track their father down. Along the way the player is assisted by a number of human survivors and must battle myriad enemies that inhabit the area, now known as the \"Capital Wasteland\".\n\nFallout 3 was critically acclaimed and received a number of Game of the Year awards, praising the game's open-ended gameplay and flexible character-leveling system. The NPD Group estimated that Fallout 3 sold over 610,000 units during its initial month of release in October 2008, performing better than Bethesda Softworks' previous game The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, which sold nearly 500,000 units in its first month. The game has received post-launch support with Bethesda releasing five downloadable add-ons. The game received controversy upon release, including the use of and the ability to be addicted to morphine and other drugs including alcohol in the game for Australia, religious and cultural sentiments in India over the cattle in the game being called Brahmin, and sensitivity in Japan due to a weapon that launches mini nuclear bombs called the \"Fat Man\" and a quest involving the detonation/disarming of an atomic bomb.","timestamp_created":1389018604,"timestamp_updated":1435357544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8591456","author":{"steamid":"76561198097778228","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":383,"last_played":1445985509},"language":"german","review":"Absolut Geile Story, Sollte man gespielt haben:)","timestamp_created":1389017715,"timestamp_updated":1389017715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8590965","author":{"steamid":"76561198109881000","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1532,"last_played":1630203025},"language":"english","review":"I will admit that I have not played many games in my life, but in my opinion it was the best game I have ever played by a longshot.

Right now i have 43.7 hours on record according to steam, while the story is about 7-8 hours if you are playing for the first time. \n\nThe arsenal is amazing, no matter what playstyle you like, there is a weapon to match it, although you shouldn't rambo in on a strider with a crowbar. From human-made weapons to scientific experimental weapons with alien and bio weaponry along the way. The gravity gun is most notable however. No matter where you go, you can always kick some ass by blasting almost anything around you in your enemy's face. They made a desk their cover? Desk in the face! \n\nI once bought it after I played through portal and portal 2. I was a fan, and wanted to know how the borealis tied in to the half life story. I thought it was nothing special. After that i bought the rest of the whole series, including half life 1 spin-offs. I must have played half life 2 and it's episodes at last 10 times each, from beginning to the end. \n\nThe story holds on to you, you will want to play again just to see if you missed a part of the story. Seeing City 17 at the start, as a calm city dominated by the combine, to seeing it again later, and seeing the combine's expansion, and their fall. It just kicks ass. I won't spoil anything else from the story. \n\nI'l be honest. The graphics don't match up to today's graphics. But the facial animation, the realism in the faces, it's just awesome considering it was released in 2004. The physics engine is source, ofcourse. Do I need to say more? Probably not, it's awesome. \n\nTrust me, if you want a FPS with puzzle elements and the best story you've ever seen in video-gaming, get Half life 2.","timestamp_created":1388942968,"timestamp_updated":1388942968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542612612247467041","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8576159","author":{"steamid":"76561198051723569","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":662,"last_played":1457732737},"language":"russian","review":"Nice\nGj","timestamp_created":1388941728,"timestamp_updated":1388941728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8576052","author":{"steamid":"76561198081859449","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1500,"last_played":1432055721},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom,um dos melhores jogos que eu ja joguei!","timestamp_created":1388941286,"timestamp_updated":1388941286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8575836","author":{"steamid":"76561198069846971","num_games_owned":499,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":313,"last_played":1462200491},"language":"english","review":"I LOVE this game.\nAbsolute masterpiece!","timestamp_created":1388940595,"timestamp_updated":1388940595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510843515396118164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8575716","author":{"steamid":"76561198099218863","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":593,"last_played":1417806383},"language":"english","review":"Very interesting, fun game which keeps you going.

It is a sequel to the previous game, Half-Life.\n\nThe game focus on storyline set after the event of Half-Life, in a City 17 somewhere in Eastern Europe. You play as Gordon Freeman, the protagonist from Half-Life and embark on a new journey as he return from G-man stasis. The world that he once knew has changed, the Combine has taken over. Now he must struggle along with his fellow human resistance for survival.\n\nUsing the new Source Engine, Half-Life 2 has remarkable graphics and far better than the previous Half-Life game. The new physics are incredible, almost everything is moveable. Textures and effects are also even more beautiful. The best graphics of the time.\n\nIt's a good classic first-person shooter game with the best story, I recommend this.\n\nRating 10/10","timestamp_created":1388932038,"timestamp_updated":1403064870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.673876941204071045","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8573184","author":{"steamid":"76561198074343277","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1533338822},"language":"english","review":"<3hl2","timestamp_created":1388930267,"timestamp_updated":1388930267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8572936","author":{"steamid":"76561198089906389","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":951,"last_played":1388760304},"language":"russian","review":"Это шедевр!","timestamp_created":1388929239,"timestamp_updated":1388929239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8572667","author":{"steamid":"76561198111423495","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":352,"last_played":1499947517},"language":"english","review":"half-life 2 is probably the best post-zombie/alien/war apocolypse game you can find on steam.
