You must turn on your brain and think. Sometimes I had problems too, but it isn't hard solve them. This game is simply fantastic and I hope, that second continue will be yet better. Sound in the background on the end of game is beautiful. I recommend this game for all people. I'm finished the game for 3 hours and is quite short. At least you must try it. :)\n\n(Tahle úžasná hra je většinou těžká, ale to je to pravé kouzlo této hry. Musíte zapnout mozek a myslet. Někdy jsem měl problémy i já, ale není těžké je vyřešit.  Tato hra je jednoduše fantastická a doufám, že druhé pokračování bude ještě lepší. Zvuk v pozadí na konci hry je krásný. Doporučuju tuto hru všem lidem.
