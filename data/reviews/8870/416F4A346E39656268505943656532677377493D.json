This is an easy mainstream recommendation. Masterpiece of a game. \n[/list]\n\n[url=https://martopad.medium.com/bioshock-infinite-review-52f37914bf1a]For Full Review; as my review exceeds Steam's charater limit[/url]\n\nBioshock Infinite will always be the game that I’m scared of playing but will begrudgingly continue to finish because the story is so good. For a game that gave me difficulty in sleeping. Even after finishing the game, I was watching videos online about its lore, and explanation pieces. \n\n[h1]THERE’S ALWAYS A MAN WHO REVIEWS[/h1]\nFor a game that gave me nightmares for a week or two. Why buy it? It was poor research on my part. I mainly buy games on steam, and Bioshock Infinite is cheap during sales. And I say hey since it's cheap and it’s a game highly regarded as a masterpiece why not give it a shot? ...\n\n[h1]THERE’S ALWAYS EXPECTATIONS[/h1]\nIn this game, you are Booker Dewitt, who is on a mission to Columbia. A city in the sky. This is set in 1912, with some trappings of real life. It prefaces itself to a scenario like Bioshock 1; what if there was a person who aimed to make a city in the sky.  \nLet me tell you, Bioshock Infinite’s graphics still amazed me in 2020. Its art-style holds up even after 7 years. Not to mention it runs well on my gaming rig (i7 8650U and a 2070S) considering I have an Ultrabook CPU. They went with this art style that mashes realism with a comic-book type of style. I’m glad they went with this because it doesn’t look dated in 2020. \nThe moment you get introduced to Columbia; you will enjoy every moment of it. They sell the “city floating in the sky” well. From captivating visuals like architecture, famous American figures, clouds that obscure the distant floating cities, and cities slightly swaying left and right. To great sound effects like the loud roaring of floating machinery, crowd murmurings, crowd activity, bells tolling from afar, and old-school-style music being played from their radios. Currently, as I’m writing this, I’m listening/watching to ambient Bioshock Infinite videos on YouTube, because of how much content there is from just sitting in a corner and let the world play its thing. How I wish they would release a patch that would let players just explore the levels with NPCs roaming around without combat. It's so good. \n\n[h1]SHOOT, SHOCK, and PUNCH![/h1]\nAs much I want to gush about the game’s visuals, sound effects, and music. This is only part of the game. Bioshock Infinite’s mechanics are also great. \nAs with any Bioshock games, there is a mix here of both guns and Vigors (same with plasmids in Bioshock games). The gun selection is as expected. From your normal range of pistols to rifles. The game gives you enough variety to tackle enemies, which is shooting them to the face. Nothing mind-blowing here.\nUnlike guns, the Vigor selection provides many ways to combat enemies. From the classic “Shock Jockey” (Electro Bolt) to “Return to Sender” (which absorbs incoming damage and hurls it back to enemies). With the variety, I was able to find the combo I’m comfortable with; a Sniper rifle with Shock Jockey and Possession (which temporarily controls enemies and turn them on your side). \nBut the game will throw you in situations wherein you must try and change your strategy. ...\nIn addition to your arsenal, there is now a new weapon/exploration tool, called the Sky-Hook. It adds a new dynamic to combat and lore-wise it makes sense. ...\nAmong the new features that this game has introduced. Your partner, Elizabeth is the best new feature they have implemented. Oh man, she was a big help helping me getting through this game. To whoever programmed her behavior you guys deserve a raise! They programmed her with so much personality, I can see why the steam community page is still brimming with Elizabeth's content. Once you get to be her partner, she will walk beside you as you explore and do combat. \nDuring exploration sequences you will see her interacting with the environment; Sitting on benches, looking at windows, throwing rocks at the beach, and many more. She will also ask/talk to you when you do something; going into female bathrooms, exploring objects, looking at decorations, and many more. She is also well-animated showing emotion well. One more thing that she does during exploration sequences is she will tell you where some items are by calling your attention, and she will also find and give some currency for you. \n...\nThe thing with Elizabeth that amazes me is they managed to make an AI partner that is not cumbersome, filled with personality and helps (I’m looking at you Wolfenstein: Young Blood). I would go on a limb and say that even if she didn’t have any combat-related functionality, I will still give a huge positive here. Because I liked her not because she gives me combat advantage, but because she has personality. I immediately got attached to her and was constantly looking at her behavior during exploration sequences. She made my experience in this game more beautiful. \n\n[h1]THE STORY THAT MADE MY JAW DROP[/h1]\nIn my opinion, the most welcomed feature that Bioshock Infinite inherited from its predecessors is its exploration-based storytelling and exploration in general. Bioshock Infinite will reward you by exploring its world. It will reward you by giving you in game materials like ammo, and currency. But the most important one is the Voxophones. Voxophones are the same as audio recordings.\nSame with other Bioshock games, Bioshock Infinite allows you to understand more of what’s happening by finding these Voxophones. I would compare the experience here to how raytracing makes everything more beautiful. A game like Battlefield V already looks beautiful, but when raytracing is enabled it looks even better. Voxophones contextualizes your perspective while playing the game, the story is great, but these audio logs make it perfect. \nAs I collected Voxophones, there were “OHHHH SHIT!”, and “SO THAT’S WHY!” moments. It's so refreshing to have these moments sprinkled throughout the game. There was one instance wherein a new character is introduced, and I don’t have a clue of who this person is. As the game progressed, I collected Voxophones that introduced who this character is and what happened. The recordings showed humanity in these people, their motivation, their thoughts. It showed a glimpse of the why in their actions. Which enriches the cutscenes and set pieces more. The voice work in this is amazing, from minor rants to grand statements. They convey emotion in their voice for both when you see the characters, and in Voxophones.\n\n[h1]THERE’S ALWAYS A VERDICT[/h1]\nBioshock Infinite is a game that has amazing storytelling, great combat, and rewarding exploration. I was emotionally invested through its up and downs. Even when the game is over, I was thinking about it. I can see this already being considered a gaming classic, and in 2020 still a masterpiece of a game. The horror aspect of the game may be a possible deterrent but I tell you, experiencing this game was worth it.  \n","timestamp_created":1606551719,"timestamp_updated":1606552093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80808472","author":{"steamid":"76561198264948769","num_games_owned":436,"num_reviews":124,"playtime_forever":3963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":840,"last_played":1656255184},"language":"english","review":"Masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1606550826,"timestamp_updated":1606550826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80804954","author":{"steamid":"76561198320941016","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":2274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":783,"last_played":1616773351},"language":"schinese","review":"带点动画风的画面，有点绕脑子的剧情，完整的世界观，合乎情景的配乐，最佳助手伊丽莎白。见证美丽的天空之城哥伦比亚的陨落，体验布克和伊丽莎白纠结在一起的人生，很棒。dlc将三代和一代完美衔接，真希望伊丽莎白好好呆在巴黎，不再离开。美中不足的是游戏的战斗体验一般\n","timestamp_created":1606549176,"timestamp_updated":1616774167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80804685","author":{"steamid":"76561198398893302","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":723,"last_played":1600831247},"language":"english","review":"This game seems to be perceived as some sort of classic, and in some ways I can see why. The story is leagues beyond gaming's usual standards, the world building and characters are great, and the maps are just delightful. However, it was a close call deciding to recommend this one, mostly because while all those things are great, the core gameplay is combat, and the design of that element is terrible. All the usual suspects that make modern shooters insipid make an appearance: impressively uninspired weapon design, regenerating health, slow movement speed, and near universal use of hitscan weapons among enemies. The big upsides of the story and the low price tag are enough to outweigh this and you'll probably have a good time on your first playthrough. The fact that the game succeeds despite the combat is a testament to how well done the other elements are.","timestamp_created":1606549046,"timestamp_updated":1606549087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80803830","author":{"steamid":"76561197981503310","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":6883,"playtime_last_two_weeks":100,"playtime_at_review":3420,"last_played":1659671582},"language":"english","review":"The best of the three games, amazing!","timestamp_created":1606548614,"timestamp_updated":1606548614,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80800124","author":{"steamid":"76561198331468478","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":109,"last_played":1630094557},"language":"latam","review":"PERFECTO","timestamp_created":1606546720,"timestamp_updated":1606546720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80799528","author":{"steamid":"76561198185195801","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":786,"last_played":1613525869},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏画面属实惊艳，很有艺术风格，这款游戏会告诉你为什么游戏会被叫做第九艺术。游戏时间不长，十几小时就能通关，但它的确讲了一个十分十分深刻的好故事。","timestamp_created":1606546401,"timestamp_updated":1614263615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80798867","author":{"steamid":"76561198881633513","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1252,"last_played":1608570010},"language":"english","review":"From the bottom of the seas (Bioshock 1 and 2) to the sky.
