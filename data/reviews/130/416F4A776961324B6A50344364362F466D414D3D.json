I heard that this and Opposing Force are of questionable canonicity. It's also cool how Gearbox made this with Dreamcast limitations in mind, which explains the missing OF content.\n\nMy opinions on Blue Shift are a bit mixed, but generally positive. My expectations were high coming out of Opposing Force, and I came into that with low hopes. Thinking of this game as a side story instead of a full on Half Life game like Opposing Force is the best way to approach it. The combat is still fun as ever, though it's disappointing that the Opposing Force weapons didn't return. I think Blue Shift does a better job at giving a different Resonance Cascade point of view than Opposing Force does, which is cool. I really don't have much to say here other than it was a decent experience. If you can't get both this and Opposing Force, go with the latter.","timestamp_created":1641874978,"timestamp_updated":1641875307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107770152","author":{"steamid":"76561198021053414","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":587,"last_played":1641871837},"language":"english","review":"Short and sweet and not as varied as the original or OF, but still quite fun and with a good story.","timestamp_created":1641871882,"timestamp_updated":1641871882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107764520","author":{"steamid":"76561198969198561","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":261,"last_played":1610471869},"language":"english","review":"good mod","timestamp_created":1641863562,"timestamp_updated":1641863562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107751566","author":{"steamid":"76561198858551873","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":35,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35,"last_played":1638083966},"language":"russian","review":"Я чуть чуть поиграл.
