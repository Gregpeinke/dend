！\n推荐理由:我们经常会看到游戏称为第九艺术说法，那么这款游戏就很好的诠释了这个说法。(前提是要有欣赏艺术的鉴赏力和心态，只喜欢打打杀杀的童鞋不适合此类游戏)\n生化奇兵系列在真实的历史上背景塑造了一个架空的神秘世界。奇幻，神秘，富有天马星空的想象力，却又与真实的世界息息相关，代入感十足。生化奇兵系列无疑是游戏中的一代经典，而生化奇兵:无限就是经典中的经典！\n 在生化奇兵:无限的世界里，你可以领略如油画般美伦美幻的风景，聆听悦耳动听的旋律。置身于充满未知却又令人熟知的奇妙世界，惊讶于美丽世界背后的惊奇故事，感叹于光明表象背后的黑暗。当你迷失于无限的循环之时，蓦然回首，一切的一切，都始于最初的决定。\n如果你认为它只是讲述了一个乌托邦的故事，让你欣赏风景的游戏的话那可就大错特错了。它恰恰是典型的反乌托邦题材，游戏前期的美好是为了衬托现实的黑暗，但是在这个黑暗腐坏的世界里，还会有一个爱你的伊丽莎白不离不弃，在我们寻找真理的道理上提供一丝人性的光辉。\n在游戏本身的游戏性上，生化奇兵无限也是十分出色。作为一款fps游戏，他的战斗系统也是独居特色:即包含传统fps元素之外，又增加了如魔法释放，空中导轨等更加丰富操作手法。广阔的自由度，半线性的叙事手法，加上画龙点睛的支线寻宝任务，为游戏的玩法策略上提供了更多的可能。玩家可以选择一路潜行做一个默默寻求真相的追梦人，也可以大开杀戒高调的改变世界！那么除此之外，游戏中还有数十张隐藏在各个角落中的录音卡带，它们可以帮你解开各个谜团，了解背后的故事，收集党和剧情党不容错过。\n        这个世界上有无数座灯塔，也有无数条道路通往不同的灯塔，也有无数个你和我。或许我们走过相同的路，到过相同的灯塔，但是却从不曾相遇，一切的一切只是无法改变的无限循环。我是谁?Booker Dewitt or

E aqui não acontece diferente.\n\nAntes de comprar o game vi que o final é de deixar o jogador de boca aberta por horas a fio após os créditos subirem, e vim aqui confirmar que é isso mesmo. Fuja de qualquer spoilers sobre o game, uma boa parte da graça de Bioshock é justamente essa descoberta aos poucos do que está acontecendo.\n\nNa minha opinião é uma forma excelente de amarrar toda a história dos 3 games e fechar a franquia com maestria.

The developer was trying to vilify multiple groups of people and it evens up a little bit. But as a Chinese,  I did feel intruded by the Boxer's Rebellion part of the game. It's true that the mob killed many missionaries but they already paid their price, 8 countries seized Beijing (translated as Peking at that time) and had a huge massacre there. And yes, US did send more than 3000 solders and made a great contribution to it. The developers might not well familiar with that part of the history and used iconic racism Chinese characters and was not paying as much tribute as they did with the native Americans. I can kinda accept it since it was in comparison with the wounded knee massacre. However, you cannot just borrow Chinese characters and put them inversely at random places. There was an image of \"Tian Xia Wei Gong\" (\"天下為公\", which means \"The world belongs to for all\") hanging at the doors of the Boxers' Rebellion museum in the game. You might see it a lot in Chinatown, and that's because it was the most famous quote from Sun Yat-sen, one of the founding fathers of China. It definitely has nothing to do with that rebellion. I have to admit it's almost impossible for most people to relate to that feeling. The closest comparison I can come up with is to imagine how you might feel if a popular game from the other part of the world have \"All man are created equal\" hanged upside down when it was talking about slave trades in early 18th century. \nFinished the main story in just over 7 hours. Bought the entire franchise a couple of years ago, and started with Bioshock remastered. Spent a couple of hours and gave up. It's been years since people started to tell me how good this game is and how it is one of the best representation of games as arts. After finishing the main story, I must admit, I enjoyed the scenery of Columbia. Even based on today's standards (2019) it's still gorgeous when I maxed out everything in 4k. I love wandering in the zip-lines around the floating city. But only a small proportion of the game was located in the \"beautiful\" city before everything got blew up and I did got bored when I have to travel long distances across the broken city multiple times. This redundant play seems unnecessary to me. The gameplay and actions are smooth and I can hardly find any flaws. Elizabeth is indeed the best teammate you can ever dream of. Return to the plot, the story has lots of contents, and it did raise a lot philosophical problems. However, most of the questions were not revealed until the very end of the story and it made me feel a little bit uncomfortable. It's like \"oh yes you killed the boss, and let's talk about some moral dilemmas and makes you feel bad.\" Despite all those problems, it's still one of the greatest story rich action game I've ever played.\nI'm still recommending this game not because I'm completely satisfied with it, but more like I have to accept how difficult it is to understand a different culture. There are lots of misunderstandings between US and China, and we still have a long way to go.","timestamp_created":1569959282,"timestamp_updated":1569959666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534965038299560547","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55387370","author":{"steamid":"76561198287737962","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":559,"last_played":1569958129},"language":"russian","review":"Не пытки меня сломали.

强化记忆自己死亡的过程，然后在失忆后 潜意识以最信任的布克形象进行自我暗示。游戏进程中伊丽莎白流鼻血，还有自己照镜子满头是血等闪回片段，都证明伊丽莎白逐渐回忆起自己是怎样逐步走向死亡的了。\n\n既然伊丽莎白知道自己会死，那为什么要毅然赴死呢？一开始游戏里是用宿命论来解释的的。伊丽莎白是布克的女儿，而布克也是康姆斯托克，就像硬币的两面。所以伊丽莎白有时会像康姆斯托克一样偏执，例如为了复仇把sally置于险境而不顾。但有时又会想布克一样因往日的过失而内疚自责，想去拼命弥补挽回。于是伊丽莎白要返回销魂城拯救Sally。\n\n但除了以上的解释，随着对游戏的探索，我认为伊丽莎白还可能因为其它原因返回销魂城。正如游戏中的两句话所提示的那样。一是布里基特.泰南巴姆博士说的“凡救一命（小妹妹Sally），即救全世界”。第二句是伊丽莎白反复说的“童年并不重要，重要的是这些儿童（指小妹妹和当年被囚于孤塔的自己）”。\n\n海葬两章里伊丽莎白为了康姆斯托克收养的干闺女Sally，一个陌生的普通小女孩为何如此拼命呢？Sally只是一个康姆斯多克失去伊丽莎白后精神上的替代品。而康姆斯多克绝对不是一个称职的父亲：专注赌博 眨眼就把Sally丢了，丢了也无所谓直到伊丽莎白上门来才知道去找。第一章结尾伊丽莎白专注于复仇而忽略了Sally的安危，她做的事和康姆斯多克如出一辙，把自己的需求建立在别人的苦难之上，于是第二章才决定回去赎罪救Sally。海葬里伊丽莎白冒死拯救Sally就好比正传里布克不惜一切拯救年少的伊丽莎白。这是父与女之间的传承。虽然两人之间总是直呼对方名字，从没有承认过父女关系，但伊丽莎白已经继承了布克自我牺牲的优良品质，她无愧于布克的女儿。\n\n游戏过程中多次提及伊丽莎白和小妹妹的源缘。我想是因为伊丽莎白在Sally和其她小妹妹身上看到了自己童年的影子。例如大老爹、小妹妹和伊丽莎白、夜莺之间羁绊的建立过程。游戏里苏崇认为基因是建立羁绊的关键，所以让伊丽莎白穿越回哥伦比亚取得自己的头发基因样本。但芬克的研究显示基因不是建立羁绊的关键。建立羁绊的过程是一个人感情的流露，不是一个听话的工具人可以复制的。例如年幼的伊丽莎白帮助了受伤的夜莺，对应结尾在伊丽莎白的指导下小妹妹们给躺尸堵门的大老爹注射亚当物质疗伤。伊丽莎白和小妹妹的共同点都是被他人利用当做工具人，有着同样悲惨的童年。所以伊丽莎白要不惜一切代价不让小妹妹布自己的后尘。\n\n伊丽莎白要救的不仅仅是Sally，她要借助一代里的主角杰克之手救走所有小妹妹。而方法就是维护这个世界的正常运转不出偏差，让方汀拿到“would you kindly”这个杀手锏。为此付出自己的生命在所不惜。\n\n当安德鲁.莱恩给伊丽莎白一分钟的时间来考虑是否合作时，我的第一反应就是上窜下跳四处找能按“F”的地方同意与莱恩合作……然后伊丽莎白就开始自言自语赶紧布置质体陷阱把敌人分个击破（潜台词就是编剧告诉玩家绝不合作……）。莱恩还贴心的提醒60秒、30秒、10秒，你咋就这么傻不肯合作呢。伊丽莎白宁可面对莱恩的“鲨鱼”也要坚持走完自己的最后道路。最后伊丽莎白把杀手锏交给方汀但方汀看不懂，被方汀杀死前非常“贴心”的把密码“would you kindly”翻译给了方汀，还说自己不傻，傻的是方汀。因为她已经回忆起了所有记忆，包括自己被方汀背叛杀死，以及自己借杰克之手除掉方汀，拯救Sally在内的所有小妹妹。\n\n伊丽莎白走完了和布克同样的自我牺牲和救赎之路。从此混乱的平行世界被纠正完毕。没有了穿越者伊丽莎白，残暴自私的康姆斯托克，卖了闺女又无限悔恨的主人公 布克以及靠未来科技建立起的乌托邦哥伦比亚。只剩下平凡的布克和她的女儿安娜。当然那就是生化奇兵之外的另一个故事了。Sally在伊丽莎白弥留之际唱起开头的那首法语歌曲，只希望最后的伊丽莎白能魂归巴黎，和她的布克永远相伴。\n\n生化奇兵系列完美落幕！泪奔！！神作无疑！！！","timestamp_created":1569932198,"timestamp_updated":1569932198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55378305","author":{"steamid":"76561198368176015","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":39,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1568664306},"language":"turkish","review":"çöp","timestamp_created":1569929305,"timestamp_updated":1569929305,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.386794298887252808","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55377751","author":{"steamid":"76561198101385613","num_games_owned":464,"num_reviews":124,"playtime_forever":1561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":1041,"last_played":1659772965},"language":"schinese","review":"这个游戏真的太好了。（虽然讲喷子总是有，但是我肯定会推荐这个游戏）\n百度上头说的生化奇兵辱华、做的假什么的就是放屁。人家就是个艺术游戏，做的假没什么大问题。辱华也是莫须有。\n\n=平台支持=\n8/10\nUDK做的游戏，通常就会像这款游戏一样支持Windows和Linux

На сюжете и атмосфере, которая, на мой взгляд, даже сильнее, чем в первом биошоке, хоть и сильно от нее отличается. В общем, для меня Биошок Инфинит стоит в одном ряду с Халф-лайф два и ее эпизодами.
