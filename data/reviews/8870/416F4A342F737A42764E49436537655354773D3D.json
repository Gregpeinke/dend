Mainly, the gameplay. Bioshock had revolutionary gameplay; plasmids were extremely versatile and can be used for many things. Solving puzzles, starting attack combos, destroying machinery, and more. Along with the customization of upgrades and gear and great stealth mechanics, Bioshock had stellar gameplay and was different than almost all FPS's of it's time. \n\nThat is, until Infinite showed up.\n\nThe game is mechanically fun. The soundtrack and noises are amazing, and help set up the atmosphere and establish that Booker is ruthless and indifferent. The gameplay is also pretty rad in that setting up traps and using a combination of vigors is always fun. Objectively, however, it does not compare with the first game. Almost no puzzles can be solved with the vigors, and everything is pretty linear. It's strange that Infinite tries to go for an almost open world gameplay style where you can go back to places you've already visited for extra bonuses, considering it's pretty damn linear. It doesn't blend well, and going back a mile is not really good design. I don't think the average person would go back at all.\n\nThe gameplay is also somewhat repetitive. At times it seems like the average AAA title where you're just filling random people coming at you with lead. The system where you can see where you're supposed to go to finish a quest/mission is pretty awful too. Sure, Infinite might have needed it considering theres so much to visit and you may be confused with the addition of skylines, but it's still not very good design. It's blatantly telling you, \"hey, go here to finish the quest!\"\n\nSome design choices were also awful. Probably the only formidable foe is the handyman (which is btw, practically a crappy big daddy rip off), and it only shows up like 3 times. Another design choice that annoyed me was the failed potential of Elizabeth's prowess. You would think opening up rifts to different universes would be awesome, but no. Instead, it's literally just summoning ammo and guns from nowhere.\n\nI'll cut the wall of text- the gameplay is more mediocre than the first Bioshock. It's not revolutionary and it has its fair share of flaws. It's still pretty damn cool though, and I'd personally say the gameplay is better than most Triple A gameplay.\n\nTo say I didnt enjoy it is completely wrong. As a narrative, the game is amazing.\n\nSure, most people don't play games as a medium of critical storytelling- literature and film exist, after all. However, games can easily show critical value and Infinite represents this.\n\nThe characters grow increasingly complex as you see more of their dialogue. Booker, the protagonist, is a great example of this. He's completely desensitized to everything, and yet so fragile. It is commonly shown that Booker hardly hesitates when it comes to death and dismay. When asked about this, he even states, \"One thing I've learned, if you don't draw first, you don't get to draw at all.\" It is suggested that the events he's been through at [spoiler]the battle of wounded knee[/spoiler] made him the person he is. The event adds significant internal strife to his character; he knows he's done wrong and sinned, and he can't do anything to fix it. As stated by him, \"You think a dip in the river is gonna wash away the things I've done?\" Perhaps the highlight of his corrupt mind is shown when (major spoilers) [spoiler]he even gives away his daughter in attempts to repay his gambling debts.[/spoiler] His fragility is shown throughout the game as well, especially torwards the end. Unlike his character, he [spoiler]starts to deeply care for Elizabeth and puts himself in extremely wreckless situations in attempts to protect her. When she tries to kill Comstock, he tells her that instead they should just relax in paris. He wants to run away rather than confronting Comstock.[/spoiler] He refuses to be [spoiler] baptized at the last second, showing his common trait of wanting to run away.[/spoiler] He is emotionally scarred and he continues to prefer running away than confrontation at many times. He becomes extremely protective of Elizabeth to the point where it's obsessive and wants to prevent her from harm. It isn't much of an exaggeration to say he's fragile.\n\nElizabeth is also a deeply interesting character. Being caged throughout her whole life and forced to have only the companion of a mechanical bird, Elizabeth desires freedom and relishes it. She's stuck between a rock and a hard place- she can go back to her tower and be restrained and watched her whole life, or go with Booker to whatever the fuck and be utilized to get rid of his gambling debts. She does care for Booker, though she doesn't show it often. Also with the strange ability of opening rifts to different timelines, it is suggested she feels somewhat alienated from humanity. Given that she practically has a massive hatred torwards everyone and every group throughout the game including booker and yet she's forced to stay strong and go with Booker, her character is pretty tragic.\n\nFinally, the Vox Populi is really damn cool. It's much more than just a terrorist group with guns; they were so obsessed with gaining liberty and freedom that it turned into something much different. They changed from fighting for justice to fighting simply just for actual blind hatred torwards Comstock and his people. This is easily exemplified with Fitzroy [spoiler]about to kill the child just because of plain hatred for his family[/spoiler] and their increasingly brutal standards for killing enemies. The concept of Columbia was bound to have internal strife, and the Vox Populi illustrates this well.\n\nNot only are the characters are well made, but also the intricate plot.\n\nIt's a highly intelligent story, yet it doesn't try to flaunt it and end up being pretentious. The ending, like the first game, is a complete plot twist. It changes everything you know about the characters. Who the Lutece Twins really are, who Comstock really is, what elizabeth represents, and more. The game is truely a masterpiece in delivery, and at too many times during the ending I had my mouth open when I realized in my head what happened. You can also find out more about the plot the more you listen to the voxophones you find during the game.\n\nNot to mention, the backgrounds/graphics and the soundtrack are all godly.

Игра была полностью на английском. Учитывая, какой здесь сюжет, сами понимаете, что я получил не самый полный комплект понимания происходящего.\nТеперь же прошёл игру не просто с субтитрами, а с полноценной любительской, но всё же крайне добротно сделанной озвучкой (крайне рекомендую установить. Ради неё можно и заново игру пройти). И знаете, что самое интересное? Всё равно после финальных титров было ощущение, что понял ты далеко не всё.\nЭту игру нужно проанализировать после того, как ты её пройдёшь. Как правило самостоятельно на все 100% это сделать невозможно.\nВ видеоиграх уже давно серьёзный сюжет, не уступающий книгам или фильмам, но здесь планка поднята ещё выше, вплоть до того, что затрагиваются различные научные теории происхождения мира.\nГеймплей в игре не даёт заскучать - в игре полно оружия и практически с каждого вида интересно стрелять. Помимо этого есть, кхм, соли (не те, которые вы подумали), дающие такие способности, как посылать из пальцев огненные шары и стаю ворон.\nГрафика в игре замечательная. Мне есть, с чем сравнивать - при относительно высоких настройках игра выглядила лучше, чем на X360, при том что было в 2 раза больше кадров. Всё это не на самом топовом железе.\nАнтураж погружает в игру настолько, что в Колумбии во время мирных похождений хочется просто жить.\nЯвляется ли игра шедевром? Пожалуй, нет. Как человек, прошедший её не единожды и по прошествии нескольких лет после выпуска становятся видны некоторые изъяны:\n-неоднозначный AI. Простой пример: люди, охраняющие мешок с монетами говорят тебе: не приближайся! Понятно - хочешь денег, вступай в драку. И пока я стоял и раздумывал, а как же их обойти или хотя бы с выгодной позиции атаковать, они внезапно сами перешли в наступление, при том что я ничего не делал! Или же зашёл ты в здание на локации, где сидит 1 враг, не позволяющий спокойно украсть содержимое этого здания...Можно зарубить его со спины одним ударом, но после того, как выйдешь из здания, обнаружишь, что вся остальная локация на тебя тоже ополчилась. Всё это соседствует с тем фактом, что сами по себе враги то умны - часто меняют позиции и за секунду уворачиваются от выстрелов.\n-Зачастую, чтобы перейти из одной локации в другую, нужно провести небольшую формальность - попросить Элизабет взломать замок. Замок нельзя взломать, если на локации остался хотя бы один враг. И тебе приходится кататься по монорельсам и выискивать, а кто тут ещё прям так сильно мешает это сделать.\nИгре не хочется ставить ничего, кроме высшего балла, но объективно этот балл она не заслужила.\nПоэтому я просто скажу, что все эти немногочисленные огрехи меркнут на фоне достоинств и в игру стоит поиграть хотя бы раз абсолютно каждому геймеру.\n","timestamp_created":1453807768,"timestamp_updated":1453807768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608413219451904297","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20761494","author":{"steamid":"76561198084377046","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2859,"last_played":1483125400},"language":"english","review":"Most beautiful and captivating game I've ever played.

Несмотря на то, что Infinite буквально \"летает\", сменяя декорации одну за другой, а игроку дается широкое \"поле деятельности\", в виде внушительного арсенала, \"энергетиков\" и \"прокачки\", игру можно пройти обойдясь \"без многого\", т. е. использовать возможности на полную катушку: комбинируя способности, улучшая оружее, героя, эффективность энергетиков (солей) можно, но нужно ли? И это обидно, ведь по сути BioShock Infinite- это сплошной режим \"арена\"- на игрока вываливают толпы врагов, которые он обязан \"расхлебывать\", а если играть, глубоко не углубляясь в механику, может показаться банально скучно, а не весело. Кстати с \"вражинами\" явно переборщили: ближе к концу, когда хочется в полную меру окунуться в игровой мир с его тайнами и загадками, от (практически) одинаковых толп врагов не только устаешь, но и начинаешь испытывать явное раздражение. ___. В принципе, BioShock- это неоднозначная игра, содержащая в себе множество слоев, в которых кто-то будет долго и упорно разбираться, а кто-то просто пробежиться, получив удовольствие от того \"как всё сделано\", не вдумываясь в сюжет.

Definetely reccomend it.","timestamp_created":1453737137,"timestamp_updated":1453737137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20748882","author":{"steamid":"76561198016615053","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":622,"last_played":1454874451},"language":"hungarian","review":"Greatest game ever!","timestamp_created":1453736197,"timestamp_updated":1453736197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20747131","author":{"steamid":"76561198213625849","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1453132920},"language":"turkish","review":"nice.","timestamp_created":1453729409,"timestamp_updated":1631796845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/szBvNICe7eSTw=="}
