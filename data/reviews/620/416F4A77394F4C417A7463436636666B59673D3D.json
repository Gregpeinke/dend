Your overall main goal is to escape the facility (again). However unlike before this game adds a whole lot of layers to the game, especially through it's lore. As you discover the rise and fall of Aperature, not only that but GLaDOS is fleshed out in more ways than the previous game. \n\nThe game also has a co-op mode. And what's even more interesting is that the co-op mode (for the first time) hits it off right. While you don't get not a lot of backstory to the two robots. You feel a sense of connection which is interesting. Portal 2's puzzles are a lot more brain power than before. While Portal 1's puzzles were almost straight forward with a little bit of trial and error. This game offers a balance of trial and error and straight forward puzzle solving...\n\nThe game even offers extras, even MORE layers to the game. In particularly the Portal 2 comic. I won't spoil the story because bits and pieces of the story can be found both in the first game (if you look hard enough) and a lot more of an actual easter egg in the second game. \n\nLastly the game offers a modding community where you can create your very own testing labs, which is pretty neat. And also a challenge mode and a developer commentary part of the game.\n\n...As I said in the beginning the game has made great strides from the previous game in every way possible.

Una historia muy buena, puzzles que te hacen pensar y tal vez desesperar si careces de paciencia. Tres personajes (incluyendote) con características propias. Diálogos muy entretenidos que te hacen meterte en la historia. Una pelea final épica y un buen final, se desean mas explicaciones pero estuvo bien el final.
