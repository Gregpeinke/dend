트릴로지의 최종장이자 프리퀼인 인피니트는 기존 바이오쇼크 게임들보다 차별된 게임성을 가지고있다. \n무기는 기존 바이오쇼크 시리즈랑은 다르게 타 FPS게임들과 비슷하게 두개까지만 보유할 수 있으며 대신 몇몇 총기들은 보유할수있는 탄약이 적어 항상 탄약 관리를 해줘야한다.\n\n바닷속 도시인 랩쳐를 배경으로 했던 전작들과는 달리 인피니트는 하늘도시인 컬럼비아를 배경으로 하고 있는데 덕분에 스카이 후크라는 특별한 시스템이 생겼다. 스카이 후크 덕분에 빠른 템포로 플레이를 가능하게 만들어주는 반면, 카빈이나 리볼버처럼 보유 탄약이 적은 총기들은 스카이 후크에서 써먹기가 애매하기 때문에 사용하는 총기에 따라 스카이 후크의 사용 빈도가 달라지게된다. 필자는 라이플류 총기들을 썼기 때문에 스카이 후크를 쓰기 애매한 경우가 많이 나왔었다.\n\n무기는 크게 세가지로 나눌수 있는데 데미지가 적지만 보유탄약이 많은 기관단총이랑 권총, 데미지가 준수하고 업그레이드를 해주면 후반부에 쓰기가 좋지만 보유 탄약수가 적은 라이플류와 리볼버, 그리고 보유탄약이 현저하게 적지만 데미지는 쎈 런쳐류가 있다. 기관단총이랑 권총은 후반부에 가면 업그레이드를 해도 써먹기가 조금 애매한 면이 있고 런쳐류는 보유 탄약이 적어 후반부의 적들을 상대하기에는 조금 힘들기에 라이플류가 게임 전체적으로 쓰기가 무난한 총일것이다.\n\n스토리 플롯은 전체적으로 단순하다고 볼수있는데 바이오쇼크 스토리의 묘미는 플롯이 아닌 다른겜들과는 달리 꼬아버린 스토리, 세계관 설정들과 인게임에서 얻을 수있는 사이드 스토리인 음성 녹음 기록에서 나올수있다고 할수있을만큼 그런부분들까지 신경을 써야 바이오쇼크 스토리의 진정한 재미를 볼수있다고 할수있다. \n\n스팀 펑크를 베이스로 한 맵들은 전체적으로 아름다웠는데 다만 바이오쇼크 1, 2편처럼 각각의 지역의 특색이 맵들에 잘 베어들었다는 느낌은 크게 못들었다. 다만 공중 도시라는 컨셉에 맞게 디자인된 스카이 후크와 레벨 디자인들은 게임속에서 잘 어울려진다고 본다.\n\nDLC는 전체적으로 무난한데 구름속의 전투는 스토이 DLC가 아닌 단순히 게임플레이를 위한 DLC이고, 스토리 DLC는 바다의 무덤 에피소드 1, 2편들이다. 에피소드 1편은 플레이 타임이 모든 아이템을 먹고 간다고도 해도 3시간도 안걸리기에 가격대비 비싼 느낌이 없잖아 있다고 말할 수 있다. 2편도 플레이 타임이 긴 편은 아니지만 바이오쇼크 1, 2편을 인피니트와의 연결과 바이오쇼크 1편 직전상황을 설명해주는 중요한 큰 역활을 하기 때문에 바이오쇼크 시리즈의 팬들에게 충분히 제값을 하는 DLC라고 말하고싶다. \n물론 바이오쇼크 2편 덕분에 개판이 되었던 세계관 설정들은 바다의 무덤 2편 DLC로 더 개판이 되버렸기에 세계관 설정을 중요시 여기시는 분들에게는 저평가가 될 수 있는 DLC이다.\n\nDLC에 대헤 좀 더 말을 해보자면 구름속의 전투는 기존 인피니트의 게임성을 그대로 가져온 웨이브 형식의 DLC이다. 그런데 특이하게 바다의 무덤은 본편과는 다른 전투 시스템을 가지고 있는데 1편은 기존 바이오쇼크 시리즈의 게임성에 본편보다도 더 탄약 후려치기를 한 시스템이고 2편은 모든 바이오쇼크 시리즈랑은 다르게 시프랑 디스아너드를 베이스로 한 시스템을 가지고 있는 느낌의 게임성을 가지고 있다. 고로 이부분에서는 기존 바이오쇼크 시스템의 유지를 기대한 유저들에겐 실망을 느낄수 있는 부분이다.\n\n전체적으로 볼떄 바이오쇼크 인피니트는 훌륭한 게임이라 말할 수 있겠다. 개인적으로는 시리즈의 시작을 알렸던 바이오쇼크 1편에는 못미친다고 생각하나 훌륭한 마무리와 훌륭한 팬서비스, 성공적인 시리즈의 새로운 변화는 인피니트가 기존 바이오쇼크의 명성을 이어간다는점은 부인할 수 없을것이다.\n\nPersonal Score: [spoiler] 8/10

the record, I’m going to give plot/game basics and warned spoilers, so if you care about those then continuing to read this review is not in your best interest.\n\nThis game overall is enjoyable, but it feels as though it garners far too many compliments from reviewers and those who complete the game. The good parts of the game are notable. Most specifically the world design. This is because if you take it slow and check everywhere you can find a bunch of dialogue and neat NPCs you can listen to and occasionally interact with. Along with that, there are themes of past racism that come through strongly at the start of the game, and it seems like dealing with old-time thoughts would be a notable role you would have to play in the game especially since there is a “choice” you have to make in regards to a racially diverse couple when the game turns for the violent. The problem is that the racism theme fades later in the game, because you just become the enemy of the rebels and the primary police force, thus you don’t get a say in fixing the society or keeping it suppressed. Instead, you kill indiscriminately between all groups, regardless of the beliefs you would want to try and push for in your playthrough. This also links to the fact that this game doesn’t have meaningful choices like the previous installations of Bioshock, Instead, you get around 3 personal choice moments, none of which impact your later gameplay experience in a meaningful or memorable way. One is a forced cutscene that doesn't change, another is a partial NPC model change, and the last is an NPC that appears once later in the story with no new activity or presence. A similar vein is that, due to the nature of these “choices”, there is no good or bad ending like the previous games, which is something I was honestly disappointed about when I learned it.\nA different issue I had with this game was that it soft locked and bugged out numerous times. My first soft-lock was at a bar,I jumped next to a chair and was then frozen in place, forced to load to my last save around 8 minutes prior (not too bad but annoying). The next soft-lock happened two times. I cleared a shopping district of enemies and then jumped onto a skyline to get to my next load zone. The issue was that my camera got hard locked looking behind me and I lost my capability to do anything aside from press spacebar, this I lost around 13 minutes of effort twice in a row (At this point I took a break away from the game for a day because all these soft-locks occurred nearly back to back). Glitches I experienced weren’t particularly “ game-breaking” but I did get manage to have the game crash for reasons unknown to me. Other glitches I experienced were mostly world clipping, such as falling into a building or walls and then having to find a hole to fall under the world and get teleported back to the surface.\nNow, the difficulty of this game is a strange thing. Some people say it’s more difficult than the previous two by a long shot, but I think that's honestly not true in the slightest. This is because your NPC follower throughout the game can spawn in crutch items to make sure you experience as few deaths as possible. Now, this isn’t a bad thing as you now lose money on death and the enemies get a notable heal once you die as well, obtaining free ammo, health, and salt (what powers vigors in this game) is also a nice kick mid-battle. Especially since you can become easily ammo starved in the later game due to a limitation of two physical weapons at a time and a severe lack of ammo shops in late areas. For me, the issue is that you may have to become terribly dependant on this mechanic if you accidentally die once or twice on a difficult area or fight. (This is still way better than having to depend on melee or backtracking if you got stuck in the previous Bioshock games). This dependency is a problem because you could be standing around taking potshots at a strong enemy, and then you would just wait there until you got a gift from your NPC, so that you would die and heal the boss/enemy horde for 20% of their max hp. Also, losing money on death sucks the life out of you. This is because buying upgrades for weapons is expensive unless you only use early game options, and buying upgrades for vigors is something you can seldom afford in regular scenarios. Along with that, some weapons eat ammo at incredibly annoying speeds, so going for single bullet high power headshot damage is almost always ideal. The kick is that near the end of the game (around the final 10% of your gameplay), the player character can gain access to some completely overpowered upgrades by using lockpicks and a single vigor upgrade at the shop if the can afford it (the one I'm referring to is around 700$ I believe). These increases in power make fighting horde enemies an actual joke because you gain the power to kill all regular enemies with 1-5 bullets depending on your weapon of choice. I would also like to take this time to say that I’ve only played the game through on the highest difficulty, so there may be some different scenarios monetarily and ammo wise if you play on an easier difficulty.\nNow I want to tell you how I feel about the ending. I think the ending is poorly thought out and is executed in a way that doesn’t do justice to the development of the characters throughout the story. This is because there are timeline shenanigans that make the ending contradictory to itself, along with character actions that make the ending unreasonable. Massive spoiler next sentence, skip to the next paragraph if you don't want it. Most specifically because killing yourself to stop aging into the antagonist won't prevent the alternate reality version of yourself at all. Of course, the game says there are constants and variables, but you see alternate versions of yourself that you can’t interact with during the last scenes of the story, which leaves me with the view that there are other versions of me that didn't get drowned in a river and die. I also say that the player character isn’t a constant in death because there is no way the player's version of the protagonist would end up becoming the villain in the first place. This is because there are clear story beats where the protagonist learns differently than the antagonist of the game, thus meaning your character wouldn’t be the same person as the one trying to kill you throughout the game. Along with that, your character isn’t the one who is capable of time tears, so if there is a constant between all of your selves, then why aren’t all the versions of you just sent into the future where they don’t make the giant flying city of Columbia? Also, if all your selves are constant, then why is there an alternate form of you that you can never interact with, that perpetually gets stopped from saving Elizabeth? Due to these subjects, I observed in the story, I honestly can't say the ending is satisfying, let alone intriguing or good.\nAt this point, you have to wonder how on earth I gave this game a positive rating given my level of criticism and distaste towards the ending. To put it simply, I think it’s a fun experience. Even if the character interactions are strange, and the story falls away from what seems to be logical. Even if the game can be buggy and imbalanced. Even if this game is nothing like what you would expect from the horror adventure experiences from the other Bioshock games, it’s still enjoyable. The world is pretty and feels full of near experiences. There are also enough hidden areas and items to make you feel good for exploring. Along with that finding little secret ways to get lethal damage, and struggling to find new guns in a last-ditch effort to survive is enjoyable in the immersion and time you have to spend making sure you do everything right. Even though this game isn’t something I would brand as true to nature Bioshock, it’s entertaining to explore and experience for the first time.\n","timestamp_created":1577851341,"timestamp_updated":1577851341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542316794395446777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61032825","author":{"steamid":"76561198829612982","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1577,"last_played":1637652740},"language":"vietnamese","review":"A perfect game to end the whole series.","timestamp_created":1577851035,"timestamp_updated":1577851035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61030193","author":{"steamid":"76561198077574094","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":548,"last_played":1580422315},"language":"english","review":"i wish i didn't see the end...","timestamp_created":1577847203,"timestamp_updated":1577847203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61028297","author":{"steamid":"76561198144560766","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1353,"last_played":1607086553},"language":"schinese","review":"本以为多了个老婆，最后才知道是多了个女儿。","timestamp_created":1577844365,"timestamp_updated":1577844365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61028082","author":{"steamid":"76561198284964143","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":995,"last_played":1612155816},"language":"schinese","review":"后期战地特别爽。除了DLC","timestamp_created":1577844065,"timestamp_updated":1577844065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61024500","author":{"steamid":"76561198271986648","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":496,"last_played":1577836569},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel ist hübsch anzuschauen und sieht immer noch Top aus, ist aber extrem langweilig.\nDie Story ist sehr linear und gelinde gesagt einfach uninteressant.\nDas man immer nur 2 Waffen, oder Kräfte ausrüsten kann ist nervig und die Kräfte sind generell auch sehr uninteressant.
