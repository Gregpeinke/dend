Даже обещал одному человеку сделать его полноценным (Nobody привет), но понял, что передать её цимус через текст невозможно. KF нужно именно пробовать, причем вначале она многим не заходит, однако дав ей шанс вы можете получить одно из лучших кооперативных приключений в своей жизни и даже найти новых друзей. Неадекватов в сети конечно тоже хватает, но в целом комьюнити KF положительное. Многие считают игру калькой с L4D, но сходны лишь сеттинги, мне этот шутер больше напоминает tower defense, в которых ты набираешь деньги за убийства и покупаешь более крутое вооружение. А оно пригодится, ведь качая перки вы в итоге можете испытать свою тиму на прочность на адской сложности. К минусам отнесу всего одного босса (хотя Патриарх эпичен), понятно что это ради баланса, но хотелось бы больше колоритных эпиков. Также присутствует дисбаланс в плане вооружения, лучше пушки придётся докупать в DLC. Напоследок пара интересных фактов, 1)существует 2 часть игры, но основная часть игроков предпочла оригинал; 2) разница между оценками геймеров и игроков почти полтора балла в пользу первых.

As someone who was used to KF2 since it was the first KF game I ever played (and was still a bit inexperienced at shooters) and it was the PS4 edition. Needless to say, I wasn't very good at it years ago. That being said, I picked up great interest in KF again and wanted to try out the very first one. I absolutely got my rear handed to me but with tons of practice and starting on Beginner difficulty, I slowly started gaining a lot of experience and it went from \"this game is too hard, not enjoyable\" to \"super fun skill and tactic based game\". It's a lot harder than KF2 and you actually need to really think what your next move is gonna be, or you're done for. Scrakes and Fleshpounds are actually terrifying and you need to try and calm yourself down and focus on how exactly you're gonna take that big guy out. The atmosphere is actually dark and scary compared to 2. If you're not careful or don't use your flashlight for some certain situations (like the West London basement area), you literally can't see a thing. With 2, there's almost no need to use the flashlight at all. This isn't a Killing Floor 2 review but to get my point across, the original Killing Floor is much more difficult if you don't know what you're doing or if you're a newcomer to the series, let alone the FPS genre as a whole. I think I've seen some people say that the graphics are ugly and terrible. Personally, I think the graphics are gorgeous and fit this game perfectly. It really gives it that dark and creepy atmosphere compared to KF2. Comparing this game to 2 again, there's way less weapons to choose from so again (especially if you're playing a perk which you haven't leveled up much on since the powerful weapons are the most expensive. They will become less expensive each time you level up the respective perk.) This game really takes a lot of practice but once you get the hold of things, you'll kick butt in no time and it's hella fun too!! There's also a ton of servers to choose from, including servers that have a bunch of custom made maps. They're just as cool as all the official maps and it's really neat to see the creativity of people and what they can come up with if you play the custom ones. I'll be honest: I used to be absolutely addicted to Killing Floor 2 and couldn't stop playing but when I really started to shift my focus on the original and actually became determined to practice and get better instead of just immediately giving up, I soon started playing less and less of 2. The original is so much more skill and tactic based. People actually work as a team for the most part and most players here are very dedicated to the game as well as their team. I absolutely enjoy helping out new players with this game and explaining the basics and leading them around. Maybe that's just me, but it's a lot of fun. Like I said, this game has a very dedicated playerbase and newcomers are often very much eager to learn the mechanics and basics. So leave it up to your pal Aoi to be an excited guide for new players and veterans of the game alike. Killing Floor never gets old and there's always someone playing (can't really say the same for the sequel). So overall, a difficult but super fun game. If you love shooting and blowing up \"zombies\" but strategy, skill, and tactics are required, then you will love this game.

someone who got this game when buying the Deluxe Edition of KF2 back in 2017, I can firmly say I have been sleeping on this game. Due to the current state of KF2 I have been finding myself playing the OG Killing Floor more and more often and I have to admit, it's a hit. The guns, zeds and gameplay all provide a solid experience, something I have been missing from KF2 since 2019.\n\nAlthough the pacing is a bit slower with less complex movement involved (no sprinting and parrying as berserker) the game does not fail to keep me on my toes. If you are a long time KF2 fan who have recently gone bored of the current state of the game, the OG Killing Floor is waiting with open arms to give you the experience you seek. 10 out of freaking 10.","timestamp_created":1641141187,"timestamp_updated":1641141187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107140011","author":{"steamid":"76561198843309021","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1641652772},"language":"schinese","review":"good\n","timestamp_created":1641132776,"timestamp_updated":1641132776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107128171","author":{"steamid":"76561198206910637","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1885,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":743,"last_played":1650361354},"language":"polish","review":"Cool!!!!","timestamp_created":1641120831,"timestamp_updated":1641120831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107125709","author":{"steamid":"76561199039356642","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":6440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1658115784},"language":"brazilian","review":"naufal stop closing the doors","timestamp_created":1641117955,"timestamp_updated":1641117955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107105199","author":{"steamid":"76561198050080631","num_games_owned":550,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":3516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3516,"last_played":1483757943},"language":"english","review":"A classic cooperative shooter when the genre was still getting its bearings, it is easy to invest dozens of hours into Killing Floor but with so much competition these days including Killing Floor 2, there is little reason to experience the original other than curiosity of nostalgia.","timestamp_created":1641092199,"timestamp_updated":1641092199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107101431","author":{"steamid":"76561198448998601","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":19,"playtime_at_review":5807,"last_played":1660362620},"language":"spanish","review":"muy buen juegito master","timestamp_created":1641088006,"timestamp_updated":1641088006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107091395","author":{"steamid":"76561198301904221","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":14850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":567,"playtime_at_review":10270,"last_played":1660480166},"language":"english","review":"Very nice game.

Yes. It is a really fun game with tons of replay value, and though I am new to the Killing Floor community, I am already deeply in love. This game holds up fairly well for how old it is, and is very fun for the cheap price. Gameplay - 10/10 - very simple and doesn't take too long to learn. Difficulty - 10/10 (of course, depending on the difficulty set in-game) - Beginner is - well - for beginners. Very Easy. Then you have Hell on Earth. Just like the title says - it is Hell on Earth :D -  Maps - 8/10 - Though I haven't played all of the various maps the game offers, from the ones I have played, they are all very good, but I feel some of them were a little lackluster and didn't match the feel to the game. Overall review - 9.5/10 - Very good game, would totally reccomend for those who want some good zombie shooting fun :D","timestamp_created":1641073999,"timestamp_updated":1641073999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107079275","author":{"steamid":"76561198036001081","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":178699,"playtime_last_two_weeks":10,"playtime_at_review":167264,"last_played":1659716856},"language":"russian","review":"Ну что, я не много поиграл\nИ могу сказать что это прекрасная игра, практически без минусов\nИ если вы ценитель хороших стареньких шутеров, то эта игра для вас","timestamp_created":1641066404,"timestamp_updated":1641066404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49253728985786438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwisPLi/4Ce+a8mAM="}
