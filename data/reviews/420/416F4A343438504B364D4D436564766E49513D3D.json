Физический движок научился сращивать математические расчеты с заранее созданной анимацией, что наглядно демонстрируют крушение железнодорожного моста в первой главе и взорванные домики — в предпоследней. Графический — освоил мультиядерные процессоры, «motion blur», глубину резкости кадра и честные «мягкие» тени от фонарика (но их почему-то отбрасывают не все объекты). Музыка, пролетавшая мимо ушей в Half-Life 2 стала агрессивнее и богаче за счет более мощного ритма и звучных электрогитар.\nХарактерной чертой, которая отличает этот эпизод от предыдущего и вообще от всех частей серии Half-Life, является то, что большая часть игрового процесса происходит в лесах, на открытых местностях.\nПарочка свежих монстров и большое разнообразие знакомых ситуаций и декораций, в отличие от Episode One (где единственной новинкой были «зомбайны»). И, несмотря на то, что Episode Two оставляет приятное впечатление (за вычетом битвы со страйдерами, в которой побеждает не умение, а «quickload»), голову не покидает тревожная мысль: неужели в третьей «серии» нам опять предложат полное дежа вю, да еще без новых видов оружия?\nПлюсы:\nОтличный сюжет и атмосфера\nЗапоминающиеся боевые сцены\nДинамичные поездки на авто\nОбщая насыщенность событиями\nПохорошевшая графика, AI, анимация, звуки\nМинусы:\nКороткая кампания\nЗатянутое ползанье по подземельям\nОтсутствие новшеств в игровой механике\n","timestamp_created":1391159465,"timestamp_updated":1391159465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8917030","author":{"steamid":"76561198048571992","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":326,"last_played":1585363882},"language":"english","review":"An EPIC continuation to the great story, and of course, an amazing ending that will leave you waiting for episode 3","timestamp_created":1391136824,"timestamp_updated":1391136824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8914062","author":{"steamid":"76561198000423747","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":108,"playtime_forever":252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":252,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"The black guy dies.","timestamp_created":1391115384,"timestamp_updated":1391115384,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":13,"weighted_vote_score":"0.386701613664627075","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8909619","author":{"steamid":"76561198040127542","num_games_owned":1869,"num_reviews":260,"playtime_forever":491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":457,"last_played":1426424829},"language":"schinese","review":"经典游戏，绝对的佳作，建议等橙盒打折的时候入。","timestamp_created":1391085803,"timestamp_updated":1391085803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526315808296203613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8907413","author":{"steamid":"76561198041137428","num_games_owned":479,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":143,"last_played":1392071001},"language":"russian","review":"отличная часть с неожиданным концом. перепрохожу уже в который раз","timestamp_created":1391060764,"timestamp_updated":1391060764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576317250728607178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8906400","author":{"steamid":"76561198016870648","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1598208333},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game!

I really loved this game. This is going to be a long review as well. Just sayin'.\n\nNow, I do have reasons to say so. I personally disliked Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2 Episode 1. Still buy them, because to get the full experience of Episode 2 you need to know not only the story, but how much the game improved.\n\nNow, the entire Half-Life 1 (classic?) series was great, while sometimes buggy. What can I say? Golden Source is golden. The gameplay was smooth, the weapons were nice and powerfull-ish, and you played as a variety of characters.\n\n(STILL BUY THIS GAME! SKIP IF YOU DON'T LIKE CRITICISM) Here is where Half-Lfe 2 comes in. Gordon Freeman in a City 17 train, waiting with the rest of the ctizens. Commence with an overly long section without even a crowbar, picking up and throwing spare junk. A little while after, you spend way too long speeding around in an airboat. Then the Gravity Gun, to pick up and throw even more spare junk, but at high speeds. A dunebuggy with suspension level ten thousand, not to mention two types of portable infinite ammo. Last but not least, the 1500 Megawatt Black Mesa Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Gravity Gun. One last way to run around with over 9000 HEV and the one weapon to rule them all. The NPCs in the game? \"Oh, Gordon Freeman. We worship you, even though you basically caused this whole mess and only saved yourself.\" Barney Calhoun, the dropout hero of Blue Shift? \"Headhumper. Headhumper. Hey, I finally took one down!\"\n\nAll of these were fun, but too drawn-out. No offense to Valve, but the majority of gamers can learn how to use a gimmick in much less time than otherwise thought. Overall, Half-Life 2 had long expanses of nothing, but in reality some of the best  gameplay experiences I've ever had.\n\n(SERIOUSLY, STILL BUY THIS GAME! YOU, THE READER, HAVE THE POWER TO SKIP AT ANY TIME!) Half-Lide 2 Episode 1. Where do I begin? Morg- Gordon Freeman wakes up, and for some reason goes right back into the Citadel. Here he aquires the Conveniently Temporary Over-Powered Blue Zero-Point Energy Manipulator. I didn't think highly of this game from up front, remembering the whimper in which Half-Life 2 ended. From here on,  The gameplay is mostly indoors with airducts, similar to Half-Life 1. But, the story was meh. To add, Alyx's AI walked right up to every enemy, and died too often. The fights were really intense, though. All being said, the game kind of ended after about three hours and one strider.\n\nOverall verdict: intense, even difficult action, but compressed into too little time, squeezing out story.\n\nvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv\nHalf-Life 2 Episode 2. This game is EXCELLENT. If I can say this to the entirety of Steam after knocking the rest of Half-Life 2, I must mean something. Gordon now wakes up inside of the train that crashed. As the train slowly topples over, the obstacle course that you need to climb down changes. I also happen to love changing terrain, so good first impression. Now I begin to notice things. The flashlight that wore out in about ten seconds in the other games was replaced with one much more similar to Half-Life 1. Also on an individual battery, allowing you to dash for more than a few seconds. I gaze deeply into my teammate's eyes, she awkwardly turns away to avoid eye contact. Very human of her. The car is come-and-go. You can struggle through most areas either with or without the car. It lasted just as long as it was needed. and no longer. As for action, there was never a point without it. All was unique, as well. Half-Life 2 got stale, while Episode 1 was overwhelming. Episode 2 managed to get just the right mix of the two, combining into THE perfect balance. Rochelle- I mean, Alyx's AI was realistic, even to the level of the player. Then there's the Gnome. My good friend the Garden Gnome. As a display of how much Valve in the greatest compaby on this side of the universe, you get an achievement for carrying this guy through almost the whole game. While a pain as some points, I kind of grew to like the guy. The ALyx Vance mauled by a Hunter? \"Don't look, Gnome. Shield thou purest of eyes.\" It's a showcase of how great the gameplay is. You literally could have taken ANY item throughout the entire game. Now, back on topic. The Characters were recovered to what they should have been. Barney as a security guard. Refugees as refugees. The vortigaunts actually using their green electricity bolts. The characters were essential to the rich storyline. The storyline alone could have made a movie, as it was what made me start rooting for Half-Life 3. Basically, every problem that I have found in any other Half-Life game was remedied in this one fantastic sequel.\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\nSeriously, just buy the game.\n\nNow.\n\nSell your house if you really have to.","timestamp_created":1390783635,"timestamp_updated":1390783635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54703831672668457","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ448PK6MMCedvnIQ=="}
