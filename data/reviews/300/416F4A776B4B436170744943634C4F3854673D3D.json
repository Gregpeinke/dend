O jogo em si já possui vários mapas padrões que são muito bons, mas existe também uma infinidade de mapas customizados (criado por jogadores), que são baixados automaticamente a partir do servidor que você está jogando.\n\nInfelizmente DoD não dispõe de uma campanha, é minimamente ‘multiplayer’. Mas isso não quer dizer que não seja divertido. Muito pelo contrario. Você pode criar seu próprio jogo, algo que nunca cheguei a tentar. Porém, existem vários servidores, nacionais e internacionais que funcionam perfeitamente bem (E são perfeitamente seguros).\n\nPara ser sincero com você, eu não curtia multijogadores. Não pelo fato do jogo em si, mas pelos próprios jogadores. Que se agridem verbalmente e acabam tornando a jogatina em algo estressante, quando deveria ser algo divertido e até “Jollyoso”. E o que aconteceu foi, quando entrei nos servidores (Nacionais ou não) acabei me sentindo bem. Não que eu tenha sido bem recebido ou coisa do tipo... Mas pelos jogadores que gostam deste jogo. É uma galera de boa, que joga para se divertir e dar risada. Que sabe dividir as gracinhas dos momentos de tensão. Que se respeitam mutualmente e que evitam tá falando merda (por mais que alguns insistam em fazer isso). Que durante o jogo, conseguem até conversar sobre temas polêmicos sem criar confusão. Resumindo... Um publico altamente civilizado. Claro, todo esse comportamento pode ser apenas pelo fato de que os servidores sempre possuem pelo menos um administrador jogando, que mantem alguém na linha, quando este individuo passa a se comportar como um ser acefálico. Mas tirando essas raras ocasiões, é simplesmente um multijogador de guerra fantástico e muito divertido.\n\nNacionais, existem duas redes de servidores que recomendo. O 4Eternity e o Dominated Brasil. Que proporcionam um publico bem divertido e ao mesmo tempo contam com administradores que fiscalizam o comportamento dos indivíduos ‘huehue’, deixando a jogatina limpa. Existem também dois servidores Internacionais que recomendo: 70th Infantry Division e o 6Th Rangers Battalion PUP, que são ótimos servidores, uma galera divertidíssima e o melhor de tudo na minha opinião... Fogo amigo (que sem dúvida torna o jogo muito, muito mais realista).\n\nEm relação audiovisual, o jogo também não peca. Claro que existem mapas que são mais detalhados ou menos detalhados que outros, mas chega a ser bastante agradável aos olhos, como também, aos ouvidos. Não possui trilha sonora... Mas onde já se viu ouvir musica em pleno combate, soldado? \n\nA dinâmica de DoD é muito frenética. Você precisa pensar rápido e trabalhar em equipe para vencer. Duas equipes. Cada uma delas com objetivos distintos (Não, não é apenas mata-mata). Os objetivos vão de capturar à bandeira a explodir a artilharia inimiga. Dependendo da equipe que selecione (que podem ser os Americanos ou a Wermacht), você pode escolher a classe que quer jogar. São 6 classes no total, e vou deixar que vocês tenham o gostinho de descobrir cada uma delas sozinhos, assim como eu também tive.\n\nEntão... Se você não curte multijogadores. Compre este jogo. Pode ser difícil no começo, afinal, você vai entrar de cara numa luta com jogadores veteranos. Então não se preocupe ou se sinta mal por apenas morrer. Acredite, vai acontecer muito.\n\nIgnore alguns jogadores. Realmente não há como escapar dos babacas. Estão por todo lado, assim como as baratas. Se você mata demais, eles te chamam de ‘cheater’. Se você mata de menos, te chamam de ‘noob’. Se você é esperto, te chamam de ‘camper’. Se você é rápido, te chamam de ‘cagão’. De uma coisa eu sei, essas pessoas que reclamam demais, com certeza devem ter uma vida de merda, para não aceitarem uma derrota de quando em vez.\n\nAcho que é isso... \nNos vemos no campo de batalha.\n\nDay of Defeat  -  9/10","timestamp_created":1454774168,"timestamp_updated":1454774411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.701813578605651855","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20999030","author":{"steamid":"76561198033724828","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":952,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":393,"last_played":1596747609},"language":"polish","review":"Hard Game :) 10000/10","timestamp_created":1454772702,"timestamp_updated":1454772702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20994655","author":{"steamid":"76561198160831934","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":146,"last_played":1568708532},"language":"english","review":"Verry Good Game ;))))","timestamp_created":1454761754,"timestamp_updated":1454761754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507507443428039551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20984800","author":{"steamid":"76561198020279241","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":119254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108768,"last_played":1641664072},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite games on steam because i have almost 2,000 hours on it and never not had fun","timestamp_created":1454726778,"timestamp_updated":1454726778,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20983349","author":{"steamid":"76561198037080732","num_games_owned":981,"num_reviews":235,"playtime_forever":5101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":166,"last_played":1510786914},"language":"english","review":"This game is the truly Master piece, THE Shooter,,,, I played this game like 10 years ago with friends, and it bloody funny, my begginig in shooter games (i was 15 on that time,,,).

The French people were nice, they gave us food water and shelter after we liberated them. It was a good week, not to many casulties. \n\nPage three: January 2, 1944 The Germans were trying to take back the French town, It was the middle of winter too. We tried to hold them off, but the our moral was low, we were outnumbered, and sickness was spreading. They had us pinned with a MG and sniper, we couldn't move up. We pulled out of the town after our casulties were to high. \n\nPage four: January 5, 1944 We were able to take back the town, but at high casulties. We destroyed one of their Tiger tanks and captured one of their AA guns. But at high costs, we lost 10 soldiers for every 8 Germans we killed, and we lost one of our M4 Sherman tanks. \n\nPage five: July 1, 1944 We took another town from the Germans, I saw my good friend Jonathan take a German grenade to the face. But he was still alive, bleeding out. He died shortly after... They knew we were coming, that's when we realised we had Spies and traitors in our uniform. After the battle we sang 'When Johnny comes marching home again', and executed the prisoners. \n\nPage six: July 7, 1944 We took the train station leading to the Berlin, we took almost no casulties in the battle. But the Germans luanched a massive counter-attack. They destroyed what little defences we had, so we pulled out. \n\nPage seven: September 5, 1944 Our unit became airbourne again and was flying over the city of Paris, to liberate France once and for all. I was on MG duty, those things are damn heavy. I set up shop in a window, and cleared a path for our boys. But the Germans had two MGs and a highly trained sniper on the other side of the gate, our boys couldn't get though. We fought all day until nightfall, then the remains of the 112th Airbourne Division went into hiding... \n\nPage eight (ZERO HOUR): It's only four of us now, everyone else is dead or turned. The dead are rising from their graves, and they crave flesh. We found a radio, and some weapons 'N' ammo. The voice on the radio said they will have a EVAC ready at dawn, If we survive... \n\nPage nine (Finale): We did it, we survived until the break of dawn. The EVAC arrived and they're bombing the city now, I heard that we're being shiped back home now...\n\n\n\n\nDay of Defeat: Source\nFinal verdict = 11/10","timestamp_created":1453098564,"timestamp_updated":1453098564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20593018","author":{"steamid":"76561197991520367","num_games_owned":329,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":10752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7582,"last_played":1654446199},"language":"french","review":"Tout simplement énorme !  \nJ'ai passé des centaines d'heures sur ce jeu juste pour le fun ou en compète avec une team.\nSi il y a un jeu sur lequel je reviens régulièrement c'est bien DOD ! \nJe recommande pour tous les fans de FPS durant cette période sombre de l'histoire !","timestamp_created":1453064349,"timestamp_updated":1453064349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20587095","author":{"steamid":"76561198149095452","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":523,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":111,"last_played":1553634412},"language":"russian","review":"Day of Defeat: Sourse - один из моих любимых сетевых шутеров, про который, почему то, многие забыли.
