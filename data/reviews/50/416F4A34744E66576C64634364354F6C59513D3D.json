is a pretty awesome exspansion pack it pretty much offers more of what made Half life so great but with new weapons and new aliens a true product of its time when Epansion packs were awesome and not just cheap 2-3 hour dlc addons no this is a quality 6-8 hour expansion with multiplayer\n\nPros\nCool new aliens \nSpectacular new weapons \nYour ai buddies actually have decent fire power\nThe boss battles while nothing to special are way better than the ones from the main game\nShepards mighty rench smites all who oppose you\nThe multiplayer can be fun \nAlien weaponry is awesome but gross to think about\n\nCons\nI think this game got a bit carried away with the difficulty some of the later levels are just a pain \nYour ai buddies may have better guns but there still pretty stupid\nIt may be tough for newcomers to get the hang of the multiplayer because I'm pretty sure most people still playing it have been playing since 1999\nThis game does offer lots of new guns but not many oppertunities to use all of them for instance the Displacer gun is like a BFG with teleprting as a bonus but I only used it like 2-3 times\nNot a fan of the HD weapons pack it looks odd and theres no option for the classic weapons\n\nSo opposing force is pretty awesome but it does have a few flaws however if you liked Half life you'll like this as it's more of the same but with new stuff added on

I've wanted to go back to the lack of cutscenes, smooth gameplay, and nailbiting enemies. So, I decided to go back to one of the original expansions for the game made by a young Gearbox Interactive.\n\nOddly enough, it doesn't have the stench of Borderlands covering it, despite the insane new guns added.\n\nHalf-Life: Opposing Force is a new story taking place during the Black Mesa incident, only now told through the perspective of the marines sent in to capture him, namely one marine named Adrian Shepard, who also has the similar affliction of mute-protagonist that Gordon Freeman has. You go through some of the same events around the crumbling science lab, while fighting a new range of alien enemies with a few new weapons. \n\nThe game functions just like the original Half-Life. Slippery running, terrible ladders, and tight gunplay all bundled into one old-school PC video game wet dream. The new weapons are pretty effective. My favorite was the equivalent of the BFG from DOOM. No matter what size the enemy you're fighting is, one hit from the gun will immediately destroy them, which will come in handy with all the new alien species that have been thrown in to f*** up your perfectly fine day.\n\nAll that aside, one problem that comes from Opposing Force is that the story isn't anything new. Sure, there's some new developments that bring further light to the conflict between the marines and their federal higher-ups, but it's just more Half-Life. And, yeah, more Half-Life is fine, but I'd just prefer the story do something a little more new than just follow the same events of Freeman, only through new eyes. It's just a 5 hour long version of Half-Life that wouldn't make sense to anyone that hadn't played the original game first.\n\nOpposing Force is still a fun 5-hour long campaign that I felt was worth the money I put into it. If you enjoyed the first Half-Life, you'll still love this expansion. It's just nothing really new or inventive, but as an expasion to an original game... does it really have to be? I'm giving Half-Life: Opposing Force an 8/10. It's a great little experience, but isn't quite as great as it's foundation on which it was constructed.","timestamp_created":1477360402,"timestamp_updated":1477360402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26196652","author":{"steamid":"76561198082113013","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":890,"last_played":1611348892},"language":"turkish","review":"Merhabalar arkadaşlar ben Luiz bu oyunu merak eden arkadaşlar için https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcLPGCi0SCVdqJ_p41VOkVlps8t-CtZ8E\nbu link ile kanalıma gidip takıldığınız yerleri izleyebilir yada nasıl bir oyun olduğuna bakabilirsiniz.

Even now, it stands out as having some of the most memorable AI, interesting mechanics, and diverse weapons of any game I have ever seen. If you enjoyed Half-Life or any of it's other Gold-Source offshoots, you will like Opposing Force. Opposing force puts the player character into the Black Mesa incident much later than all other games in the series, and keeps the player there far after every other character's story has ended. \n\nOne thing that sets this game far from other titles in the series is its difficulty. There are times when playing on hard that the AI for alien creatures and Black Ops teams seems to be almost mockingly hard. Even though they rely heavily on scripted paths and arenas, the Black Ops teams surpass what any enemy in the rest of the series can do, providing long fights that force the player to both act quickly and prepare for the multitude of tricks the enemy can pull at will.\n\nThe weapons in this game were also an enjoyable departure from Half-Life, and may even outshine the innovative gravity gun from the sequels. Opposing Force arms players with many alien weapons, most notably, the embryo of one of the game's most memorable alien enemies. It also adds a handheld barnacle which, while ridiculous, is used as a grappling hook very similar to the recently added Team Fortress 2 grapple. The dislocator, although impractical as a weapon outside of emergencies, is a very interesting idea for a weapon, as it allows limited travel between Earth and Xen. \n\nI highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys speedrunning, the original Half-Life series, hard games, or doesn't mind trying older titles.","timestamp_created":1476748141,"timestamp_updated":1476748141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513235151767730713","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26080768","author":{"steamid":"76561198242561750","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2440,"last_played":1649468635},"language":"english","review":"Opposing force is a great game and I recomend this game if you liked half life.

Overall, the game's just great, and I highly recommend playing it after finishing the original Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1474685692,"timestamp_updated":1474685692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53451228141784668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25657662","author":{"steamid":"76561198009564384","num_games_owned":1064,"num_reviews":288,"playtime_forever":490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1496587801},"language":"russian","review":"Самая интересная часть всей серии первого поколения, уж ИМХО.
