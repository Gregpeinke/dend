I would say that if you mixed Nation Red with Left 4 Dead, Killing Floor is what you would get. You can have six people play at once online, the levels are well made and dont feel too linear and the gunplay/ melee is a blast.  You go through waves (from four to ten) then at the end you fight a boss.\n\nThere are perks you can get but unlike other games, perks serve more as a role than a buff. For example, the berserker is great with melee weapons and damage resistance but if you want to blow something up you will get a better \"boom\" with the demolition perk. \n\nThis game does have its down sides.
