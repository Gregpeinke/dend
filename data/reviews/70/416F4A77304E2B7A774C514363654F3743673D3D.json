Скриптовые анимации в реальном времени, скелетная анимация. Всё это впервые появилось именно здесь. Сюжет. Загадочный, интригующий. В тестовой камере исследовательского комплекса Чёрная Меза случается несчастье. Это должно было быть обычное испытание телепорта, но не тут-то было. Техника выходит из строя. На нашу планету телепортируются загадочные существа с планеты Зен и начинают воспринимать Землю как свою родную. Гордону (главному молчаливому герою) придётся разобраться в этом всём и позвать на помощь. Военные же, которых послали в комплекс, оказались не спасателями, а командой по зачитске свидетей. G-Man. Загадочная личность в образе человека явно с нечеловеческими способностями будет попадаться на протяжении всей игры, наблюдая за действиями Гордона Фримена. И как окажется, не с проста.\nПереписанный движок Quake компания Valve его сделала под свои нужды и назвала Gold Source. Есть сетевой режим в виде \"каждый сам за себя\" с возможностью мгновенного респауна после смерти. Действия в мультиплеере развиваются довольно быстро. Играется по сей день так же бодро. \nВ этом году Half-Life исполняется 20 лет!

At the time of release in 1998 one of the major popular FPS games were Quake by id Software, a superb masterpiece, but what it was missing was what Valve had in mind. \n\nAn immersive storyline experience.\n\nRather than doing cutscenes like all of the rest, they felt that the only way you could actually feel like you were part of the world was by placing you in it instead of a character controlled by you. They achieved this by making sure you would always see from the eyes of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist at the age of 27, from the very beginning to the end. \n\nThere is no narrator, no one telling you what's going on. It's just you experiencing and learning the plot. The level design is beautiful, you weren't playing just another level with another environment, what it did was it progressed the story by using the environment to make you think you were actually a part of the world, instead of using the arbitrary concept of levels like so many others. \nIt convinced you that this isn't a game anymore, this is entertainment at its highest. \n\nWhen a monster would come at you in other games, it would usually scare you, but when you realized that all of the monsters AI was in fact just cardboard cutouts homing in on you, sometimes getting stuck on corners, it somehow took away from the experience. \nThe Half-Life AI was the most advanced on the market, but there were certainly monsters designed to be stupid by choice, such as the headcrabs. \nBut where it shines the most on is the HECU soldiers. They can flank, toss grenades, take cover and spit out information to other team mates. Another great AI is the houndeyes, they work in groups attacking together. Even the cockroaches were advanced, moving away from light, seeking food and running away from larger creatures. It's even possible to feed bullsquids. All of this to try and enhance the experience of you actually being there. \n\nScripting made everything more immersive, it made sure that the plot mattered to you, and that the outcome of the ending was satisfying to keep you wanting more. It also made sure cutscenes wasn't necessary as it would take away from the experience. \nEvery time you see a great scripted character in a game you have Half-Life and Half-Life alone to thank for it. \n\nThe levels never became stale and boring since they kept changing them all the time. They mixed around with different mechanics and weapons to keep you interessted, weapons would be lying on logical places or dropped by someone rather than at a random place where the devoloper thought \"This place is empty, lets place a weapon or powerup here\". \n\nOne example of excellent design is a place where you find something reffered to as snarks, they are essentially small bugs that you could throw away and they would jump around attacking, even yourself if you weren't careful enough. You're not really sure where they could be useful, but valve just introduced you to them so that you now know how they work. Later on you come across this ventilation filled with these, you crawl forward a bit and realize soldiers are shooting the ventilation down, it collapses and creates a large gap in front of you. \nYour only instinct is to load the bastards with snarks. This is one of so many examples that the game just keeps letting you try out new interessting things and it becomes a fun ride all the way through. \n\nOther games would either have a handfisted tutorial, which to me is like looking at the answers to a puzzle, why even bother doing the puzzle in the first place... or the mechanics would for the most part be the same, making the game boring after a while. \nIt's the solutions to new problems that gives you satisfaction and enjoyment to a discovery. Which is something most games, even today, seems to have lost. Because, what else is there really to make a game enjoyable?\n\nIt's not just the weapons that mix it up, but also the enemies, you never fight the same enemies all the way through, it's constantly variating, not to mention all of the enemies are unique. \nVortigaunts needs to charge before firing which means you can take cover in between, bullsquids charge when close and spit on long range, houndeyes are lethal in groups and need to charge to fire a damaging blast radius around them and headcrabs and zombies need to be timed with the crowbar to avoid taking damage. However, later on you recieve weapons so that killing them becomes much easier. \n\nEnemies actually react properly when you shoot them, sometimes they'll moan when they are hurt and grunts will run away from your grenades instead of just standing there. You can't just strafe left and right to dodge incoming nades like you can dodge linear hitscan fire, this creates a different experience than most other games at the time. \n\n\n\n\n\nBecause that Half-Life is running on GoldSrc, a modified Quake engine, it recieved an infamous exploit, bunnyhoping. While it technically has nothing to do with the intended game it feels worth mentioning as it has created one of the most entertaining games to run and watch. It has a very high skill ceiling so there's no doubt Single Segments will always be improved. \n\nMetaScore 150/100\nimdbScore: 9.0/10\n\nReview by treetoon ver 0.901","timestamp_created":1326928388,"timestamp_updated":1425997081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523650884628295898","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5325451","author":{"steamid":"76561198047956636","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":402,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":402,"last_played":1329811200},"language":"english","review":"Crowbar: $5.50\nH.E.V Suit: $4.6 mil\nBeating the $#!^ out of inter-dimensional alien overlords: Priceless.","timestamp_created":1326616618,"timestamp_updated":1326616618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5151834","author":{"steamid":"76561198045681416","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1327651200},"language":"english","review":"아무리 생각해도 옛날에 만든게임인데 어떻게 이런 그래픽이 나오지?","timestamp_created":1326563641,"timestamp_updated":1326563641,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2310170","author":{"steamid":"76561198005545192","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":5957,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5344,"last_played":1588648588},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the best games I've ever played.

It's not a traditional FPS; there's rarely prolonged firefights with a massive amount of enemies on-screen. The game is much more meticulous, and you're spending more time figuring out how to move from A to B rather than dodging bullets. Much like Portal (a spin off that has gained a life of its own) the game concentrates more on thinking than shooting. The narrative has very smooth pacing as well, but otherwise it's aged, and it's honestly a bit boring at times. Portal just does it so much better. Perhaps its the drab environments that deter the game? I'd recommend it only if you're planning to play the entire series-for completions sake. On the plus side, the multiplayer is still active.

I no longer enjoy regeneating health, I would much rather duct tape a health pack to my face and go back to killing interdemensional aliens bent on the enslavement of earth.  The lack of cutscenes is amazing.  The immersion in these games and the others Valve has created sucks you in and keeps you on the edge of your keyboard.   Valve has created an innovative new style to games that is shown throughout videogaming.  This is a must play for any Valve fan or FPS fan.  I can't wait for the next Half life game and whatever game Valve can come up with.","timestamp_created":1325014851,"timestamp_updated":1325014851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"752266","author":{"steamid":"76561197977387793","num_games_owned":547,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":260,"last_played":1347778800},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever made.\n\nThis game is my childhood.","timestamp_created":1325014650,"timestamp_updated":1325014650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2774383","author":{"steamid":"76561198012430452","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":0,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":0},"language":"english","review":"Pretty much the best shooter of all time.
