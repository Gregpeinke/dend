And this time it introduced new concept of portals in interesting enviroments. And yea, portals ended up being big thing. Though there weren't much of other games copying it like it was with Gravigun in HL2.\n\nAnd so you go through the abandoned labs, solving around 19 test chambers while listening to the lone robotic voice with slight humor. All while creating two portals to solve puzzles. It blew minds of people back then, but is probably nothing but \"fine\" nowdays. It's quite pleasent anyway.\n\nThe problem is that the game feels too short.\nAnd I don't mean short like people who actually count hours and then go and complain that the game wasn't 100 hours dragged agony.\nWhat I mean is that majority of the game feels like tutorial, with remaining parts of game where you don't just learn of new thing feeling too short. You aren't even given ability to create all two portals until half into game or so. It's quite nice to learn, yes, quite light on a game, casuals enjoyed it greatly, but it could use more of errr \"actual gameplay\".\n\nIt also includes challenges and developer commentary. Developers commentary is quite nice balance between interesting things and usual voice acting stuff.\nFor challenge mode, you got Advanced version of six maps from campaign that were made harder. You should beat those, since it feels more like proper challenge.\nAnd then it got 3 types of challenges for standart edition of those maps as well. Portal count makes sense and is nice to think over, despite sometimes requiring you to do exploit-like solution. Time taken is another fine one. But Steps Taken is just horrible! It really feels like youa re supposed to be some kind of speedrunning, as it mostly means that you will be in awkward positions and even worse, you have to time your jumps out of elevator, hopping down the hallway. One map has the beggining section where you need to walk down long hallways and climb up using cube. No portals allowed. Just mastering the oh-so-excited way that game engine counts steps while hopping onto things.\n\nSo yea, it's a pretty nice little game the gameplay of which amazed the masses at release time. And it does have a nice lonely atmoshpere to it.\nJust kidding, the only thing that masses were going crazy over was that credits song!\nOh yea, and fans trying to force their unfunny cake meme everywhere.","timestamp_created":1437481736,"timestamp_updated":1437482552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51890033483505249","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17153136","author":{"steamid":"76561198157049277","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":97,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1459161888},"language":"russian","review":"Чтоб больше таких игр было","timestamp_created":1437467611,"timestamp_updated":1437467611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17148372","author":{"steamid":"76561198115477633","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":94,"last_played":1435373957},"language":"spanish","review":"Gran juego :)","timestamp_created":1437434928,"timestamp_updated":1437434928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17144765","author":{"steamid":"76561198201390457","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":115,"last_played":1440564177},"language":"russian","review":"Вроде горм игра.
