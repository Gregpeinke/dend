Even if puzzle games are not generally your cup of tea, this game takes a unique approach to the genre, exploiting many different creative facets of its relatively simple gameplay mechanics. But the highlight of this game, as I see it, is its extremely witty and often downright hilarious dialogue (or perhaps monologue would be a more appropriate word).\n\n2) That said, if you are still uncertain about whether or not you will enjoy this game, I feel compelled to recommend that you wait until its on sale to make the purchase. My reason for this is that the full campaign is disappointingly short (my friend and I both beat the entire game in 3.5 hours)... about 2 hours into the game, the plot takes a twist of sorts, and suddenly gains significant momentum that almost gives the impression that the main crux of the game is finally starting. But no such luck... about an hour later, you realize you've beaten the game, which feels like it ends right after it truly begins. \n\n3) Replay value is low in my opinion. Recently I let my friend play through it on my computer while I watched, and I found that I remembered practically every solution right away. However, even merely sitting in the passenger seat as my friend traversed the angular corridors of Aperture Science Laboratories, I found myself thoroughly entertained by the clever writing... and, of course, my friend's confused frustration in all the same sections of the game that I struggled with.\n\nConclusion: Even if this isn't the type of game you would normally be interested in, I think most will quickly discover why this game has received such acclaim throughout the years. I think most gamers should not hesitate to add this game to their library... assuming the price is right ($9.99 for an old game that is *so* short might be hard to justify for some, but if you happen to find it on sale, waste no time in picking it up).","timestamp_created":1449742853,"timestamp_updated":1449742853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19595039","author":{"steamid":"76561198088549975","num_games_owned":1612,"num_reviews":78,"playtime_forever":227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1442022389},"language":"schinese","review":"当年半条命2附带的传送门，竟然不输半条命","timestamp_created":1449722265,"timestamp_updated":1449722265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19592739","author":{"steamid":"76561198063320266","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52,"last_played":1617840905},"language":"portuguese","review":"jogo do caralho!, compra junto com o 2 pq depois de jogar o primeiro vc vai querer jogar o segundo, a historia fica ainda melhor quando vc lê o quadrinho que a valve disponibilizou (lab rat).","timestamp_created":1449709779,"timestamp_updated":1449709779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19592183","author":{"steamid":"76561198211667417","num_games_owned":335,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":872,"last_played":1593940150},"language":"english","review":"I consider this game to be the single best game in existence.","timestamp_created":1449707051,"timestamp_updated":1506628221,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19590130","author":{"steamid":"76561198264191668","num_games_owned":443,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":465,"last_played":1610473772},"language":"english","review":"Having played the 2nd episode on ps3 long time ago; was  eager to try the original.

Any longer and I would have started to get a little bored and letting my mind wander as to the possibilities of a Portal Gun.\n\nThe only qualms i would have is the soundtrack started to get a little repetitive and the gold level challenges are nearly impossible.\n\nBut all in all i would say this game is worth everyones time.","timestamp_created":1449576032,"timestamp_updated":1449576032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19563493","author":{"steamid":"76561198143530000","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1491228338},"language":"english","review":"Gave me motion sickness.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1449573992,"timestamp_updated":1449573992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19560575","author":{"steamid":"76561198031239270","num_games_owned":557,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":390,"last_played":1648687317},"language":"english","review":"Those of you who have played the game know its awesome and those who have played the game and don't like it should probably call the asylum because they've been looking for ya! :D","timestamp_created":1449554580,"timestamp_updated":1449554580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19559760","author":{"steamid":"76561198099829108","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1520687130},"language":"schinese","review":"3小时剧情通关，经典无需多说\n高级房间和挑战很耐玩T.T","timestamp_created":1449549157,"timestamp_updated":1449549157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19559054","author":{"steamid":"76561198207738909","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":358,"last_played":1449549102},"language":"spanish","review":"excelente juego la verda medio corto por para eso esta el portal 2 huehuehuehuehue :v","timestamp_created":1449544966,"timestamp_updated":1449544966,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19558733","author":{"steamid":"76561198064936633","num_games_owned":576,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":1175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":601,"last_played":1646177990},"language":"english","review":"free cake.","timestamp_created":1449543306,"timestamp_updated":1449543306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483320683240890503","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19558149","author":{"steamid":"76561198034579902","num_games_owned":596,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1105,"last_played":1449331097},"language":"brazilian","review":"Excelente jogo, como todos da Valve.

There is one way through \"the maze\", but how you acheive that is up to you.  Often they provide you with tools that may or may not help you, and it's up to you to decide if you want to use them.\n\nThe graphics are fun and clean.

Now I've basically completed the game, if you don't count the secrets. Now if you like a good puzzle game but like a bit of a story this is WITHOUT A DOUBT the game for you. This has some seriously nice story and good puzzle gameplay aspects. If you're easily scared (like myself) this game may give you the feeling you're bieng watched...which technically you are. But if your worried about it being scary it's not. You will have a great time playing this! 9/10 for me!","timestamp_created":1449395732,"timestamp_updated":1450952502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19521738","author":{"steamid":"76561198248302572","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":172,"last_played":1657722918},"language":"english","review":"So far so good ../.\n","timestamp_created":1449395415,"timestamp_updated":1449395415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19521321","author":{"steamid":"76561198091217260","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":3259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":438,"last_played":1561720252},"language":"english","review":"awsome classic game, had a lot of fun","timestamp_created":1449393908,"timestamp_updated":1449393908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500416278839111328","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkv2mu9ECefK7Sg=="}
