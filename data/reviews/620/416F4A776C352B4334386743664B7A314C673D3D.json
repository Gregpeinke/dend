Nous sommes réveiller par Wheatly, \"Le gentil Nabot\", comme il le dit si bien, alors qu'on était plongé en pleine criostase. Suite à un accident au sein des laboratoire, les deux personnages sont contrain de s'enfuir des abysses d'Aperture Science à l'aide du Portal Gun afin de finir sein et sauf. A un moment, ils rencontrent Caroline, ou plutôt \"GlaDOS\" qui est un ancien collègue au créateur \"Cave Johnson\" d'Aperture Science\". En cherchant le module d'évacuation, Wheatly déclenche accidentellement la réactivation de GlaDOS, ce qui entraine Chell, de rester toute sa vie à faire des test, mais aussi elle devra subir toute sa vie la soumission de GlaDOS.\nDes anciennes salles de test, aux très anciennes, et même aux nouvelles, il faudra faire preuve de logique et de patience pour réussir à échapper à GlaDOS, et même à Wheatly (Si vous jouer au jeun vous comprendrez pour quoi). Cependant, le jeu à une très mauvaise durée de jeu (J'ai fini le jeu en 2 heures), et pour cela, il ont essayer de se ratraper avec les salles de test comunautaires, et avec le très bon mode co-op.\nL'histoire à un très bon sens, et peut en apprendre plus sur la vie des trois personnage.\nLe jeu est de difficulté moyenne, mais faut quand même faire preuve d'une grande logique.

a first time portal player i have hurd of this game so much through social media and i was thinking can it keep up with all the hype that it had received over the years of release...... And so it did its a amazing game full of awesome puzzles that will take time to figure out and test your skills. Portal 2 will twist your knowledge of the laws of physics. I would define this game as a physics bending puzzle game with a well placed sense of humor that will provide a fun adventure for the weeks to come........","timestamp_created":1412077746,"timestamp_updated":1412077746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12299407","author":{"steamid":"76561198023054500","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2445,"last_played":1416475530},"language":"english","review":"an emence puzzle game consisting of get form poitn A to point B the only problem is its much ahrder than it may seem useing you're portal gun to open portals around the map and with a still thriving community map section of endless puzzles that dont seem to end but if you feel like teaming up theres also a co-op mode ware you can play with a friend on.. sadly only a few misisons but theyre fun the first try around","timestamp_created":1412075717,"timestamp_updated":1412075717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12299060","author":{"steamid":"76561198153010831","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":300,"last_played":1506043265},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошие головоломки бывает подзаебывешся над некоторыми","timestamp_created":1412072753,"timestamp_updated":1412072753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12299001","author":{"steamid":"76561198012896289","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":174,"last_played":1412070929},"language":"english","review":"Good and catching story.
