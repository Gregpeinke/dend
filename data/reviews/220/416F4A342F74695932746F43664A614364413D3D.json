really really wish I still loved this game, but unfortunately I don't. This game definitely shows its age in the design which is extremely unfun and gimmicky at times. For example, [spoiler] in the chapter sandtraps, using the gravity gun to move objects around to get through the sand is extremely tedious.[/spoiler] Also, stacking puzzles are not fun and you can't tell me otherwise. There is nothing interesting about picking up a box and moving it to a spot where I need it to progress. The shooting is really just okay, but in general I kinda got bored in sections with a lot of enemies. In general, I actually think the weapons and shooting was a lot better in the first Half-Life actually. I really wish I enjoyed the game more and if you're looking at my reviews, you probably think I'm a Half-Life hater, but I really think that both Half-Life 1 and 2 are very flawed. At the end of the day, I still played through these games multiple times and they are a big part of my childhood, I just wish they were designed better.","timestamp_created":1489612188,"timestamp_updated":1657998880,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30530304","author":{"steamid":"76561198170342302","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":1567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1615611495},"language":"english","review":"pretty good,","timestamp_created":1489605471,"timestamp_updated":1489605471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30529842","author":{"steamid":"76561198282721275","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":782,"last_played":1586001085},"language":"russian","review":"По началу я думал что игра не очень интересная но когда я туда зашел я просто не мог оторваться от компутера там годная графа,сюжет,герои,транспорт мне игра очень понравилась всем советую!","timestamp_created":1489603717,"timestamp_updated":1489603717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30529128","author":{"steamid":"76561198252655522","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1682,"last_played":1524462267},"language":"schinese","review":"很好啊。。还要开挺长时间气垫船和三蹦子。。嗯还有起重机。。(随时SAVE LOAD也很方便呐~)\n剧情设计的也挺赞。\n铁幕下的17号城市，一下火车就是巨大的显示屏播放着领导人的“欢迎”词。\n“这不是一个有监狱的国家，而是一座有国家的监狱”\n居民家里的电视机，街上的大屏幕都播放着同一个频道——领导人道貌岸然的洗脑演讲。\n然后游戏的内容就是从一个逃犯混成反抗军领导者。\n后来一个场景是几个反抗军拆除纪念碑上的大屏幕。不管你们的“恩主”怎样标榜自己的伟大光荣正确，它们的末日也终将来临。暴力机器的强大和谎言的欺骗或许能维持一时，却维持不了一世。\n嗯反正就是觉的这款游戏还是比较meaningful而不仅仅是好玩，就写个评测吧。❤","timestamp_created":1489600933,"timestamp_updated":1489600933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.618927359580993652","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30523726","author":{"steamid":"76561198088968538","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110,"last_played":1511971186},"language":"schinese","review":"我曾经以为只有小时候会晕3d","timestamp_created":1489579457,"timestamp_updated":1489579457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30519856","author":{"steamid":"76561198318837743","num_games_owned":528,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1133,"last_played":1645351024},"language":"schinese","review":"这款游戏虽然已经很久了，但是不得不说做的非常良心，细节也做的非常不错，而且中文配音听着也舒坦啊，但是猪脚从头到尾一句台词都没有略微让人蛋疼，有时候找路也要耗费大量的时间","timestamp_created":1489555520,"timestamp_updated":1489555520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30518182","author":{"steamid":"76561198328562462","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1039,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":959,"last_played":1543505971},"language":"russian","review":"Ну конешно 10 из 10.

The first Half-Life has been said to be the best game ever so the sequel had gigantic expectations, and it delivered.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story of Half-Life 2 is very rich. You are Gordon Freeman, a former Black Mesa employee who's been in a coma for 20 years under the control of the Gman, once you've woken up you try to reunite with the scientists who survived the events of Half-Life 1. Every character is unqiue and they have their own personalities. My favourite character being Barney Calhoun. I am also a big fan of Half-Life and Portal being in the same alternative universe.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe graphics in Half-Life 2 are outstanding for it's time, holds up great even for today's standards. Although the texture quality being a bit outdated, everything else is great. Shaders are nice, I'm a big fan of the reflections on floors, windows and on water, that technology is called cubemapping. Post-processing effects are cool, good use of sprites.\n\n[h1]Controls and Movement[/h1]\nThe controls in Half-Life 2 have set the standard of good and simple controls. Segwaying in let's talk about the movement, the movement is an art form of it self, it reintroduced bunnyhopping, strafing and many more movement techniques. Bunnyhopping is still a big movement technique in today's games like CS:GO which uses the same game engine as Half-Life 2. I would really recommend you watching a speedrun of Half-Life 2 done by waezone on Games Done Quick.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gWd5A_4eYQ\n\n[h1]Official Soundtrack[/h1]\nThe Official SoundTrack of Half-Life 2 is my favourite music track from any other game ever, i personally love the industrial sounding instruments and sounds that are in this track. I love this soundtrack so much sometimes I listen to it when I'm going to sleep. My favourite song being Triage at Dawn, closely followed by Hazardous Environments.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nHalf-Life 2 is for me the best game in the Half-Life series and also my favourite game of all time. Played it first 2 years ago as a very early easter gift, I still play this game to this day, but I mostly play Synergy (HL2 multiplayer mod) because it's more fun to play the Half-Life experience with other people and friends than with just yourself. If i had to rate this game out of then. I would rate it a deserving 10/10. Best game ever made. Thanks for reading and have a great day.","timestamp_created":1489518243,"timestamp_updated":1575791600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30512567","author":{"steamid":"76561198316077564","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":812,"last_played":1503495157},"language":"english","review":"fun, had absolutely no idea what i was doing","timestamp_created":1489517929,"timestamp_updated":1489517929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30509436","author":{"steamid":"76561198138100244","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":168,"playtime_forever":135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":109,"last_played":1580634068},"language":"russian","review":"++++++","timestamp_created":1489506487,"timestamp_updated":1489506487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30507458","author":{"steamid":"76561198160652223","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":800,"last_played":1489498663},"language":"turkish","review":"Efsane oyun...

Jamas perdemos el control de Gordon Freeman y por eso el juego nos introduce en su mundo con su ambientación. No necesitan decirnos que estamos en un mundo oprimido con autoritarismo, nos lo muestra mientra nos escapamos de la primer ciudad. Ni que a la resistencia le estaba yendo mal pero nuestra llegada tuerce la balanza, nos damos cuenta por los alientos de cada aliado que vayamos encontrando en el camino. Desde que arranca el juego hasta que termina es una montaña rusa de emociones que va cambiando para no atascarse en la monotonía. \n\tEl combate es rápido y fluido. Se dispara desde la cadera con una mira, no hay vida regenerativa y tenemos un arsenal muy variado que cada arma tiene una función especifica. Todo esto le da una modalidad de juego, que en los juegos modernos ya no existe. Saber cuando avanzar retirarse o escapar, así también como darnos cuenta que arma nos conviene en cada situación, puede cambiar drásticamente el resultado de las batallas. Y si lo juegan en una dificulta alta, el posicionamiento y cuidado de la munición son factores claves para sobrevivir. \n\nCompralo. ES UN JUEGAZO.

Jednak nie dlatego, iż tytuł okazał się klapą. Bardziej przychodzi na myśl słowo: \"pozamiatane\". Baldur's Gate. Fallout. Wspomniany w tytule Half-Life. A jednak. Okazuje się, że powstaje część druga, przy której \"pozamiatane\" wzbudza jedynie nieco sarkastyczny uśmieszek na ustach. To, co Valve zaprezentowało w drugiej części Half-Life'a przeszło moje najśmielsze oczekiwania. Kompletnie nowy silnik graficzny. Nowy, wykreowany specjalnie pod potrzeby fabuły świat. Dodatkowi bohaterowie, zróżnicowana rozgrywka. Batalie z obcymi na otwartych terenach i spektakularne, jeżące włosy na karku bitwy z Kombinatem w City 17. Klimat post-apokalipsy, gdzie wraz z kosmitami niczym rzymski cesarz rządzi dyktator. Brak mi słów. Brak słów! Ta gra jest jedną z najlepszych, jakie kiedykolwiek stworzył nasz ludzki gatunek. Gra niemalże żywa, gdzie grając i walcząc odnosi się wrażenie, że po drugiej stronie nie ma maszyny, algorytmu, komputera, ale siedzą prawdziwi ludzie, którzy wcielając się w przeciwników kontrolują ich poczynania. Ponadto niewiarygodny, realny świat. Wszystkie obiekty dają wrażenie masy. Podnoszone skrzynki, przedmioty, pojazdy i przeciwnicy. Czuć masę. Czuć fizykę. Czuć autentyczność. Do tego świetna fabuła, spektakularna cytadela i starzy przyjaciele z Half Life. A na koniec Gordon Freeman i G-man.
