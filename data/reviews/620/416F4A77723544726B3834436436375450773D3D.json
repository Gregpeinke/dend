It is easy in control, but hard in solving puzzles.\nIf you are not confident with your IQ, it's okay cause most of those puzzles are not that hard.\nIf you are confident with your IQ, please come all the same, there must be one puzzle that will drive you crazy.\n\n============================================\n\nIf you've got a lovely girlfriend, this is a great game to play with your girlfriend;\nIf you don't have a girlfriend, this is a great game to play with your firends;\nIf you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone;\nIf you don't have the game to play, get money for it;\nIf you don't have money for it, get a job;\nIf you don't have a job, rob a bank;\nIf you got arrested for robbing a bank, at least you tried...I'll send you one as a gift.\n\n============================================\n\nSome people say that this game would be boring if you play the same laboratory twice. Yeah he's right. Then I'll do the math for you:\n\n1. Firstly, if this is your first time in the game, official campaign will cost you about 10 hrs, then the coop campaign, another 5 hrs;\n\n2. Then you will have got though all of them. End of the game? No, just the beginning.\n\n3. In the workshop, there are 61,427 coop labs and 387,466 single player labs. 448,892 labs in total.\n\n4. Every lab will cost you 15 min in average, if you play Portal2 2.5 hours every day, then you will experience 10 labs each day.\n\n5. Then, it will take you 44889.2 days, in the other word, 123 years, to solve all those puzzles. And new made labs are not in the consideration\n\n6. Do you think you can live for 123 years?\n\nSo you cannot have played all of those Portal2 laboratories in your single life. Is there any necessity to play the same lab twice?\n\n============================================\n\nWell designed puzzles, Countless laboratories, Only $5 in promotion days, Won't you buy it if you still have humanity???","timestamp_created":1435221243,"timestamp_updated":1483237636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":119,"votes_funny":117,"weighted_vote_score":"0.915280640125274658","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16693316","author":{"steamid":"76561198036286714","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":2359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":635,"last_played":1646329669},"language":"english","review":"Played the whole game and holy sh*t i love the sequel","timestamp_created":1435219626,"timestamp_updated":1435219626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16692567","author":{"steamid":"76561198203166336","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":449,"last_played":1435264513},"language":"turkish","review":"Accayip süper efsaneeeeeeeeeeeee\nTürkçe olması dahada iyi\nKESİNLİKLE ALIN\nÖZellikle bir arkadaşınızla girince çok sarıyor bu oyun.\nNormalde fiyatı pahalı ama indirimlerde 7 tl ye düşebiliyor. indirimdeyken almanızı tavsiye ederim <3","timestamp_created":1435215671,"timestamp_updated":1435215671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16692229","author":{"steamid":"76561198121446926","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":827,"last_played":1539635667},"language":"english","review":"I have to say when I first saw a Portal 2 demo a year ago on the Xbox 360, I thought it was just another game that you play it once and thats it.
