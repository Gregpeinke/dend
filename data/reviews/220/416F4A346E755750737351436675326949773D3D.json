Una volta finita la saga, ci sarà un'unica cosa a darvi fastidio, l'assenza di news riguardanti il prossimo capitolo: Half Life 3.\nE' inutile dire che consiglio vivamente a tutti di giocarlo come si deve, ovvero dall'inizio alla fine, godendo di ogni momento passato in compagnia di Gordon... a tal proposito comprate uno dei pacchetti di valve per avere tutti gli hl e i portal (magari scaricate black mesa e iniziate da lì, visto che hl1 potrebbe risultare un po' troppo retrò).\nIl mio consiglio?

Los principales aciertos del juego fueron su lograda historia, ambientación y narrativa, junto al grandisimo uso de las fisicas y la manipulación de objetos, hasta el punto de haber logrado una maravilla como el arma gravitatoria. Quizas se le puedan sacar algunas pegas como el hecho de que fases como la de la lancha o el coche se hacen demasiado largas y aburridas, pero desde la fase de las hormigas león hasta el final es sencillamente PERFECTO, destacando esa gran fase que es \"Seguid a Freeman\".

Fantastic atmosphere, great level design, interesting story, good variety of weapons, and quite frankly some of the best pacing I've ever seen in a game. The fact that you're not force-fed exposition via cutscenes is also a nice addition, as it ensures that you are always in control. Of course, I expect nothing less than excellent game design from Valve.\nAlso nice is how reasonable the sys. reqs. are, so pretty much any computer, from high-end desktops to laptops with integrated graphics, can run this game smoothly.\nOverall, I whole-heartedly recommend Half-Life 2. You can get it for, what, $10 these days?
