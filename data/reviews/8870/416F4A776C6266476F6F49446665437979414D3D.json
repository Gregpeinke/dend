I am a single father to my Son. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 25 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching some tiktok videos. So i decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me so many happy memories.\n","timestamp_created":1659444164,"timestamp_updated":1659444529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":43,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590463340282440186","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119930336","author":{"steamid":"76561199196528942","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":44,"playtime_at_review":1417,"last_played":1660397841},"language":"schinese","review":" A good game with a unexpected ending.","timestamp_created":1659435598,"timestamp_updated":1659435598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119923946","author":{"steamid":"76561198124998555","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":541,"playtime_at_review":1685,"last_played":1659510858},"language":"spanish","review":"diez años después sigue siendo mi juego favorito","timestamp_created":1659423426,"timestamp_updated":1659423426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119923530","author":{"steamid":"76561198107127905","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":169,"playtime_at_review":822,"last_played":1659419927},"language":"spanish","review":"alta historia, juegardo","timestamp_created":1659422538,"timestamp_updated":1659422538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119919230","author":{"steamid":"76561198013024213","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3851,"last_played":1658059008},"language":"english","review":"So, i played Bioshock 1, 2, and Infinite all within the span of like a week, working on all of the achievements for each game so i could experience everything this series has to offer.\n\n++ Bioshock: Infinite as a standalone was a really fun game, the change of scenery, as well as the changes to how the combat works and plasmids are dished out, called \"Vigors\" in this installation of the series. This series always provides such an interesting look into different time periods and putting them into such fantastic scenarios. However considering the game by itself, i still believe that the first two games offered more in exploration, combat, and general action. I LOVED using the rails around Columbia to get around and gain an advantage over my enemies, but i was a little disappointed in they ways they used the rails, they were super cool, and i loved them, but i think they probably could've utilized them a little better.\n\n++ Bioshock: Infinite alongside its DLC, Burial at Sea, was the best experience I've had. It wrapped up most, if not all of the loose ends of the series, and provided tons of interesting ways that the series could continue. With all of the scenery changes, game play changes, in tandem with all of the new content that Infinite already offered, was seriously cool and i loved every second of it. Including the DLC, Infinite takes the cake as my favorite Bioshock game. It was emotional, it was beautiful, and it was fun.\n\n++ The game was gorgeous, the visuals were breathtaking, playing this game on an ultra wide monitor was an incredibly cinematic experience, it was like i was playing a part in an action film.\n\n++ The Clash in the Clouds, blue ribbon challenges were one of the hardest, but most exciting challenges i had to complete.\nthey were hard, they were time consuming, they really could've benefited from a checkpoint system, but i learned so much in unique ways to utilize the weapons and powers in Bioshock: Infinite, that i couldn't help but come out of the experience super pumped and with a great sense of accomplishment.\n\n++ Bioshock is always very honest in its telling of different eras in our time, sometimes this leads to some uncomfortable topics being brought up in the story of Bioshock. To me, these moments are welcome, they help add realism to the incredible storytelling of this series, and i respect the developers refusal to shy away from harsh facts of American history.\n\n-- The crashing issue that i noticed in the past 2 Bioshock remasters, is still prevalent in Bioshock: Infinite. However, i will say that i crashed the least in this game, i also lost the least amount of progress from crashes in this game compared to the other two. This is still my biggest complaint of the series, these crashes were the only real issue i had when playing them all.\n\n-- I was really disappointed in how the hacking system has fallen apart through the series, in Bioshock 1, the hacking was challenging, but fun. In Bioshock 2, the hacking system was made so much simpler and easier, to the point that it was almost too easy, but i was happy that i could still hack things to my advantage. In Bioshock: Infinite however, the hacking system was reduced down to just a vigor that's much harder to predict and control than hacking. I think this would've been an awesome change if they included the hacking and possession abilities together, kind of like they did in the past, but with hacking pretty much gone i was sad to see it.\n\nOVERALL ++ Playing through the Bioshock series from start to finish, including all of the DLC and challenge maps, completing all of the achievements along the way, was INCREDIBLE. The storytelling between the games was all mostly linear, and i finished the series with very little questions, and a lot of answers. Despite the crashing issues across all of the games, i still, loved every second. Bioshock is an awesome example of a fun, classic feeling game, there was never a point where i felt overly bored or frustrated. I recommend this series 100% to anyone that enjoys a good ole fashioned beat em up shooter.\n\n","timestamp_created":1659414035,"timestamp_updated":1659414035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119914214","author":{"steamid":"76561198028192982","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":543,"last_played":1657072977},"language":"english","review":"This is the only Bioshock game i've played so I don't have anything to compare it to in the series but the story and gameplay are awesome especially for a 2013 game.
