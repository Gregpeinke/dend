But today, I finally finished Half-Life. [/h1]\n\n[No spoilers but if you ever want to try this out for the first time without any prior knowledge or opinions about it, ignore this]\n\nThe farthest I've gone back in the day was \"Blast Pit.\"After that chapter, everything was foreign to me. And when I was younger (and more impatient), I remember using a cheat code—which I have now forgotten—to skip everything and jump straight to \"endgame\" to see the ending. Even so, I vaguely remember some scenes of the first few parts. So I experienced most of the game for the first time.\n\nHalf-Life is an immersive first person shooter that offers more than just shoot 'em up gameplay. There's a lot of problem-solving to accomplish and platforming to perform. It also doesn't put you in a position where you always have to clear out your enemies. Sometimes you have to find an exit as quick as possible or stay away from certain rooms or areas. \n\nI seriously recommend going into this game blind if you're jumping into it for the first time, which means avoiding walkthroughs and playthroughs. Half-Life is highly enjoyable to experience for what it has to offer. The combat can be fast-paced, the jumpscares are still thrilling (for me, at least), and the constant thinking of how to get from one point to the other can be frustrating but rewarding once you get there. Some tasks can be challenging at certain points but the only times I really had to lookup stuff online was when I forgot what to do after a month-long or week-long break from playing. For every anxious moment the game throws at you, it also gives you those huge moments of relief and satisfaction once you get things done.\n\nThe story is simple enough to understand and doesn't need a lot of explanation. But even with its simplicity and straight-forward storytelling, it still managed to pique my interest. I will admit that the latter parts were a bit underwhelming. And I can't really say that the overall story was memorable. Nevertheless, Half-Life is worth playing even just for the narrative.\n\nI don't necessarily know if this game pales in comparison to newer ones, because I also stopped playing video games around 13 years ago—almost as long as the last time I played Half-Life. Returning to gaming at 30, I'm still impressed with 2000's era graphics of Half-Life. I'm aware that this is an updated version and there are recent remakes of this title. But what I'm trying to say is that it looks better than ever and feels just as fun as it was when I was younger.\n\nWith that being said, I'm glad that I revisited Half-Life and I'm highly satisfied to have finally finished it.","timestamp_created":1612521977,"timestamp_updated":1612522714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85995856","author":{"steamid":"76561198267706027","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3068,"last_played":1656533949},"language":"turkish","review":"Good","timestamp_created":1612520143,"timestamp_updated":1612520143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85991503","author":{"steamid":"76561198056517530","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7834,"last_played":1612113879},"language":"danish","review":"overraskende god historie og godt spil","timestamp_created":1612513941,"timestamp_updated":1612513941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85989776","author":{"steamid":"76561198838617950","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":565,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":552,"last_played":1612512291},"language":"russian","review":"Хоть я и сыграл в эту игру спустя много лет, мне она понравилась и я прошел её\n","timestamp_created":1612511399,"timestamp_updated":1612511399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85981426","author":{"steamid":"76561198841403732","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":4675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":2938,"last_played":1660491741},"language":"english","review":"MY. 455.

It was certainly ahead of its time. Other than its graphics the game has aged gracefully; I now understand why it earned its spot as a cult classic of PC.\n\nExcellent story; the game manages to build a compelling atmosphere that is memorable. The story is told through gameplay, not cutscenes. Shooting and enemy AI have nothing to envy modern games; the gameplay overall still very solid. Movement feels a bit slippery, but it does not impact playability. The graphics hold up better that I expected, but this is where the game shows its age the most; the atmosphere and other details do make up for it.\n\nThe level design is organic and creative; plenty of subtle details. Most of the game feels like one big thing, even though you are constantly going to new zones. The puzzles are challenging; the game does not hold your hand; this is from back when you did not have a marker on the screen telling you what to do and where to go; you have to listen to the game to figure things out and move forward.\n\nHalf-Life is old; if you cannot stand \"retro\" games, then it will be too dated for your enjoyment; however, if you can change between modern and old games without issue, then it's definitively still worth playing.","timestamp_created":1612412916,"timestamp_updated":1612412916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85920171","author":{"steamid":"76561198029516469","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4319,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3353,"last_played":1637623805},"language":"english","review":"its a good game","timestamp_created":1612410177,"timestamp_updated":1612410177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85917853","author":{"steamid":"76561199088821081","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":233,"last_played":1622154861},"language":"english","review":"gaming","timestamp_created":1612406606,"timestamp_updated":1612406606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85917207","author":{"steamid":"76561198396172241","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":962,"last_played":1612387833},"language":"english","review":"HoLEE SHIT BABY THIS GAME IS GOOD\n\nI loved pretty much everything about this, especially how damn seamless the game is. There's no cutscenes, no real loading screens beside the loading icon slowing you down for a few seconds sometimes, and everything just flows together like one complete package. I really had no interest in half life and bought this game because someone gifted me half life 2 and I wanted to play 1 first, but damn I got what I expected and more. If you don't care about this series and are randomly reading this, play it. It's one of the best gaming experiences I've had in my entire life. \n\n[i] This next part assumes you've played the game [/i]\n\n[spoiler] I particularly liked the assassin segments. The way they take place in these huge sprawling areas with tons of artificial corners for the assassins to hide behind, and the way the echoey nature of the areas provide both an advantage and a disadvantage. For one, you can easily hear any footsteps the assassins make, but it also means your own footsteps overlap, potentially confusing yourself. Even after you've taken out every assassin in the area, there's no real way for you to know, so you end up tiptoeing around the area with your finger jittering over your mouse waiting to get hit. It's great that in the second and last assasin section you're forced to go up on the catwalks yourself since the assassins can't get down, meaning that if you camped with explosives like I did, you have to switch up your playstyle.
