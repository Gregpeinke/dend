(Unoriginal Joke Is Unoriginal) [/h1]\n[b] Note: This is a rereview, redone in my \"new style\" of review. [/b]\n\n[b] tl;dr: This game is like a marshmallow: fluffy, tasty, and fun, but it's gone as soon as you get it. [/b]\n\nPortal is Valve's very first puzzle game, but not just any puzzle game, as it sees you being in a testing facility in a first person view and soon after picking up a gun... that shoots portals. All while being talked to by a robot computer lady that very much enjoys sarcasm, snarking and [spoiler] killing humans in her test chambers, or just in general. [/spoiler]\n\n[u] General Overview [/u]\nAs stated, this is a puzzle game. Each room consists of a puzzle, with each puzzle getting progressively difficult. You start off with just your hands, then a one-way portal device, and finally a dual portal device. There is also a post-campaign advanced mode, consisting of previously completed chambers with a variation that increases difficulty, and a challenge mode, which has you completing previously completed chambers in a set time limit in order to get bronze, silver or gold.\n\n[u] Pros [/u]\n- Very fun, and a nice introduction to puzzle games\n- Pleasing ambianace and music\n- GLaDOS (the robot computer lady) can be quite funny at times\n- A unique twist on the Puzzle and FPS genres\n- (Mostly) Easy to get achievements\n\n[u] Cons [/u]\n- Short game. Assuming you go for only the story, it'll take you 2 hours at best and maybe 4 at worst\n- There is only 12 extra challanges, which isn't much bonus content\n- [spoiler] The cake is a lie [/spoiler] (Hur hur, another hilarious and original joke)\n\n[u] Nitpicks (That May Detract From Your Overall Enjoyment) [/u]\n- Not much music overall\n- The achievements have two settings: hard and easy. There is no spectrum.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\nValve made a pretty interesting game here. A Puzzle and FPS hybrid, and it somehow manages to not botch it up. It's amazing to think this was suppose to be a throwaway game in Valve's Orange Box bundle, but instead managed to become one of the most beloved PC games of all time. However, you can definetly feel that this was supposed to be a throwaway game from the story and the post-game content, which ends up leaving the game feel like... a marshmallow. Just one. That you buy at a bake sale. Sure, it's fluffy, tasty, and fun, but as soon as you eat it, it's gone.","timestamp_created":1465091526,"timestamp_updated":1466738090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522523641586303711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23390464","author":{"steamid":"76561198076436720","num_games_owned":521,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":120,"last_played":1462581570},"language":"spanish","review":"Corto pero divertido, nada mas que añadir.","timestamp_created":1465086381,"timestamp_updated":1465086381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23390228","author":{"steamid":"76561198216298097","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":38599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18550,"last_played":1655327922},"language":"english","review":"Short but sweet","timestamp_created":1465085006,"timestamp_updated":1545343766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498711347579956055","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23384303","author":{"steamid":"76561198258448371","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1482549392},"language":"spanish","review":"+10 prro","timestamp_created":1465061854,"timestamp_updated":1465061854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23383337","author":{"steamid":"76561198071485133","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":438,"last_played":1456350077},"language":"russian","review":"Legendary puzzle game with atmospheric gameplay. 10/10","timestamp_created":1465058655,"timestamp_updated":1465058655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23380949","author":{"steamid":"76561198166235594","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":45,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1427051613},"language":"english","review":"portal is ok","timestamp_created":1465050474,"timestamp_updated":1465050474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481182724237442017","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23380329","author":{"steamid":"76561198274279057","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":636,"last_played":1560267589},"language":"german","review":"Anfangs war ich skeptisch ob mir das Spiel gefallen würde oder eher weniger.
