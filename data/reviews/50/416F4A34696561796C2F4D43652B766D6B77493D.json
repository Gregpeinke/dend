My only complaint would be that it's a bit short and (probably as a consequence) the events feel a little rushed, for example, the soldiers in Opposing Force seem to pull out very shortly after they came... they were much more 'present' as opponents in Half-Life 1.

Adrian could be sent into the main story by something like an experiment to get Alyx back from the G-Man by accessing the void he is trapped in.","timestamp_created":1594518805,"timestamp_updated":1594518805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72530162","author":{"steamid":"76561198353463981","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":559,"last_played":1637276333},"language":"english","review":"It is a good awesome game.","timestamp_created":1594511866,"timestamp_updated":1594511866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72528184","author":{"steamid":"76561199027956541","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":317,"last_played":1605459155},"language":"english","review":"Blue shift but better","timestamp_created":1594508778,"timestamp_updated":1594508778,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72524284","author":{"steamid":"76561199021943667","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":3184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":579,"last_played":1632677831},"language":"brazilian","review":"Half-Life: Opposing force, é a primeira expansão do Half-Life.
