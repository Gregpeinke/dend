This Blue Shift is the second rather dull expansion pack for Half Life 1. To be blunt, the first expansion Opposing Force is better, because it offers more guns, new gameplay mechanics and a lot of new monsters. Blue Shift however offers nothing new except new levels that will take you under 4 hours to complete the first time around.\n\nBlue Shift takes you through Black Mesa and Xen once again when everything goes wrong and aliens invade. You start the expansion riding the tram to work (just like Half Life 1) after taking an optional training course that is literally the same training course from Half Life 1.\n\nThe gameplay is more challenging than the original game in both good and bad ways. The good way is the game shows off its artificial intelligence by pitting you... Barney Calhoun, a blue shift security guard at Black Mesa, against hundreds of marines sent into the Black Mesa facility. Usually you fight 10 marines at a time in wide open areas. The enemies will scatter when you throw grenades, run away from you, try to flank you and fan out so you're not shooting enemies like dominoes.\n\nThe negative ways that the expansion is challenging comes from several dark areas with dozens of head crabs jumping at you around every turn. It feels cheap compared to Half Life 1 and Opposing Force.\n\nThere are a few shining lights for this expansion and that is rescuing scientists, although it's not much of a rescue, because any of them can die and it doesn't matter. The expansion also dabbles in having an important character Dr. Rosenburg that you will rescue and he will guide you to the end of the expansion. Guide you as in briefly tell you what to do through believable voice acting.\n\nIn all this is a lackluster expansion compared to the previous one and feels more like a level pack... without levels, just one continuous game. Chances are you can get this expansion with one of the deluxe Half Life 1 games, so save some money and get Blue Shift there instead.","timestamp_created":1424571368,"timestamp_updated":1432148538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.66750788688659668","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14574627","author":{"steamid":"76561198033322769","num_games_owned":323,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1492605396},"language":"english","review":"Story: 11/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nSoundtrack: 10/10\nTotal: 100/10\nBarney Included","timestamp_created":1424518929,"timestamp_updated":1424518929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14570270","author":{"steamid":"76561198179199150","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":508,"last_played":1425079271},"language":"english","review":"I played the original Half Life back in the day and became a big fan.

The good news is that the revamped graphics and inclusion of Opposing Force make the retail package a lot more worthwhile. \n\n \n\nHalf-Life: Blue Shift is the second official retail expansion to Valve Software's groundbreaking 1998 first-person shooter. It's worth noting that Half-Life's publisher, Sierra Studios, has used the Half-Life brand name on many other products, including refurbished \"Platinum\" and \"Game of the Year\" editions of the original game, and has also helped promote (and sell) fan-made Half-Life mods, including last year's Gunman Chronicles and the extremely popular multiplayer mod Counter-Strike. Blue Shift was developed by Gearbox Software, the same team that brought you the excellent 1999 Half-Life expansion, Opposing Force, in which you play as one of the commandos sent in to ventilate Gordon Freeman, the protagonist of the original game. Blue Shift itself was originally developed as supplemental content for Half-Life for the Sega Dreamcast, but unfortunately, that console was discontinued earlier this year. Thus, plans for the release of Half-Life for the Dreamcast changed, which is why Blue Shift has now been made available for the PC. In North America, Blue Shift also comes bundled with Opposing Force--and you don't need the original Half-Life to play either of these. For good measure, Blue Shift also includes the Half-Life High Definition pack, which refurbishes some of the graphics throughout Half-Life and makes the entire game look a little newer. The bad news is that Blue Shift, the actual game, doesn't amount to much on its own terms. The good news is that the revamped graphics and the inclusion of Opposing Force make the retail package a lot more worthwhile. \n\n\n\n\nThe high definition pack noticeably enhances some of Half-Life's graphics.\n\nIt takes much more effort to put Half-Life: Blue Shift into proper context with all the preceding Half-Life products than it does to actually finish the game. It's not that the game is easy so much that it's extremely short--it'll take you between four and 10 hours to see everything in Blue Shift. You are put in the role of one of Half-Life's stalwart, levelheaded security personnel, whom you'd run into from time to time in the original game, as well as in Opposing Force. Barney Calhoun, your character in Blue Shift, supposedly doesn't have the same academic background as Gordon Freeman, nor does he have the military training of Corporal Adrian Shephard, the protagonist of Opposing Force. In the context of the game, none of this really comes across--Barney runs extremely quickly (just like Gordon and Adrian) and can suffer an inordinate amount of damage (just like Gordon and Adrian). This makes sense in Half-Life, where you are protected by a state-of-the-art environment suit, as well as in Opposing Force, where you are a highly trained soldier. In Blue Shift, it's a stretch, and the only time you get the sense that you're actually supposed to be a down-to-earth security guard is in an early sequence in which you have to get your sidearm and pick up your security vest and helmet. Like in Half-Life and Opposing Force, your character never actually says a word during the course of Blue Shift. In Half-Life, this helps immerse you into the game. In Blue Shift, it's too bad, since the main appeal of Half-Life's security guards comes from their numerous, wry one-liners and other banter.\n\nLike Opposing Force, Blue Shift takes place during the same time frame as Half-Life. You start out heading in to work just as you would any other day, but things quickly go awry in the Black Mesa Research Facility. It's suddenly under siege, and as a member of its security force, you're tasked with defending the facility's scientists from aliens and also from government soldiers, who have come to do you in. In practice, you'll traverse the same sorts of dangerous levels that are found in the original game and Opposing Force. During the course of Blue Shift, you might catch a couple of clever references to both Opposing Force and the original game. These, along with a few other in-jokes, make for the most enjoyable parts of Blue Shift. The rest of it consists of a few fairly straightforward firefights, an obligatory jaunt to Xen (Half-Life's perennial parallel universe), and several jumping puzzles that manage to be just clever enough instead of annoying. There are no new challenges to be found, it's all over very quickly, and there isn't much point in revisiting the levels.\n\n\n\n\nBlue Shift's weapons may look different, but the difference is only skin-deep.\n\nHowever, you may find that once you've installed the High Definition pack, Blue Shift gives good reason to revisit the original Half-Life (as well as Opposing Force). This graphical enhancement increases the size of most of the texture maps found in the game and its expansion and also improves some of the 3D character models--you'll quickly notice that the scientists, security guards, and government soldiers all look more lifelike. The High Definition pack also changes all the weapon models from Half-Life. The most jarring of these changes is that Half-Life's terrific submachine gun has now been replaced by a full-on assault rifle that's functionally identical but looks a lot heftier and sounds even louder when it fires. Half-Life is almost three years old, so all of these graphical enhancements are helpful, though they still don't make Half-Life look like a new game--nor are many of the changes themselves very noticeable. Furthermore, these enhancements are entirely superficial--Half-Life will still play the same as before.\n\nIf you buy just one Half-Life-branded game besides Half-Life itself, then that game should be Blue Shift. You can always get Counter-Strike as a free download, and Opposing Force comes packaged with Blue Shift anyway. Don't be misled by the fact that Blue Shift doesn't require Half-Life: If for some terrible reason you don't actually have the original, then owning it should be your first priority. Besides, Blue Shift is actually best suited for those who own and enjoy the original Half-Life. These players will quickly find that Half-Life remains extremely enjoyable today and that the enhanced graphical touches in Blue Shift's High Definition pack make it fun to revisit some of the original game's incredible scenes for the umpteenth time. Otherwise, Blue Shift is a great value if you've never tried Opposing Force--an expansion pack that originally retailed for $10 more than Blue Shift's $30 retail price. However, if you've finished Opposing Force and already spent plenty of time with the original game, you'll find that Blue Shift doesn't have a lot to offer. It's much too short, and it has no multiplayer features--therefore, it won't satisfy your craving for more of the intense action that made Half-Life so remarkable. You can get a $10 rebate for Blue Shift if you've already bought Opposing Force, but that still doesn't make the underachieving Blue Shift worthwhile on its own.\n","timestamp_created":1423331673,"timestamp_updated":1423331673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14363532","author":{"steamid":"76561198043971033","num_games_owned":605,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1421289347},"language":"english","review":"I'll put it simply. Half-life Blue Shift was visually impressive and had some cool scripting when it came out. Besides that though, it's largely a dissapointment. It's not that the game isn't fun, or doesn't have it's moments-it does- but it doesn't fill the standard that Half-life and HL:OpFor set. Besides the overall game time and plot both being lacking, it also shoots itself in the foot by not including as many weapons or enemies. Only about half the arsenal is included (no energy weapons, missing a couple explosives, and no Xen/Race X weapons). While I don't fault this game for leaving out the Race X creatures, I DO MISS the Xen creatures (and human enemies) that fail to show up. You don't get to fight any mutated zombies (OpFor), Icthysaurs (underwater things), boss enemies, black ops or assassins, and you only fight a handful of grunts and the flying mini-Nihilanth things. The game is still enjoyable, but it's not highly recommendable.  If you're a HL fan or just craving a decent shooter however, perhaps this may appease you. 6/10","timestamp_created":1423286745,"timestamp_updated":1423286745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14360377","author":{"steamid":"76561198053570068","num_games_owned":1769,"num_reviews":137,"playtime_forever":147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":147,"last_played":1423267098},"language":"russian","review":"В свое время (чуть более 10 лет назад) запорол сейв в области спасения ученого из поезда.

A fairly short but decent expansion which gives us yet another perspective to the entire Black Mesa Incident from a different character.\n\nThis time the player takes on the role of Barney Calhoun, a security officer employed at the Black Mesa Research Facility and the man who has helped Gordon Freeman out of so many sticky and difficult situations. The game starts out with Barney Calhoun carrying out his duties and then being caught up in the Black Mesa Incident which, like Opposing Force, cleverly coincides with the original Half-Life’s storyline.\n\nWhat Gearbox Software does well is maintaining the atmosphere and world of the original Half-Life while providing the experience through the eyes of someone else who was involved in the story of the original Half-Life. For me, Blue Shift felt like the final game in the Penumbra series (Penumbra: Requiem) as it ends the first Half-Life game’s storyline in a fairly chilled and relaxing way without forcing the player to battle an end boss whilst providing a few situations where a puzzle needs to be solved.\n\nThe core gameplay is the same as it is for Half-Life and Opposing Force with the weapons and other items not really changing which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The health system is also the same with some slight changes as those that were in Opposing Force. Since security officers do not wear HEV suits, they cannot make use of any HEV suit charger units that are located around the facility. Instead the player must pick up security officer issued body armour vests and helmets to replenish their armour protection. Something that I’ve noticed about Blue Shift is that you will find an enormous amount of first aid packs around each chapter and this makes the game less challenging. The player’s flashlight seems to have been designed differently with the way light is dispersed in dark places which felt a lot more realistic.\n\nStructurally, the game is chaptered like the previous games and provides a fun, linear storyline that will keep you engaged and wanting to find out more. Barney Calhoun does not encounter any of the alien creatures of Race X as Adrian Shepherd did in Opposing Force, but does encounter hostility from the marines and the traditional Xen alien creatures.\n\nOverall, there is not much more that could be said about Half-Life: Blue Shift. It provides a new and interesting perspective to the storyline which leaves a lot of questions and few answers. For those who want to return to the events of the Black Mesa Incident and see the situation unfold from a different viewpoint then I highly recommend Blue Shift. I personally found it a joy to play and think it is just as good as Opposing Force.","timestamp_created":1421864858,"timestamp_updated":1421864858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14094903","author":{"steamid":"76561198143473595","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":130,"last_played":1421774476},"language":"french","review":"It's Half-life, but you play Barney (security agent) this time.

See Conclusion[/h1]\n\n[h1]NOTE:[/h1]\nAlso see my: \n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/70]Half-Life (1) Review[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/220]Half-Life 2 Review[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/50]Half-Life: Opposing Force Review[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/362890?tscn=1431108183]Black Mesa Review[/url]\n\n[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]\nHalf-Life: Blue Shift is a first-person action game by Gearbox Software and Valve and serves as the third official expansion to the Half-Life franchise.  Unlike Half-Life or Half-Life: Opposing Force, Blue Shift does not introduce new game mechanics; rather, it offers a new type of narrative storytelling through constant interactions with an NPC character (i.e., Dr. Rosenberg).\n\nIn this game, you step into the shoes of Black Mesa Security Guard and Clone Template Barney Calhoun, a man whose normal routine of offering beers and guarding doors is shattered with a catastrophic accident that opens the facility to an alien invasion and U.S. Military intervention (a direct result of Dr. Freeman's experiment from the first game).  As Barney Calhoun, you try to survive the alien invasion, protect the survivors, and escape the now doomed Black Mesa Research Facility.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n+ Good story (NO SPOILERS) that serves as the 'final link' that connects every story (Half-Life, Half-Life: Opposing Force and Half-Life: Decay) of the Black Mesa Incident together.\n+ Constant interaction with an NPC that is essential to the plot rather than for opening doors\n+ The first game in the franchise to introduce 'HD' content during its time\n+ Intense action as can be expected from a Half-Life game\n+ Satisfying puzzles\n+ Adaptive enemy AI, especially with the soldiers\n+ Great level design\n+ Barney can kill dangerous aliens and highly trained military soldiers wearing only a flak vest and an almost transparent plastic helmet as protection (He would be perfect in the Warhammer 40,000 universe as an Imperial Guardsman).\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- VERY SHORT and possibly the shortest game I ever played with only 3 hours of playtime on Hard Mode and Training Tutorial\n- Existence of bugs despite being 14 years old (Particularly a bug where you're unable to move)\n- No new weapons, enemy, or gameplay mechanics.\n- Most weapons from the first game were removed\n- Relatively easy (even on hard mode) as compared to the other games.  In my opinion, it is because acquiring 'armor' and health kits are a lot easier.\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\nStory and lore wise, Blue Shift is GOOD but other than that, it does not offer any new content aside from the new player perspective of the overall Half-Life Lore.  In my opinion, Blue Shift is not an expansion but more of a DLC (downloadable content) than anything else, which is not a bad thing by the way, especially one with a good story and fun action sequences.\n\nSo do you buy Blue Shift?  YES but DO NOT BUY Blue Shift alone!

When I first played half life 2, I was disapointed because it was so different from the original (though dont get me wrong, still a great game.) That being said, Half Life Blue Shift and Opposing Forces are great games because they take place at the same time as thr original and are that same original style and setting. In Blue Shift you play as the security gaurd Barney Calhoun, working your way through Black Mesa, and fighting against aliens and the marines. You see things that you didn't see as Gordon Freeman, which is exciting. So even though it took place at the same time as Half Life, it is still its own game. It is very short but if you loved half life you have to get this game. I highly recommend it, but I would also point out that Opposing Forces was significantly more fun than Blue Shift.","timestamp_created":1420848331,"timestamp_updated":1420848331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13908011","author":{"steamid":"76561198076936661","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":28,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1373533514},"language":"russian","review":"[i][b]Xуйня[/b][/i]","timestamp_created":1420807790,"timestamp_updated":1420807790,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.275123149156570435","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13899468","author":{"steamid":"76561198106288150","num_games_owned":1004,"num_reviews":205,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73,"last_played":1609532476},"language":"english","review":"Lame, broken ass game.

Thats about it.","timestamp_created":1420340243,"timestamp_updated":1420340243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13818651","author":{"steamid":"76561198094596629","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":847,"playtime_last_two_weeks":161,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1659852132},"language":"english","review":"not so good if you ask me. very short campaign, not much to do, same content as half life but HUD is blue.. 5/10","timestamp_created":1420328376,"timestamp_updated":1420328376,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13794929","author":{"steamid":"76561198011064539","num_games_owned":293,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":177,"last_played":1420235965},"language":"brazilian","review":"Curtinho mas bão","timestamp_created":1420236576,"timestamp_updated":1420236576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13793662","author":{"steamid":"76561198076029116","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1319,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":1475715601},"language":"english","review":"Every other security guard wants to buy you a beer.","timestamp_created":1420233010,"timestamp_updated":1420233010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540523290634155273","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13793303","author":{"steamid":"76561197989691101","num_games_owned":334,"num_reviews":75,"playtime_forever":163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":100,"last_played":1581457723},"language":"english","review":"Playing as security guard B.Calhoun,you will visit new places of Black Mesa Complex.\n\nSadly levels aren't very interesting.Gameplay is average due to lack of anything new(npcs,weapons)\n\nBut I won't say it is bad,because it's still atleast 3 hours of good fps gameplay you know from original Half-Life\n\nCrobwar is back,Gordon meakes few cameos.Instead of full game I would say it's good map pack for orignal game.\n\nBought it for 1 euro which was fair price,5 is way too much for such short game.\n\nI give 7/10 \n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1420231997,"timestamp_updated":1420231997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13772974","author":{"steamid":"76561198061432598","num_games_owned":332,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":527,"last_played":1396080440},"language":"english","review":"Excelent game, but short (in comparasion to HL, or even HL:Op4).\nI r8 8/8, can't h8.","timestamp_created":1420160963,"timestamp_updated":1420160963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540229856967926025","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13752230","author":{"steamid":"76561198159765700","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1490733868},"language":"english","review":"I would only reommend this game to someone whose played the Half-life or any other Half-life game before.  From the same friend that introduced me to the Half-life series, I also received knowledge of the splinter games to Half-life and the impression that this game would be about Barney. Wait... Calhoun is Barney? So, I wasn't lied to. Then why didn't any body refer to him as Barney. Where we suppose to know Barney as Calhoun? Regardless, Half-life: Blue Shift made me want to take back on quesioning whether Half-life was too long. Half-life: Blue Shift's brevity and instatenous action brought  an increase satisfaction for Gordon Freeman storyline. \n\nI suspect that the game was used to experiment with new mechanics for future games, relative to the release to this game. I admit a certain number of standstill problem solving took a large amount of my time. Fortunately, I didn't need any guides or cheat to figure them out, but that didn't change the very awkwardness of the resolutions. From the spand of 4 hours that it took to finish the game on normal, you can tell that a large portion of the consistented of more tactical problem solving versus rat-in-the-maze problem solving. I cannot argue since I enjoyed the process of \"How do I take care of these guys? Well, I seem to be safe in this corner and can shotgun any who pop through that doorway... Wait, they have grenades right now, don't they. Crap, speak of the DEVIL!\"\n\nAlthough I cannot think of a way to resolve this, I found the ending dissatisfying and unfulfilling. If not for the credits soon after, I would have thought I still had a chapter or two to still go, but without any closure for the game it ended. I also didn't care for the thrid wheel feel to the game. As Barney, You get to do so much, and carry the story to lead into the Half-life 2 saga. Yes, You see G-man, but much like Gordan Freeman, G-man remains behind the seams.\n\nMy overall thought is that I would not recommend this game. I cannot think of a reason to tell some \"yeah go get this game it has this, and that and so expands on what you would have known about the Half-life series.\" The game is not a bad game, but I cannot see myself telling someone that the game's worth their time.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this 5/10.","timestamp_created":1420085748,"timestamp_updated":1421428809,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13735496","author":{"steamid":"76561198083561522","num_games_owned":314,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":363,"last_played":1419893326},"language":"english","review":"I'm gonna be honest, I was confused who Barney was in HL2. He revealed himself and I thought \"... who exactly are you? Are you an enemy or not?\" Then I remember this game, Blue Shift. I remembered reading about this game and the character it spawned, so I paused HL2 for the moment and purchased Blue Shift. It was... decent to say the least. I think taking a character who didn't have a lick of screen time/potential story and making him the main character of his own spinoff is pretty hilarious. In a good way I might add. This game, however had a few really annoying glitches that almost ruined some aspects of the game for me. Everytime I would load after a death, the gun/weapon I was holding wouldn't stop shooting/attacking. While playing on hard mode, where I need every tiny bit of ammo I can get, made this much worse. Something I really love about this game was seeing Gordon at those random parts, those made the whole thing worth while. All and all, I really only recommend this game to fans of Half Life, if nothing else but to experience Barney's adventure.","timestamp_created":1420025286,"timestamp_updated":1420025375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13729652","author":{"steamid":"76561198145824088","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1581841112},"language":"russian","review":"Я люблю серию Half-Life, и всегда буду играть :)","timestamp_created":1419998892,"timestamp_updated":1419998892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503237724304199219","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13703472","author":{"steamid":"76561198161073925","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1642019316},"language":"english","review":"a short game like 5 hours long.good game\n","timestamp_created":1419905955,"timestamp_updated":1419905955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497942358255386353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y66/zMoCcJOjNA=="}
