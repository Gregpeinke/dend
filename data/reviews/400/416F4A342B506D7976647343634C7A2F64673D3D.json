Хотя, как по мне, это такая демо-версия, но я всё равно с большим удовольствием перепрошла её.

It's short by today's standards but that's because the game itself is more of a fleshed out tech demo than a AAA title.  That said, the premise of using portals to solve platforming and physics puzzles is SO good that it doesn't NEED to be more.  They didn't need to tack on an 80 hour epic storyline, level up system with skill trees, endless procedural crafting or whatever else companies think a game needs to be good.\n\nThat didn't stop Valve from going the extra mile, though. Instead of making a set of solid puzzles and calling it a day, they gave us the BEST antagonist I have ever seen.  At all.  The fact that the game is pretty repetative doesn't even sink in when GLaDOS's quirky chatter keeps you entertained.\n\nWhile these days (oh god, is this game really 10 years old already?) it seems like a small game with not enough meat on its bones, what's there is SO good it doesn't NEED more.
