Play's great off of steam, I do recommend this game if you like puzzles, it's not an action game so don't expect a call of duty experience, this is definetly a one of a kind game.  Even those it has been years since I played it, I picked it back up and got right into it, it's simple, fun, and can be played for short periods or long periods at a time.  And a huge plus is that I was able to use my xbox controller for this game.","timestamp_created":1533354307,"timestamp_updated":1533354307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43919723","author":{"steamid":"76561198157405807","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":904,"last_played":1549665867},"language":"german","review":"Great game, gotta play it if you want to to puzzle a bit.","timestamp_created":1533348059,"timestamp_updated":1533348059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533381223678588867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43919712","author":{"steamid":"76561198307643859","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":464,"last_played":1554061728},"language":"spanish","review":"ME ENCANTO !!!!!!","timestamp_created":1533347978,"timestamp_updated":1533347978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43919154","author":{"steamid":"76561198106327980","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1079,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":780,"last_played":1580626120},"language":"schinese","review":"断断续续10h+才通关，可能真的是手残+脑子不好使了，但依然不妨碍我吹爆这款游戏，夏促1折入，迄今为止它仍是我最爱的游戏。","timestamp_created":1533344330,"timestamp_updated":1533344330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43917806","author":{"steamid":"76561197969489829","num_games_owned":764,"num_reviews":281,"playtime_forever":998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":998,"last_played":1533275818},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 is Portal but double. \n\nYou play as Chell, a lady with a funny name. After killing GlaDOS at the end of Portal 1, Chell is brought back into the lab by a mysterious entity and is put into stasis for a long period of time.\nAbout the length of one Peter Jackson movie. \n\nBut some time later, Chell is awoken by a personality core named Wheatley, who is basically a robot designed to be annoying. \nEven voiced by Stephen Merchant. What are the chances? \nWheatley wants to help Chell escape, and after going through the overgrown and dilapidated facility, they run into an old friend.\n\nPortal 2 is all-around an upgrade over Portal 1. While Portal 1 could be beaten in 45 minutes to an hour, Portal 2 can be beaten in around 57 minutes and 15 seconds. I mean, if you're a super fast guy. It took me six hours, so don't worry.\nWormholes 2 made quite the stir when it was released in 2011, quickly becoming a fan favorite, I cant say cult classic because it sold, like, a billion million copies. \nThat's enough money to buy a PlayStation 3 and one game! \n\nNot to mention the amount of effort put into the sequel, not saying that Portal 1 was a slouch. Everything from the physics, to the story, to the graphics is a general upgrade. There are some quality of life changes like showing you where your portals are at all times. The lighting and textures have improved, and there are less noticeable source-engine things lying around like stock sounds and other Half Life 2 effects. \nWheatley is also really emotive, considering he's just a big ball with a blue eye. The way he moves and reacts makes him come off more like a Dreamworks or Pixar character rather than something you would see in Portal. \n\nConsidering all the hardcore memeing and tom foolery that happened when the game came out, I actually forgot that this game is actually...You know...Funny? Considering everything in between the jokes and events people actually hooked on to, I was surprised at how many times I actually ended up laughing by the end of it. Which is more than you can say for most games.\nOr kids falling over. \n\nThere is nothing funnier than kids falling over. \n\nOne of my favorite things about Portal 2 is just how much time you spend away from the test chambers. I would say that more than half of the game is spent mousing around the inner workings of Aperture Science. Its nice to be able to use the portal gun outside of a controlled environment and getting to explore the machinations of a long dead facility, uncovering it's secrets and even it's history. \nNot to mention more secrets to find, such as a portrait of an important character or the mysterious, and kind of unsettling, lairs of a unseen character who people call the “Ratman”. \n\nThe game is good in its own as a single player game. But much like that alarming growth that is spreading across my leg, Portal 2 is the game that keeps on giving!\n \nOutside of the single player campaign there is also a Cooperative mode that has it's own independent campaign featuring Atlas and P-Body, two robots built to replace life test subjects so that testing can continue on forever. \nThe Coop mode is different from the main campaign because. Well, there's two of you, and also you have to work together. A majority of the time someone has to either man a device or shoot portals for his buddy to use instead of just doing it by themselves. Communication is key and you can see it as a trust building exercise.\nNone of that I-fall-you-catch-me crap. I don't even trust another me to catch me. \n\nOther than the campaign and the coop, there is also a metric assload of community maps that you can just get from the Steam workshop. You can basically play this game forever. Or until you get bored, I guess.\n\nOr you run out of maps, you psycho. \n\nPortal 2 is good, pretty good actually. I hadn't played the game since its initial release in 2011, so I went into the game with a mostly clear expectation. Portal 2 is fun, has enough extra content to keep you going, and doesn't wear out it's welcome like other games are prone to do. \n\nI give Portal 2 a big thumbs up and also this chip I found in my suit pocket.\n\nI lied, I'm eating the chip. \n\nKetchup used to be sold as medicine. \n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7124597/]Join the curator, where we don't kill for good or evil, but to satiate our eternal bloodlust.
