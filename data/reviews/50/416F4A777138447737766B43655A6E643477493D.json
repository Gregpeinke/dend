I haven't finished Opposing Force, and I refuse to. I can look past some of the problems, mostly the graphics and animations, but the fundamental gameplay is just terrible, even compared to Half Life, which I think hasn't aged too well.\n\nAny praise I can give for new weapons, new enemies, and new environments, is meagre in comparison to just how painful an experience this is.\n\nThere is a ridiculous amount of platforming, which I don't really mind, but that would be a massive turn off for some.\n\nHalf Life has a few too many weapons, so Gearbox decided to add more to fix this problem. This did not work. Half Life's gunplay was never its strongest suit, and the weapons here have most of the same problems.\n\nYou're dependent on AI characters to progress at certain points, but their pathfinding breaks if you get more than 10 feet away from them.\n\nIt's not hard - it's straight up unfair. I stopped playing when I got to the point where your put in a pitch black maze, you can only see 10 feet ahead of you even with your Night Vision Goggles, and the maze is filled with powerful enemies.\n\nI didn't have too many ammo problems, but health and suit charge are very rare. To top this off, the Autosave is very relaxed, requiring frequent saving or massive losses of time and effort.\n\nI hope Crowbar Collective could do something with this for a Black Mesa-esq re-do, but I'm not counting on it. I'm going to go back to pulling my own teeth out, because it was less painful than this.","timestamp_created":1624481376,"timestamp_updated":1624481376,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94228627","author":{"steamid":"76561198053396514","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1624468690},"language":"english","review":"It's green Half-Life","timestamp_created":1624469302,"timestamp_updated":1624469302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":17,"weighted_vote_score":"0.771669209003448486","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94209642","author":{"steamid":"76561198063279547","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":532,"last_played":1624440588},"language":"polish","review":"W pytę","timestamp_created":1624440651,"timestamp_updated":1624440651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94200110","author":{"steamid":"76561198965272994","num_games_owned":337,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":309,"last_played":1624420383},"language":"english","review":"very fast paced and satisfying shooter\nbetter then the original game if you ask me","timestamp_created":1624420618,"timestamp_updated":1624420618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94198557","author":{"steamid":"76561198967667322","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":377,"last_played":1629576043},"language":"english","review":"It took me longer to beat it than most.

Причём \"взглянуть глазами\" в самом буквальном смысле, как и в оригинале, повествование выстроено таким образом, что игрок всегда видит ровно то же самое, что и персонаж,\n\nГрафика и геймплей примерно такие же, как в оригинале, и я не буду останавливаться на них отдельно. Что ещё важнее, левелдизайн тоже столь же хорош, как и там. А продолжительность примерно в два раза меньше.\n \nВ остальном же, как любили писать игрожуры в нулевых, игра сделана по принципу \"тех же щей, да погуще налей\".\nВрагов намного больше, как по разнообразия, так и по концентрации. Хотя в описании и заявлено, что главный герой отправлен для устранения Гордона Фримена, сразиться с ним не доведётся, и даже воевать с охранниками комплекса не нужно. Солдаты HECU, понятное дело, наши союзники. Но сражаться придётся не только с монстрами из мире Зен, но и с чёрными оперативниками, которые по неизвестной причине начали обернулись против солдатиков, а также с пришельцами из загадочной расы Икс, в больших количествах пролезшими в наш мир уже после того, как Фримен отправился в Зен. \n\nЗаметно расширился и арсенал игрока. Помимо стандартного оружия из основной игры Шепарду доступно мощное армейское вооружение (пулемёт и снайперская винтовка), а также высокотехнологичные прототипы, разработанные земными учёными, и живое оружие из иных миров. Особенно порадовали ручной барнакл и портальная пушка.\n\nИгра за Шепарда слегка отличается от игры за Фримена. У него нет навороченного скафандра, зато имеется специальный бронежилет, который тоже можно подзаряжать энергией.  Так что по ощущениям Шепард немного хрупче, но при этом мощнее Фримена. Вместо фонарика у него прибор ночного виденья. И на уровнях довольно часто встречаются солдаты, пропустившие эвакуацию, которые охотно встают под командование Шепарда и оказывают ощутимую поддержку в бою.\n\nЧто очень радует, в аддоне исправлены те немногочисленные недостатки, что были в оригинале. Перекрестие прицела из бледно жёлтого стало зелёным, и теперь его всегда отлично видно. И хотя главные герой, вроде бы, тоже по прежнему по умолчанию не ходит а довольно быстро бегает, это почему-то не слишком мне мешало.

Bu eklenti Half-Life'taki birtakım soru işaretlerini giderdiği gibi beraberinde bazı yenilikleri de getiriyor. Oyunun hikayesi Half-Life ile aynı zaman diliminde geçiyor, hatta bir bölümde Gordon Freeman'ı da görme şansı (Oyuncu hızlı olduğu takdirde Gordon Freeman'ı öldürebiliyor.) yakalıyoruz. Hikayede Half-Life'ta karşımıza çıkan ve Black Mesa çalışanları ile uzaylıları öldürmekle görevli \"HECU\" (Hazardous Environment Combat Unit) askeri ekibinden Adrian Shephard isimli onbaşıyı kontrol ediyoruz. Oyunun başlangıcında Shephard, ekibi ile helikopterdeyken helikopterin düşmesi ile bayılır. Gözlerini açtığında Shephard kendini Black Mesa'da bulur, durumu ise kendisini kurtaran bilim adamından öğrenir. Shephard'ın aşması gereken tek engel uzaylılar değildir, çünkü HECU'nun durumu kontrol altına alamadığını gözlemleyen hükümet, askerleri Black Mesa'dan geri çeker ve işleri yoluna koymaları için Black Mesa'ya özel eğitimli infazcılar gönderir, bu infazcıların görevi Black Mesa'daki her türlü canlıyı (orada kalan askerler ve bilim adamları da dahil) etkisiz hale getirmektir. Bu noktadan sonra Shephard, yer yer yalnız ilerleyerek yer yer Black Mesa'da karşılaştığı diğer askerlerden/bilim adamlarından yardım alarak oradan kurtulmaya çalışır. Hikayenin sonunda Shephard, Xen gezegeninden gelen oldukça güçlü bir yaratığı alt eder ve sonra karşısında G-Man'i bulur. G-Man Shephard'a Black Mesa'nın bir \"utanç\" olduğunu ve \"şu an kendi kendisi ile ilgilendiğini\" söyler, G-Man bunu söyledikten sonra Black Mesa'yı yok eden patlamanın sesi gelir. Ardından Shephard'ı kastederek \"bazı tanıklar olduğunu\" ve onu korumak konusunda kararsız kaldığını, her ne kadar Shephard gibi bir devlet görevlisinin gizliliğin öneminin farkında olduğunu bilse de \"işverenlerinin güvenen kişiler olmadığını\" söyler. Daha sonra G-Man, Shephard'ı \"kimseye zarar veremeyeceği ve kimsenin de ona zarar veremeyeceği bir yere göndermeye karar verdiklerini\" söyleyip, onu uzayda bir yere hapseder ve hikaye sonlanır. Opposing Force bir eklenti olmasına rağmen Half-Life'taki soru işaretlerine çok güzel bir şekilde açıklık getiriyor, ayrıca Black Mesa faciasına Half-Life'taki düşmanlarımızdan olan HECU ekibinin üyelerinden birinin gözünden de tanıklık etmiş oluyoruz. Ek olarak hikaye sunumunun da Half-Life'a göre biraz daha geliştirilmiş olduğunu düşünüyorum. Mesela bir yerde özel infazcılar kamyonetlerinden silahlarını indirirken birbirlerine \"neden HECU askerlerin becerisizliklerinin cezasını biz çekiyoruz\" tarzında yakındıklarını ve oraya geliş sebeplerini açıkladıklarını görüyoruz. Buna benzer birkaç kısım daha eklentide bulunuyor. Half-Life'ta bunlar yoktu, varsa bile daha azdı diye hatırlıyorum. Hikaye sunumunun kötü yanlarından birisi ise ana karakterinin sesinin ve kişiliğinin yine olmaması. Oynanış olarak da yenilikler yapılmış, yeni düşman ve silah çeşitleri eklenmiş ve sadece 1-2 tane değiller. Eklentiyi oynarken Half-Life'ta görmediğim birçok uzaylı düşman çeşidi ile karşılaştım, ayrıca portal atan bir silah ve ağır makineli tüfek gibi yeni eklenen silahlar da bulunuyor, Half-Life'ın bile düşman ve silah çeşitliliği konusunda oldukça iyi olduğunu göz önünde bulundurursak, daha fazla çeşitlilik eklemek Opposing Force'u çok başarılı kılmış. Kontroller Half-Life'taki gibi zaman zaman sinir bozucu olabiliyor, yine de bunun çok büyük bir sorun olduğunu söyleyemem. Bölüm tasarımı olarak eklenti aynı Half-Life gibi çeşitli ve eğlenceli, sürekli aynı atmosfer olmadığı gibi tasarımlar sıkıcı da değil. Grafiksel olarak pek bir gelişme yok, performans olarak Half-Life gibi stabil. Oynadığım süre boyunca herhangi bir hata ile de karşılaşmadım. Half-Life Opposing Force, Half-Life'ı sevenler için biçilmiş kaftan.","timestamp_created":1623335038,"timestamp_updated":1623335038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93505528","author":{"steamid":"76561198990599820","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":349,"last_played":1595984817},"language":"english","review":"otis is the perfect human being","timestamp_created":1623318343,"timestamp_updated":1623318343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93505434","author":{"steamid":"76561198866427993","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":7384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1411,"last_played":1624525186},"language":"turkish","review":"En iyi Half Life ek paketi.","timestamp_created":1623318133,"timestamp_updated":1623318133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93503536","author":{"steamid":"76561199162563696","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":930,"last_played":1658939659},"language":"russian","review":"мноа аружия афыгинная клутая рикамендую","timestamp_created":1623314592,"timestamp_updated":1623314592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93499785","author":{"steamid":"76561198148317197","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1652304832},"language":"english","review":"Honestly more diverse in terms of weaponry than the original half life.
