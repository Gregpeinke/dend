Когда разработчики выпустили первую часть Bioshock они разделились на две команды где первая команда начала делать вторую часть, а вторая команда та самая которая в основном и сделала первый Bioshock начала делать \"бесконечную\" (Infinite) часть. Игра уж сильно отдалилась от предшествующих серий и стала \"самобытной\". Есть как и плюсы в виде: \"аэростатов, яркого и красочного мира, Элизабет\", так и минусов(лично на мой взгляд, т.к для кого то это может минусом и не показаться) :  казуальность - на средней сложности проблем почти никаких нет все всегда в избытке(патроны, здоровье и что то типа маны) ещё и в придачу появился магнитный щит(который сначала примет на себя урон), чтоб не заскучать лучше выбрать высокий уровень сложности, управление мышкой - такое как будто эмулирует движение с геймпада, настройка чувствительности здесь слабо поможет. Самая главная фишка игры это конечно сюжет. Он такой же бомбический как и в первой. При всем при этом \"Белые западные люди\" снизошли до русских Иванов и в стимовской версии игры ПОЯВИЛСЯ РУССКИЙ ИНТЕРФЕЙС И СУБТИТРЫ кроме конечно озвучки, но это не беда добрые альтруисты сами сделали озвучку которую можно найти в сообществе.","timestamp_created":1568296381,"timestamp_updated":1568296381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55075970","author":{"steamid":"76561198117657199","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":133,"last_played":1597367195},"language":"english","review":"I feel like this game still holds up and is a great shooter from what I've seen so far.","timestamp_created":1568294253,"timestamp_updated":1568294253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55074989","author":{"steamid":"76561198873886894","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":516,"last_played":1567840686},"language":"schinese","review":"第一次玩还是初中，在一家有Xbox的黑游戏厅里，当时就被那种画风迷住了，但是那是阉割版，没字幕啥的，关卡也不完整，玩的我是稀里糊涂。前段时间偶然发现，果断连DLC一起入手，一口气通了主线，还是稀里糊涂，在网上找了讲解视频，好歹是整明白了，可偏偏手痒，点开了DLC海葬的视频，好了，媳妇没了，直接把游戏卸了。\nPS：4啥时候出？","timestamp_created":1568288365,"timestamp_updated":1568288365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55073886","author":{"steamid":"76561197996190623","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":74,"playtime_forever":1208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1208,"last_played":1568238602},"language":"english","review":"Highly recommended because Elizabeth, art style and powers are fun and well done.

I guess they want to let the fan theorize about a lot of things but it's sometimes forced. Fortunately, it does not ruin or make it a bad game.\n\nGUNPLAY (this is my major critic): let's get it straight, it is BY FAR the worst AAA gameplay I've ever seen. It's not complicated like Monster Hunter/Dark Souls and it's not skill based like Arma or Hunt Showdown\nIT'S CLUNKY. Running is not responsive, gun sounds and recoil aren't that impressive and finally it's not fun like Doom (where there's WoW moments like executions or defeating bosses).\nWhile the powers are fun, the base gunning is not. Take Dishonored - the gameplay is good and powers add to it, while here only the powers are solid.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSave from the latter storyline (DLC) and the gunplay (in the main game) it's a good game.  \n\n","timestamp_created":1568280565,"timestamp_updated":1568280565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55072753","author":{"steamid":"76561198852030259","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":773,"last_played":1597840805},"language":"schinese","review":"我永远喜欢伊丽莎白","timestamp_created":1568272057,"timestamp_updated":1568272057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55072497","author":{"steamid":"76561198053513269","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":794,"last_played":1575828979},"language":"english","review":"\"Bioshock: Infinite\" is a First-Person Shooter.  It is absolutely totally gorgeous to look at. I'm not sure why I thought this would be an RPG, but know that there are absolutely no RPG elements or skill trees here. It is just about as basic a shooter as you can get, in spite of how dressed up it is with busy environments, and slow, lengthy conversations (that never seem to end) as well as soaring aerial movement. Elevator rides are really long.\n\nIn many ways \"Bioshock: Infinite\" will remind us of a stripped-down instalment of Fallout because of its steampunk world of gramophones and 30s era posters interspersed throughout a technologically advanced floating city and lots of Pipboy like characterizations in the imagery. But all you can do in \"Bioshock: Infinite\" is shoot and move, really, and with a whole lot more moving than shooting, even the shooter part of this game feels weak. Just 2 gun slots and 5 \"salt\" powers, and almost nobody to shoot at for much of the game, make this adventure lose its way despite its soaring ideals.\n\n\"Bioshock: Infinite\" presents a visually rewarding and interesting (if not familiar) world. It tells a story. It is ambitious. But it's a bore.","timestamp_created":1568269831,"timestamp_updated":1569437291,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.365969359874725342","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55072031","author":{"steamid":"76561198815038457","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":258,"last_played":1594058889},"language":"schinese","review":"我打架的时候都在翻垃圾桶","timestamp_created":1568266145,"timestamp_updated":1568266145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55071966","author":{"steamid":"76561198367906919","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":940,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":275,"last_played":1568516983},"language":"schinese","review":"好游戏","timestamp_created":1568265618,"timestamp_updated":1568265618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55070809","author":{"steamid":"76561198179355215","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":779,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":779,"last_played":1568253533},"language":"english","review":"Damn.","timestamp_created":1568255616,"timestamp_updated":1568255616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55070645","author":{"steamid":"76561198401311972","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":722,"last_played":1568252960},"language":"spanish","review":"El mejor juego que he jugado, no soy capaz de explicarlo de otra forma ni de explayarme más, jugarlo y buscar cosas por internet y disfrutad, dios que puto juego, no puede ser tan bueno","timestamp_created":1568254442,"timestamp_updated":1568254442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55070487","author":{"steamid":"76561198065327164","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":919,"last_played":1585267404},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game.
