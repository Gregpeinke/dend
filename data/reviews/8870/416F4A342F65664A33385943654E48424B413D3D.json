This is BioShock in name only - the story and setting do not even relate to the rest of the franchise, other than a couple of minor similarities and a pointless (spoiler alert) cameo at the end. The DLC also attempts to shoehorn the stories together - poorly, but really I don't know why this even bothers to be called \"BioShock\". It is entirely dissimilar, and when you take away this being a sequel (since it isn't), what you're left with is really just a boring shooter with a couple of interesting but repetative mechanics, all of which were much-better executed in the first two games.\n\nAll that said, the non-gamey elements (for example, the opening sequence, everything up until you immediately need to kill or be killed), are completely excellent. It really set me up for a let down, as it had such a strong start. The story itself (for the main game, not the DLC) is interesting right up until the end (which.. to put it lightly, is awful). If this did not have the BioShock name, or the poorly-copied BioShock-like elements, I probably would have enjoyed it more.\n\nAlso skylines. Those things are completely stupid.","timestamp_created":1403406923,"timestamp_updated":1403407327,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10645362","author":{"steamid":"76561198086876925","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108,"last_played":1435543508},"language":"english","review":" This game cured my cancer, very realistic, has great cutscenes, the ending made me convert to a muslim. 9/11","timestamp_created":1403406441,"timestamp_updated":1403406441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560439586639404297","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10645287","author":{"steamid":"76561198088833679","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30,"last_played":1572065736},"language":"english","review":"Haven't gotten to far into this game, but I can honestly say it is really fun and worth the money, whether on sale or not, so buy it.

I have never played a game that is so visually vibrant, colourful and downright beautiful as Bioshock Infinite, my eyes felt like they were orgasming everytime I gazed upon its glory.\nThe BioShock series has always produced quality games that are rich with story and content......or so I've been told. I'm also ashamed to say that I have not played the prievous two games in the franchise. But I can assure you after playing Infinite for 10 minutes I put both BioShock 1 and 2 straight onto my wishlist. Obviously I'm being biased, but I don't see how the  predecessors could top Infinite in content, gameplay and of course storyline.\nThe main protagonist Booker Dewitt, voiced by the talented Troy Baker (who has just about provided his voice to every notable gaming franchise on the planet, go check his IMDB page and see for yourself) has been assigned one task, \"bring us the girl and wipe away the debt\" sounds simple right? Set in the city of Columbia, a floating Utopia that resides higher than the clouds, quite the contrast when comapred with Rapture, the underwater paradise. This venture develops into a story that's so addictive and interesting that you'll be finding it hard not to complete it in a single sitting. But try to space it out and make it last, something my good friend Lar failed to do.\nThe game is catergorised as a FPS and I'd class it as one of the best FPS games of 2013. The firefights you're a part of are so fun and exciting, thanks to the game mechanics and the badass artillery. The game features bog-standard foot soldiers as the games primary enemies, however there is a whole host of wierd and wonderful adversarys like the Handyman who looks like it has the body structure of a mechanical gorilla with a spud for a head to the Patriots who come in a fabulous array of models (I feel like I'm hosting  a catwalk shoot) ranging from Abraham Lincoln to George Washington. The foes that I personally found the wierdiest and definitely the freakiest are the 'Boys of Silence', trust me you won't forget your encounter. \nAlongside Booker, you have Elizabeth who acts as your companion throughout the majority of the game, although she doesn't attack enemies, she sure is handy to have in your company. Elizabeth helps by tossing you health, ammo and money when you desperately need them. But Elizabeth do you have to throw money my way when I'm in the middle of a shootout? Despite that , Elizabeth is definitely one of the greatest companions I've ever come across in a game. She's just so damn adorable. Personally I hate games where you have to protect companions constantly to a point where you actually forget the initial objective, a little game called Resisdent Evil 4 springs to mind. However Elizabeth is unlike most followers as she can take care of herself and avoid danger entirely. Which makes me wonder, do the enemies just go by the rule of 'no hitting girls' or does Elizabeth use her feminine charms to her advantage? Hmmmmmm. Lastly, the character that I find most memorable is The Songbird. Songbird acts as Elizabeth's guardian and protector, stopping at nothing to ensure her safety (Watch out Mr. DeWitt).  The Songbird's shriek is one that will make your hairs stand on end, pierce your ear drums and stay with you forever. You'll know when he's closing in.\nThere is one thing I must cover before I conclude this review of BioShock Infinite and that  is the mind blowing ending to the game. Don't worry I won't spoil it, but I have never been so dazzeled and shocked by an ending to a game, until I finished Infinite. I place BioShock Infinite at the top of the best endings to any game in the history of games, it'll leave you wide eyed, gaping mouthed and dumb struck. And so I recommend BioShock Infinite to anyone who enjoys quality entertainment. To be honest Infinite's conclusion blew my mind so much that I'm still picking up the fragments, even as I write this review.","timestamp_created":1403378121,"timestamp_updated":1403378121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500998020172119141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10629241","author":{"steamid":"76561198027717294","num_games_owned":494,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2930,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2916,"last_played":1416023424},"language":"english","review":"came for waifus, stayed to eat toilet taters","timestamp_created":1403377806,"timestamp_updated":1403377806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10629082","author":{"steamid":"76561198095381371","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":986,"last_played":1501682599},"language":"english","review":"Truly one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, both in term of plot and apperance.

Einfach ein solides und einfaches Egoshooter Erlebnis.\n\nStory und Characktere sind mit der größte Pluspunkt an diesem Spiel. Mich hat die Story von der ersten Sekunde an mitgerissen und bis zum Ende nicht mehr losgelassen. Vor allem mein Beschützerinstinkt für Elizabeth wurde immer wieder auf harte Probem gestellt und man fühlt sich im Laufe des Spiels echt dazu verpflichtet alles für dieses kleine süße Mädel zu tun.\n\nMein Fazit ein absoluter muss Titel für Leute die an einem soliden Egoshooter mit einer Hollywood reifen Story interessiert sind.","timestamp_created":1403376693,"timestamp_updated":1403376794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10628339","author":{"steamid":"76561198107504929","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":875,"last_played":1436558086},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая!","timestamp_created":1403376652,"timestamp_updated":1403376652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504727602005004883","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10627560","author":{"steamid":"76561197998431025","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":801,"last_played":1467340910},"language":"english","review":"Worthy playing it!","timestamp_created":1403375725,"timestamp_updated":1403375725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10627185","author":{"steamid":"76561198091310162","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1609,"last_played":1404026760},"language":"english","review":"When I started playing this game I had no idea of I should expect, I had never play any Bioshock game and I didn't know anything about the story, hell I didn't even know what was Songbird, but I must say I fell for everything about this game.

I.E. you can make a good bit of progress and still have a good ways to go to the next save.

Again not a biggy, in reality the game generally provides the right type of weapon for the fights you are getting into.\n\nI thorougly enjoyed the game, and just purchased the DLC which is downloading as i'm typing this.\nI will update after playing the DLC, but expect it will be just as polished as the base game is.\nSo far the Bioshock series, Half-life series, Portal 1&2, and Metro series rank as my favorites in the last 5 years.\nThose are going to be hard to beat, next up I think I will be trying the Far Cry series, have heard good things about it.","timestamp_created":1403368477,"timestamp_updated":1403368477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10621571","author":{"steamid":"76561197962850838","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":13424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9397,"last_played":1598075260},"language":"english","review":"i liked the original better but damn the detail in this game. still amazing tho, looking forward to the dlcs.","timestamp_created":1403368388,"timestamp_updated":1403368388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10621419","author":{"steamid":"76561198090215324","num_games_owned":480,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":1157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":709,"last_played":1449264773},"language":"english","review":"amazing","timestamp_created":1403368175,"timestamp_updated":1403368175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10621003","author":{"steamid":"76561198046619604","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":131,"last_played":1430679592},"language":"english","review":"Very fun worth the money","timestamp_created":1403367579,"timestamp_updated":1403367579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10620930","author":{"steamid":"76561198130270477","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1270,"last_played":1404907776},"language":"english","review":"Best Bioshock and 7 th in 2013 best games games xD","timestamp_created":1403367461,"timestamp_updated":1403367461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10620521","author":{"steamid":"76561198076976720","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":856,"last_played":1463607581},"language":"english","review":"I guess you could say i enjoyed it infinitly...","timestamp_created":1403366878,"timestamp_updated":1403366878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10620416","author":{"steamid":"76561198120460179","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2918,"last_played":1590087970},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is an amazingly beautiful game, has a wonderful soundtrack, with a great story, and awesome characters that make you love the game to the very end.
