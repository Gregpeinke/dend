That caught me off-guard.\n\nIn 2007, I'd heard all the hype about this being the next great RPG.  Just coming off Oblivion (which I'd played obsessively), I was so excited for Two Worlds!\n\nWell, I played it about 30 minutes, was horrendously disappointed, laughed at it a bit, and gave up.  It's very pretty.  That's about all I have to say about it.\n\nRecently, seeing all the positive (??) reviews for the game, I grabbed it for $2.  Well, I wish I had my money back.  I gave it another try.  If there is redeeming value in this game, I can't find it.  The combat is awful, it's buggy, the dialog is laughable...\n\nTwo Worlds II, on the other hand, is actually underrated.  It's a lot of fun.  That's another reason I gave this game a second shot.  The sequel is so much fun, despite not exactly being brilliant, so maybe I missed something in the original?\n\nWell, again, if I'm missing something, I can't find it.  I have a pretty high tolerance for crappy RPGs, but I can't tolerate this one.","timestamp_created":1398739559,"timestamp_updated":1398739559,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571019530296325684","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9964850","author":{"steamid":"76561198121458519","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1744,"last_played":1399719047},"language":"spanish","review":"Gran juego  , merece la pena jugar un poco de rpg  .

I want to, very badly, but I cannot. Yes, even for $2.50, not worth it. The Last Remnant is cheaper and a better challenge, no lie. Anyway, this is why this classic should be laid to rest.\n\nBefore I could even play the game I ha to download a special driver update because my Windows 7 cannot outwardly play this game. This is despite it being RECOMMENDED as a OS by STEAM. Fail. After the first fifteen minutes was scouring the internet for information I fnally got into the game. Two Worlds was made in 2007, so I forgave the awkward character creation system and lackluster options in hair styles and colors. Even the \"great for its time\" graphic rendering. For me, however, the big let down came when we got to gameplay.\n\nAnyone else take notice that it uses Diablo I font type? Like to the \"T\", I wonder if they paid for that font? Anyway, the voice acting began to remind me of a bad early 90's dubbed anime. The actors kept missing inflections of words and botching their lines 'emotionally' and it was just the opening scene! I get to my first objective, kill a few baddies and gain xp and again bad things happen. Three of them come at me, I fire a fireball at the first one then go to swap targets to attack the encroaching second baddie. Wait, how do you change targets? I almost die trying to figure this out and use the awkward \"Q: jump forward, E: jump backward\" dynamic to slay and burn my enemies to proper pulps and ashes.  Afterwards I take a quick moment to alt-tab to Google to find my answer. The answer? You cannot swap targets. Wait, what? Excuse me? A game that requires me to focus attacks and fight multiple monsters not only hasn't figured out how to \"jump and direct\" at the same time but doesn't have a simple TARGETING feature?\n\nI'm sure this game was great in 2007, the original Final Fantasy was groundbreaking. Now a days, however, there's so much more that could be and should have been done to this game. The dynamic of spell making and reputation systems are great, but it's really hard to get to that part of this game when it fumbles over every other step. I have Two Worlds II GOTY on my PS3 and a lot of these issues WERE handled. This is why, 2007 was a great year for TW, but not 2014 and not even for $2.50.","timestamp_created":1398376029,"timestamp_updated":1398376029,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488124340772628784","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9918897","author":{"steamid":"76561198037126760","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":100,"last_played":1403178730},"language":"english","review":"I do not recommend this game.\nIve played a few hours of it and i have hit so many bugs.

The animations might be a bit ropey but the visuals aren't too bad. The combat could have been done better and feels a bit dated, using the bow is pretty poor, but if you can look beyond it's faults there is a huge game for the tiny price.\n Always liked the way you can combine matching items to boost them up (mouse over them in the inventory and if they match they turn green, then just drag 'n' drop). I would suggest using the 'jump-back' key to avoid enemy attacks and survive combat for longer though, especially at the start, and carry a mix of slashing, piercing and bashing weapons with different elemental upgrades. Horses have their own inventory, just stand next to them and get the panel up, use these to solve your storage problems by gathering a few around a teleport site. Doing this and having different ones for different item types makes it easier to collect armour sets etc and to keep matching items to combine them.\n   Huge world, loads of locations to discover, tons of loot, vast number of quests, hacking down creatures while on horseback, if you want an epic rpg experience and give it the chance it deserves you'll soon find yourself ignoring it's failings and find a good game, get it at sale price and you can't go wrong.","timestamp_created":1398158177,"timestamp_updated":1398158616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9898275","author":{"steamid":"76561198023502495","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":116,"last_played":1489064567},"language":"french","review":"Si le jeu crash a démarrage installez le fix N'vidia Physx (carte Amd aussi) \nhttp://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.12.1031-legacy-driver.html\n\nBon jeu ;)\n","timestamp_created":1398157199,"timestamp_updated":1398157199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506984412670135498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9897829","author":{"steamid":"76561198086644089","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1398751558},"language":"english","review":"GG","timestamp_created":1398150680,"timestamp_updated":1398186916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.448623567819595337","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9897800","author":{"steamid":"76561197980653014","num_games_owned":489,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":392,"last_played":1436119841},"language":"english","review":"One of the worst games ever made.

BUGS. HOLY MOTHER OF GOD, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. It's like an infestation of glitches of every kind: graphical (I'll talk about that later.), gameplay, combat and some are even game-breaking. Walk up stairs,  open a chest, and never walk down the stairs again due to the magical power of floating over noble gasses gained in the 11 seconds you spent raiding the poor farmer's pantry. Luckily, the game keeps a good list of autosaves to avoid these issues.\n\nSecond biggest problem: the visuals are horrendous. I was walking through what I thought was a field of grass and happiness, when suddenly...bamboo. A whole forest of it, and I was walking through the center of the mighty wilds without even noticing. It took the game 10 minutes to process the enviroment fully. I could understand this if you were playing Mass Effect 3 on a Commodore 64, but with these extremely out-dated and pixely graphics, it should take less than 5 seconds on an average non-gaming computer.\n\nOh, and don't bother talking to that drunk guy in Four Stones Village. His voice acting is even worse than the cook in the army camp named Bodlo, wh speaks in 3rd person and has the voice of a pig that was injected with both steriods and female hormones.\n\nWith the bad parts aside, lets talk about why this game is actually worth the $10.00 asking price. Let's be posh and give you a list of blunt statements:\n\n- ALMOST 600 ARMOUR SETS, each with individual pieces: helmet, gauntlets, legs, torso, and boots.\n- 200 different weapons\n- Decent character customization (Though more hair options would be nice, other than just the 12 flavours of short available in 9 shades of brown.)\n- Very easy to pick up and play.\n- Puns of Damage. And lots of them. Some of them are even tolerable!\n- Large open world, with tons of shiny loot, though I wish more of it could be placed in your house...which you can't have.\n\nOver all, the hardcore gamer will find nothing of interest here. Fans of western RPG's will find an interesting mix of complete control over your character's destiny, and terrible, game breaking bugs such as randomly dying when you pick a lock to... \nA TENT?

Questo gioco mi ha fatto passare dall'esaltazione alla noia, dal divertimento al rimanere basito per svariate cose, più volte, in una sola partita. Ho il presentimento che sia un gioco con un progetto ambiziosissimo dietro, riuscito come un gioco mediocre per motivi di budget o forse per semplice pigrizia.\n\nIl mondo è piuttosto ben realizzato per i tempi, ha i pregi e i difetti dei giochi suoi contemporanei, è bello da esplorare, le città sono abbastanza variegate tra di loro, ma non c'è \"molto da guardare\", non sprona all'esplorazione di ogni singolo angolo, perché in fondo non ce n'è motivo, se non per trovare la solita cassa saccheggiabile.\n\nCi sono quest molto belle, altre invece ridondanti, alcune side quest si accoppiano bene con la main quest e altre sono costruite molto bene sul mondo immaginario del gioco, la maggior parte peraltro. Missioni secondarie di sorprendente qualità, forse manca un pò di quantità. Mancano quasi totalmente le scelte, se ne possono fare molte poche e non influiscono DAVVERO sul gioco, salvo faide tra associazioni/gilde/clan, che nel più dei casi si concludono con l'annientamento di una delle due fazioni. Sistema di reputazione presso le fazioni interessante, ma probabilmente \"sprecato\", c'è anche qualche bug/omissione dei programmatori che permette di farla franca in alcuni casi: ho ammazzato la guardia del cancello in un insediamento, mi sarei aspettato l'odio del mondo intero come succede ad esempio in elder scrolls, invece non solo nessuno ha detto niente, ma il capoclan mi ha pure accolto in privato per discutere dei loro affari (lol).\n\nMain quest che inizia col piede giusto, convince (se non addirittura costringe, ma a mio modo di vedere è positiva come cosa!) ad esplorare il mondo, o per lo meno i luoghi più importanti, ad interessarti di tutto ciò che sta dietro; la ho giudicata positivamente per la maggior parte del tempo, finché non mi son trovato di fronte ad alcune cose che mi han fatto concludere che il gioco è stato realizzato con fretta.\n\n<SPOILER>\n\nPRIMO:\nSi deve raggiungere una città nel gioco, ashos mi pare, dove si trova uno degli oggetti da raccogliere per la main quest. Tale oggetto fa anche da custode religioso per gli abitanti della città, e frena gli orchi da eseguire un assedio con olocausto umano. Ecco, NON IMPORTA cosa voi facciate, potete radere al suolo un continente intero (continente che ci terrei a sottolineare per lo più vuoto, proprio vuoto, come un mondo curato a metà, da una parte molto bene, dall'altra trascurato), uccidere ogni orco sul pianeta, NON IMPORTA, la città viene invasa lo stesso dagli orchi nell'istante in cui voi poggiate le mani su quella fottuta reliquia.\n\nfalliscono quest all'istante (per cui se volete quel poco di xp/ricompense in cambio, dovete fare avanti e indietro nello stesso posto, che è ridondante), tutti gli abitanti muoiono, mercanti che muoiono ma i negozi non sono saccheggiabili (non c'è interazione con l'ambiente nel gioco), ne i loro inventari (date l'interpretazione che volete a questa cosa, non mi interessa), vi ritroverete ad uscir fuori in una città invasa da 2432325235 orchi, che oltre un certo livello schiaccerete con un dito, VOI DA SOLI li ammazzerete come foste terminator un armageddon di orchi, mentre un esercito di guardie giace morto a terra. Aggiungo: nessun segno di assedio, porta della città perfettamente in piedi, niente fiamme, niente di niente. Orchi materializzati in città che hanno ucciso persone: neanche la quest della guerra civile di skyrim era fatta in modo così trascurato. Questo è quello che io definisco \"avere una bella idea e realizzarla MALISSIMO\", anche perché le opportunità c'erano, e pure tante.\n\nSECONDO:\nLa parte sopra è nulla in confronto a quello che sto per dire, perché è davvero qualcosa di indescrivibile. Perché in una città assediata senza assedio uno può dare la colpa magari agli strumenti, a developer poco esperti, a difficoltà che ti costringono a buttar fuori un gioco non al massimo del suo potenziale. Ma questo è qualcosa che non so davvero come descrivere.\nA quella che è praticamente la fine della main quest, ci si incontra con un personaggio importante di questa associazione che ti ha \"ingaggiato\" all'inizio del gioco (ricattato a  dire il vero), e uno si aspetterebbe una cutscene o un lungo dialogo che spieghi cosa stia per succedere.\n\nNO INVECE. NO.\nSemplicemente NO. Non c'è nulla infatti. Nulla.\nEDIT: ho sbagliato, ho controllato e ci sono delle cutscene nel gioco che però sono buggate e spesso non funzionano (come nel mio caso). Sono comunque ridicole. Ridicole e non spiegano NULLA di quello che succede.\nVieni indirizzato ad uccidere in una tra cinque torri elfiche a tua scelta un nemico facente parte dell'associazione nemica, per poi essere indirizzato al castello per la non-battaglia finale. Dico non-battaglia perché è davvero disarmante trovarsi al livello 51 e con una build tank disumana, con un pool di energia spaventoso, contro un nemico che ti one-shotta solo perché è gigante, brutto, cattivo e si chiama \"demoniaco\". E' davvero vergognoso fare un boss così. Un modo non-umano per ucciderlo è sfruttare la stupidità dell'IA, ovvero salire su una roccia e usare magie/archi per far fuori il nemico. Vorrei far notare che funziona così con quasi tutti i \"nemici di grosse dimensioni\" nel gioco. Oneshot o quasi ovunque. E chi non ha una build tank cosa fa, se prende uno schiaffo si trova la faccia nel sedere? eddai...\nMa comunque, il Boss non finale è seguito dal non-boss finale, che si rivela essere il tipo che ti ha ricattato/aiutato all'inizio del gioco (woooo che plot twist pazzesco, sarebbe stato anche piuttosto bello se ci fosse stata una storia dietro, ma non c'è quindi ci attacchiamo), che è un normalissimo spellsword che non ti uccide con un colpo solo, ha danni decisamente sensati, ma va giù molto facilmente, ma poco male, specie con la mia build.\n\nIl fatto che mi rende più nervoso in assoluto è che qui ci DOVREBBE essere un finale, invece non c'è. Perchè ti ritrovi al menù principale. Non sai cosa sia successo a tua sorella, aziraal non si capisce che fine abbia fatto, non si capisce che fine fa il mondo in base alla decisione che prendi alla fine, NULLA. Un gioco tagliato. Immaginate di entrare nel Tempio dell'unico alla fine di oblivion, E IL GIOCO FINISCE Lì invece di esserci la scena finale con Martin/Akatosh e Mehrunes Dagon. Più o meno la dimensione è quella. semplicemente non c'è modo per descriverlo.\n\n<FINE SPOILER>\n\nSistema di combattimento brutto, facciamola breve. L'idea che sta dietro non è poi così diversa da altri giochi (Prince of Persia, Assassin's creed), ma il guaio è che il gioco è tremendamente legnoso e un IA non proprio brillante peggiora le cose. Il più delle volte ci sono troppi nemici perché uno possa combatterli ragionevolmente (e quando dico troppi, voglio dire TROPPI), ma con una build tank come la mia, li butti giù tutti assieme con un colpo solo, salvo essere atterrato e non riuscire più ad alzarsi perché in mille ti stanno colpendo con colpi atterranti. Se non \"brutto\", tutto il sistema di combattimento è trascurato.\n\nNon capisco come si possa giocare con una build arciere se non ci si può muovere con l'arco teso, senza rimanere in furtività (eddai...), o una build ladro con un sistema di furtività che si basa su spendere punti in un potere che non migliora te, ma rende ciechi i nemici (non sto scherzando, è così), o giocare con un mago senza dover in qualche modo obbligatoriamente spendere punti in vitalità.\nFine.","timestamp_created":1394840771,"timestamp_updated":1394844598,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":38,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.810062289237976074","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9374788","author":{"steamid":"76561198000905268","num_games_owned":333,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":2456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2377,"last_played":1499971858},"language":"spanish","review":"Gran juego de rol, me encanta la libertad de exploracion, juego algo viejillo con algunos fallos en el control del personaje, lo mejor es la libertad de exploración total, un 10 para mi.","timestamp_created":1394215852,"timestamp_updated":1480106343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9361326","author":{"steamid":"76561198050540228","num_games_owned":405,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2487,"last_played":1394072815},"language":"english","review":"The game itself feels like an old version of Skyrim.

It was the first open world RPG I ever owned and so when I saw this game on steam the nostalgia hit like a thrown brick.\n\nThis is a game that you have to laugh at to play. If you are a fan of open world RPGs like me and are willing to keep a sense of humor, this is an excellent game despite the constant speed bumps.\n\nThe gameplay elements that work in this game's favor are the skills, crafting, and combat.\n\n The raw number of different skills allow the player to create a Robin Hood-esque ranger, a steel-clad one man-army warrior, or a mighty mage who owns an entire town (a bug I will explain later on).  The crafting system is simple, find two of the same items and you can combine them to make a single more powerful item.  The alchemy of Two Worlds is also the best type of potion-crafting I've ever experienced for a single reason: permanent effect potions and trap-making.  The combat is as varied as the classless skills, making any path viable. Using a wide variety of re-useable traps (from poisoned spikes to hammers and fire-coated blades) allows players who prefer ranged magic or bows to kill much more powerful creatures without the worry of being forced into melee. Magic and potions can keep a warrior alive in even the thickest melee.\n\nWhile I do love this game, the experience fails in just as many ways as it succeeds. The game's skill system, combat, and crafting could all use some work.\n\nI sound like I'm contradicting myself, but it is the truth. The way the player unlocks skills is by finding a trainer and purchasing the skill, which then allows the player to use and allocate points towards that skill. This is not a huge problem except for the alchemy skill. The alchemy skill is useable from the start of the game but the player must find the alchemy trainer (located far to the south and hidden among end-game monsters) in order to increase the skill, which is vital in wringing out every last stat point from permanent-effect potion ingredients. With the most useful early-game skill unlocked in the late/end-game, the other major skill dissapointments are the useless and annoying skills. You can learn a skill to unhorse a mounted enemy, but no one except the player can ride a horse. The swimming skill is useful for crossing rivers, which the player only really needs to do once or twice meaning the skill is a waste and swim-speed makes every river crossing a five-minute ordeal.\n\nThe combat, while the options are varried, can easily become stale.  Once you find a style that works, you will abuse it. For example: what should be an epic battle of ranger vs dragon becomes a chore as you trick the dumb-as-rock AI into alternating between stacks of traps as you fill it with arrows. \n\nThe crafting system requires two of the same item to create a single more powerful version. However, if the two items are too different in their enchantments, you can't combine them. The only way to tell if an item is too different from your gear is to have them both in your inventory, making purchasing equipment a gamble at the best of times. \n\n\nThe game has a few qualities that are neither inherently good or bad, as long as you keep a sense of humor. Perfect examples being the dialogue and the bugs.\n\nThe dialogue is comedic. It would be difficult for anyone to write funnier dialogue becuase between the merciless abuse of old-english and the uninspired voice acting, every single conversation will have you either cringing or laughing. \n\nThe best bug I've ever experienced was in this game. *SPOILER ALERT*  During the course of the main questline, a city is overrun by orcs. By killing all the orcs and using the resurrect spell on everyone (including the orcs), the player can create a city where guards do not attack them and the humans and orcs co-exist peacefully (the orcs even sweep the streets) *SPOILER OVER*\n\nWhile there are countless speed-bumps to enjoying this game (including the terrible activation), it is an experience worth having.","timestamp_created":1390554959,"timestamp_updated":1390554959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8738884","author":{"steamid":"76561197976405393","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":24293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4972,"last_played":1527243355},"language":"english","review":"This game is one of the best RPG games I have played.

I played this for many hours over Christmas and found the tasks and roleplay to be challenging and very enjoyable. There is no excess gore in fighting and the horse riding control is the best I've come across allowing for good combat on horseback with upgrade skills.

С одной стороны, передо мной предстала недо-RPG  с приличным кол-вом квестов, какой-никакой основной сюжетной линией, открытым миром и другими вещами, присущие сериям, вроде Elder Scrolls. Но сделано все, вообще все настолько криво, что хочется ее просто выключить и снести после пары квестов (поездки на лошади в этой игре не выветрятся из памяти еще очень долго). Думаю, что тот, кому неинтересен жанр и вся фэнтезийная мура, так и поступит. Но с другой стороны, мне, как человеку, который обожает серию Spellforce приглянулся сеттинг, да и сами ветки квестов. С геймплеем все вышло очень странно - лично я вкачал лучника, и уже к 20 уровню выносил все и вся по всему Талмонту. Качался до 60 уровня, пока просто не надоело, потом плюнул и выполнил основной квест за час, лол. Последний босс был вынесен одной-двумя стрелами. Несмотря на все это, игра смогла удержать меня аж на тридцатку часов.\n\nЧестно говоря, порекомендовать это я могу только любителям жанра. Здесь нет интересного сюжета, вменяемой прокачки, побочные квесты банальны и однообразны. Зато есть эти чертовы лошади. Но для себя я бы поставил 7 из 10.

Erfreulich auch hier, dass man nicht einen vorgefertigten Charakter an die Hand bekommt, sondern man selbst entscheidet, wie man sich im Laufe das Spiels entwickelt. Wer also denkt, er müsse eine dicke Rüstung tragen und gleichzeitig die übelsten Zaubersprüche wirken...kein Problem. Alles machbar mit der Skillung.\nEbenso simpel wie genial ist auch das Crafting. Hat man zwei identische Items (Rüstung, Waffe, Schmuck), zieht man sie einfach übereinander und schon ist aufgewertet. Und seinen Alchemiekessel hat man eh immer im Gepäck. Man muss also fürs komplette Handwerk weder Siedlungen noch Städte aufsuchen.\nDa die Welt von \"Two Worlds\" wirklich riesig ist, komme ich hier auch zum einzigen Schwachpunkt in meinen Augen. Wenn man es so nennen kann: Abseits der Wege tut sich leider nicht ganz so viel wie in den obengennanten anderen Rollenspielen. Man findet zwar reichlich Wildtiere und Pflanzen für die Alchemie, aber für Entdecker und Erforscher ist es nicht ganz so spannend. Klar stolpert man hier und da über irgendwelche Dungeons oder Ruinen. Doch aufgrund der Grösse der Spielwelt wirkts fast ein wenig \"leer\". Dafür gibts jede Menge Banditen-, Ork- und Monsterlager in denen oft mehrere Kisten zum plündern rumstehen.\nTrotzdem, zu tun gibts jede Menge, man wird reichlich versorgt mit Quests. Langeweile kommt also keine auf...und rumkommen tut man auch. Daher kommt auch ein Pferd sehr gelegen, an das man auf die verschiedensten Arten und Weisen gelangen kann. Leider ist hier die Steuerung etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber nach kurzer Übung hat mans raus.\n\nAmüsant sind auch die verschiedenen Gilden in diesem Spiel, für die man Jobs erledigen muss und somit Ruf erhält...was wiederum dem Ansehen zugute kommt. Da gibt es nämlich einige, die sich gegenseitig nicht so ganz \"grün\" sind. Da kann es dann schon vorkommen, das man die eine Gilde auslöschen soll, obwohl man doch für die grad wichitge Missionen erledigen soll. Und vorallem: was würde dann danach passieren? Vor solche Entscheidungen wird man übrigens öfters gestellt...und nicht nur von den Gilden.\n\nInteressant ist auch der Aspekt, welche Rüstung ich für was benutze. Es gibt nämlich so einige, mit denen kann man z.B. nicht schwimmen oder keinen Bogen verwenden. Da wirds natürlich zur Gewissensfrage, ob ich die Teile trotzdem trage oder mir mehrere Sets ins Gepäck packe...so für alle Fälle. Da gehts dann natürlich wieder drum ob auch genug Platz in selbigem ist.\nApropos Items: ich war erstaunt wieviel unterschiedliche Waffen und Rüstungen es in diesem Spiel gibt. Und die haben auch wirklich ihren eigenen \"Look\".\nKurzum, wenn man bedenkt, dass das Spiel schon einige Jahre auf dem Buckel hat, wird man gut unterhalten und ich schätze mal die Spielzeit locker auf 50-80 Stunden. Kann bestimmt auch mehr sein, wenn man (so wie ich) seinen Nase überall und in jeden Winkel reinsteckt.\nIch selbst habe es übrigens auf einem Rechner mit Windows 7-64bit laufen und habe absolut keine Probleme damit.

At later levels, the game becomes severely punishing. Now I don't mind difficulty, but this game likes  to suddenly throw overpowered monsters at you without warning. High level monster scale rediculously well. They will have a few times your health and do a couple times your damage. If you want to be able to take on high level challenges, you either have to grind out a lot of levels, which is done by killing monsters MMO style or through quests, or invest in the severely flawed magic system.\n\nOne can understand why the monster are so strong when one takes a look at what spells are available to the player. While finding the exact spell you want is nearly impossible, getting hands on any higher level spells makes your power level spike like crazy. I was able to get my hands on a reflect aura in the earth magic school. By abusing the magic system, I was able to get my reflect spell to reflect 70% of all damage. You heard that right, 70%. It seems the game will assume your use of of magic. By throwing out rediculous monsters, it forces you to be a sort of mage-warrior no matter what.\n\nThe leveling system in this game is actually more interesting than that of Oblivion's. There are a myriad of skills that can be learned, and the aforementioned magic system provides a bunch of really cool spells. Unfortunately, in terms of melee combat the game seems to favor two-handed weapons. The advantage of dual-wielding or using a sword and shield is the ability to parry attacks (done automatically). But one quickly realizes that isn't not worth it. It's far better to abuse the two-handed weapon's long range and simply physically avoid the ennemy blows, rather than nibling away at the enemy with the extremely short ranged one-handed weapons and relying on the dice to block strikes. It doesn't help that two-handed weapons all seem to deal double the damage of one handed weapons. \n\nIn a role-playing game, the player should never be forced to do something. All roles should be equally valid. Whether that be a mighty barbarian or a graceful duelist. But the game funnels you down a single path. With some more polish and a better balanced combat and magic system, I might have really enjoyed this game. But these gaping issues ruined it for me.","timestamp_created":1387393081,"timestamp_updated":1387393081,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":74,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653878152370452881","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8103747","author":{"steamid":"76561197975018345","num_games_owned":512,"num_reviews":118,"playtime_forever":199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1424497017},"language":"english","review":"This game was pretty nice and I don't understand such bad reviews it received.

Habe mir das komplette Two Worlds Paket gekauft um auch im Genuss des ersten Teils zu kommen und bin auch trotz etwas schlechterer Grafik und nur ein paar Minuten Ingame wieder Feuer und Flamme für die Serie. ein paar kleiner glitches die aber nich sehr ins Gewicht fallen.","timestamp_created":1386973623,"timestamp_updated":1386973623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8032682","author":{"steamid":"76561197982253696","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":271,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":122,"last_played":1429615340},"language":"russian","review":"Необычная и захватывающая игра.","timestamp_created":1386967825,"timestamp_updated":1386967825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539629757404327393","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8022833","author":{"steamid":"76561197965021835","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4607,"last_played":1379385294},"language":"english","review":"Awesome roleplaying game great graphics and epic story. The beginning is very hard you have to take your time and build up be patient, dont dive into combat or you die. learn the jump back system for defense. The horse riding is better than any rpg ive played for realism, you can shoot your bow while riding horses. The combat system is very fun once you get comfortable with the way your character moves. THere is an ingenious way to stack equipment so nothing gets wasted and items lvl as they are stacked into eachother. There are hours and hours of content and side stories. The magic system is fantastic. This was due to buggyness rated as one of the worst RPGs but infact i find its one of the best RPGS now with the patching. I prefer this game over oblivion 10 to 1. The characters are more robust. Some people complain about the voice acting but its appropriate for the setting the old english. Also its nice to hear your character talk instead of read what he says as a mute as in most games.  There is plenty of element of exploration. This is a recommended must buy for anyone who likes skyrim,oblivion, gothic or any open world RPG 3rd person games. Also this game has some of the best looking armor sets ive ever seen in a game and the most veriety of weapons and items in any game to date.","timestamp_created":1386890424,"timestamp_updated":1386890561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507462680339813232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8020155","author":{"steamid":"76561197969367226","num_games_owned":577,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1027,"last_played":1388780216},"language":"english","review":"I love this game!!

You're the kind of hero who prefers to narrate everything you do, all the while sounding like the last guy who told your drunk ass to get in the trunk. The kind of hero with the air of a repeat sex offender who eats nails for breakfast, but possesses a warm gooey center and extremely mixed feelings about their scantily clad sister who looks nothing like them 99.9% of the time. If you feel like chasing the big bad hard warrior known as Gandohar and is sensible but stylish  master named Reist across the damn continent to save your sister prepare yourself for a twist that would probably make M. Night Shablabdingdong proud. \n\n\nNote that it will cause everyone else to indifferently stare at the screen while fiddling with their genitalia. Oh yeah you kill a lot of things and get progressively shinier armor to protect you from (or attract) Gandohars firm hands, its all fun and games till the bad guy starts caressing you like  you're his pillow. Also this game is a fantastic substitute for Blender Simulator 2013, I'd like to see those sim punks make an even better identical sword by throwing 20 of them in a blender together!\n\n\n\n\nSeriously though Two Worlds has...\n\nSymbol Key\n--------------------\n++= very good\n+= good\n- = bad\n--------------------\n\n- Hilarious voice acting (yes its bad but in a good way) + \n\n- Exploration! ++\n\n- Some Forgettable quests -\n\n- Plenty of quests +\n\n- Plentiful factions but no real consequences for reputation other than more or less quests =\n\nThe combat is somewhat difficult but unlike other games you can't permanently die, you'll just get ressurected at a nearbly Maliel Shrine and continue your journey back to that damn Cyclops that used your helmet as a bongo. No item loss, no nothing, just rinse and repeat till you win (quicksaving in other RPG's is kind of the same thing though). Did I mention the map is huge and full of diverse and fairly interesting environments complete with some fairly standard but servicable guilds/factions to be a part of? \n\n\nWhether you're slaying Jackals and Dragons in the desert, killing Polar Bears and Orcs up in the glacier, being chased through the ruins of the deadlands surrounding a destroyed city with appropriate amounts of demons, undead, and more. Maybe you'll just slaughter entire cities and towns for fun once you become powerful enough? Just don't beat the main quest right away as once its over so is the game, its a lot more fun to explore the exotic landscapes of Antaloor and though they may lack much lore to give them added signifigance, its always the journey that beats the destination. Good thing the journey is so damn fun.\n\n\nYes the voice acting is THAT bad and you will love it!
