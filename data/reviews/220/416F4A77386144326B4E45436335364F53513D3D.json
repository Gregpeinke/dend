While gamers are still waiting for Half-Life 3, they can just complete the second part over and over again, and every time they do that, they'll discover something new. Half-Life 2 is a game full of secrets, surprises, and great level design features. I wouldn't say it's [i]better[/i] than Half-Life 1 but that's only because they are so different that they can't actually be compared.\n\nSo, what does this game have to offer? For me, it is the following:\n\n[b]1. A great storyline.[/b]\nNot that Half-Life 1, the origin of the series, had a worse one, no. But now Half-Life 2 has a lot more dialogues than the first game, and they are a lot more detailed. The story is no longer a \"human vs. alien\" cliché, Valve turned it into a very original, very clever \"human AND aliens vs. mutated humans controlled by a man controlled by a mysterious thing previously controlled by Nihilanth\". Sounds good.\n\n[b]2. Great graphics.[/b]\nI have no desire to know what Call of Duty fans would say about the graphics in Half-Life 2. For me, they will always stay as awesome as I thought when I first saw them. Seriously, look at this game. It came from 2004 (11 years ago). Now, check other games from 2004 and look at them. Half-Life 2 is the obvious winner. In 2015, it still looks pretty. At least, for me.\n\n[b]3. Physics.[/b]\nPhysics! Boxes breaking into really small parts! Carry boxes with yourself! What else could you dream of in 2004? In Half-Life 2, physics are just awesome, without exaggeration.\n\n[b]4. Alyx.[/b]\nA woman companion. I wouldn't say she looks as nice yet having a woman accompanying you is a great feature. Especially if she can shoot at enemies and even kill them sometimes. What else do you need?\n\n[b]5. Puzzles.[/b]\nThe campaign of Half-Life 2 is not linear. That's what makes it beautiful: lots of puzzling elements (I keep getting stuck at some levels if I don't play this game, say, for a month or two). Totally not like Call of Duty, the best shooting range game of all times. In this game, you don't simply go from point A to point B, you discover secrets, solve puzzles, [spoiler]escape from a hunter chopper,[/spoiler] and only meanwhile, fight enemies.\n\nThese are only 5 features I'd most like to point out. There are always much more but to discover them, you have to play the game yourself. I totally recommend this game, it deserves ten stars out of five but I can't rate it this way, unfortunately. But keep in mind that you still have to play Half-Life 1 to get into the story.","timestamp_created":1448272477,"timestamp_updated":1448272477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546827793121337891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19229176","author":{"steamid":"76561198105673546","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":4178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2389,"last_played":1584499556},"language":"english","review":"It's good as everyone says it is, just get it","timestamp_created":1448256168,"timestamp_updated":1585116118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19228616","author":{"steamid":"76561198233849256","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":2917,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1387,"last_played":1586482110},"language":"spanish","review":"11/10","timestamp_created":1448252613,"timestamp_updated":1448252613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19226017","author":{"steamid":"76561198035094387","num_games_owned":534,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":5422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5379,"last_played":1642898551},"language":"english","review":"very fun game","timestamp_created":1448236989,"timestamp_updated":1448236989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512524962425231934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19224732","author":{"steamid":"76561198077539564","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":393,"last_played":1574818906},"language":"english","review":"Best game 2k27","timestamp_created":1448231300,"timestamp_updated":1448231300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19223842","author":{"steamid":"76561197991567449","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1007,"last_played":1448779345},"language":"spanish","review":"Poco se puede decir que no se haya dicho ya, obra de arte, de esos juegos que lo tienen casi todo.

Tedious, tedious, and tedious.  I have to laugh when I read reviews about how this game doesn't hold your hand like most games.  Huh?  This is one of the most heavily scripted and linear games I've ever played.  Whether it’s through tunnels, rooms or driving down the road there's only one way to go.  It’s not open world and there's no exploring so you can't get lost, you keep going in the same direction.  Walls, buildings or something blocking your path always keeps you linearly going forward so why would you need hand holding?\n\nAs for the puzzles, there’s nothing consistent about them.  The point of puzzles or puzzling out the next step is that there has to be consistency so what you learn from the previous one can help provide a method or direction for the next one.  That doesn’t happen in this heavily scripted game.  If the script calls for you to place two boxes on top of each other to climb over something then that's the only thing you could do.  If the script doesn’t want you climbing over two boxes then you can’t, even if the scenarios is very similar to a previous one.  Meaning that the script has a different solution you have to ignore what worked before.\n\nIt’s the same with actions like jumping; if the script required you to jump 5ft from one obstacle to another obstacle to get the next point then you did it.  Try that with the next encounter and you can’t even jump 2ft because the script doesn’t want you to go in that direction.  So now you have to figure out what the lame scripted puzzle is for that scenario.  I don’t call inconsistencies in how you puzzle out the next step challenging, rather more like lazy programing.  \n\nI played Half-Life 2 and both Episodes and this inconsistency was prevalent in all of them.  In one scenario I piled a couple of boxes on top of each other to jump over a fence.  I could see that the fence ended next to small building and was clearly about a foot taller that the building.  Makes sense to move the boxes next to the building and jump on the roof, right?  Placed the boxes next to the building and jump on them and what do you know, now the building is taller than the fence.  Jumped off the boxes and stepped back and clearly the fence is taller than the building.  Jump back on the boxes and the building again is taller than the fence.  Which basically means that the script doesn’t want me to go that way.  I wasted a lot of time in this game puzzling out the next step with inconstancies like that.  Lazy, lazy programing.\n\nOf all the games I've played this one was definitely the most tedious.  It was stretched out waaayyy too long.  Nothing but heavily scripted scenarios of endless linear hallways, tunnels, roads, waterways while gunning your way running through gauntlets of bullet sponge enemies for no particular reason.  \n\nIn conclusion I can clearly see why there is no Half-Life 3.  Half-Life definitely belongs in the past when gamers weren’t so particular.","timestamp_created":1448081775,"timestamp_updated":1458948273,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.30738222599029541","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19185171","author":{"steamid":"76561198213559089","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3703,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2151,"last_played":1643844655},"language":"english","review":"Probably one of the most beautiful games I've ever played (Besides Portal 2, cause Portal is life)\nFull of story, action, and adventure.
