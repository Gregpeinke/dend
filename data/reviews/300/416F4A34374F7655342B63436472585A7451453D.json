I bought it for three other friends, unfortunately, after three hours playing, I ultimatly find that I don't like it very much and that might have something to do with the fact that I play an aweful lot of Dino D-Day.\n\nI like that the game is a remake of the old DoD from 2003 which ran on the old GoldSRC engine, the same engine as Half-Life, i like how frantic it can be and how claustrophobic and harrowing each game feels and how on edge it can get ya.\n\nWhat I don't like is the lacking selection of game modes like Skirmish or TDM etc. The only game mode available is King-of-the-Hill which gets a bit old.\n\nMaps feel more like arena's inspired by WW2 battlefields as opposed to trying to be like an actual WW2 battlefield, although this complaint is minor.\n\nAt the posting of this review I haven't gotten a handle on weapons or classes. I find the weapon recoil, especially on automatics, annoying, but this probably stems from my time playing DDD where weapons lack that annoying recoil. I don't feel very confident with the weapons, in fact I hardly feel in control and this has left me dead more than a few times.\n\nIt's very easy to mistake foes for friends and even team kill if the server has it enabled which can lead to some hilarious, and other times aweful moments.\n\nFinally, the player movements feel sluggish and the sprint feels utterly useless, it's not going to get you across the map at any acceptable speeds, you only move about a few centimeters until the character is huffing and puffing with barely any ground covered.\n\nAddiitonally, the crouch feels way too slow, especially when aiming a weapon. If you're not precise on where you crouch and aim you're going to be easy pickings for some fella who happens to be positioned right. There's no room for screwing up when it comes to aiming.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't like the game as much as others do and I deffinitly prefer DDD over DoD anyday. The game feels dated for sure and it takes a lot of time to get good at, time I spend feeling like a let down to the team. There are better WW2 shooters than this that isn't CoD that offer more game types and better map designs.\n\nI'll keep playing, but as far as enjoyment goes, there's hardly any there for me.","timestamp_created":1546689323,"timestamp_updated":1546689853,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497230410575866699","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48102154","author":{"steamid":"76561198192237503","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":137,"last_played":1599173696},"language":"spanish","review":"Que

Багато залежить від тактики і вміння поступово захоплювати позиції. Терпіння і дія в команді - ось що приводить до результату. Щоправда, одного разу мене вигнав адмін з сервера за те, що я взяв під контроль половину однієї сторони вулиці, яка складається з одного довгого і великого будинку, і тільки контролював його, а не безпосередньо брав участь у захопленні точок. В моєму розумінні це просто тактика, адже кожен виконує свою роль. Проте навіть без попередження мене вигнали з сервера. Але це всього лиш одна історія з мого віртуального життя в цій грі. Хочеться ще сказати про атмосферу. Вона тут шикарна. Це незабутнє відчуття, коли ти біжиш, все взривається, звуки пострілів і це все супроводжується безперервними криками гравців по-німецьки(не в войс чаті, а безпосередньо через натиснення кнопок або автоматичними скріптами, хоча і в войс чаті теж не рідко можна було почути німецьку(хоча сервер міг бути французький)).

of defeat... ¿que puedo decir del juego?... ya se, UNA MARAVILLA claro, si tienes en cuenta las limitaciones grficas del motor source.\neste juego es un FPS de clases, como el team fortress 2, pero realista, el juego se ubica en 1944 y hay un pequeño catalogo de mapas, los modos de juego son capturar la bandera y explotar los objetivos (ejemplo: taques y cañones) lo importante de este juego es TRABAJO EN EQUIPO si no hay trabajo en equipo, NO ganaras, tienes poca vida, te pueden matar de 1 a 2 disparos dependiendo de que arma, esto es compensado por la rapides del respawn, en tf2 esperas hasta 20 segundos, en csgo TODA la ronda, aqui a lo maximo son unos 9 segundos, ahora viene lo NEGATIVO del juego:\ntiene pocos mapas, y cuando digo pocos es porque son POCOS, el cs:s (counters strike source) tiene menos mapas que el original, pero DoD tiene como 5 mapas por defecto, puedes obtener mas mapas si entras a servers de la comunidad, pero que vengan tan pocos mapas, es como un insulto teniendo en cuenta que el DoD original tenia una GRAN variedad de mapas.\nlos servidores son POCOS miren yo soy de chile y tengo que jugar en servidores brazileños\nuna de las cosas buenas del juego es que va RAPIDO mi computadora no es muy buena, pero este juego logra ir a unos 125 FPS \n\nConclucion:\nun juego bueno, balanciado, entretenido y coperativo pero con pocos servidores aqui en latino america y pocos mapas\nQuerida valve, si lees esto POR FAVOR dale un poco mas de atencion a este juego, hacerlo gratis podria aumentar los jugadores potenciales, añadir mas mapas quizas mejorarlo

Here I thought gaming clans were completely extinct by now but sure enough the only populated servers on this game are owned and populated by clans. This was a heartwarming blast from the past; even if I did find out later that the age demographic for clans has somewhat changed from when I was playing CoD from 2006-2014 on console. \nSo I ended up joining a server with a bunch people who I learned were all 30-40 year old ex-military guys. I didn't talk much and decided I'd just learn how the game works and listen to them have their conversations. They all knew each other on a first name basis and talked about gun control, the guns they own, the guns they want, the \"problem\" with this country, their ex-wives, millennials, border patrol, and they shared a few jokes that you wouldn't repeat in mixed company. I played for a couple hours and started to get a hang of how the game worked then got kicked for going 40-10.\nThe game itself is OK. The gameplay isn't going to knock your socks off or anything. But the community is something to behold and I recommend everyone tries being a fly on the wall on some of these clan servers. And if you're a divorced ex-military republican guy looking for like-minded friends then look no further.","timestamp_created":1545273453,"timestamp_updated":1545273453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":67,"votes_funny":43,"weighted_vote_score":"0.84779202938079834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47633106","author":{"steamid":"76561198315925507","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10409,"playtime_last_two_weeks":317,"playtime_at_review":5584,"last_played":1660420504},"language":"polish","review":"Najlepsza Gra !","timestamp_created":1545243362,"timestamp_updated":1545243362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47631902","author":{"steamid":"76561198244136856","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":2542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":435,"last_played":1640511318},"language":"english","review":"Tf2 fans are crying about not getting an update.\nAnd this community is just kicking a$$\nRespect","timestamp_created":1545239607,"timestamp_updated":1594034944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47631190","author":{"steamid":"76561198062824455","num_games_owned":1675,"num_reviews":215,"playtime_forever":125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":112,"last_played":1546099196},"language":"italian","review":"bello, ma e' come counter strike","timestamp_created":1545237389,"timestamp_updated":1545237389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47OvU4+cCdrXZtQE="}
