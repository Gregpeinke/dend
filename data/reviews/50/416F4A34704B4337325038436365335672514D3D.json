- 7/10, wasnt superior to the base game like the community claims, but still a solid expansion\n\nfull review:\n\nmy order of playing these games hasn't exactly been in the order many people would recommend, as so far, i played half-life, then started half-life 2, played blue shift, finished half-life 2, then played through this game. if i were to recommend an order, i'd probably suggest playing in release order as many others would, but i felt it was necessary to know that this isnt my first foray into the half-life universe.\n\nhalf-life: opposing force was an absolutely amazing experience, but considering the praise it gets from the community, was also severely underwhelming. that's partially my fault, however. i set the bar for the game way too high, even higher than my expectations were for base half-life, and even its sequel. if you're looking for an experience that is better than base half-life, this is not the game for you. however, if you look at it instead as a side story that is nothing more than a simple expansion of the story and lore, you will be satiated completely.\n\npros:\n- made in goldsrc engine, this engine is genuinely so charming. its primitive graphics and at times wonky control schemes and physics make every game you play in it just have a certain layer of charm that not even source games have managed to replicate. while yes, source is vastly superior to goldsrc, and goldsrc is definitely extremely dated by modern standards, i cant deny that this engine makes me feel good while playing.\n- a brilliant expansion to the lore of half-life and the story of the black mesa incident. [spoiler]while i wouldn't say that adrian shepherd is anywhere near as immersive as a character as gordon, due to shepherd being a literal marine corporal, it's interesting to see a new perspective of the events following the resonance cascade.[/spoiler]\n- the game actually progresses at a nice pace, unlike blue shift which felt like it dragged a lot towards the end. [spoiler]the race x aliens, cliché name aside, were an interesting change of pace for the enemies towards the end of the game, making me so accustomed to them that when a regular vortigaunt spawned it, it confused me for a bit.[/spoiler]\n\ncons:\n- some enemies felt a bit too tanky to be enjoyed. [spoiler]enemies like the voltigore and shock troopers felt extremely tanky and hit you really hard. they're such a different class of enemies in terms of raw strength than the xen-based lifeforms.[/spoiler] this isn't necessarily a con if you're looking for something more difficult than the original game, but it was not what i was expecting going in.\n- a lot of mechanics introduced in the hazard course (or boot camp as its called here) either were never really used outside of a few key scenarios (like the radio), were only accessible towards the end game (sniper rifle), or were just downright janky (ropes). it felt like gearbox came up with the training course first and then realised they had to make an actual half-life expansion afterwards.\n- the black ops team. one of the most annoying enemies in base half-life, but were manageable due to their low amount. [spoiler]in nearly half the chapters of the game, the black ops team were the main enemy force. it's very easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of these enemies, something not present in base half-life due to their scarcity as enemies.[/spoiler] again, not a con if you want a more difficult experience, but such a vast difference to the base game.\n\noverall, i enjoyed the game. i'd rank it a 7/10, just a little bit below base half-life in my opinion. this game is genuinely a lot of fun, same as the base game and blue shift. none of my cons really hindered my experience, rather were just minor things that slightly inconvenienced me at their worst.","timestamp_created":1649133029,"timestamp_updated":1649133216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113345397","author":{"steamid":"76561198295206088","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1649097641},"language":"english","review":"It's a good game for its age.\nI like it when games show the enemy side of the story so we the players can see their point of view and perspective.
