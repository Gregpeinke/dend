You can have two of them at one time, you jump into one and come out from the other. You could use them to solve puzzles or you could infinitely fall until you get sick. I'm not judging. \n\n[b][u]The Good Guys[/u][/b]\n\n[b]ALL PRAISE LORD GABEN![/b]\n\nIf you love Steam -which is the platform that you're on, by the way- you probably know [b]Valve[/b]. It's that company that sells all of their game for [i]50p[/i] each once a month. Also they own this site and part of your monthly income. They're known for developing incredible games, innovating the market and not knowing how to count to three.\nValve is one of the most beloved and lovable developers/publishers around and I'm currently looking for a job. I'm not saying hire me but please at least notice me, Lord Gaben. \n\n[b][u]The Bad Guys[/u][/b]\n\nPortal is self published. No loot boxes or dlcs here. We leave that stuff to the [u]dark side[/u] of the company.\n\n[b][h1]Script - A[/h1][/b]\n\nI mean, take this score lightly. Portal is more of a tutorial for Portal 2. It doesn't really have a huge story. \n\nYou're a test subject in an abandoned scientific facility. Cortana wants you dead but you don't like that so you try not to be dead. \nIt's good, for what it is. It's a good starting point for the more complex plot of the second game but the narrative is just superb! like oh-oh, mon dieu! Baguette! [i]*finger kiss*[/i]Even if the story is extremely simple it is also really well written and the jokes are just so funny! If you've been on the internet long enough, you probably heard the expression \"the cake is a lie\". This is where it comes from. No spoilers. Pick up the game and shut up.\n\nChell, the main character, doesn't really talk and you don't really know much about her but GLaDOS, uh. She IS the game, no question asked. \nGLaDOS will be your guide AND you main antagonist. She is a big meanie bus she's also so charming!\n[i]She attac, she protec but most importantly she cak(e)[/i].\nEvery line of dialogue from this character is a pearl and her design is, generally speaking, a work of art. \n\n[b][h1]Gameplay - S[/h1][/b]\n\nIt's not a case if Portal won dozens of awards, mainly for the innovative mechanics and clever game design. Fluid controls, satisfying puzzles and balanced progression: Portal constantly challenge you and you want to demonstrate yourself that no, you're not stupid and yes, you want that cake, and no, you're NOT STUCK IN CHAMBER 17, [b]IF YOU'RE SO GOOD WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT YOURSELF, SUZAN!?[/b]\n\n...\n\nSo there are all these social experiments, right?\nThe game is full of them. It revolves around science and so they decided to make science with it. It's genuinely interesting to see a social experiment introduced as a game mechanic in a videogame and it just adds so much to the general theme and design of the game.\n\n[b]Companion Cube (No clickbait, Gone sexual, must watch) [/b]\n[u]Please, stop the meme.[/u]\n\nIt took me less than one hour to beat Portal, a bit less than a couple of hours to one-hundred-percent it.\nThis is not a long game but it's not necessarily a bad thing!\n\nBack in the days I used to race with my friends -when I actually [b]HAD[/b] friends- to see who can beat the game faster. 35 minutes was our record, not the greatest speedrun ever but we had a lot of fun! I replayed the game a lot and I'm still not bored of it.\nAlso, once you're done with the campaign, you still have a couple of challenges ahead:\n\n[i]Advanced chambers[/i] makes you play a harder version of six maps from the main campaign. If you are already familiar with the game's mechanics these are fairly easy. \n\nThe real challenge comes in the form of trials. In this game mode you have to find alternative ways to beat the same 6 stages from the main campaign by using less portals, less steps or in just less time. \n\nNo, Suzan. I am not stuck in [i]Chamber 17 again[/i]. [b]LEAVE ME ALONE![/b]\n\n[b][h1]Presentation - A[/h1][/b]\n\nPortal is clean, sterile, which again it's really fitting. It's basically a white painting with a grey, nice frame and an orange and blue trim. It's pleasant, tidy, futuristic and mechanic. It's not the best looking game of 2007 but, honestly, it's Source's fault. I don't like how Source Engine looks. I guess it's a matter of taste? \nPortal is not a bad looking game by any means, it's just not [i]astonishing[/i]. Apart from that: models are great, really well made, and the palette choice is sophisticated yet not too pretentious. The game wants you to feel lonely, alienated and lost in a cold and hostile maze and it manages quite well.  \n\n[b][h1]Conclusion - A[/h1][/b]\n\n[i]I lik gam. [/i]\n\nGood stuff, much fun, very science, many thumbs ups. \nA must play. \n\nAnd that was a rhyme, just realized.
