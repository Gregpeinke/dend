Don't do it. This game sucks, and i'm gonna rant at you about it.\n\nThis game is the worst successor to the bioshock franchise that could've ever been made. It dumbs the formula started by bioshock 1 to such an extreme degree that it no longer even fits within the immersive sim genre. To put it in simple terms, bioshock original was an immersive sim with a heavy emphasis on action; it could play like an fps in parts, but it was at its core a successor to the system shock franchise and played as such most of the time. It was a simpler and more accessible game than that venerable franchise, but it still had that depth in both gameplay and story. bioshock shitfinite, on the other hand, is literally just an FPS with at best minor rpg influence and is in no way an immersive sim. \nFirst of all, im gonna talk about the story because that is the part that pisses me off the most. The story is so ham-fisted and hypocritical that it can't even compete with the older bioshock game.  The original bioshock was a critique of late-stage capitalism and the inherent flaws of a society of unchecked ambition, but it never felt the need to hammer that message into the player. It merely presented its world and its story to you, and expected you to put the pieces together yourself. Bioshock infinite screws this up by not only making the story so explicit in purpose, but also further hammering it in with a talkative main character and sidekick that constantly verbalize the message you are supposed to be getting. Like they will not shut the hell up for 5 seconds, its like the developers heard the phrase \"death of the author\" and thought it was supposed to be literal or something. And can we talk about how racist this story is for a second? the main take away the game basically forces on you from the whole subplot of the resistance vs Columbia is that yeah the horrible capitalist and slavery oppression thing is bad but armed resistance against it is just as bad. The leader of the resistance tries to murder a child because he was the child of an oppressor, and it makes literally no sense for her to have done that like what? And then the main characters start openly discussing this and say \"yeah she was just as bad as the literal slave laborer for trying to kill one child, which made no sense for her to do but lmao\" The writers clearly realized that their plotline was dumb and tried to hamfist in some bullsh*t trait for the resistance leader to paint them as bad. They are literally propaganda-ing at you in a story that is supposed to be anti-propagandist. Not to mention that, to stop the child killing, your partner, the pretty white girl who is pure and delicate and innocent, has to stab her dead on the spot. Like this is so clearly a racist attempt to paint resistance against oppression as badly as the oppression in the first place, and its so blatantly hypocritical and i never see anyone talking about it.\nAnd for the part that everyone other than me cares about, the gameplay. Story doesn't matter if the game is fun, right? Well, it isn't. Not for me, and not for anyone who actually understood what made bioshock 1 good in the first place. The original bioshock had large, open-ended levels, enemies that encourage subversion of mechanics using your own wits, and resource management mechanics that also encouraged the use of powers and weapons in creative ways to be as efficiant as possible. Bioshock infinite, however, is basically just call of duty with a prettier reskin over it. The best way to prove my point is the fire plasmid. In bioshock 1, you could use the fire to attack enemies directly, or you could be smarter with it and use it to melt ice for resources and alternate paths, light oil on fire and lead enemies into it, use it on wind traps to turn them into fire traps, all sorts of things that allow you to be creative with the plasmid's use, and the claustraphobic level design and focus on melee enemies enabled this. However, the fights in infinite are too open and fast paced for this sort of creative problem solving to apply, so the fire power is basically relegated to the status of being a reskinned grenade from every other fps game in existence. The few powers that are designed well are either useless or so blatantly overpowered that it makes other powers completely obsolete. The crow swarm power is the best example of this, you can use only that for most of the game and get through it just fine. And the ghost fight, jeezus christ don't get me started on the ghost fight. This thing is so bad that it makes the bioshock 1 final boss look like Ornstein and Smough by comparison. It is by far the worst boss ever created in the history of game design. Its so damn bad that you can easily softlock yourself from the rest of the game because you straight up ran out of bullets in the boss arena, making the fight unwinnable. That fight by itself brings the gameplay down from \"below average\" to \"hot garbage.\" Don't buy this game its terrible.","timestamp_created":1615834836,"timestamp_updated":1615834836,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88492933","author":{"steamid":"76561198349191736","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":409,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":331,"last_played":1616774254},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyunun en güçlü olduğu nokta atmosferi.

will show you”，我来展示给你看，我爱你，我在乎你。这种如同稚童般表现自己的行为，真正让玩家为布克感到悲哀，他在乎的是自己被人误解，而伊丽莎白需要的却是布克的成熟。\n\n故事到了这里，我们还漏掉了布克的很大一块碎片，那就是康姆斯托克。也许有人认为康姆斯托克具备完整的主体性，他就是另一种布克，甚至作为“Father Comstock”进行大规模的集权，真正完成了“父”的诞生。但康姆斯托克本质上 依旧只是“布克”的碎片，无法单独成形，原因便在于他依旧逃避了责任，这瓦解了他后来一系列成为“父”行为的根基。\n\n康姆斯托克将过去的一切罪恶推卸到布克身上，否认自己的责任，这种彻底的逃避导致他后来无论如何纵欲（行使权力）都无法真正成为“父”。最终也只能作为“布克”补完的材料，通过被布克杀死来促进碎片的融合。\n\n虹吸装置被破坏后伊丽莎白的力量空前壮大，“父”的权重有了物质力量的外壳终于在她身上膨胀起来，而接下来的故事很明了：纵欲、受创。伊丽莎白首先杀死了童年好友夜莺，独自承担其痛楚。接着不顾布克“去巴黎”的要求，强行帮助布克回忆一切，这时的伊丽莎白作为“父”的肢体延伸，在以母亲的角色促成“布克”亦即 “父”的诞生。最后一刻，她以“男孩”身份夺回的主体性使她短暂挣脱了“父”的控制，伊丽莎白按住布克推门的手“你 确定 这真的是你想要的吗？”。\n\n但这无济于事，碎片终将合并，“父”就在门后。\n\n布克推开了那扇门，清澈的河水、环绕的子嗣，生与死在这一刻交织。\n\n扮演着母亲的伊丽莎白揭晓真相，在象征着羊水的水中宣告“布克”的诞生。“Booker DeWitt，Comstock，no，I am both.”\n\n扮演着子嗣的伊丽莎白，作为“父”的肢体延伸，执行“布克”的意志——自杀。降生的前一刻他还懵懂无知，降生的后一刻他却自我毁灭，如此一来“父”终于完整，责任已负，人死债销。作为“父”延伸的伊丽莎白就此消失，布克的故事终于结束。\n","timestamp_created":1615806959,"timestamp_updated":1615806959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.665340542793273926","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88472989","author":{"steamid":"76561198256208892","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":366,"last_played":1657571874},"language":"finnish","review":"It`s

I still remember the hype surrounding the release of this game. There's just something special about all these games that is very difficult to put into words. Irrational Games portray different ideals of human governance and take them to their logical extremes, and then explore the natural consequences of what a world like that would produce (with some science bullshittery in the mix to make it fun). It was unchecked neo-liberal capitalism for Bioshock 1 and 2, and Antebellum America for Bioshock Infinite. \n\nIn infinite, you are in a floating city, headed by a \"prophet\" who built the city in holy reverence of God and the founding fathers of America who then proceeded to secede from the Union after being met with controversy by the government for making the unilateral decision of stopping the Boxer Rebellion in Peking. That's just the tip of the iceberg, with themes of pre-destination explored through quantum entanglement, race, religion, revolution, and imprisonment all being explored.\n\nHonestly, I couldn't recommend this game more. I replay it from time to time, and each time I am blown away by the main campaign. It's not the best GAME in the world- the shooting is real meh and it feels kinda clunky- but it is one of the best experiences i've had in a game. In an era where games rarely try to make statements anymore, this game stands out on that regard. Play it. In fact, play all the Bioshocks (2 included, it gets a too bad of a rap for what it is).","timestamp_created":1615738427,"timestamp_updated":1615738427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88431553","author":{"steamid":"76561198829141798","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":768,"last_played":1659129047},"language":"english","review":"Its fun, but it took me some time to get used to the controls.
