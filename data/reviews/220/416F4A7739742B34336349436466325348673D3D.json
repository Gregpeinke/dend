Now before I get hunted and killed by a bunch of fanboys, let me say this. Half Life 2 is a GREAT GAME... that some few major problems. I really enjoyed the game, but it doesn't seem like something I'm gonna replay. I beat the game, and now I don't think i will touch it again. Why? Well first off, I don't like the storytelling. The game has apparantly tons of lore, but I couldn't find any of it. I can't care for games that make you search for the plot. Don't give me the excuse \"It allows you to enjoy as much of the story as you want\". That is a load of bull. If you want to tell me a story, tell me one, don't just hint at one. I also don't like Gordon Freeman. Don't get me wrong, he is and always will be a badass, but I think having a silent protaganist in a world where the character is already developed dosen't mix well. Seriously, am I supposed to believe he got an MIT degree without saying a word? I think it works in other games like Portal however because of the character's abrupt introduction to the enviroment. Chell wakes up, not remembering how she got involved with this place, but she still has to go on with no one alone (another reason she dosen't talk, she has nobody to talk to). \n\nNow, why am I still recommending this game? Well because it is alot of fun. The enviroments are gorgeous for a game made in 2004. Each of the areas are quite different from each other, from the distopian City 17, to the lonely highways and waterways outside the city, the horrifying Ravenholm, to the futuristic Citadel. Each area also has different and varrying gameplay. The city is more of an escape, waterways and highways are vehicle oriented, Ravenholm is more survival-horror, and the final attack on the Citadel is an all out war. Also the game has impecible atmospere and pacing. It starts out slow, but then builds up to an all out battle that is very climactic. It's a refreshing break from modern millitary shooters that focus on spectacle and explosions over a true sense of epicness. If a game has all out explosions and action, it would get boring. Another reason why the well designed physics puzzles are nice to breakup shooting segments. Sad to think that a game made almost ten years ago is still more innovative than most trash today.\n\nSo, my opinion stands that Half Life 2 is a GOOD GAME (just want to make that clear), but NOT A PERFECT GAME. I will preach about how it is better than most garbage out there, but I won't say it is the greatest game ever made.

The only nitpicks I can think of are really just elements in the game that frustrate/terrify me but don't really bring the game down (Snipers, Fast Zombies, that damn train...).

If you haven't played it already then you should, it holds up well against recent titles and embarrasses a fair few.\n\nThe game has so many little touches that make it better than its competitors. The shotgun has a tight blast radius, so it's effective even at considerable distances. The gravity gun gave meaning to the rubbish strewn across the levels. Who would have thought a radiator could serve as a weapon, a shield and a useful platform to reach high-up areas? The grenades are satisfyingly clunky, the explosive barrels are meaty and I wish that they sold bugbait stress balls. It's probably the nicest sounding weapon in the world (and beyond).\n\nThis game needs no introduction. It's the game that single-handedly brought Steam onto desktop PCs everywhere. It had to live up to the standards set by the original and it surpassed it in every way. Graphically it was ahead of its time, with detailed character animations and convincing CLUTTER all over the world. Each level leads straight on from the previous so you can almost draw a mental map of City 17 as you journey towards the looming Citadel in the centre. You can see the sun slowly setting as the levels progress and distant sirens and explosions really draw you into the Eastern-European themed city. There's something very lonely about the echo of a gun shot on the cliff levels.\n\nEvery chapter has its own theme and alterations to the gameplay. You'll find yourself in vehicles, or battling against a certain type of enemy, or battling WITH that type of enemy against another sort. It really makes me wonder why other developers bother even trying to compete with the creativity that this title offers.\n\nIs it perfect? Nhggghhh, almost. I could say that the vehicle sections go on for a bit too long and the quiet, talky sections (which used to be my favourite- LOOK AT THEIR FACES!) have aged a bit. I find myself hitting things with a crowbar, waiting for more enemies to kill.\n\nSeriously, if you don't enjoy this game then first person shooters aren't for you.","timestamp_created":1386424624,"timestamp_updated":1386424624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":68,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.855435073375701904","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7953108","author":{"steamid":"76561198076340310","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":753,"last_played":1450380407},"language":"english","review":"Quality Game","timestamp_created":1386424023,"timestamp_updated":1386424023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7952519","author":{"steamid":"76561198078898246","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":705,"last_played":1649042462},"language":"english","review":"This game is Awesome.

The concept is great, but there is no actual material in the story throughout the game. I never really though about the story, as I had with games such as BioShock, System Shock 2, and The  Walking Dead. It could be improved greatly with the addition of more important characters and plot twists, which fortunately are more prominent in the episodes.\n-No connection to the first game, save for a few subtle references. If you were a complete outsider to the series, you would not know that HL2 was the sequel to Half-Life. I would have liked to have seen an immediate continuation of Half-Life's story rather than a completely new one set many years later.\n\nDue to all this, HL2 does sadly feel like you just run-n-gun. There's very little thought involved, you don't care or know much about any of the characters, and story is almost nonexistent. Say every character (other than the enemies) was removed, you would not notice much of a difference.\n\nHowever, it HL2 is GREAT run-n-gun.

Na początku widzimy twarz znanego z pierwszej części gry G-mana, który opowiada nam pewną historię. Gdy tajemniczy człowiek  w garniturze zniknie budzimy się w wagonie jadącego pociągu. Jedziemy nim chwile, aż w pewnym momencie pociąg staje i wysiadamy na peronie miasta City 17. Niestety nie wiemy w jaki sposób znaleźliśmy się w tym miejscu (chyba że graliście w jedynkę, to się sami domyślicie) i do końca gry nie zostanie to nam wyjaśnione. W późniejszych etapach gry poznamy wiele postaci, które będą nam pomagały lub szkodziły. Dowiemy się również w jakim celu przyjechaliśmy do City 17. Jest to zalążek złożonej fabuły tej gry, więc jeżeli chcecie poznać dalsze losy Gordona Freemana sięgnijcie po Tę grę.\n\n \nTechnikalia\n\nPierwsze co od razu rzuca się w oczy po rozpoczęciu gry to bardzo realistyczna grafika oraz wiernie oddane prawa fizyki. Wielu graczy (w tym ja) nie palili się do drążenia fabuły, lecz do zabawy fizyką świata. Wrzucanie puszek do kosza, przesuwanie walizek, rzucanie przedmiotami, tłuczenie butelek czy układanie skrzyń pozostaje na długo w pamięci. Jednak są to tylko początkowe zachwyty, gdyż cała zabawa zaczyna się gdy dostaniemy w swoje ręce Karabin grawitacyjny, którym na odległość możemy przyciągać i rzucać różnymi przedmiotami, a nawet nim ciosać. Cała fizyka została tak sprytnie wkomponowana w rozgrywkę, że bez niej nie można by było dalej rozwijać fabuły. Jeżeli chodzi o grafikę to również jest powalająca, mimo długiego upływu czasu. W grze występuje wiele postaci niezależnych, których wygląd (przede wszystkim twarz) zostały wiernie odwzorowana, również wygląd przeciwników jest świetny. Jeżeli chodzi o lokacje w których przyjdzie nam toczyć boje, są one różnorodne (City 17, Wybrzeże, Cytadela, Opustoszałe miasto Ravenholm ) - ich wygląd jest jak i  cała grafika niesamowity. \n\nW porównaniu wymagań gry do takiego Doom'a 3, Far Cry'a czy F.E.A.R.-a są one niewygórowane, a pod względem graficzny spokojnie może z nimi konkurować. Taki efekt udało się uzyskać dzięki silnikowi Source. Silnik ten jest tak zaprojektowany aby wyświetlać dobrą grafikę przy jak najmniejszym obciążeniu sprzętu i stąd te niskie wymagania sprzętowe -  Valve pokazało jak należy robić gry.\nJeżeli chodzi o dźwięk, to trzyma on poziom. Dobrze brzmią odbicia kul (odgłos zależy od materiału w jaki uderzy pocisk), aktorzy podkładający głosy postaciom też wywiązują się z powierzonego im zadania.\nMuzyka również jest zrobiona mistrzowsko.\n\n \n\nArsenał i przeciwnicy\n\nW grze dostępny jest raczej standardowy arsenał, a są to: pistolet, Strzelba, karabin maszynowy, karabin pulsacyjny, kusza, granaty, karabin grawitacyjny i oczywiście łom, który stał się znakiem rozpoznawczym całej serii. Jednak po co nam broń jeżeli nie mamy godnych siebie przeciwników. W tej grze występuje kilka rodzajów przeciwników, których musimy pokonać. Podstawowymi ludźmi zagrażającymi naszemu zdrowiu są żołnierze Kombinatu, czyli organizacji, która porozumiała się z Dr Breenem (były przełożony głównego bohatera, a obecnie człowiek sprawujący władze nad City 17). Żołnierze tejże organizacji są wyposażeni w pistolety, a z biegiem czasu w karabiny maszynowe i pulsacyjne. Następnym zagrożeniem są różnego rodzaju potwory jak lwie mrówki, headcraby czy maszkary zwieszające swój język. Ostatnia grupa przeciwników to maszyny, których używa Kombinat, a są to kanonierki i stridery. Te pierwsze to latające maszyny a'la helikopter (a może samolot ?) i strzelające do nas z działek pulsacyjnych, natomiast stridery to wysokie i potężne roboty chodzące na swoich trzech długich nogach i niszczące wszystko co stoi im na drodze swoimi działkami.\n\n \n\nCo dalej ?\n\nPierwsza część Half–Life`a doczekała się kilku dodatków a jak będzie z tą odsłoną ? Otóż do tej pory ukazały się trzy dodatki. Pierwszy o nazwie Lost Coast - to bardziej prezentacja nowej technologii HDR niż kontynuacja przygód dzielnego naukowca, natomiast drugi, Episode one, którego premiera odbyła się 31 Maja jest bezpośrednią kontynuacją „dwójki”, jak i \"Episode Two\" będącą kontynuacją Episode 1.\n\n \n\nKrótkie Podsumowanie\n\nPodsumowując Half–Life 2 jest bardzo dobrą grą z wspaniałą grafiką i fizyką oraz fabułą.  Wielu recenzentów oraz graczy skarżyło się, że w grze nie ma nic co by ją wyróżniało, ani nic rewolucyjnego jak zapowiadano, lecz uważam, że jest to uwaga trochę „nawyrost”, gdyż nawet gdyby gra była idealna podczas czekania na nią rozbudziła takie nadzieje, które nikt nie był w stanie spełnić.\n\n\nOcena\n\n9,8/10","timestamp_created":1386145299,"timestamp_updated":1386145751,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629368424415588379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7907352","author":{"steamid":"76561198016147560","num_games_owned":1619,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1045,"last_played":1376507829},"language":"russian","review":"Эту серию не зря называют культовой, Half-Life это феномен, уход от привычных рамок FPS того времени. В отличии от, популярных в то время Doom и Quake, в Half -Life во главу угла поставлен сюжет. Наконец-то непрекращающееся кровопролитие получило логическое обоснование. Типичная история шутеров того времени сводится к тому, что плохие ребята напали на Землю, и только бравый ноу-нейм солдатик может спасти человество, что он и делает, уничтожая огромную армаду всяких тварей и умножая их империю на ноль. В Half -Life такого нет, и в этом его преимущество. Сюжет всех частей великолепно связан, особенно это видно на примере эпизодов. Отдельно стоит отметить движок Source, сказать что он хорош - это ничего не сказать, потрясающее качество изображения (не как в Крайзисе конечно, но мы же не графоманы) и отличная физика Havok при скромных системных требованиях.
