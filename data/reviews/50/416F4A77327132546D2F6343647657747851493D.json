Было добавлено новое оружие, были добавлены новые фишки в виде верёвок, по которым можно карабкаться, а также ручной барнакл, который сделает из персонажа эдакого Человека-Паука (Если найти правильное место). Были добавлены новые противники, но это уже мелочи, хотя представляют они загадочную расу X (Икс), о которых скажу чуть ниже\n10/10\n\n[h1]Сюжет[/h1]\n\nЕсли с геймплеем стало ещё лучше, то с сюжетом наоборот - стало чуть хуже. История расскажет о Капрале HECU Адриане Шепарде, который с начала операции в Чёрной Мезе попал в неприятную ситуацию и смог вернуться в строй только к началу эвакуации войск. И если Гордон всю игру пытался остановить каскадный резонанс, то Адриан будет пытаться выбраться из комплекса. Также в игру вступают новые инопланетные захватчики из мира X,  которые, хоть, и имеют новые фишки, но явно вдохновлены войсками Зена, которым так и не дали хоть какую-то историю в отличии от их \"старших\" собратьев из того-же Зена\n5/10\n\n[h1]Графика[/h1]\n\nОна (Как и впрочем - в остальных дополнениях) остался на том-же уровне и если хотите узнать мнение, то прошу на мой обзор оригинальной игры https://steamcommunity.com/id/Drezih/recommended/70/\nА тут - просто оставлю оценку\n9/10\n\n[h1]Саундтрек[/h1]\n\nУж не знаю, Кейли Байли-ли писал музыку для дополнений, но тут тоже всё чуть, но хуже, чем в оригинале. Саундтрек не плох, не мешает, но и запомниться он не может. Могу лишь на слух вспомнить пару композиций из-за их военной тематики (Хотя-бы тот-же Orbit), но названия вы вряд-ли запомните (Даже только сейчас вспомнил ранее упомянутую композицию)\n6/10\n\n[h1] Онлайн [/h1]\n\nЧто-то писать особенного не буду. Опять-же можете глянуть обзор на оригинал. Но опишу пару различий от онлайна в оригинале. Во-первых - сюда добавили оружие из дополнения. Во-вторых - появился новый режим (Для своего времени) под названием \"Захват Флага\", что также было перенесено из Quake. Уже здесь были только команды (Учёных и военных), которые воровали друг у друга флаги. И вроде-бы хороша была затея, когда вышло дополнение, но, как писал выше - вначале люди ругали данное дополнение за сюжет отступающий от канонов оригинала. И именно из-за этого - сервера. как пустовали, так и пустуют по сей день, лишь имея очень малый поток игроков на паре-тройке серверов. И по всей этой причине, я не могу поставить оценку выше, чем у оригинала, несмотря на улучшение геймплея посредством ввода нового контента. Но если вам хочется новых ощущений, а качать моды на оригинал неохота, то могу посоветовать поиграть в онлайне данного дополнения.\n8/10\n\n[h1]Вердикт[/h1]\n\nНесмотря на все ухудшения дополнения - самое главное она улучшила для Half-Life, а именно геймплей. Будь эта игра на часа два больше для прохождения, то могла-бы даже метить на отдельную часть серии. В любом случае - это самая недооценённое дополнение во всей серии, хотя-бы из-за добавления расы X, но при этом - сейчас эта часть пользуется чуть-ли не той-же любовью как и оригинал. Дополнение я советую всем, а также, в особенности, всем любителям скоростных шутеров (Хотя тут больше мест, где играет не скорость, а правильная позиционка)\n10/10","timestamp_created":1612304108,"timestamp_updated":1626125839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85843018","author":{"steamid":"76561198143348334","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":837,"last_played":1658003053},"language":"english","review":"[i]Follow along the footsteps of Corporal Adrian Shepard who is a H.E.C.U soldier that was sent to Black Mesa after the Resonance Cascade.

Но всё же, перекрестных моментов как в другом аддоне, а именно Blue Shift, здесь куда меньше. А вот геймплей стал масштабнее - появилось новое интересное оружие, хотя как по мне, геймплей всё же не такой динамичный, как в той же оригинальной халфе. Ещё можно заметить разницу в геймдизайне, ибо этот аддон делали не Valve, а Gearbox, из-за этого геймдизайн стал какой-то более однотипный, в том же Blue Shift от тех же Gearbox он куда разнобразнее.

In that regard, I am going to consider Opposing Force its own game.\nOut the gate Opposing Force is testing players with combat and problem solving - it doesn't have a slow tram ride to the start like base Half-Life. That being said, the feeling of a world that's slowly getting more chaotic isn't there - by the time you start playing, the Resonance Cascade is well into effect, and by the time Freeman enters Xen at the end of Half-Life, Adrian Shephard is only halfway through his journey in Opposing Force.\nDespite how disconnected it is from the feeling of the base game, Opposing Force also contributes on its own. New enemies and weapons keep combat fresh and nonrepetitive, and unlike in Half-Life I felt pushed to approach combat situations in new ways each time. The story, while disconnected from Freeman's, still contributes to Half-Life by explaining the other side of the story - hence the name \"Opposing Force.\"\nOne issue I have is that it's significantly less challenging than base Half-Life. Overpowered weapons can feel satisfying if used properly, but about halfway through the game you're granted just about every overpowered weapon in the game and ammunition is plentiful. The pistol you START WITH can two shot most enemies in the game - that's some Halo: Combat Evolved pistol/Hunter stuff.\nDespite these flaws, I enjoyed Opposing Force. I don't see it as a waste of time, and it's an admittedly short experience. I think that people exploring the Half-Life series should pick up Opposing Force and experience it for themselves. It's a shame that Adrian will probably never appear in a Half-Life game again.","timestamp_created":1611779441,"timestamp_updated":1611779441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85455296","author":{"steamid":"76561198407483816","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1612365091},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1611772090,"timestamp_updated":1611772090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85446069","author":{"steamid":"76561199123305916","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1611760704},"language":"english","review":"Good game.

Opposing Force is notable for having plenty of custom content, slightly harder difficulty, and a new point of view of the Black Mesa incident. Unlike my other reviews, I can't simply divide this into two sections, the good and the bad. The good and the bad tend to meld into one another. Anyways, let's get into it.\n\nOpposing Force doesn't really have any big changes from Half Life 1. If you liked the original, you'll like this. The levels, despite their linearity, are still fun. Thankfully, Opposing Force tends to be a bit more open at times (For example, the creatures studies lab). Also, I thought the incorporation of Half Life 1 levels was pretty neat, even if it didn't make the most sense at times. (The part of chapter 3 where you see the radio guy from surface tension doesn't even take place at the same time of day as surface tension.) \n\nThe new content is where things aren't so great. I really like most of the new enemies, but two in particular get annoying at times. The feds, and the Shock Troopers. The feds have a bigger role in this game's story, as it would be kind of weird if Adrian, the marine you play as, would be killing other marines. The feds, at least the male variant, are from what I can tell more aggressive HECU marines. And if you've played chapter 9 of Half Life 1, I'm sure you know that the female assassins can get annoying at times. So, you have the perfect storm of being pissed off by them. The Shock Troopers are from a new race introduced specifically for Opposing Force, Race X. I like most of the Race X enemies, but the Shock Trooper is very annoying at times, especially during Foxtrot Uniform. They're like the marines from Half Life 1, except are more difficult and drop a pesky little bugger to deal with when dead. And since their living weapon is tiny, it's not always obvious when you've killed it.\n\nThere's no mistake, however, the new content brings interesting things to the table. While some weapons are practically just reskins of others, most new ones do something different, and most new enemies do something different as well. I really liked the encounters in Opposing Force, as most of them were quite memorable and fun. The battle with the Pit Drones in the ventilation system of Chapter 7, and basically all of Foxtrot Uniform come to mind. Also, the Barnacle Gun and the Displacer are such cool ideas.\n\nSo, while Opposing Force's custom content is part of what holds it back, it's problems aren't a deal breaker, and I still had a lot of fun with this entry. If you liked Half Life 1 or Blue Shift, but were looking for some new elements to spice things up, give this a try.","timestamp_created":1611558730,"timestamp_updated":1611558730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85304437","author":{"steamid":"76561198400896757","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1611545299},"language":"english","review":"i highly recommend opposing forces, new weapons, new enemy types, and longer than blue shift. worth your time","timestamp_created":1611545471,"timestamp_updated":1611545471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566756963729858398","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85302846","author":{"steamid":"76561199053648778","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":449,"last_played":1611542819},"language":"spanish","review":"ta¨ bonito \n","timestamp_created":1611542867,"timestamp_updated":1611542867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85302578","author":{"steamid":"76561199088792223","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":482,"last_played":1625724547},"language":"english","review":"gr8 game","timestamp_created":1611542406,"timestamp_updated":1611542406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85298830","author":{"steamid":"76561198986410870","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":404,"last_played":1611782096},"language":"russian","review":"Одна из странных (ИМХО) игр из серии, но игра вполне хороша.
