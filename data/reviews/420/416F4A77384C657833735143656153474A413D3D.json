Bref, je ne me concentrerai que sur cet Episode Two, referez vous a mon avis sur HL2 pour avoir une idée du jeu de base si ce n'est déjà fait. Et bien entendu cet avis est volontairement vague afin de ne rien spoiler et particulièrement subjectif comme a mon habitude.\n\nEP2, bien qu'il reprenne et continu les bases de HL2 ainsi que de EP1, nous emmène vraiment a l'apogée de la guerre contre le Cartel et de cette recherche incessante de réponses a nos questions. Si l'aspect visuel ne change pas, nous avons par contre droit a un level design tout simplement magistral. Sans être bien sur immense, le terrain de jeu est suffisamment grand pour donner un sentiment de liberté profonde. La ou au début de l'aventure ( cf. HL2, début EP1 ) l'oppression se faisait sentir, on vois clairement que nous sommes maintenant au moment ou le monde se relève et ou Gordon Freeman en a plein le c** du Cartel et consorts. Pleins de belles trouvailles en lien avec la physique du jeu sont présentes, et on se marre même assez souvent. Le bestiaire accueille de nouveaux venus ( enfin ! ) et vous allez maudire les devs d’être aussi imaginatifs. L'IA est toujours aussi retord et en difficulté élevée vous allez avoir un vrai challenge, sans parler des scènes vraiment épiques qui vous feront perdre quelques gouttes de sueur croyez moi. Vraiment, le travail derrière cette extension est pas mal plus présent que dans le premier Episode. Le scenario continu son chemin, mais malheureusement malgré le fait qu'il réponde a quelques interrogations, il ouvre tellement d'autres portes qu'on dévore le reste du jeu trop vite ( il est plus long que EP1, mais reste un Episode trop court a mon gout ) et au final on reste sur une faim énorme...( j’espère que vous comprenez ).., d'autant qu'on se rappelle de suite que HL2 Episode Three n'a jamais vu le jour a l'heure ou j’écris cet avis ( et je pense que c'est mal parti pour qu'il arrive un jour... )...ça, ça fait mal.\n\nEn conclusion, grand jeu, grande série, tout gamer doit avoir au moins une fois dans sa vie jouer a HL2 pour prétendre avoir une quelconque culture videoludique...blablabla...je vois même pas ce que vous faites encore la, allez y jouer !","timestamp_created":1398648880,"timestamp_updated":1398648880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9952636","author":{"steamid":"76561198074240707","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1570,"last_played":1546662475},"language":"english","review":"Half life 2: Episode Two is an amazing game.

As a fan of the Half Life series this game enticed me and gave me a massive stiffy and I just cannot wait for HL2Ep3/HL3 myself.\nPS: Get it with The Orange Box if you don't have the other games as The Orange Box is a real bargain with 4 amazing games for just 20 bucks, also do not miss HL1, I suggest playing Black Mesa, however the only problem with that however is that Black Mesa lacks the final level/chapter (\"Xen\"), which may actually be a good thing :P.

This game is really split into two different parts for me, the part up until leaving the caves, and then the part after that. The first part resembles Episode One greatly, very tight enviorments and not as memorable. However, the second half of the game is absolutly amazing. The most open world Half Life has ever gotten! The scale just gets so much larger! One of the most notable differences are the Hunters. They are kinda like a smaller version of the Striders. They are yet another unique enemy that takes a lot to get it down. (And they travel in packs, so watch out for more than just one!) There is another driving sequence which is better than all pervious, and the last playable part in this game is so frustrating and yet so rewarding. And the ending... Lets just say Half Life 3 needs to get here now... \n\nPros:\n+Everything Half Life\n+Story\n+Open enviroments\n\nNeutral:\n*First half of the game\n\nNegitive:\n-No Half Life 3\n\nOverall: This was tough... 9.5/10 If only the first half was as good as the second! Then it would be perfect! I personally think the second half was better than even the orginal Half Life 2! But again, do not buy this seperatly, please get the Orange Box.","timestamp_created":1394952107,"timestamp_updated":1394952261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504727602005004883","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9490489","author":{"steamid":"76561198040241806","num_games_owned":509,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1607110722},"language":"french","review":"Un des jeu les plus marquant de l'histoire du jeux vidéo . un trés bon gameplay , le moteur source , les armes , les ennemie etc .....\n","timestamp_created":1394905837,"timestamp_updated":1394905837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9471174","author":{"steamid":"76561198069626998","num_games_owned":387,"num_reviews":94,"playtime_forever":682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1427998408},"language":"english","review":"Amazing. 10/10","timestamp_created":1394835952,"timestamp_updated":1394835952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9465200","author":{"steamid":"76561198111889552","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1394615591},"language":"english","review":"Another great continuation to the series. Enjoyed the new weapons and enemies. Was a bit repetitive, definetely if you have all of the Half Life series and have played through them several times. Still massively fun. Except for the last chapter, which I won't spoil, but is a massive battle which will determine how much your mouse and keyboard gets beaten.
