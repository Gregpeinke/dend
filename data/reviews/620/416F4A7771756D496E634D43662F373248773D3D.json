Pas une perle, j'ai bien dit une pelle.\nCar avec Portal2, vous allez vous creuser la cervelle comme jamais auparavant.\n\nPour ceux qui ne connaitraient pas encore le principe, c'est simple sur le papier: un lance-portails dans les mains qui peut créer au maximum 2 portails connectés sur les murs, sols, plafonds. A vous de mettre en route la matière grise pour sortir des salles de test et autres chambres de torture encéphalique.\n\nEn apparence, c'est simple.\nMais quand l'ordi le plus débile de tous les temps obtient toutes les clés des labos Aperture, ça va se révéler mauvais pour votre espérance de vie.\nEn plus des portails, vous aurez à disposition différents gels (de propulsion, de répulsion, de conversion...) qui enrichissent encore les niveaux et augmentent les possibilités du jeu. Merci donc aux étudiants de DigiPen pour cette merveilleuse idée.\n\nA noter un mode COOP à 2 (donc 4 portails, vous suivez?) pas spécialement difficile si vous avez un minimum d'expérience dans le jeu, mais sa durée de vie peut être prolongée à l'infini grâce au Workshop et ses petites abeilles bénévoles qui butinent sans cesse pour nous apporter de nouveaux levels, parfois extrêmement complexes.\n\nDe longues heures de fun et de réflexion.\nYou are now thinking with portals.\n\nPS: Attention, les skin de personnalisation des robots sont buggés et n'apparaissent pas en jeu, inutile donc de dépenser votre argent dans le shop sachant que Valve n'a pas l'air pressé de réparer le bug ou de rembourser les joueurs.","timestamp_created":1388304353,"timestamp_updated":1409664869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545743286609649658","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8390044","author":{"steamid":"76561198052101505","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1388244591},"language":"russian","review":"Что тут сказать.
