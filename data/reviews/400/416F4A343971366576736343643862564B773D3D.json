Despite being only a few hours long, at no point does it feel rushed, incomplete, or anti-climatic. The levels present the story with subtle and organic touches. There is no need for immersion-breaking exposition as it is either an obvious bit of the setting itself or it's cleverly woven in as a part of the puzzle or scenery. Very little information is given about the protagonist which works to further immerse the player in the role. If you pay attention you can learn her name and appearance, but there's no background or dialogue for her. And with no one to respond to anything she would say, you are free to be her voice yourself. While the story component is fantastic for a game so short, what makes Portal great is well-designed puzzles centered around an interesting gimmick. Portal travel shifts physics in such a way as to make the impossible slightly more possible, that is all. As a gimmick it has a strong root in real concepts and only twists the familiar, thus providing a new way to look at a law that governs our lives. The frequency of puzzles can increase later in the game as you'll find their solutions second nature, so they won't slow you down.

Причём классика от самой VALVe, которая может производить не только добротные шутеры, но и столь же добротные головоломки. Да-да-да, я знаю, что такой инновационный геймплей был создан не компанией VALVe, а создателями игры Narbacular Drop, про которую, к сожалению, сейчас мало кто помнит. А сейчас перейдём к самой Portal.\nЧто касается сюжета - тут он прост как банка пива. Проходим 20 тестовых испытаний(не 19, а 20, потому что первая камера имеет номер 00) под наставления GLaDOs - суперкомпьютера с женским голосом, которая за управление Aperture Science наградила своих создателей смертельными дозами нейротоксина. Так вот, проходим все тестовые камеры, понимаем, что GLaDOS хочет нас убить, сбегаем, а потом ликвидируем этот суперкомпьютер. Ах да, а ещё слушаем в титрах небезызвестную Still Alive. К слову, сама песня раньше была довольна популярна и даже вырвалась за пределы игры, став чуть ли не самостоятельным мемом. Ещё одним мемом была фраза The Cake is a Lie. Тот самый торт, к которому нас торопила GLaDOS и который оказался ложью. Впрочем, торт один раз можно увидеть в самом конце игры. \nПравда, у игры есть один недостаток - это её продожительность. Автор этого обзора умудрился пройти игру за 42 минуты 55 секунд, хотя на YouTube можно найти и видео, на которых прохождение Portal занимает не меньше 10 минут.

Students working on a game called Narbacular Drop, which has similar mechanics to Portal, were hired by Valve to continue its development. Portal became the fruit of their development. The team indicated that the limiting constraints under which they developed the game contributed to its success. The game is a first-person puzzle game, where you play as Chell, who finds herself in an eerie, pristine test chamber in  a vast laboratory building. Her antagonist is GLaDOS, a seemingly light-hearted AI, who guides you through the series of test chambers. Later, you find that GLaDOS is actually quite sinister.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nI feel that Portal's story is told in a fashion that's truly unique to video games. There's a true sense that you're working toward finding answers, yet you're never expressly told to \"Go here to advance story\", or never told \"Press X to not die\". It's very hard to put into words, but the story almost feels like it's not there unless you choose to investigate and look more closely. The fact that it's told so subtly seems to make it stand out in my memory. I feel like Metroid Prime on the GameCube is very similar in this fashion.\n\nI understand this is all vague sounding, and not really explaining the story itself, but if you've yet to play Portal, the less you know about it, the better.\n\n[h1]Physics![/h1]\n\nThis game's core portal mechanic has to be the funnest way to get around in a video game. The game revolves around interacting with two spatially linked portals placed on flat surfaces. You use this mechanic to move objects, and yourself, in various creative ways.\n\nThe gameplay feels mindbending and visceral, since the rate at which you're accelerating when you enter a portal reflects your acceleration as you exit the other. By the end of the game, you're doing some really creative things, and there's still probably many tactics and solutions you'd never consider.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\n\nPersonally, I found the game's difficulty to be tuned very well. I was never super frustrated, yet finding some solutions felt very satisfying.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nOverall, I can see why this game is considered such a classic. Every facet of the game just works well, and the story and gameplay work very well together. I'd have to say that GLaDOS is one of the best written characters I've seen in a while. It's all in the subtlty of the writing and Ellen McLain's voice acting. A lot of games these days really need to take a queue from this game and understand that subtle story telling can have a far greater impact.","timestamp_created":1406571206,"timestamp_updated":1406571206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11451759","author":{"steamid":"76561198107890900","num_games_owned":497,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1405475493},"language":"english","review":"Something about this game gives me a headache and nausea every time I play it.

GLaDOS makes for one of the best \"Villains\" of a game in a long time, being delightfully sadistic as the story deepens. \n\nAfter the completion of the story there are challenge chambers to complete, which are more difficult than the puzzles you encountered in the story.
