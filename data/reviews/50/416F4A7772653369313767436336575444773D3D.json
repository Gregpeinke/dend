The story has that familiar Half-Life flair despite it being produced by Gearbox. For multiplayer, there aren't many active servers anymore, but there are tons of custom maps (literally thousands) so the replay value is very large, especially if you're starting late in playing it (many years late).

This has less jumping puzzles and irritating distractions from the core gameplay, which is definitely welcome. It is considerably more challenging, I should add; but in the right way.\n\nMy overall verdict is that this is one of the best FPSs ever made. I don't want to go on for too long, and my Half-Life review covers most aspects of this game. All I have to say is that this improves on the gameplay even more and ultimately surpasses the original Half-Life in fun value.","timestamp_created":1378951274,"timestamp_updated":1378951274,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512135922908782959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7139093","author":{"steamid":"76561198088218475","num_games_owned":558,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":102,"last_played":1505287519},"language":"english","review":"You want a decent Half-Life 1 game that's cheap?

This is one of them.\n\nBuilding on the already genre defining work of Half Life, Opposing Force is perhaps my favourite of HL1.\nThis expansion pack puts you in the jack-boots of cult favourite Adrian Shepard, and kits you up in a uniform that is all too familiar to the Freeman and Half Life players.\nAs one of the military spec ops. marines, you'll see the Black Mesa incident from an entirely new perspective. So even before you exam the gameplay, this is a brilliant piece for fleshing out the story.\n\nBut the gameplay is actually what makes OF work: It is, in my opinion, of a higher standard than the original game and introduces some fantastic ideas and elemants to the experiance. The player's arsenal increases exponentially, with a dismounted barnacle, electro-laser-xen gun, a teleportation device and the legendary SAW deserving special mention. You'll find no shortage of ways to splatter, maim and exact severe trauma on the interlopers of Xen !\nThe slightly dodgy squad system can be lived with and is very rarely a problem.\n\nI recommend this with passion and zeal. A genuinely great piece of work that for me ticks more boxes than the Original Half Life.\n\nThis is for Half Life fans, story fanatics and for those who may be forgetting just why Half Life is the monolith to the gaming industry that it is.\n\nBuy now!","timestamp_created":1377697870,"timestamp_updated":1389740308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5563810","author":{"steamid":"76561198051993563","num_games_owned":384,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1401560092},"language":"bulgarian","review":"Като Half-Life, просто още.","timestamp_created":1377036309,"timestamp_updated":1377036309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614147961139678955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5015691","author":{"steamid":"76561198044212412","num_games_owned":492,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":1067,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1067,"last_played":1581589310},"language":"english","review":"Bring back Shepard","timestamp_created":1375671908,"timestamp_updated":1581589378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6330028","author":{"steamid":"76561198063927329","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5366,"last_played":1466699751},"language":"english","review":"Multiplayer is amazingly fun\n","timestamp_created":1375416027,"timestamp_updated":1375416027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7072137","author":{"steamid":"76561198085002055","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":1638,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1420,"last_played":1519166054},"language":"english","review":"The best expansion\nNew weapons make a new feel\nAnd it's pretty long","timestamp_created":1375042271,"timestamp_updated":1518664910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5458513","author":{"steamid":"76561198050096226","num_games_owned":608,"num_reviews":88,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1434723088},"language":"english","review":"I'd say this is the best half life game.\n\nIt's the base Half Life game but with much more content like new weapons and enemies to deal with, it also has more action go on too.

Most fights take place in corridor/small-medium rooms, so keep that shotgun hotkeyed. Mostly you fight aliens, as you are a marine this time around. The enemy is exactly as the alien enemy was in half-life plus a few new baddies (that were borring but not detrimental to the fun). \n\n  The level design is linear, but made intereting by having elegantly masked  the progression path with enviornmental puzzles. These puzzles involve shooting explosives to break open a new path, and/or moving crates to reach vents and other areas. The puzzles are rarely stumping/frusterating, yet their sollution gives the illusion of cleverness, which is a satisfying addition to the bad-ass feeling you get from the combat. \n\n  Music is used very occasionally, often to signify an event that lacks the momentum the sudden and intense music clips would have you expecting. The rest of the sounds are exactly the same as half-life 1. Again this is a half-life level pack, not a sequel or prequel.\n\n  As far as story, you're one of the nameless marine grunts gordon kills. Thinks get fubar quick, and pretty soon your alone in black-mesa rushing to meet the evacuating remains of the marines. The story is dictated through the occasional human npcs. The dialogue makes references to the half-life universe and games without really adding to the half-life plot itself. This game can be skipped from the canonical half-life series if you only care about the story.\n  \n  Its worth the time if you remind yourself to expect a solid level pack , it's just a seamless collection of worth-while (and occasionally excellent) half-life levels.","timestamp_created":1357715638,"timestamp_updated":1357715638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504561901092529297","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6189213","author":{"steamid":"76561198060869595","num_games_owned":778,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":1397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1059,"last_played":1636360107},"language":"english","review":"Great expansion with fun weapons.

I definitely like it better than Half Life.","timestamp_created":1349212292,"timestamp_updated":1349212292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1898225","author":{"steamid":"76561197999450389","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1616626537},"language":"danish","review":"dette spil er noget af det bedse half life har lave og har spille det siden jeg var lille men det var demoen men det er mega fedt yo!!! :D","timestamp_created":1347569338,"timestamp_updated":1347569338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4338894","author":{"steamid":"76561198035704742","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1954,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1954,"last_played":1543161465},"language":"english","review":"Still runs like a dream","timestamp_created":1347142543,"timestamp_updated":1543161564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6261046","author":{"steamid":"76561198062370302","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":896,"last_played":1437530083},"language":"english","review":"epic game","timestamp_created":1346706005,"timestamp_updated":1346706005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3685431","author":{"steamid":"76561198026047370","num_games_owned":505,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1558718843},"language":"english","review":"One awesome expansion pack for Half Life, letting you play in the boots of a USMC Marine.
