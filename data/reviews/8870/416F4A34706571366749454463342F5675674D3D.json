The problem lied in the level design, the exploration wasn't really interesting while it had some decent parts the lack of interactions with the environment rendered the experience a bit bland.\n\nThe writing is good, it's story-driven so it's a change of pace from its predecessors but it was well executed even with how convoluted it was. The characters were interesting with the chemistry between Booker and Elizabeth as the best part but the Lucetes were quite entertaining as well. The only problem I have here is the lack of player agency, it feels like a drawback for a Bioshock game. \n\nNow this is the crux of my problems with Infinite, the gameplay is streamlined in many ways. There is no more bullet types (instead of 3 per gun) , the gun variety is lacking, there is a carrying capacity of 2 guns (instead of no limit), the upgrades felt mostly insignificant, the amount of customization with upgrades is severely limited, the vigors(plasmids) felt tacked on, the more interesting vigors are found way too late into the game and vigor upgrades felt mostly insignificant. The gunplay was alright but because of there are no more bullet types and a lack of gun variety the enemies are also handled the same way every time so there is no more strategy to maximise bullet efficiency or how to approach tougher enemies. Another issue is how it's basically going from one arena to the other, most of the combat is the player entering an area which gets locked up until everything is dead with as little exploration or down time as possible in-between. There is also no more hacking and there is a lack of interactions with vigors and the environment. It's not too unbearable and I can still find some enjoyment out of it but it's certainly a letdown. \n\nSome positives for gameplay are the tears that can sort of summon allies, supplies or an environmental element to help in combat and the sky-lines were fun to make fights more fast paced in large areas.\n\nOverall, I think it's worth playing and can recommend it but be aware that it's noticeably different from Bioshock 1 and 2 if you had a lot of love for them you might get a little homesick but if you can overcome that there is a fun experience to be had.","timestamp_created":1653838521,"timestamp_updated":1653838521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116198777","author":{"steamid":"76561198827112352","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":680,"last_played":1653838421},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo foda, plot incrível.

first two games were amazing, and were definitely worth the price. However, Infinite was... not. I had heard good things about it and enjoyed the first two games, so I was really hoping this would be the best of the three. The graphics and weapon system seemed to be the best, at least. However, the gameplay actually took a step back from Bioshock 2 in my opinion, and the story was awful. It's so filled with plot holes and superficial depth.\n\nThe story shows you this beautiful new world in the clouds, and a girl with strange powers, and then proceeds to do nothing with them. The city itself, in fact, is barely important, and is only a backdrop to the astoundingly mediocre story filled with bad writing and plot holes. The game is incredibly disappointing in a series known for it's amazing story. \n\n(To all the fans out there saying I just don't understand the story or the plot and that's why I dislike it, I promise you I don't. I played through the game and DLC multiple times, watched videos on the timeline, and everything. And the more you see, the worse it gets.

Si con mi notebook viejita en 2013 lo disfrute en gráficos bajos y a menos de 30 fps, y ahora que pude concretar la adquisición de una notebook gamer, lo he disfrutado aún más corriendo al mismo con gráficos en ultra y a +60 fps. Pasaron los años pero su disfrute no cambio.\n\nGráficos: Al máximo es una belleza y eso que tiene sus años.\nDificultad: Lo pasé en la dificultad máxima y me saco un par de veces unas canas.\nHistoria: Muy linda, en todo momento te deja con ganas de saber más y el cierre te deja asombrado.\nIdioma: Lo pude disfrutar en mi idioma nativo.\nSonido: Muy linda melodía.\n\nRecomiendo este juego, pero aún mas es la coleccion, que trae los tres bioshock ( 1 y  2 remasterizados). El 1 ya lo termine y me falta el 2.\n","timestamp_created":1653579758,"timestamp_updated":1653579758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552404463291168213","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116042861","author":{"steamid":"76561197968242518","num_games_owned":3512,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":1902,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1902,"last_played":1458273488},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game also the whole Bioshock collection is free on Epic this week  :D","timestamp_created":1653579068,"timestamp_updated":1653579068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":105,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.799735784530639648","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116042086","author":{"steamid":"76561198239419270","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":127,"last_played":1653576891},"language":"schinese","review":"有很多好的游戏，不需要剧情就可以让人爱不释手；也有很多款走路模拟器，不需要玩法也可以靠故事打动人心。\n而这个游戏就两边不讨好。\n玩之前看到所有人都在夸剧情，玩了两个小时玩到塔上，基本没看见剧情，除了欣赏风景（美工确实值得称赞）就是无休无止的跳出来一堆敌人——射死——再跳出来一堆敌人。我在欣赏环境设计和人物台词的时候突然被单调重复的射击过程打断，非常迷茫；在专注扫射敌人啥也不想只想爆头的时候又突然大家都跪下了不打了跑出来一个先知跟我说话，我又非常迷茫。玩到最后感觉哪怕剧情再神，我也不想在一路扫射的间隙去一个碎片一个碎片的拼这个神剧情了。\n个人的感想是建议视频通关，可以自由的看剧情跳射击，或者视频通关都太碎片化了的话直接找个文字剧情简介就完了。","timestamp_created":1653578021,"timestamp_updated":1653578021,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116042071","author":{"steamid":"76561199013044404","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1595134940},"language":"schinese","review":"我是sb，又被背刺了","timestamp_created":1653577998,"timestamp_updated":1653577998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116042058","author":{"steamid":"76561198147408720","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1468,"last_played":1653743890},"language":"english","review":"The game is so good, beautiful atmosphere, colorful, and love every statue in this game, felt so majestic, seeing floating city is like my dream come true, I may replay it again just for the atmosphere, cant get enough sight seeing, and the story is good it still plaque my mind after ending, what I hate is I cant even search for fanfic without haunted by \"sweet home alabama\" song in my mind,","timestamp_created":1653577979,"timestamp_updated":1653578256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116041971","author":{"steamid":"76561199246887480","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":309,"last_played":1653555675},"language":"schinese","review":"我是煞笔","timestamp_created":1653577831,"timestamp_updated":1653577831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4peq6gIEDc4/VugM="}
