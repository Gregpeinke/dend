A rich and finely crafted floating city is a nice change of scenery from previous Bioshock games. It starts off simple. Get up there, jail break a girl named Elizabeth out of there. Knowing this is a Ken Levine game, plot twists are expected! The story incorporates the concept of multiverse and inter-dimension travelling cleverly. The ending is definitely thought provoking as it leaves you wanting for more answers! As for Elizabeth, unlike most companions; they end up obstructing the door way (Looking at you Lydia). Elizabeth doesn't impede your progress in anyway so you don't need to fus ro dah her out of the way and she's helpful providing ammo or potion when you need it the most. Game mechanics wise, It plays similar to Bioshock 2. Weapons on 1 hand, vigors on the other. \n\nBurial at sea DLC is probably one of the most well made DLCs. Episode 1 you play as Booker and Elizabeth in the second. The former is more combat oriented and the latter is more stealth focused. Once you complete the DLC you'll realize the cycle is complete, joining previous Bioshocks together as one complete trilogy.","timestamp_created":1431936758,"timestamp_updated":1431936758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15882945","author":{"steamid":"76561198110533185","num_games_owned":705,"num_reviews":89,"playtime_forever":3238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2015,"last_played":1506605655},"language":"japanese","review":"FPS+RPG、シリーズ物ですが従来の1,2と比べたら\n敵は普通の人間だわ世界は深海から空になってるわ道がめっちゃ綺麗だわ\n魔法は名前が変わっちゃってるわで共通点はどこだよと言いたいくらいの別物\n懐古主義者なら「こんなのは○○じゃない」と言いそうな典型例な進化の仕方\n\nしかしハッキリ言って1,2よりはるかに面白いです\n日本語ローカライズ完璧でバグもなくその辺の作りの甘さによるストレスなし、\nスカイラインで空を飛び回ったり相方が頼もしすぎたり\n新しい攻撃法があったり色々すごい、散策してるだけでも面白い\n\nストーリーものめり込む、謎呼ぶ謎から最後にどんでん返し\n1と2はどっぷり繋がってましたがこれは独自路線なので\nこれを最初にはじめても話的には特に問題なくついていけるはず\n\n戦闘法は相変わらず多彩ですが操作は少しシンプルに。\n魔法以外は拾った武器で手を変え品を変え戦う方式になって退屈しない\n弱すぎる魔法や武器もなくバランスが良く工夫が楽しい\n武器は強化もできるしお気に入りをずっと使い続けるのも一興\nなるほどこう来たかという感じの進化の仕方\nわずらわしいハッキングはついになくなりましたが\nタレットや敵を一時的に味方にするのは健在\n一応密かにステルス要素もあるけどハッキリ言って無いも同然のデキ\n\n一緒に旅をするエリザベスがなんとも言えずいい味\nストーリー上の役割はもとより戦闘のアシストや\n話し相手として素晴らしい立ち位置、変な走り方。\nそんだけ頼もしいなら普通に戦ってよと言いたいけど…\n射線を塞ぐことも度々ですがまぁそこは愛嬌\n\nマイナスなのは自力でセーブできない（オートセーブのみ）ところ\nいつセーブしたのか全然わからないので自分のタイミングでやめると\n意図してた以上に戻されることがあります、なんでこうしたんだろう…\nゲーム終了時は「セーブしたのは○時?分ですがよろしいですか？」と\n聞いてくるがそれがいつだったかいちいち時計を見て推測しなきゃいけない\n\nもう一つは割りと広い世界を体感できるのにマップが見れないところ\nマップの仕様は1から順に悪くなってましたがついに見ることもできなくなった\n迷いやすいのはともかくわかりにくい上に収集要素があるので不便\nストーリーが一本道で取り返しがつかないタイプなので困ります\n\nあとDLCがあるけど高い…\nトリプルセットで購入したのでセール待ち\nストーリーが旧1,2とつながるらしいのでやってみたいけどまだ買えず\n\nとりあえずオススメ\n久しぶりに濃いRPG終わってからの脱力感みたいなのを感じました\n何かRPGやりたいなと思ってる人は開発してみるのがいいかも\n難易度も選べるのでFPS不慣れな人にもオススメ","timestamp_created":1431936418,"timestamp_updated":1432199605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.443009912967681885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15881896","author":{"steamid":"76561198060286834","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":444,"last_played":1395178684},"language":"english","review":"Game play is pretty easy and standard but the ending was so stupid....I mean seriously?

You're a wanted man, and at the same time, a revolutionary icon developed by the city far below. And just like the previous two games, this one has not disappointed me in too many areas. As a well story-driven game, there wouldn't be very many mechanics to the game but the environments and atmosphere is wildly immersive and at times, quite dark. As the game's plot was good and somewhat adequately filled, there was some DLC that released later on called Burial at Sea, which does help fill some plot holes, from even the first game, Bioshock. \n     Regarding the awesome story that goes on into Bioshock Infinite, I do not like the plot twists. It takes on very unnerving events and confuses you. The game had 3 difficulties (as far as I remember) of which the hardest was challenging enough.

Among the top complaints are these three nuances that play an exceptional and pivotal role in Infinite; to some, the streets of Columbia are too linear when compared to the openness of Rapture, to others, the new weapon system doesn't adequately compliment the new baddies, and to a stubborn select few, the story simply either makes no sense or isn't quite as memorable as the first installment. To each his own, I suppose, but when we consider these \"faults\" to hold the experience back, we make room for further diminishing of the series as a whole. We have to feel some empathy for the developers at Irrational and understand what kind of thought was put not only into Rapture's cavernous tunnels, but Columbia's banner-ridden streets.\n\nUnfortunately, I won't go into any detail about that stuff, because I don't (or didn't) work at Irrational, I wasn't there for the writing process, and I've never seen how these concepts fly into Ken Levine's head. What I CAN do, lacking this information, is NOT compare Rapture and Colombia at all. Bioshock Infinite is in a completely new setting, with completely new characters, and while it may follow some similar ideas and share a basic plotline, what we know about either game is so NOT subjective, so NOT interchangeable that it makes no sense to start comparing at all. They share the same title, so what? Vigors or Plasmids? Who cares? What difference does it make if Bioshock wants to take us into the sky for an adventure we can't quite explore so well as an underwater palace? There's a lot less room for walking up in the sky, mind you.\n\nIf you found fault in the game not because you found inconsistencies regarding this and the 2007 giant, but because you simply couldn't get a grip on the controls, the mechanics, or the story, by all means, you have your victory, and there's no sense in fighting over a cause you've already won. However, I have one message to those who insist to deem such tremendous games to be similar only because they share rather malleable concepts: BREAK THOSE CHAINS. ARE YOU A MAN, OR ARE YOU A SLAVE? I'm not trying to insult, I'm not trying to incite argument, I'm only trying to remove the slight tarnish that comes with a reputation, be it good or evil. When Bioshock decides to move a few miles up out of the water, you COMMIT, you don't QUESTION why it's moved or try to calculate the actual distance between the two.\n\nAgain, to each his own, but I don't like sitting back and watching a game become progressively reviled because it is by law a member of the Bioshock series and therefore must be treated as inferior to its predecessor. In time, all things will eventually pass, and I should save my ranting for the future, but for now, I hereby declare that you will find no error in any three of these games. Should you find error in any of them, please make certain that you are judging the game in its own right. While there are some franchises that DESERVE the compare/contrast treatment (Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty are the ostensible ones), Bioshock is NOT one of them.\n\nBuy it, play it, love it.

There's much that I like:  Gameplay is unique, fast, and exciting, there is an interesting (if nearly incomprehensible) story, the voice-acting, graphics and music are all first-rate, and they finally got rid of the annoying political commentary that plagued the first two games.  Even though I recommend the game, however, this still is far from my favorite game of this genre.  That's because it's ... just ... too ... darned ... weird.  It's 1910 and you begin in a flying city by rocketing there in a chair launched from a lighthouse.  You then get to shoot crows, fire, electricity, etc. from your fingertips while avoiding robotic George Washingtons with chain guns and a giant robotic songbird, while your companion, Elizabeth, summons assistance by opening tears into other universes.  In this world, you find money in just about every trash can and can buy ammunition, weapon upgrades, and \"vigors\" (magic abilities) from vending machines.  It is unknown why none of the enemies searched the trash cans and bought their own \"vigors\".  In the end, you ... oh, it doesn't matter, the end makes even less sense than the rest.  I'm a guy who loves sci-fi, I understand a little about quantum physics and multiverses, it's just that I can't get used to the idea of basing a game around them.  Suffice it to say that the game designers used some mighty powerful drugs in thinking this one up.  As I said, it's got a lot going for it if you can handle the pervasive weirdness.  I guess it's no more weird than its predecessors, it's just that I would have enjoyed it more if it had been rooted somewhere a little more rational to which I could relate or at least understand; e.g., Far Cry 2, 3, or 4; Metro 2033; Half-Life 2, DXHR, etc.","timestamp_created":1431392724,"timestamp_updated":1431392724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15792327","author":{"steamid":"76561198098105287","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2197,"last_played":1460199867},"language":"italian","review":"il più bel gioco mai fatto. lo provai grazie ad una copia prestata  su ps3 e me ne innamorai, lo ricomprai sempre su ps3 a mie spese per rigiocarmelo con calma ed ora su pc l ho ricomprato l' ennesima volta assieme al season pass...\nmai speso soldi in modo migliore:  il gamplay di per se non è  ottimo, anzi a volte da fastidio l' accostamento dei vigor ( quasi inutili) alle armi da fuoco, però viene ricompensato da una grafica gradevole che si fa amare per i suoi colori vivi ( se non fosse per alcune texture a bassa risoluzione e per le poche skin degli npc) e soprattutto da una MERAVIGLIOSA STORIA, che mi ha toccato come in nessun altro gioco ( nemmeno the last of us, hl2, borderlands o bioshock 1 sono riusciti ad eguagliarlo).

Это то что игра не стимулирует игрока адоптироваться под здешний мир а именно имея огромное количество плазмидов, разрывов, кучи различных одежды дающих множество полезных бафов и аэростат которые можно использовать для борьбы с врагами, поэтому можно пройти игру не использовав всего этого на лёгкой и средней сложности (когда я первый раз проходил игру я даже не знал что плазмиды можно комбинировать, что при правильной комбинации одежды можно сделать из вашего героя машину для убийств и многое другое было пропущено мной), только после прохождения игры на сложности 1999 год я научился использовать все эти плюшки(( \n2). В игре есть очень много интересных мест, деталей и аудиозаписей которых можно просто не заметить или же просто пройти мимо них (только проходя игру на 100% я понял сколько всего пропустил)) \n\n\nЯ не любитель что либо писать, но ради этой игры мне было не жалко потратить два часа времени чтобы написать обзор)) Спасибо за этот Шедевр Кену Левину и всем кто ему в этом помогал! :3","timestamp_created":1431298517,"timestamp_updated":1511865195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.689758598804473877","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15780415","author":{"steamid":"76561197998751063","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":913,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":913,"last_played":1431392581},"language":"brazilian","review":"Simplesmente fantástico.","timestamp_created":1431297502,"timestamp_updated":1431297502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15779512","author":{"steamid":"76561198079544651","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":947,"last_played":1433077973},"language":"russian","review":"СЮЖЕТ!!!!!","timestamp_created":1431292818,"timestamp_updated":1431292818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpebsn80CeOuYPA=="}
