I feel that players can relate to the game as not through the character, but the dividing choices Gordon has to make throughout Black Mesa. You never feel trapped in one specific area and it’s always a sense of progression through the game, this is a game that if people master the mechanics the ability to blaze right through the game blends for a satisfying experience which is the most enjoyable of all. \nUnfortunately there is no Character development as our character is mute, and we are never even shown his face in-game (excluding the box art and title screen). Gordon Freeman is supposed to represent the player, he is a shell that is controlled by the actions of the player and when you play Half-Life, you become Gordon Freeman.\nFor my passion of this old, retro game, I love to press that play button on my steam client and play a couple levels before I go do something else, Half-Life is a game that will never leave my heart and for that I have to give this game an honest 95% as I see the only downside is the graphical limitations of this wonderful game!\n","timestamp_created":1506892202,"timestamp_updated":1506892202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506172835826873779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35394943","author":{"steamid":"76561197972261978","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":3820,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1615,"last_played":1567449086},"language":"english","review":"This game's difficulty levels are a pain in the ass compared to Half-Life 2, HL2: Ep 1, and MAYBE Ep: 2 (Episode 2 was also hard on hard difficulty) but Half-Life 1 takes the difficulty to another level, not on ANY playthrough of any of the Half-Life 2 games have I raged so hard that I nearly broke my keyboard, as this game did.\n\nI do enjoy HL2 more, the story, gameplay and everything but this game is pretty amazing for a game from 1998.\n\n\nIt is VERY challenging if you go straight to hard mode, which is what I did after not playing it for like a year, and I regret my decision, I died at the Nihilanth like 30 fucking times that I had to take an hour long break.\n\nGood game though.","timestamp_created":1506888563,"timestamp_updated":1506888563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35394883","author":{"steamid":"76561198428331601","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":542,"last_played":1552261525},"language":"english","review":"A great game, albeit an often confusing and difficult one.

To this my response would be, “more than you’d expect”.\n\nInitially, I was lured back to the series after “Epistle 3 Leaks”. While I anticipated a mediocre trip aided by my nostalgia goggles, I was pleasantly surprised by how well the title aged, like fine wine that tasted better over time. There are several reasons to why I derived to this conclusion, allow me to convey each in description below.\n\nFirstly, the GoldSrc engine might be a bit dated graphically, but it is good enough to represent whatever model it needs within the game play, delivering good performances with smooth animation. You will come to appreciate how detailed the models for each entity are, despite their low polygon count. Comparing to the games today, you will noticed just how much work was put into optimisation, along with full on compatibility with a range of operating systems. Something I wish I could say the same for the developers today.\n\nSecondly, the plot of Half Life was well written by Marc Laidlaw, it is just as good today as it was back in the yesteryear. You will be drawn in by the dubious stance of Black Mesa in its teleportation research, its lack of care in human resources as well as ethics. As well as the mysterious Xen forces and Nihilanth’s motive in invading Earth. The enigma that is G-Man still puzzles us to this day in who exactly he works for.\n\nThirdly, the AI technology in this game is just phenomenal. Marines would work in concert with one another, putting down suppressing fire while encircling you from behind. Houndeyes would hunt in packs with a leader, changing their behaviour and attack pattern based on the pack’s strength. Vortigaunts would retreat in fear but regroup in numbers, rallying in the safety of cover. Hardly any of these advances are even visible in games today, which are just upsetting to say the least.\n\nFourthly, the arsenal which Gordon can play with is very well designed, each gun has its own specific use and none of them are ever obsolete, just because you found a new shiny gun. Each section of the stages can be tackled with different weapons in different play styles. Sure they might not be perfectly balanced in multiplayer, but a community still exists to this day for its death matches, that should speak for the quality in itself.\n\nIf you have the fortune to play Half Life before, then I believe no amount of convincing is required. However, if you came from a newer generation of video game enthusiasts, you should give this title at least a single try in your lifetime. No regrets, Mr Freeman.","timestamp_created":1506777957,"timestamp_updated":1506777957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.697199523448944092","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35336086","author":{"steamid":"76561198132845068","num_games_owned":717,"num_reviews":116,"playtime_forever":163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":163,"last_played":1506774367},"language":"schinese","review":"我感觉Prey借鉴了HL\n背景设定都是科研弄出怪物\n小怪长得神似，还有神似的jump scare\nNPC都可以被打死\n各种钻管道解密跑图\n……","timestamp_created":1506775876,"timestamp_updated":1506775876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.448739945888519287","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35335800","author":{"steamid":"76561198045751460","num_games_owned":1601,"num_reviews":100,"playtime_forever":199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1505865371},"language":"english","review":"The decision to recommend this game or not is probably the most difficult I ever had on Steam.\n\nI'm old enough to have seen severale decades of video gaming, I like very much science fiction and I do not dislike FPS if they have a good story to tell. For some strange coincidence I never tried HalfLife so far, I knew it was considered a master piece and I thought I would have played it sooner or later, untill almost 20 years later ...\n\nThe story is pretty simple. You start moving all the way in a secret base down to you laboratory, this trip makes you realize the huge size of the base. Something went wrong during an experiment, and aliens arrives on this side of the universe. Then it's time to  flee for your own sake, meeting and cooperating with other survivors on the road. Aliens are bad enough, then you are going to survive to the army, which isn't sent in to to help survivors, but to clean the mess.\n\nThe graphic is outdated, few skins for scientists and guards becoming soon repetitive. Acting voice and sounds are outdated too. During all the playtime I've been very engaged, I felt being a survivor running for my life, trying to help people along the road and find solutions fo move forward.\nControl isn't good, there's always a feeling of slipping on ice and jumps are difficults.\n\nI meant to finish it, but motion sickness moved in. I'm not able to play for more than 60 minutes before experiencing it and after several sessions I eventually quit. \n\nIt's clear to me that this game was a masterpiece, it made history, but 20 years later it's not enjoyable anymore.\nAll in all I think you should try it, there's often the opportunity to get a good valve games bundle. This game has overwhelming positive reviews, and mostly all the negative are biased against valve for having quit the development of the line (which is a pity)\n\nI'm looking forward to play BlackMesa and HalfLife2.","timestamp_created":1506775356,"timestamp_updated":1518950728,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485409706830978394","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35332528","author":{"steamid":"76561198064220965","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1628950067},"language":"english","review":"it was ok but it wasn't even close to as good as garfield 2 the tale of two kitties..\n\n0/10000\nNO GARFIELD IN IT DON'T BOTHER PLAYING","timestamp_created":1506769056,"timestamp_updated":1506769056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497287511825561523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35331293","author":{"steamid":"76561198051678689","num_games_owned":1199,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":725,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":570,"last_played":1636518086},"language":"russian","review":"Хоспаде как же он ИБОШИТ","timestamp_created":1506766558,"timestamp_updated":1506766558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35328889","author":{"steamid":"76561198142369717","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1741,"last_played":1555854598},"language":"english","review":"really good game","timestamp_created":1506761468,"timestamp_updated":1506761468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35319513","author":{"steamid":"76561198011739480","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1654316370},"language":"english","review":"Good game","timestamp_created":1506737635,"timestamp_updated":1506737635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35318153","author":{"steamid":"76561198170018923","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":102,"last_played":1585273332},"language":"english","review":"Like minecraft with guns","timestamp_created":1506734023,"timestamp_updated":1506734023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35316944","author":{"steamid":"76561198104461737","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":5016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3297,"last_played":1606533158},"language":"english","review":"You are launched into the boots of the famous-yet mute- Gordon Freeman in a very twisted plot with questionable characters and settings.

STOP READING AND BUY THIS GAME ALREADY.\n\nStill here? Oh well, I might as well occupy you.\n\nYes, the graphics and sounds are dated, the artstyle isn't pretty. But this game is one of the most immersive experiences I have ever had. The story, despite being so simple, is expertly presented through the events of the game and really takes \"Show, don't tell\" philosphy to the next level.\n\nI went into this game with high expectations based on it's hype and the fan obsession surrounding it. I was expecting to be dissappointed. But I was amazed. And for the first time in ages, I was also terrified. \n\nThis game is almost too immersive. I felt as if I were genuinely running for my life at times. Like I was actually cornered and in danger. This game gives the feeling of zero hand holding, and you're almost immediately dropped in the deep end.\n\nThe only true downside I see with this game is the aspect ratio support. It only natively supports 4:3. selecting wider aspect ratios will simply cause the game to zoom in and slice-off the top and bottom, resulting in a SMALLER FOV.\n\nBut hey, I didn't care. I played this game in 4:3 the OG way, ON AN ULTRAWIDE MONITOR. Black bars be occupying most of my damn screen! So I think the majority of you will be fine. Or you could take the easy way out and play 'Black Mesa', which is just a remaster of this game running on the source engine.","timestamp_created":1506432622,"timestamp_updated":1506432622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35219373","author":{"steamid":"76561198397312660","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52,"last_played":1627021878},"language":"schinese","review":"经典 补个票","timestamp_created":1506422084,"timestamp_updated":1506422084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35215782","author":{"steamid":"76561198202796042","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":10137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3798,"last_played":1657551193},"language":"schinese","review":"以现在的水准来看画面确实有点寒酸了，但1998那个年代，一定会有很多人为此尖叫不已。\n       无论是关卡设计，还是气氛营造，都是对整个FPS系列活生生的教科书。\n       这也是我第一款通关的FPS游戏，同时也是我的游戏初恋。\n       玩盗版通了十几周目，玩正版依然停不下来，也不添加mod，就喜欢一遍一遍地通。（比较丢脸的是我现在才准备通最高难度）\n       HALF-LIFE FOREVER！\n       GORDON FREEMAN FOREVER！","timestamp_created":1506401084,"timestamp_updated":1511688043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35214538","author":{"steamid":"76561198159255487","num_games_owned":335,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":630,"last_played":1506393389},"language":"english","review":"Swood and addicting.

Look for \"MarphitimusBlackimus\", the videos will show the many many cuts, such as Gordons' original death, the alphas and betas, and many interesting stuff. \nIt is one of my top 10 favorite games of all time. \n\nPROS:\n\nStoryline\n\nShooter + Puzzling - Yup, levels have shooting and puzzling which you have to move to the air vent and follow where it will lead to, and among others. With shooting, pure action too. This is what makes the game itself so unique, and so different from thousands of games. Even today, there are very very low games follow HL footsteps.\n\nExcellent sounds. Everything about them is so unique and so good! Like the footsteps, medkit and armor charging sounds like DZZZZZZZKZZZZZZZZT, BD-D-D-DVZZZZT\n\nMultiplayer. The multiplayer is very amazing. Best played with peanut butter jam sandwich. Great times. Also look for the videos of \"The Gmen Squad!\" by Xanatos, it makes you replay multiplayer again.\n\nPersonally the best game with unforgettable quotes. I swear, every quotes in this game is memorable.\n\nThe Whole Concept - The concept of aliens, sci fi things and more are gracious. My favorite of the whole concept is the HEV suit.\n\nThe Locations - Ever since I played the game I really want to travel to the USA and to view the beautiful deserts of New Mexico. This is probably one of the games that makes me want to see where they're bassed on. Catchy name though!\n\nMod support + calm community - There are so many great mods for this game. One of my favorites is the SSH: Mod Messup and Cry of Fear. \n\nSound ambience and monsters are unique and just plain SCARY. Seriously at this point if you played Doom 3 (which is considered as horror game, and this game not) you’ll realize this is so much scarier than D3.\n\nExpansion Packs are Amazing. I, F***ING LOVE, the idea to play the three (or 5, if Decay canon) characters with each of their perspectives of the Black Mesa disaster.\nSO GOOD Soundtracks!!\n\nGood story. And amazing one too, it's just not any other generic \"the aliens have come to earth, defend earth and kill invaders\" the plot is bit too deep, you can (i hate promoting but bare with me) check out \"The Aftermath of the Black Mesa Incident\" It's very interesting  \n\n.... And more to write soon\n\n\nCONS:\n\nNot yet found\n\n11/10\n\nThank you Valve, thank you HALF LIFE.

Hierbei handelt es sich um das allererste Spiel der Reihe, welches im Oktober 1998 erschienen ist. \"Half-Life\" kann man vor allem in das Genre des Ego-Shooters einsortieren, allerdings besitzt das Spiel auch eine Vielzahl an Rätsel-/Puzzle-, Parcours-/Jump 'n Run-, als auch Adventure-Elementen. Da neben dem Erledigen von Gegnern, auch Hindernisse unter komplexe Situationen bewältigt, wie auch verschiedenste Rätsel gelöst werden müssen, um beispielsweise Türen zu öffnen oder Sprengfallen zu deaktivieren. Die Handlung, wie auch der Stiel von \"Half-Life\" ist sehr Science-Fiction basiert.\n\nDer Protagonist und spielbare Charakter des Spiels ist hierbei Dr. Gordon Freeman, ein MIT-Physiker, der für die geheime Forschungseinrichtung namens \"Black Mesa\" arbeitet. Diese Forschungseinrichtung liegt  sehr weit abgeschieden in einer Wüste in dem US-Bundesstaat New Mexico und war ursprünglich eine Raketentestbasis. Dr. Freemans Spezialgebiet, wie auch die Abteilung in der er tätig ist, nennt sich \"anomale Materie\". Als das Experiment seiner geheimen Forschungsarbeit, zur Erschließung einer neuen Energiequelle durch Kristalle außerirdischen Herkunft jedoch misslingt, öffnen sich im gesamten Forschungsgebiet Dimensionstore aus der Parallelwelt \"Xen\", die sämtliche Kreaturen dieser Parallelwelt das Betreten in die \"normale\" Welt ermöglichen. Neben den außerirdischen Lebewesen, die Gordon Freeman konfrontieren, erscheinen in der Forschungseinrichtung U.S. Marines, die den Auftrag erteilt bekommen haben, jede Person und Kreatur zu erledigen, die das Gebiet verlassen will. Diese U.S. Marines haben wiederum die Situation unterschätzt und sind nicht in der Lage diese zu meistern, wodurch der Staat das \"Black-Ops-Spezialkommando\" losgerückt hat, mit dem Befehl die gesamte Forschungseinrichtung Black Mesa ausnahmslos samt allen Personen und Kreaturen auszulöschen. Gordon Freemans Ziel ist dabei aus dieser Einrichtung zu fliehen. Im gesamten Verlauf wird er allerdings unbewusst von einer mysteriösen Gestalt, der nur unter dem Namen \"G-Man\" bekannt ist, beobachtet.\n\nFunFact: Der Titel des Spiels (Half-Life) ist eine Anspielung auf den Kernphysikalischen Fachbegriff \"Halbwertszeit\" Das klassische Symbol der Spielreihe ist dabei das \"Lambda\", welches auch als Zeichen für die Zerfallskonstante in der Physik verwendet wird.\n\nMeine Persönliche Bewertung nach meinen Kriterien*:\n\nStory 82,5 / 115\nGameplay 11,75 / 40\nGrafik und Gestaltung 7 / 25\nSound 7 / 30\nAtmosphäre 15 / 20\nSonstige Besonderheiten 10,25 / 20\n\n*Bewertungen unterliegen hierbei zusätzlich (1) dem Vergleich zu neueren Spielteilen und (2) aus der Sicht der heutigen Zeit!\n\n\nIch werde mich bei meiner Bewertung sehr zurückhalten, da ich nicht in der Lage bin das Spiel verhältnismäßig zu bewerten. Wie man meiner Bewertung entnehmen kann, ist die Punktzahl besonders bei den Punkten: Gameplay, Grafik wie auch Sound recht negativ. Der Grund dafür ist einfach, dass ich das Spiel nur aus heutiger Sicht bewerten kann. Nicht falsch verstehen. Das Spiel wurde 1998 veröffentlicht. Es ist einfach älter als ICH. Dafür, dass \"Half-Life\" noch so eine gewaltige Playerbase, wie auch Fans besitzt, hat das Spiel meinen Respekt verdient. Für damalige Zeit war \"Half-Life\" bestimmt sehr revolutionär und was besonderes.\n\nAus diesem Grund werde ich nur einige Punkte kritisieren, die wirklich aus heutiger Sicht katastrophal gealtert sind.\n\nDie Story von \"Half-Life\" fand ich sehr gut. Auch wenn die Handlung aus heutiger Sicht ein wenig generischer geworden ist, aber da will ich nicht meckern. Es gibt sehr viele Elemente die umgesetzt wurden, um die Handlung abwechslungsreich zu füllen. Allerdings ist die Gestaltung von den Orten zu sehr eintönig. Die gesamte Handlung spielt (mit Ausnahme von einigen Sequenzen auf Xen) in Black Mesa. Auch wenn die Map gigantisch groß ist (was \"normaler\" Spieler, die \"Half-Life\" nur einmalig durchspielen nicht wirklich bemerken) wurde meiner Meinung nach gestalterisch alles zu sehr gleich gehalten. Durch veraltete Grafik, hinterlässt es halt leider einen sehr schlechten Eindruck.\n\nEin weiterer Negativpunkt, welches nur in Deutschland exisiterte, ist die Indizierung von \"Half-Life\". Da damals die Jugendschutz-Standards hierzulande sehr streng waren, musste das Spiel stark angepasst werden, damit es überhaupt in Deutschland verkauft werden durfte. Leider hat es die Atmosphäre etwas geschadet, da \"menschliche\" Gegner wie die U.S. Marines durch Roboter ersetzt wurden, was wenig Sinn gemacht hat.\nFriedliche NPC sterben auch nicht, sie setzen sich auf den Boden und schütteln den Kopf...\nMehr muss ich glaube ich nicht sagen. Auch wenn Valve nichts dafür kann, muss es trotzdem angesprochen werden. Denn meiner Meinung nach hätte man sich vielleicht eine bessere Lösung überlegen können, wie man den Beschuss auf (menschliche) Personen anderweitig zensieren kann.\n\nUm das Gameplay angenehmer zu gestalten, empfehle ich allerdings den Spielern \"Half-Life\" auf 30 oder 60 FPS zu begrenzen, da das Spiel nicht ausgemacht ist mit hoher Framerate zu spielen. Als ich das Spiel damals 2016 das erste Mal gespielt habe, wollte ich einfach nur schnell \"durchrushen\" um direkt Half-Life 2 spielen zu können, da es sehr unangenehm war anzuschauen. Mir taten einfach die Augen weh und ich bekam leichte Übelkeitserscheinungen. Daher dauerte mein erster Durchlauf des Spiel auch mehrere Wochen bis Monate.\nAbseits davon, waren die Mechaniken in dem Spiel echt revolutionär. Es gab schon damals eine große Auswahl von Waffen unterschiedlicher Art mit unterschiedlichen Funktionen und einem Sekundärfeuermodus.\nAuch eine große Leistung, dass die Steuerung des Spielers und einige Objekte bis heute kaum verändert wurde.\n\nAbschließend kann ich einfach nur erneut sagen, dass obwohl das Spiel nun mehr als 20 Jahre alt ist, dennoch empfehlenswert ist. Erwartet jedoch nicht extrem viel, da es logischerweise mit heutigen Spiele eher weniger mithalten kann, was es jedoch auch nicht muss. Genießt einfach die Handlung des Spiels!","timestamp_created":1506113484,"timestamp_updated":1619719574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.341020137071609497","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35122944","author":{"steamid":"76561198090629324","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1542,"last_played":1592805085},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un buen juego de la infanca :3","timestamp_created":1506068471,"timestamp_updated":1506068471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35119005","author":{"steamid":"76561198192773098","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":661,"last_played":1590457314},"language":"spanish","review":"QUE GRAN JUEGO, apesar de los años que pasaron desde la salida de este juego, este sigue siendo muy bueno, excelente historia, uno de los mejores juegos que e podido jugar.","timestamp_created":1506049896,"timestamp_updated":1506049896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35117672","author":{"steamid":"76561198357557785","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1527985869},"language":"english","review":"A good ol' classic\nwhere it all started","timestamp_created":1506043767,"timestamp_updated":1506043767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35116974","author":{"steamid":"76561197991889066","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":106,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":486,"last_played":1505587905},"language":"english","review":"Very good game, a golden legend like Midas that may have had it's sequel justice done justice in some way, shape or form.\n\n9.5/10","timestamp_created":1506040782,"timestamp_updated":1506040782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35112297","author":{"steamid":"76561198109598973","num_games_owned":789,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":556,"last_played":1565394658},"language":"english","review":"Disgruntled scientist raids his workplace after jobs are taken by illegal aliens.","timestamp_created":1506022755,"timestamp_updated":1506022755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35108807","author":{"steamid":"76561198165269066","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":574,"last_played":1635590041},"language":"english","review":"We all know why,\n\nand still remember in 2018.","timestamp_created":1506012380,"timestamp_updated":1542835519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35100237","author":{"steamid":"76561198054805835","num_games_owned":497,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1399602504},"language":"english","review":"The start of Valve's legacy.
