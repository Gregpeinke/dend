Поэтому лучше прочитай сначала обзор.\n\n[h1]САМАЯ ХУДШАЯ СМЕНА ОХРАННИКА...[/h1]\n\nЗавязка в Blue Shift здесь следующая. Главный герой дополнения - это Барни Калхау, однако русская локализация по не понятным причинам называет Калхуном. Его возраст неизвестен, однако известно что он охранник в комплексе Black Mesa. Стартует Blue Shift также, как и оригинальная Half-Life. Барни едет на работу, и попутно смотрит, чем заняты коллеги по цеху. \n\nТакже как и Opposing Force ,Blue Shift также переплетена с оригинальной игрой, однако переплетается куда чаще. В момент когда Барни приходит на работу, дверь внезапно заклинило, не позволяя ему войти внутрь. В этот момент можно увидеть проезжающего мимо Гордона Фримена, который отправляется в лабораторию. Ещё пару раз Барни может увидеть Гордона на камерах наблюдения, и в конце дополнение, когда из-за телепорта он случайно попадёт в подсобку, где он видит, как Гордона тащат военные.\n\nТем не менее попав внутрь, Барни нужно взять пистолет, и получить шлем с бронежилетом, дабы отправиться на смену. Получив необходимое снаряжение, Барни вместе с учёными отправляется на смену, однако в этот момент начинается каскадный резонанс, и лифт сначала перестанет работать, а затем и вовсе упадёт вниз. Очнувшись в окружении мёртвых учёных, Барни мгновенно находит монтировку, и дополнение мгновенно начинается. \n\nЕсли вы ждали какого-то эпика как в Opposing Force, то... вы его не увидите. Дополнение проходится за 2,5 часа и никаких сложностей в прохождении игра не вызовет. Да и сюжетно игра также слаба. Нужно найти группы учёных, и с помощью них свалит к хуям из комплекса. Даже битв с боссам в дополнении нет, что позволяет без усилий пройти даже самым косоруким игрокам.\n\nС другой стороны, мотивации учёных куда более адекватные, чем у учёных на Лямбде. Поскольку их главной задачей не спасение мира от пришельцев, а сбежать из комплекса. \n\nА вот сам Барни Калхау не вызывает эмоций. В теории, Барни в отличии от Фримена и Шепарда умеет говорить, однако на практике ничего из его уст вы не услышите. Неужели нельзя было озвучить хотя бы немного фраз. Как минимум озвучит фразы, когда он отвечает персонажам, ибо без этого учёные выглядят какими-то шизофрениками, которые разговаривают с воображаемыми людьми, игнорируя то,что рядом с ними стоит Барни.\n\n[h1]НИЧЕГО НОВОГО...[/h1]\n\nЕсли вы ждёте от Blue Shift только шутер, то вас можно поздравить! Тут его достаточно для двухчасового дополнения. А если хотите какого-то разнообразия, то возвращайтесь перепроходить Opposing Force, а лучше вовсе оригинальную игру. Здесь мы куда больше стреляем, чем решаем головоломки. Вот только арсенал оружия у Барни в сравнении с вооружением Фримена и Шепарда куда скромнее: пистолет, магнум, дробовик, M16, гранатомёт, монтировка, гранаты, взрывчатка с детонатором, вот и весь арсенал Барни.\n\nКак говорилось ранее, бои в Blue Shift просты до безобразия. А если вы выучили поведение пришельцев в прошлом дополнении, то на их фоне — это просто легкая пробежка.\n\nСреди мелких недостатков, в игре есть лаги. Когда ученые находятся в движущимся лифте, то они подлагивают. Не то чтобы это были недостатки, однако не упомянут об этом было бы не честно.\n\nИтог сказанного тяжело составить. С одной стороны Half-Life: Blue Shift позволяет посмотреть на события второстепенные, которая лишена какого-либо экшена. Даже G-man появляется всего один раз, и больше в дополнении не участвует. Что дает понять что на Барни ему в принципе плевать. Но с другой стороны, дополнение ничего нового не привносит в мир игры, что является её недостатком. Стоит ли в неё тогда играть?

It did not up the quality to make up for the decrease in playtime, it actually made it worse. Every improvement from the prior expansion pack is gone, which is baffling because one would expect that if they were going to give us a padded waste of time, they would fill it with already developed assets from their earlier work, but that is not what happened. There is no attempt to add anything of real value to the experience besides an extra main character, which is really a glorified follower that can't do anything besides move the story forward and complain about being out of breath when you are in a justified hurry to escape the now alien and soldier-infested facility. There are maybe two puzzles where I thought it was cool or interesting, and even then they aren't very difficult to solve, and one of them is more likely to become obnoxious to a player who doesn't figure it out, leading them to just look up the solution online instead of bothering to actually solve it. The rest is lacking any sort of quality problem-solving, and so one will be unchallenged a majority of the time in the worst way possible.\n\nThe rest of the game is understandably boring dribble, its a lot of uninspired battles where enemies are present in droves to artificially enhance the difficulty, namely the example that annoyed me the most was the fact that [i]headcrabs[/i] thrive in a majority of secluded areas, dealing unnecessary damage and proving to be less of a challenge and much more of an obnoxious ploy to find you something to do while you travel through the nothingness of this experience. Another rather ridiculous problem I ran into with this installment that the base game and other expansion had little to nothing to do with were glitches. Loading up a save can often lead to you firing your gun and wasting bullets, some non-playable characters will bug out and their bodies will unnaturally vibrate immensely, and the list goes on. It can break the immersion, a huge turn-off for most players that want to be enveloped in the gameplay and story presented. \n\nAs far as [i]Half-Life[/i] protagonists go, [i]Barney Calhoun[/i] is the bottom of the barrel in terms of quality. Although all are silent, their importance is made clear and their ability to accomplish what they do makes sense for the other two. [i]Gordon Freeman[/i] is a rightfully iconic video game figure for all he symbolizes, and very interesting to learn about as the game progresses, not to mention he was trained to do what he spends a majority of [i]Half-Life[/i] doing. [i]Adrian Shepherd[/i] isn't extremely amazing, but he gets the job done and is a trained soldier, not some everyday cop ill-equipped to handle the tasks they are presented with. With how some of the cops in the series perish so easily, [i]Calhoun's[/i] exemplary skill is a definite outlier, and even then, the hardest challenge he is presented with is blowing up a tank, nothing grand or creative like the other protagonists face. If there was more to the game and the character was fleshed out, maybe it wouldn't be that bad, but everything about this release comes off as rushed and uninspired, so it feels more like profiting off the name of the series rather than a passion for what they are making here.\n\n[i]Half-Life: Blue Shift[/i] is frankly a waste of time. From the lazy game design to the arguably offensive lack of care put into this release, it all piles up into a heap of wasted potential. Definitely the lowest point for the [i]Half-Life[/i] series, this expansion adds nothing new, disappoints in ways it never should have, and most importantly, this barren wasteland of a game has no soul.\n\n[b][RATING:
