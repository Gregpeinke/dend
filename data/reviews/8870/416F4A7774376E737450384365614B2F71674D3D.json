solid conclusion (?) to the Bioshock series. While I can see mixed reception to the story I think it was overall well presented and executed at minimum.\n\nThe gameplay is a more refined version of the prior games with a different set of weapons and abilities. Also, the environment lends itself to providing a lot more open space and associated mechanics. In short though, whatever you thought of the prior Bioshock games' combat system will largely apply to this game as well. The gameplay in the DLC has the same core mechanics but is a bit different, so the statement doesn't perfectly apply to the DLC gameplay.\n\nGraphics, OST, voiceovers, etc. were all pretty well done. I do not have anything notable to call out which is why I lumped them all together. That is also to say that I do not have anything negative to say about them. They all fit the moments they were used quite well and I was never taken out of a moment from a jarring visual or musical choice.\n\nThe story is quite interesting to say the least. I can absolutely see mixed reception on both the main story and DLC story simply given the nature of the story: [spoiler]notably the multiple dimension aspects[/spoiler]. Personally, I really enjoyed the main story and had mixed feeling about the DLC story. I still enjoyed the DLC and how it tied everything together but some aspects felt shoehorned in. For example (WARNING: MAJOR STORY SPOILERS): [spoiler]Elizabeth somehow getting killed by a Big Daddy when she was practically omniscient and omnipotent at that point[/spoiler] or [spoiler]Daisy seemingly having decided to let herself be killed[/spoiler]. Still, I think there was overwhelmingly more good than bad and as mentioned it's an interesting story even if you feel mixed about the actual \"end\" state.","timestamp_created":1647132363,"timestamp_updated":1647132418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112075943","author":{"steamid":"76561198096334365","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":921,"last_played":1627248745},"language":"english","review":"Columbia is not the place to go bird-watching\nTake my word","timestamp_created":1647131273,"timestamp_updated":1647131273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112073085","author":{"steamid":"76561199221454549","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":672,"last_played":1647944471},"language":"koreana","review":"스토리 쩔어요 꼭 해보세요\n","timestamp_created":1647127501,"timestamp_updated":1647127501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112070626","author":{"steamid":"76561199085590831","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":986,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":960,"last_played":1659209914},"language":"english","review":"The storyline was rich as well as mysterious (as it included a plot twist at the end).

It is action packed, story driven, and gorgeous. However, if you played Bioshock and Bioshock 2, you need to understand this is a different game. It is an action packed version of those two, and not nearly as horror / scary. The atmosphere is light and airy most of the time, and it is just not going to present you a hallway you are afraid of going down. \n\nThat being said, omg this game plays so good. You will be fighting in these huge arenas and have to keep moving, throwing Vigors at enemies, jumping up to a skyhook to ride around and jump onto a ledge, only to realize you are out of ammo and frantically look around to find a shotgun, then grab it to finish the fight. It has a haste that most of the time is just delightful.\n\nSome of the controls are a little awkward (right click fires Vigor, which means every time I tried to aim I shot off a vigor), but for the most part it is snappy and nice feeling. You will not be making any choices, and it will be almost impossible to get \"lost.\" I don't even think there are any points offering even branching hallways. \n\nThere are a few secrets that are almost impossible to figure out on your first play through, and I would recommend playing the game once to get used to it and again on 1999 mode (hard mode), which will add a \"never enough ammo\" feeling to things, and mean you scrounge and hunt for every spare bullet for every single gun.\n\nFinal point: Their checkpoint system is fantastic. You will be able to easily pick a chapter in the game at any point, which means if you start to enjoy the game and see an achievement to kill some dudes with shotguns, you can load up a section you liked and go easily do it. This added a lot for me, since I ended up doing all the achievements, and this was a big reason why.","timestamp_created":1647109241,"timestamp_updated":1647109241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112049384","author":{"steamid":"76561198412457833","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":1239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1239,"last_played":1645915603},"language":"english","review":"I enjoyed it, but it is a far cry from the previous two. Not because of the game taking place in a city above the clouds rather than a metropolis beneath the ocean (I actually much prefer Columbia to Rapture), but of the major sweeping changes that transform Infinite into a more watered-down, linear experience. The story and writing is all over the place, at points it absolutely bangs and at others it's a confusing joke. The story goes from an interesting plot about a bigoted reflection of American exceptionalism and jingoism to a confusing and stupid time-travel, dimension hopping romp. It's one of few cases where a story would have been bettered by being simplistic. With all that said, again, I liked the game. I loved Columbia, I loved riding the sky lines and smacking mother fuckers from the air. I loved all the re-contextualized music from the 60s and 70s. The barbershop quartet rendition of \"God Only Knows\" slaps and is easily the best part of the game. I just wish the rest of the game was equal in quality.","timestamp_created":1647103011,"timestamp_updated":1647103011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112047708","author":{"steamid":"76561197991503304","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1477435500},"language":"english","review":"Nice.","timestamp_created":1647101304,"timestamp_updated":1647101304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112047312","author":{"steamid":"76561198960437013","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1647100054},"language":"turkish","review":"aaaaaaa","timestamp_created":1647100915,"timestamp_updated":1647100915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112045464","author":{"steamid":"76561198981483168","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":691,"last_played":1647096720},"language":"schinese","review":"8/10","timestamp_created":1647099018,"timestamp_updated":1647099018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112037640","author":{"steamid":"76561198309261275","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1614,"last_played":1643982525},"language":"schinese","review":"伊丽莎白！伊丽莎白！没有你我怎么活啊伊丽莎白，伊丽莎白你带我走吧伊丽莎白啊,伊丽莎白！","timestamp_created":1647090700,"timestamp_updated":1647090700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112035406","author":{"steamid":"76561198142639115","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1626003139},"language":"schinese","review":"一般般顶顶顶","timestamp_created":1647087894,"timestamp_updated":1647087894,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112028452","author":{"steamid":"76561199053423770","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":226,"last_played":1649686691},"language":"schinese","review":"就是闪退问题严重不满，其他的都很好","timestamp_created":1647078902,"timestamp_updated":1647078902,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112028449","author":{"steamid":"76561198851281979","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":527,"last_played":1647078835},"language":"turkish","review":"8/10","timestamp_created":1647078900,"timestamp_updated":1647078900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112026705","author":{"steamid":"76561198256693058","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1117,"last_played":1647076147},"language":"schinese","review":"海葬刀死我了，伊丽莎白，我的伊丽莎白，跟我去巴黎好吗？","timestamp_created":1647076285,"timestamp_updated":1647076285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112014521","author":{"steamid":"76561198802507401","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":343,"last_played":1643352406},"language":"koreana","review":"좀

He bile bolca vigor kullanın çok işinize yarayacak, hele oyunun sonunu sırf vigorla bile geçebilirsiniz.\n\nOyunun giriş kısmı güzel. Oyun hakikatten açılmaya başladığı zaman (insanlarla kapışmaya başladığımız an.) oyun bir miktar sıkıcı oluyor ve erken oyunda öldürmesi aşırı zor olan taretler oyunu iyice bir çile haline getiriyor. Oyun biraz ilerleyince daha güzel bir hava kazanıyor, özellikle Elizabeth ve gizemli özelliği ortaya çıkınca hikayede ilerliyor. Hikaye demişken söyleyeyim, bence oyunun hikayesi bazı yerlerde tahmin edilebilir bazı yerlerde ilginç olsa da atmosfer konusunda güzel bir iş çıkarıyor. Özellikle oyunun başlarında ve sonlarına doğru atmosferi gayet güzel hissediyorsunuz. Vuruş hissiyatı konusunda 2010'ların başında yapılan bir oyunda bekleyeceğiniz düzeyin bazı yerlerde üstü bazı yerlerde altında. BioShock serisinde alışkanlık olarak oyunun sonlarına doğru bir düşmanı öldürmek için bir sarjör sarf ediyorsunuz, kafaya hedef almıyorsanız tabii. Bazı yerlerde karakter konuşmaları tam oturmamış gibi olsa da bence güzel bir oyun, indirimde iyi fiyattan aldım.\n\nHe bile sizi şimdiden uyarıyım oyunda Handyman diye bir illet var üç defa çıkıyor onu ekleyen adama çok sevdim, ama bayağı sövdüm o düzeyden iğrenç ve nefret edilesi oyun zevkini yok eden bir şey.","timestamp_created":1647048616,"timestamp_updated":1647048616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112006012","author":{"steamid":"76561198159615312","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":818,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1653695671},"language":"spanish","review":"Imprescindible","timestamp_created":1647045584,"timestamp_updated":1647045584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112002067","author":{"steamid":"76561199085716172","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1240,"last_played":1649815199},"language":"koreana","review":"띵작...","timestamp_created":1647039974,"timestamp_updated":1647039974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112000799","author":{"steamid":"76561199110419423","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":1704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1704,"last_played":1646945536},"language":"english","review":"I wouldn't call it an \"open\" world game.

This has got to be one of the best games I have ever played. The FPS game play is a lot of fun, but that is not what I am most amazed by. The story is the craziest story I could have ever imagined. The twists and the non-stop confusing and epic sci-fi story telling is some of the best of each, I have ever seen. \n\nTL;DR: Play this if you like Steampunk RPGs with very intense, dark and twisty stories.

I played on normal difficulty and felt that it was not really a challenge. If you buy this don't be afraid it will be hard. As I have said before I am not a soulslike fan so being a badass is only a small con.\nOnce again there is an awful checkpoint system. What happened to save wherever you want games. I get that the developers don't want people cheesing it with saves but I paid for the game let me save where I want dammit\nDespite Elizabeth being a great character her game play is often disorienting and annoying. I seriously have to wait for 20 seconds for her to walk across the map to unpick a lock or during a firefight I accidentally tap 'e' and then my POV is forcibly moved. Plus she is a better character than Booker so why not let me play as Elizabeth.\nThe skyhooks probably work great on console but are an annoyance on PC. Why is it forcing me to look a certain way and fights me when I try to look around.\nWeapon wheels, ability wheels. This review is starting to look like this game is a poor console port.\nIt's a Bioshock game so the story will try and mess with your mind but either I got spoiled and forgot or the twist ending was so telegraphed that I knew it from about 20 minutes in.\n\ndespite all that I would recommend playing this game if it is on sale and you have played the other two. However if you only buy a couple of games a year your money will almost certainly be better spent elsewhere.\n\n6/10","timestamp_created":1646750005,"timestamp_updated":1646750005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111804895","author":{"steamid":"76561198833838593","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1647167551},"language":"russian","review":"лучшая игровая атмосфера как по мне","timestamp_created":1646748302,"timestamp_updated":1646748302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111803296","author":{"steamid":"76561198049059454","num_games_owned":373,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":5448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5448,"last_played":1409164298},"language":"russian","review":"-","timestamp_created":1646746237,"timestamp_updated":1646746237,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111802921","author":{"steamid":"76561198416987717","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1033,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1033,"last_played":1628371416},"language":"russian","review":"\"Игры вне политики\"\nЯ не считаю эту игру плохой, этот отзыв я пишу просто в знак протеста 2K которые решили уйти с Российского рынка","timestamp_created":1646745734,"timestamp_updated":1646745734,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551429510116577148","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt7nstP8CeaK/qgM="}
