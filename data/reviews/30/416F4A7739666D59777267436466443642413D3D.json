Once you have looked past the graphics you get a great game with so much structure. Choose either the Axis or the Allies and from there you have a wide range of classes for different weapon types. This game is so well structured because of its community. If someone sees someone in an assult class then they will go long ranged to co-operate with the assult class instead of your average, load-out based FPS where people choose weapons because they like them.

Often overshadowed by it's significantly more popular older brother, Counter-Strike, Day Of Defeat is a relatively unknown to many and while it doesn't quite live up to the standards set by similar retail games it does provide a decent World War II experience.\n\nDay Of Defeat pits the German Army against either the British or American forces, which one is chosen depends on the map being played, in relatively small surroundings. Although it is not a game that aims for any sort of uber realism it does feature a number of mechanics to encourage slower and more realistic behavior such as a stamina bar and significantly decreased accuracy when moving. Respawning into the battle happens in waves which keeps the action going and prevents too much downtime but unfortunately also encourages less entertaining behavior such as spawn camping.\n\nThe class based system is fairly limited and only changes the weapons you use which creates a rather bland experience.\n\nGraphically it is clear that the old Half-Life engine has run it's course, Day Of Defeat is by no means a good looking game and the lack of detail can get distracting at times especially when considering that it's main rival is the stellar looking Battlefield 1942.\n\nAll in all Day Of Defeat is a mod success. The people that played it before it turned retail are the people that's going to play it afterwards, it's not a game that's looking to pick up any new fans in the transition. Perhaps it is easier to understand if you view this, not as a game going from mod to retail. But as a team of developers going from amateurs to professionals. It is an astonishing accomplishment and I wish them all the best in their future endeavors, I am just not really sure I want to pay for their advancement.","timestamp_created":1370175909,"timestamp_updated":1385409327,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546498537063598633","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7039135","author":{"steamid":"76561198083648521","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":782,"last_played":1457030660},"language":"russian","review":"Классная игра, для GoldSrc особенно.\nNuff said.","timestamp_created":1370159482,"timestamp_updated":1456740671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6667306","author":{"steamid":"76561198071893750","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":5555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2626,"last_played":1622209465},"language":"english","review":"an old gold src game but still its playable, fun, and honestly more fun than the source counter part","timestamp_created":1370146506,"timestamp_updated":1396304433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3695842","author":{"steamid":"76561198026203038","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":97851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44615,"last_played":1642185912},"language":"french","review":"très bon jeux j'adore","timestamp_created":1369422490,"timestamp_updated":1509956876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2666193","author":{"steamid":"76561198010746170","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2062,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2041,"last_played":1536801108},"language":"spanish","review":"Basado en la 2da guerra mundial (creo)... tiene el toque del CS pero tenes que capturar banderas, recomendado... todo un vicio!","timestamp_created":1368732712,"timestamp_updated":1368732712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6092313","author":{"steamid":"76561198058855716","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1435411680},"language":"english","review":"8½/10","timestamp_created":1368364078,"timestamp_updated":1368364078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5717000","author":{"steamid":"76561198054604395","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":846,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1553741929},"language":"english","review":"Don't listen to those people who say it sucks.
