К сожалению игра не идеален. Сносить врагам хедшоты приятно, но стрельба в целом ощушается мультяшно. Из-за щита темп перестрелок снизился, да и само повествование ведётся довольно медлено, так же вас будет самедлять огромное количество монеток, яблок, пончиков и всяких безделушек, которых вы сможете найти в столах и просто разбросанных по уровню.\nЕсли вы ищите умопомрачительный, динамичный геймплей то это явно не то (попробуйте какой-нибудь тайтанфол,батлу с колдой или серьёзного сема ).

Mas no fim das contas não é tanto assim e a história é muito mais complexa que os anteriores, como fã da série não diria melhor mas tão boa quanto. É muito importante jogar prestando atenção em cada detalhe do enredo pois ao fazer as ligações de cada evento, é que a história vai começar a fazer sentido. O final foi fantástico e um pouco confuso, é impossível terminar o jogo sem ter algumas dúvidas restantes mas nada como pesquisar em fontes confiáveis pra ficar mais tranquilo. Bioshock Infinite é surpreendente e te prende do início ao fim pela boa ambientação, trilha sonora e jogabalidade bem flúida que é o fator principal a te fazer ficar jogando por horas e horas. Uma coisa legal a se notar, pra quem curte ir mais a fundo nos detalhes, são algumas referências musicais a frente da época em que se passa o jogo, os famosos anacronismos. Se eu explicar vou acabar spoilando mas prestem bastante atenção nas fendas ou \"tears\" que são abertos no jogo, entre diversos outros Easter Eggs para mim esses foram os melhores. Recomendo o game e acho muito válido os DLCs também Burial at Sea episódios 1 e 2 pois mostram fatos importantes na história da série inteira.

The best I could give it is \"it's ok.\"\n\n\nStarting with the gameplay, the game is really easy and has almost no punishment for dying. Basically, whenever you die, you are Deus Ex Machina'd back to life. Remember the Vita Chambers from BioShock 1? This game pretty much does the same thing, but this time you can't disable it. \n\nBeyond it being too easy (I played on Normal, by the way, and I have no desire to play it again on Hard or in 1999 mode, but I'd assume it at least sort of rectifies the issue), there are problems I have with the game's mechanics:\n\n1. The 2 weapon limit.\n\nBecause of this, your options in combat are severely limited. Also, weapon upgrades are basically useless because you won't always have your upgraded weapons with you. \n\n2. Unneccessity of Vigors\n\nThe Vigors in this game are not neccessary to your continued survival. Sure, they help, but I barely ever used them. Beyond that, I only ever used Bucking Bronco and occasionally Possesion throughout my adventure. I used the rest maybe once or twice before discarding them for the rest of the game. This is oppposite to BioShock 1, where I was constantly using all the Plasmids I had because I needed to or else I would die.\n\n3. Very little strategy involved in combat\n\nI never had to think about what weapon was best to use nor did I ever have to think about what Vigor to use because it all worked itself out in the end. I never had to adapt to any enemies, mainly because 90% of the enemies you fight are all the same mechanically and have no special abilities.\n\n4. No need to scavenge for stuff\n\nElizabeth (I'll get to her later) will conveniently throw stuff to you like Health, Ammo, and Salts (AKA Eve) whenever you need it. You don't need to actually explore to come out of a fight alive because the game will protect you from dying for as long as it can. And, as mentioned earlier, if you do die despite all the game's efforts, you are Deus Ex Machina'd back to life.\n\nRE-EDIT: Started another playthrough, this time on Hard. It seems to be the perfect balance between 1999 mode and Normal. Still a tad on the easy side, however.\n\nThe good thing I will say about the gameplay is the Skyline fights were really, really fun. The absolute best parts of the game. If they made the entire gameplay based around Skylines (and made the Vigors more useful and gotten rid of the 2 weapon limit), it would've gotten a STRONG recommendation from me. Unfortunately, Skyline fights are fairly few and far between, even though they were one of the big advertised features if my memory serves me right.\n\nNow, let's move on to the story, shall we?\n\nRE-RE-RE-RE-EDITED THIS SECTION:\n\nThe time-travelling aspect makes sense now thanks to Steam user Imperion. After playing through some more and thinking really hard, I conclude the ending does not totally contradict the Many Worlds theory, However, there are other problems with it that are massive spoilers, but I will link a video describing said problems [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c2LM-xIvSg]here.[/url] \n\nFor those that don't know, the Many Worlds theory is a theory where every single action that could be taken [i]is[/i] taken in a different universe. Say, in this universe, I'm writing a largely negative review of BioShock Infinite, whereas in a different universe, I write one that's more positive. Of course, there would also be other universes where I don't write a review at all,  one where the review is more in the middle, etc.\n\nAnyway, the story begins with you, Booker DeWitt, on a rowboat headed up to a lighthouse that will bring you up to the city of Columbia, a floating city in the sky. Why is it floating, you ask? Dunno. It's not like it needs to be isolated, like Rapture needed to be. I guess maybe because they had nowhere else to put it?\n\nAnyway, you are instructed to retrieve a 17-19 year-old girl named Elizabeth and bring her to New York. Simple enough, right? Well, once you get to Columbia, you enter a raffle and win. What do you win? The chance to throw a baseball at an interracial couple. At this point, you can either throw it at the couple or at the guy running the raffle.\n\nYour choice doesn't matter here, because no matter your descision the people start calling you the False Prophet because the markings on your hand and everything goes to hell. You get a gun and start shooting the Columbian police and make your way to where Elizabeth is kept.\n\nYou know the whole racism thing I just mentioned? The game forgets about it for a while, as will I for this review.\n\nBack to Elizabeth, she's a plot device, nothing more. Unlike most people I've talked with, I never felt any sort of emotional attachment to her. She wasn't interesting as a character to me, and she felt artificial. I can't remember a single line of her dialogue, in fact. Booker himself isn't particularly interesting, either. You could argue that you're supposed to put yourself into his role, but that's hard to do when your character isn't a silent protaganist.\n\nHer \"special ability\" if you want to call it that is the ability to open up \"tears\" (not crying tears, tears as in ripping apart paper) to other dimensions. This is basically how the game works the Many Worlds theory into its plot, and while it's not a terrible idea, it doesn't execute it all that well.\n\nI forget if this was mentioned or not, but one thing I kept wondering is why Elizabeth didn't just open a tear to the outside of the tower she was trapped in and then live a normal life. I think they talked about it at some point, but I don't remember.\n\nAnyway, now you might be asking, \"how does the story integrate into the gameplay?\" The answer is that it doesn't. At least, it doesn't very well.\n\nYou can open up tears during combat sections, and while it's a cool idea in theory, it felt really limited. You can only open up tears that put in random objects or walls and sometimes friendly Patriots, one of the not-boring enemies in the game that becomes boring because of how often you fight them and how predictable they are. Elizabeth doesn't ever actively participate in combat, however. Instead, she watches from the sidelines and tosses you Health and Salts whenever you get low on either.\n\nA part of this game's story is that you're trying to protect Elizabeth so that you can escort her to New York safely, but it never feels that way because you don't ever have to protect Elizabeth. The enemies don't even try to find her or attack her or capture her. They always are 100% focused on you, the player. Because Elizabeth is so passive during gameplay, I'd often forget she was even there until I needed to open a tear and I heard her say \"On it!\" or something like that.\n\nI was severely disappointed by this game's story after being told how amazing it was. What I got instead was a story that outwardly acted like it had depth and then really didn't.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, the music is ok and serves its purpose, but I can't remember any of the tracks. The graphics are very pretty though, I'll give the game that. If you love this game, good for you, I'm glad you enjoyed it. As for me, I didn't. I suggest buying BioShock 1 instead of this.","timestamp_created":1408662763,"timestamp_updated":1409763013,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500440239906311035","comment_count":20,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11812650","author":{"steamid":"76561198091017252","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":626,"last_played":1506807131},"language":"english","review":"I'd reccomend this game to any and everyone one of the best games I've ever played","timestamp_created":1408661959,"timestamp_updated":1408661959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11812474","author":{"steamid":"76561197994054422","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":168,"last_played":1423098864},"language":"portuguese","review":"Mindblowing","timestamp_created":1408660715,"timestamp_updated":1408660715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11812189","author":{"steamid":"76561198065400886","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1784,"last_played":1563392057},"language":"czech","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1408658829,"timestamp_updated":1414235809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11812179","author":{"steamid":"76561198086426553","num_games_owned":235,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1091,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1471980302},"language":"german","review":"Is ganz Tööfte","timestamp_created":1408658756,"timestamp_updated":1408658756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11812116","author":{"steamid":"76561197971763391","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1827,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1827,"last_played":1405629931},"language":"english","review":"7.5 out of 10.

I could go on and on about this game, but I'm going to keep this review short and simple. I am one who enjoys experiencing a game, rather than just playing it. I want the story to be engaging, the gameplay to be smooth, and the art design to have a soul. This game has it all!!!\n\nHalf-Life has been my number one FPS for a long time because of how engaging it really is and how well the elements of the game come together. It will always be a classic for sure. However, Bioshock Infinite (and the original Bioshock) has shown me that a game's story can be just as original and immersive as any book or film. This is a perfect example of why I enjoy video games: it truly is an art form. You have music, sound design, art design, acting, plot, among many other things that contribute to the amazing feat of creating a visual world that we get to step into and experience. One of the best things this game does is, just as the Half-Life series has done, it keeps you engaged into the story by never letting go of the first person perspective, even in the \"scripted\" moments, so everything is experienced through your eyes. However, this game takes this idea one step further with the incredible addition of your supporting character. This particular character is what really brings Bioshock Infinite to another level.\n\nFor those of you who haven't experienced this game, I suggest you do and try to stay away from any notion of its story before playing. Sit back, turn the lights off, pump up the volume, and experience this masterpiece of gaming.\n\n5 stars out of 5","timestamp_created":1408651276,"timestamp_updated":1415308505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11810683","author":{"steamid":"76561198098399105","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1701,"last_played":1524770302},"language":"spanish","review":"Bueno , la saga Bioshock en si es demasiado buena , empezar bajo el mar y terminar sobre las nubes , Bioshock Infinite a demostrado superar a sus 2 juegos anteriores y por mucho , es uno de esos juegos que se debe recomerdar si o si para cualquier tipo de plataforma , la historia , los graficos y la personalidad de los personajes , un 10 de 10 completo.\n\nSobre los DLC Burial At Sea Part 1 y 2 , me sorprendio mucho ver Rapture con los nuevos graficos de Infinite , y sobre todo la historia para finalizar en si por completo Bioshock.\n\nEn si ; Excelente juego 10/10","timestamp_created":1408649896,"timestamp_updated":1408649896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11810389","author":{"steamid":"76561198046450508","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":343,"last_played":1407559374},"language":"russian","review":"Отличный гемплей, красивые пеизажи и очень захватываюший сюжет!!!","timestamp_created":1408648360,"timestamp_updated":1408648360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520833313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11809788","author":{"steamid":"76561198042925212","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1139,"last_played":1408643301},"language":"german","review":"Beewährte Bioshock-Mechanik, leicht verändertes Setting.

Долгое время я был убежден что не может, однако мое мнение изменилась после Биошока. Как говорил Марк Бусслер (Mark Bussler) в своей рецензии к первой игре серии «Биошок это испытание». Это игра испытывает на прочность ваш интеллект. Сможете ли вы разгадать её тайны? В оболочке красивого шутера на Unreal Engine 3 спрятана чудо философской мысли. \nЯ не хочу рассказывать вам ничего о сюжете, просто поверьте на слово, он может уделать большинство представителей кинематографа и литературы. Для меня сюжет Биошока находится на одном уровне с «Бойцовским клубом» и «Началом». У сюжета только один минус: в самой игре он не объясняется, чтобы понять его – вам придется искать ответы в google.\nТеперь перейдем к «оболочке» игры. Это шутер с очень красивой графикой (даже на низких настройках) и в который работает по тому же принципу что и Halo или Crysis. Вас ставят на арену с врагами и предоставляют разные способы их уничтожения. У вас есть обычное оружие (носить с собой можно только два): винтовки, автоматы, пистолеты, дробовики и тяжелое оружие. У главного героя также есть спец способности (всего их восемь) которые должны разнообразить геймплей и справляются с этим на «отлично». В игре конечно есть и прямолинейные сцены, но это не проблема. Не малую роль в разнообразии игрового процесса играет Элизабет. Это, пожалуй, единственный напарник в играх который действительно помогает. В общем, как шутер, Биошок довольно хорош, хоть и не претендует на трон Half Life или F.E.A.R. \nХочу вас предупредить на счет одного из боссов: приемная мать Элизабет (это не большой спойлер). Эта тварь может возродить тела убитых вами врагов, по этому делайте по умному и уничтожьте их тела электричеством. \nВ конце хочу добавить что Биошок это глоток свежего воздуха. Игра вышла без мульти плеера и ко-опа, а ДЛС можно смело пропустить мимо – игра хороша и без них.

In your grandathers wet dream, you team up with Elizabeth, someone you need to escort as the main plot. Elizabeth is great and can take care of her own. Finally, an escort bitch that knows what they're doing. Even with some minor plot holes with the whole chaning time/dimension, the plot and story is great, with a thoughtful ending.

A few complaints I do have for this game are, (1) you cant carry every weapon you pick up (in the dlc you can) (2) some enemies can get stuck inside walls making it hard to pass certain missions that require you to kill every enemy getting to the point where all your time was wasted to do the mission over again. (3) most vigor upgrades seem WAY too expensive unless you use most of your time finding every penny you need for them, but in most cases you dont really need them much to the point where its not really neccessary at all. i end up only upgrading 1 or 2 (4) In the DLC I do find it annoying that people can kill you in 1 hit or give you massive damage and i do get that it has to be all about stealth but thats just me, not a bad challenge. (5) the game requires 50 gb with the DLC which seems massive. given all of these its a good game to pick up especially for the discounted price.","timestamp_created":1408578503,"timestamp_updated":1511762812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11799826","author":{"steamid":"76561198059493581","num_games_owned":714,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":1017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":588,"last_played":1396113279},"language":"brazilian","review":"gostei!!!","timestamp_created":1408577307,"timestamp_updated":1408577307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11799824","author":{"steamid":"76561198046068654","num_games_owned":415,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1022,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":748,"last_played":1535349102},"language":"english","review":"Played and beat this on ps3, but had to get it on pc.

The sights of Columbia are beautiful, even at their darkest amd dreariest.  The society of Columbia is disturbing,  since I'd rather say the least.  The enemies and friends of Columbia are fierce, the revelations that you will get on Columbia,  the Lamb of Columbia,  the false shepherd,  and the songbird, will keep you gunning and grinning all the way through.  This game is superb fun, lots of upgrades to obtain, many weapons to use, but my favorite is what happens toward the end of the game. I still dont know what to make of it, so I intend to beat Bioshock 1 & 2, then play it again.  \n\nThe DLC episodes are very fun as well, exploring the environment of Rapture, the location for the first 2 Bioshocks.\nClash in Clouds is also interesting. It's arena-style combat against waves of enemies is sure to make many FPS enthusiasts smile. \n\nSo, at this very moment, base game + season pass is on sale for $15. the triple-pack for all of the bioshock games is on sale for $10.19.

I bought it on steam sale so for a long period of time the game just lied in my library \"collecting dust\". I was bored one day and decided to try it out so my expectations for this game was equal to zero. \n\nAt first the game started out quite as a mystery and the incentive to keep on playing is that you need to clear your debt and to find the girl. Who is the girl and what kind of debt are we talking about? In the end of the game you realise this is about way more than it first seemed to be. Quite frankly I was something you can call mindblown when the game was finished, and to add on top of that, I also shed a tear for the first time in my life over a game. \n\nBioshock Infinite is a beautiful game with a really heavy and focused story. For me the game was not about the use of the vigors, effectiveness of guns or overall gameplay. It was about the progression of the story. I was so invested in it that I really didn't mind much about gameplay. But that didn't mean I enjoyed luring my enemies into my vigor traps to then blow them to pieces with my shotgun. The game feels rewarding with the upgrades and equipment you have for disposal and some upgrades really felt like it turned the battle on my side. I played this on hard so it was quite challenging in some places and I had to think sometimes before battle. It's not really guns blazin' in battles and the game often offers you several way to approach a battle. \n\nCollectibles in this game is also something I appreciated. It was not just something crappy to make the game longer but it expanded the story and you got to know alot of characters more in that way. \n\nNow this game doesn't come without flaws. \n- Prices in vending machines are not thought out exactly\n- You always have alot of money\n- NPC models pretty much look the same\n- Some of the neutral behavior Liz has(lockpicking, coin tossing) takes away the feeling since she has a ever changing mood in the game\n- The story can be quite complicated( but genius) so you might have some unanswered questions and not full understanding of the story once you're done. \n\nOverall Bioshock Infinite is one of the best singleplayer game I've ever played with a beautiful story and smooth gameplay and it also treats the player as a human being with a brain so regarding the story you will need to pay attention and also puzzle pieces together to make the story make sense.","timestamp_created":1408476956,"timestamp_updated":1408476956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11781489","author":{"steamid":"76561198023948935","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1417690679},"language":"english","review":"With 10 hours gameplay its not very infinite. 10/10","timestamp_created":1408463676,"timestamp_updated":1408463676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11780797","author":{"steamid":"76561198076557678","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":997,"last_played":1463485492},"language":"english","review":"completely different setting but it still manages to capture the aesthetics of rapture","timestamp_created":1408459890,"timestamp_updated":1408459890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11779051","author":{"steamid":"76561198007294175","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3278,"last_played":1408430548},"language":"english","review":"excellent game!","timestamp_created":1408449843,"timestamp_updated":1408449843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11777054","author":{"steamid":"76561198068416874","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":369,"last_played":1409301298},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegazo imprescindible, una gozada encontrarse con este espectáculo visual después de jugar a sus dos antecesores, sin duda el mejor Bioschock, además el guión, doblaje y la interpretación son inmejorables.
