Everything looks really pretty and the effects look really good, without trying too hard, also making it so from a far they don't look bad in a weaker computer... For the sound, dear lord the sound is amazing, it's so immersive and it feels right... I never have epic music when I'm in a quiet part when i'm solving a puzzle, and accordingly I never have silence  in an epic part... But the quietness while solving the puzzles makes it so you can really enjoy how awesome all the sound effects are... The Co-op campaign was extremely fun to play with a friend, the 4 portal system makes really harder puzzles, and the ability to kill your friend at some points followed by Gladus's commentaries creates really humorous parts... And finally the story, without any doubt Portal 2's strongest point, it's immersive, funny, creative, not too long, not too short, doesn't have time wasters...

Una trama di un certo livello però, scrivere due righe sono capaci tutti.....\nPortal 2 è un capolavoro bello e buono, potrei finire qui. Invece no perchè c'è tanta di quella sostanza in questa produzione che non so dove iniziare....dal lato tecnico magari. L'engine è legerissimo e gira anche su sistemi datati, a patto di scegliere una risoluzione più bassa ma con tutti i dettagli attivati. Le ambientazioni sono dissociate ma giocando si scopre il perchè, dalla prima parte alla seconda parte. Ma lo stile è pulito, godibilissimo, una gioia per gli occhi. Il sonoro è eccellente, non solo per le musiche ma per i toni di voce dei protagonisti che sono qualcosa di mai sentito pima in un videogioco. E qui si apre una partentesi, lunga....Whetly è fenomenale, dissacrante, logorroico, paranoiode, petulante, ironico, cinico. Ed è una scatoletta di metallo con una IA al suo interno!E' incredibile come la Valve sia riuscita a tirare fuori un personaggio simile con queste caratteristiche, un personaggio che ci accompagna in tutta l'avventura e che, per quanto a volte si vorrebbe tirargli un pugno per farlo tacere, non si può non affezionarci. E glaDOS...al pari di Wethely penso sia uno dei personaggi meglio riusciti degli ultimi dieci anni e in Portal 2, raggiunge livelli di assurdo e comicità mai visti primi. Ironia e comicità, sono i pilastri fondamentali di questa produzione e ce se ne accorge da subito, dal primo incontro con Weathley e in tutto il gioco, la cura per le battute, i dialoghi è talmente riuscito che è un peccato finire il tutto.\nParadossalmente la parte meno riuscta del gioco sono gli enigmi...non che siano facilissimi ma si poteva osare di più perchè il gioco ha delle potenzialità incredibili che non sono state sfruttate.
