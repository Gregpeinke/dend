I guess listening to other people talk of the largest cathedral in some distant country as an awe-inspiring piece of human ingenuity for half of your life usually results in you finally entering the halls and thinking to yourself: “What an old building.” Still feels kinda cool nonetheless, but can’t help but thinking you would enjoy it a lot better if you found about it yourself. Half-Life 2 is largely a study case. A Citizen Kane of video games, if you will, absolutely revolutionary in its time, properly crafted and well presented, but suffering – for very much the same reasons. In a post-Half-Life 2 landscape, ideas that made the game so good are thanks to it just so commonplace, this game can hardly blow you away anymore. But when you think about all the clever and non-intrusive storytelling, pacing, level design, even the range of stuff you do in the game, you realize its genius. But unless it’s one of your first games evarr, this realization will always be an afterthought. No self-respecting gamer goes through life without playing Half-Life 2 and that’s why I recommend it, but at the same time, I now know better than to shove it down people’s throat.","timestamp_created":1438513291,"timestamp_updated":1438513291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17346399","author":{"steamid":"76561198127722575","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":383,"last_played":1574530346},"language":"german","review":"Half life 2 ist sogar besser als sein vorgänger.\nDie neue(alte) source engine ist einfach super in diesem spiel.\n\n-die geschichte ist super spannend\n-Grafik für damals sehr gut\n-Gameplay und das bedienen der Waffen ist auch super\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1438503540,"timestamp_updated":1438503540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17343505","author":{"steamid":"76561198096429917","num_games_owned":293,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":3208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1297,"last_played":1585721127},"language":"english","review":"An amazeing game even to today","timestamp_created":1438484265,"timestamp_updated":1438484265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17342411","author":{"steamid":"76561198125044906","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1644967019},"language":"spanish","review":"Buenisimo!!!! es uno de los mejores fps que he jugado, espero salga el Half Life 3 algun dia.","timestamp_created":1438477835,"timestamp_updated":1438477835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17342165","author":{"steamid":"76561198134799037","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":666,"last_played":1463696191},"language":"english","review":"The predecessor to the much known and aclaimed Half-Life lives up to it's standards and continues to be an all time pc game, I extremely recommend playing this game for it's amazing story and gameplay ecspecially for it's time.","timestamp_created":1438476393,"timestamp_updated":1438476393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17341557","author":{"steamid":"76561198119723520","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2112,"last_played":1428189503},"language":"english","review":"awesome and an amazing game, valve rules","timestamp_created":1438472839,"timestamp_updated":1438472839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17338754","author":{"steamid":"76561198079389029","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3149,"last_played":1633285361},"language":"english","review":"BEST GAME ON EARTH","timestamp_created":1438460037,"timestamp_updated":1438460037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474117904901504517","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17338363","author":{"steamid":"76561198090421730","num_games_owned":349,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":713,"last_played":1560045448},"language":"english","review":"This game was outstanding!

Gabbagool Newell and his team of dirty tricks rubbed out a sequel to their classic clusterfuck Half-Life; Straight onto the lusty red lips of their fanbase as they sip on their overpriced Starbucks coffee and browse Reddit to discuss how Marx was a visionary and 'The Man' just keeps us all down. Did I mention I make sure to Pre-Order every major Triple-A Video Game release to fill the gaping void of emptyness in my personal life? That's not important though.\n\nWhat is important is what a miserable pile of trash and rusty syringe needles Valve has dumped on our collective front lawns. First of all, those shits at Gabriella \"Granny Panty\" Newell's* Bugchasing Bonanza forgot to package Half-Life 2: Deathmatch WITH the actual game. Instead you get to pay an extra $9 for Multiplayer everybody abandoned as soon as Counter Strike: Source reered its ugly face around the corner. Second, I didn't pay hard earned dollars for a glorified tech demo of your outdated physics engine. Renderware had more power than Source and everyone reading this all knows it.\n\nThe developers just couldn't help but drudge up \"nostalgia\" to pander to the braindead reviewers and consumers who bought the first game, we begin with G-Spot telling you how none of the events of the first game mattered because aliens took over earth anyway and the only other person who could help Gordon Freeman is trapped in his Space Freezer right now. This then fades into a train ride into the dystopic City 17. After a 20 minute walking segment you meet the alcoholic security guard from Black Mesa- Barney, who wishes his father paid more attention to him as a child. Another boring 20 minute walking segment leads to you meeting the mixed-race mutt daughter of Black Mesa's token [strike]Black[/strike] [b]PROUD PERSON OF COLOR[/b]- Alyx Vance, who wants Gordon's superior Aryan genetics inside her. Fast forward through an uncomfortable, unskippable cutscene where Kleiner makes sweet, sloppy love to the Headcrab chained to his radiator and we finally get to play the game.\n\nThat is, it might have qualified as a game had Valve cut out the Airboat section where you're chased by a Helicopter for 2 hours before you can even damage it. The weapons feel like my wrinkled, limp penis is smacking you in your sleep and enemies are too easily distracted by Gordon's incoherent ramblings about White Privilege and the Patriarchy to even attack you intelligently. There's actually very little to say about this game because theres very little to this game. You run from Point A to Point B and listen to NPC's tell you about your next objective before shooting a conveniently placed explosive barrel to clear a path for you to move on. Then you shoot a magic energy ball into the final bosses asshole and you're treated to a bigger cop out than the end of Neon Genesis Evangelion. This game sold for $60 at retail, everybody. I repeat: $60 at retail for a tech demo.\n\n5/10: Good thing Valve is too busy with Microtransactions and A.S.S.F.A.G.G.O.T.S to address their fan's concerns about the future of their flagship franchise!\n\n*(Gabriella used the money he (now xyshe) embezzled from his idiot fans to get the sex change operation xie always wanted, please be considerate and not bigoted towards our [strike]mentally ill[/strike] allies #HIVwins #nevermarryandneverreproducewhiteman)","timestamp_created":1438413181,"timestamp_updated":1438413588,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":13,"weighted_vote_score":"0.333660751581192017","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17327092","author":{"steamid":"76561198210591008","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":863,"last_played":1437324679},"language":"spanish","review":"La verdad lo que tengo que decir de este juego es algo que no puedo expresarlo con palabras aparte que mi historia con los videojuegos empezo con el half life jugando su deathmatch en la cabinas del internet con mis amigos y pues cuando obtuve mi primera computadora el primer juego que me compre fue el half life 2 ya que es juego muy bueno demasiado dira yo, en fin half life estara por siempre y para siempre en mi vida aunque llevo media vida esperando el Half_Life 3 o Half-Life 2: episode three lo seguire esperando aunque durante unos cuantos años mas","timestamp_created":1438401842,"timestamp_updated":1438401842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17326513","author":{"steamid":"76561198148028667","num_games_owned":372,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":759,"last_played":1451030468},"language":"english","review":"bought this because of all the hype, but couldnt see what all the fuss was about","timestamp_created":1438398175,"timestamp_updated":1438398175,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.40298086404800415","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17326159","author":{"steamid":"76561198079214282","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":763,"last_played":1655937651},"language":"brazilian","review":"Esse jogo é uma delicia","timestamp_created":1438395468,"timestamp_updated":1438395468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547413825988769531","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17324816","author":{"steamid":"76561198031534827","num_games_owned":293,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":1242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1159,"last_played":1437542615},"language":"brazilian","review":"A título de esclarecimento, este review abrange não apenas Half-Life 2, como também HL2: Episode 1 e HL2: Episode 2, pois ambos os episódios apenas dão continuidade aos eventos do HL2, sendo, portanto, indispensáveis também. Todavia, HL2: Lost Coast, outro software que faz parte do pacote, nada mais é do que uma fase demonstrativa dos recursos da Source Engine (motor gráfico destes jogos), não tendo nenhuma relevância para a história do jogo, apenas é uma curiosidade para quem se interessa pelo desenvolvimento de games. Enfim, ao review.\n\nMeia-Vida 2 é a sequência para o clássico Half-Life. Já tem alguns anos desde seu lançamento, mas o visual é muito detalhado considerando os padrões da época que surgiu. Tem controles responsivos e precisos, além de uma ótima progressão, introduzindo aos poucos uma boa variedade de armas, incluindo a icônica “Gravity Gun” (este é o nome popular, pois ela na verdade se chama Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator), útil tanto para puzzles, quanto para usar contra inimigos, seja com um raio que dispara, seja lançando objetos espalhados nos cenários contra eles. O jogo intercala momentos de bastante ação, de diálogos entre NPCs que explicam os acontecimentos (e um ponto forte é a relação com Alyx, uma mulher que o ajuda e o acompanha em boa parte da jornada) e de quebra-cabeças baseados em física. Sua história é bem interessante e detalhada, começando alguns anos depois do primeiro Half-Life, num mundo distópico e bastante tecnológico, sendo que Gordon Freeman, o protagonista, acaba se aliando a um movimento de resistência, que aos poucos tenta descobrir os planos para o planeta e combate as ações dos opressores. É um jogo excelente, mas que infelizmente parece incompleto, pois mesmo com a história principal e dois episódios, alguns aspectos da trama permaneceram inconclusos ou inexplicados, dando margem à praticamente eterna esperança de um Half-Life 3. Mesmo assim, é uma série que merece ser apreciada pra quem gosta de FPS e quer uma experiência mais profunda.","timestamp_created":1438388044,"timestamp_updated":1438388044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495867758989334106","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17320892","author":{"steamid":"76561198101846376","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":4113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1551,"last_played":1659023286},"language":"english","review":"Really fun and intresting.\nIt has good voice acting.\n10/10","timestamp_created":1438370226,"timestamp_updated":1438370226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492307692766189575","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17320477","author":{"steamid":"76561198066131599","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":503,"last_played":1438368739},"language":"english","review":"This game is actually annoying.

I Know right?) Is truly one of the best games ever made. Continuing the story of Gorden Freeeman about 20 years after the first game in which you must take down city 17 and free the earth of combine control. The puzzles were a great balance of challenge and action. Some may cloaim that the graphics are \"outdated\" or its old but to that i say well it has been some years but Graphics sometimes don't matter, the original Half-Life is sure outdated but the gameplay keeps me playing. Some people may also claim they don't undertsnad what the ufss is about with this game, I guess this genre is not for them but for 99.99% of you reading this I definitly recomoned you buy this amazing masterpice. The game is a comsiderable length and there is never a part where a puzzle is too diffucult or hard. The only thing I don't like is the ladder climbing (But thats with CS:GO too, Darn source engine).

No contaré más de la historia pues sería arruinarles la experiencia, lo que sí diré es que es totalmente inmersiva y que cada uno de los 14 capítulos que componen Half-Life 2 son fabulosos, con algunos a notar como el tétrico “Nos vamos a Ravenholm” o el explosivo “Nova Prospekt” y otros realmente memorables como “Anticiudadano Uno” o “Seguid a Freeman!”, capítulos en los que el protagonista aparece como el símbolo indiscutible de la resistencia humana contra la fuerza opresora de Combine. Son momentos  intensos, incluso épicos, que se quedarán grabados en tu memoria.\n\nCon respecto al apartado técnico, el juego ha envejecido fabulosamente, es cierto que acá no tenemos texturas HD ni modelados ni expresiones faciales ultra-realistas, pero créanme cuando digo que para ser un juego de hace 10 años luce espectacular aún a día de hoy y les aseguro que correrá suavemente en computadoras con varios años encima o con cualquier computadora actual que no esté preparada específicamente para jugar. Poder disfrutar de esta obra de arte del ocio interactivo prácticamente sin ninguna limitante de hardware a día de hoy es sencillamente de agradecer. No hay excusas.\n\nSobre la jugabilidad, se mejoró mucho con respecto a la primera entrega. Nuestro personaje se mueve mejor por el escenario, ya no existen mayores dificultades con los saltos o con el uso de instrumentos, como las escaleras por ejemplo, pues incorporaron el uso de la tecla E para subir y bajar de las mismas, algo que realmente no recuerdo existía en el Half-Life original y que al menos a mi me dio muchos dolores de cabeza. Se incorporaron nuevos elementos como los vehículos, y también nuevas armas. Se mejoró notablemente la IA de los enemigos, en fin, varias otras novedades jugables que deben experimentarlas por sí mismos.\n\nFinalmente, la música, simplemente espectacular, encajando siempre perfectamente con cada uno de los sucesos que se van desencadenando a lo largo del juego, contribuyendo así a aquella inmersión que mencionaba anteriormente. Todo un acierto.\n\nPara terminar mi nota: Un 10/10 inobjetable, un must-have en la librería de cualquier videojugador que quiera vivir una experiencia interactiva inolvidable.\n\n[TIP: En el episodio de Nova Prospekt hay un bug con un switch ubicado en una de las salas de control que permite abrir una puerta para poder avanzar. El problema se da cuando algún objeto, como alguna torreta, por ejemplo, bloquea la puerta y hace que sea imposible activar el switch. Mi consejo, antes de activar los switchs verifica que no exista nada obstruyendo la puerta y guarda constantemente tu partida, así si te topas con el bug puedes retomar tu partida en un punto anterior y evitarlo].\n\n[Como no podía ser de otra manera he nominado a Half-Life 2 en la categoría \"La prueba del tiempo\" de los Steam Awards 2016. Y sí, estoy actualizando esta review para obtener mi insignia.]","timestamp_created":1438136049,"timestamp_updated":1480017601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":32,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.739104688167572021","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17272933","author":{"steamid":"76561198160328949","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1480,"last_played":1629162032},"language":"brazilian","review":"bem loko\n","timestamp_created":1438121078,"timestamp_updated":1438121078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17272821","author":{"steamid":"76561198059767024","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1332,"last_played":1644100301},"language":"english","review":"This game is beautiful.

It is going to be quite hard for a game to beat this story. It has the right amount of plot twists and surprises that will keep you guessing, never able to know what comes next.\n\n[Gameplay]\nIn the sense of how smooth the game is with shooting and combat was a nice surprise for the Source engine and made me personally happy. The shooting was on point with the only problem being the ammo capasity in a few guns. Other than that I couldn't find any problems with that. Walking and running wasn't changed or different from any Sourse engine games so I couldn't really say anything about it.\n\n[Graphics]\nI don't feel like I have much of a right to judge graphics in this game seen as it's made on the Source engine and by valve (No offence). The graphics were pretty much right on point with what I expected, by none the less better than Half-Life 1. The only reason this is not a 10/10 is because throughout the game there would be slight lighting problems or shading would be off and worst of all clipping textures.\n\n[Entertainment]\nThis game was SO MUCH FUN to play, along with the great story you were always in combat, fighting through waves of enemys being either combine or weird creatures raised from hell, or those annoying headcrabs. The action was spot on and I very much would enjoy if it was the same in Half-Life 3\n\n[Humor]\nYou may ignore this part if it doesn't fit what you're looking for, I just like to add this in for the people like me. This game was in all honesty, humorous. The characters were all wel devoloped with different jokes and personalities, even some of the creatures. There were several funny moments I enjoyed alot but overall, alot of the humor was hidden. I am satisfied with the amount of jokes Valve added, but there could have been a bit more.\n\n[Difficulty]\nHalf-Life 2 was all in all, a decently easy game. There were some levels that took several hundred tries to perfect but, alot of the time it held your hand,  usually on a straight path to the objective. The Source engine totally could have handled a bit more of an open environment for the levels, making it so you could choose how you wanted to complete the level. I had trouble with a few parts decently close to the beginning actually, once I got most of the weapons, the game was just a walk in the wasteland. There's not much more I could say about the difficulty other than it could have been harder.\n\n[Overall]\nI would 100% recemmend this game in a heart beat to anyone, It's a great game that's well made and enjoyable to play. Finishing the game is one of the most satisfying endings in a game i've had so far, and with a community surrounded by games that just release the same crap over and over again (cough cough, Call of Duty) it's a fresh consept in a stale community. My overall rating of this game would definatly be a 9/10, and for the price it's at normally ($10) it's alot more than you pay for, and there's even a demo! +1 Brownie point for Valve.\n\nI really hope this review helped even a little bit, even if no one sees it, i enjoyed putting my thoughts out there  for future buyers.","timestamp_created":1438025039,"timestamp_updated":1438025039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17253054","author":{"steamid":"76561198080057208","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":413,"last_played":1438016766},"language":"english","review":"i actually need 2 finish this","timestamp_created":1438019937,"timestamp_updated":1521361888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478876441717147827","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17252803","author":{"steamid":"76561198089246253","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2492,"last_played":1470074092},"language":"english","review":"This game shall not be rated.
