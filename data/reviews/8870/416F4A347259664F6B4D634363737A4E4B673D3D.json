The graphics are beautiful. The story is amazing. The characters are all unique in their own way. Even though I have not yet had the chance to play the first two, I still understood the story pretty well. My favorite part of the game was probably the ending. There were many twists to the game that the ending reaveled that I did not expect at all and it took me a while to put all the pieces together even after the game had ended.

The developers acquired their reputation from a System Shock 2 remake that was popular with people who never played the original.  Now they've moved onto their own content and the lack of creativity really shows.\n\nIt's an achingly linear console shooter with no opportunities for stealth, dialogue, or exploration.  Just endless combat.  The short, unimaginative levels require frequent backtracking to disguise the lack of content.  The combat is particularly pointless since your death rewards you with ammo and mana.  I stopped looting early on, never touched a vending machine or equipped new gear.  Punching things to death usually worked and you get a free refill when it doesn't.  \n\nThe centerpiece of the story is an unlikable deus ex machina whose superpowers are hoarding, causing headache inducing graphical glitches (the static for the “tears”), and being an endless stream of nonsense for plot detours and subsequent advancement.   [spoiler]Multiple universes.[/spoiler]  Nothing makes sense, or ever has to, when writers decide to open that particular can of worms.\n\nI found no way to influence the story.  Killing every single person you meet, especially the few peaceful mannequins, elicits no response from your vapid companion.  You are never allowed to make a decision or do anything besides kill the same handful of enemies again and again and again and again.  All decisions were made by the writers and you're told to hit the appropriate button when it's time to advance the plot.  This kind of barely interactive game can only work when there's a good story or enjoyable gameplay.  Unfortunately Bioshock Infinite has neither.  One can only hope the developers stick to remakes in the future.","timestamp_created":1405276745,"timestamp_updated":1405276745,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11220190","author":{"steamid":"76561198010180088","num_games_owned":863,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":1342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":841,"last_played":1414342005},"language":"english","review":"[b]This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend BioShock Infinite then skip to [u]Results[/u] and read from there.[/b]\n\nIrrational Games takes what 2K started did and pushes it above and beyond reality. One cannot come to words for how to describe BioShock Infinite as there are no words that possibly capture its essence. \n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nAs you sit in your little office you are given an offer, one that will allow you to be free of all that you owe. Two people, a man and a woman, provide you with an ultimatum with you accept. You are given the opportunity to go to a world in the clouds and retrieve a girl. As you push through your mission you will learn more about yourself than you ever wanted to know. \n\n[b]Campaign:[/b]\nBioShock Infinite campaign is of decent length. Depending on the difficulty you chose and your play-style you get through this game from anywhere between 10-16 hours. I would recommend taking your time as this game is more about the story than the gameplay and missing the smallest element can result in a completely different understanding. The campaign is divvied up across 40-chapters, all varying in length, some take only a minute, while others you’ll be wondering for at-least an hour. An interesting element in Infinite is that almost all of the cinematics involve player interaction. You control basic camera elements, as well as in some scenes interaction with the environment. This provides a more immersive campaign than traditional games. \n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nBioShock Infinite does away with tonics, ADAM, and limited weapon upgrades. Instead of Plasmids you use Vigors, which are essentially the same thing with a different name. The only currency in the game is Silver Eagles, most likely based on the US Silver Dollar and Half-Dollar. You can use this money to buy weapon upgrades, Vigor upgrades, and ammo/health/salts. Unlike in the first two you no longer need to acquire Adam to get Vigor upgrades, which means you can customize your gameplay based on what you plan to use more. I was weapon intensive so I spent all my cash on weapon upgrades, and only upgraded on Vigor for the achievement. You also don’t buy Vigors instead you unlock them for free throughout the campaign which means you will have every single one by the end of the game. \n\nThere are 14-weapons that you will find throughout the campaign: Sky-Hook, Broadsider Pistol, China Boom Shotgun, Triple R Machine Gun, Huntsman Carbine, Bird’s Eye Sniper Rifle, Paddywhacker Hand Cannon, Peppermill Crank Gun, Pig Flak Volley Gun, Heater, Burstgun, Repeater, and Hail Fire. So you won’t feel limited in this game by your weapon choice, as you have more than you can ever imagine. Although despite all these choices you can only ever carry two-weapons at one time. So you will more than likely stick to what you like, as you may not get it back for a while if you let it go. \n\nA new feature to the series is Infusions; infusions are vials found throughout the campaign that allow you to increase your health, shield, or salts (mana). Depending on your play-style you may find more or less of these throughout the campaign, but you will probably not find them all. Some are in secret areas, while others are right infront of your very eyes. Infusions allow you to customize yourself without limiting your capital.\n\n[b]Results:[/b]\nBioShock Infinite is an amazingly beautiful game that is aweing and terrifying at the same time. Like all BioShocks you will enter confused and cautious, but as the game unfolds you will never want to put it down. The story is beautiful, the gameplay is fantastic, the music is breathtaking, and the environment is inspirational. As you play you will learn more about yourself that you can imagine through even the simplest choices, heads or tails?\n\nPros:\n+Amazing story, amazing doesn’t even breach how brilliant it is.\n+Beautiful environment, you will stand there just to look at how beautiful the architecture is, how elegant the people are, how clean the world is.\n+Amazing music, the music is simple but rather still brings much depth to the game. Even the combat music draws shivers up your spine.\n+Great graphics engine, as well as a fantastic optimization tool. \n+Awesome boss battles, which keep you on your toes\n\nCons:\n-The enemies are kind of lacking (Most of them are the same enemy with a different gun)\n-The combat AI is rather limited, I found myself taking advantage of how stupid they were on many occasions.\n-They got rid of the manual saves (if you have a busy schedule you sometimes don’t have time to find a checkpoint).","timestamp_created":1405276205,"timestamp_updated":1405775110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505300343036651611","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11219006","author":{"steamid":"76561198001728191","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1139,"last_played":1453394287},"language":"english","review":"Gameplay can get a bit a repititive but definitely worth it for the story.

Além disso a variedade de armas e habilidades fazem com que o modo de combate seja ditado pelo jogador primordialmente. O ponto fraco no caso de Bioshock seria na minha opinião a duração do jogo, que poderia ser maior a fim de proporcionar uma ainda mais imersiva experiência aos jogadores mesmo na existência de dlc's.\n9.7/10","timestamp_created":1405216485,"timestamp_updated":1405216485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11208774","author":{"steamid":"76561198107254138","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1405214038},"language":"english","review":"Wasn't entirely sure what to think of the game when I started, but once I got through maybe a quarter of it, I couldn't stop!

Infinite's story is just that, infinite, and to narrate an infinite amount of stories, timelines and universes in 10 hours... That's a bit of a stretch. \n\nI also strongly prefer Rapture over Columbia as a setting. The melee combat is gleefully gory - the BS2 drill is now replaced by a triple hook that you can use for navigating skylines, but also, for the lack of a better word, hacking your enemies skulls. Nevertheless, at times the gore seemed a little too over the top, without clear motivation - why is Booker so sadist? Note that I said Booker, I never really became one with the protagonist (like you do with, say Freeman in HL2 or in FarCry3). \n\nThe racial struggle also seemed a bit forced; Rapture and its Ayn Randian philosophy was about individualism and a society torn under its own weight; Columbia doesn't really do that, mixing capitalism with religion and racial issues that didn't actually pose a very good motivation for slaughtering your enemies, not in that thrilling way Bioshock did - you were kind of giving mercy to the splicers, and you understood them not as villains but still had a clear reason for kililng them. \n\nThe gameplay is enjoyable, but I had a massive problem with the use a plasmids. They were not explained anywhere (at least for me), so it was kind of hard to understand why Booker kept finding odd potions here and there - and why nobody else seemed to be able to use them. In original Bioshock, you kill splicers who have gone too far with genetic mutations - something you do to yourself as well; very interesting conflict there. In Columbia, Booker is an odd guy with a hook that shoots stuff out of his hand without any apparent narrative explanation. \n\nI believe that the setting will be a little bit more enjoyable for US citizens, it relies greatly on US, especially 19th century US symbolism and aura, also providing great satire. Nevertheless, motorized patriots were just a little bit... silly for me. \n\nAs mentioned before, I really liked the melee weapon/transport hook, swooshing down the skylines was mostly fun as well, but during some sequences it was a bit hard to locate yourself and it got a bit tedious, trying to find the right place to land etc. The airstrike was very enjoyable as well. \n\nI also own the Season Pass DLC bundle, a few remarks on this as well for completionists - \n\nBurial at Sea Episode 1 - rather short (very short, in fact), does provide some good scenes (actually, the beginning and the end) and I didn't feel fulfilled after the playthrough. I was especially looking forward to explore Rapture at its hayday and I didn't feel that I got to. \n\nBurial at Sea Episode 2 - so much better than epi 1 and considering its magnitude (bringing together several timelines, Columbia, Rapture, characters from all Bioshock games), it did its job very well. BASE2 also brings in an element of stealth, which enhances the gameplay; as an avid FPS player I'm used to kicking in the door and slaughtering everything in my way, but playing as Elizabeth I trully felt vulnerable. Still, sometimes I felt that the easier way was just to take your chances and run, instead of stealthing on your enemies. The end sequence (last 15-20 minutes) are trully chilling and I have to admit that this was the only time, playing through the entire franchise, when I had to instinctively look away from the screen for a second; not gore, just... grotesque. \n\nI don't need a huge wrap-up - I am very comfortable with some things being left open and ambiguous, so I sometimes felt they tried too hard to answer some questions that would have been better off left open. Didn't feel any connection or motivation towards the enemies. But you do get some really awesome scenes, my personal favourite being the final result of Suchong's experiments :) I actually just sat for a while and stared at the screen, this was a powerful emotion which triggered a thought chain on the dilemma the original Bioshock presented so well - doing evil in the name of good. \n\nRecommended.","timestamp_created":1405039962,"timestamp_updated":1405040144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11175096","author":{"steamid":"76561198031533267","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1011,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":987,"last_played":1404947677},"language":"english","review":"Flawless game, no crashes, perfect quality. \nNothing to complain about :)","timestamp_created":1405038791,"timestamp_updated":1405038791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11174068","author":{"steamid":"76561197995926288","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1496,"last_played":1411510515},"language":"english","review":"I've really enjoyed this game, much more than its previous parts.

В первую очередь необходимо отметить, что \"чистые\" шутеры я не люблю и игру купил только потому что её очень везде хвалили. Красивый мир, хорошая графика, миленькая Элизабет и интересный сюжет.\n Это не шедевр ни разу. Просто очень хорошая, добротно сделанная видеоигра. До шедевра она,к сожалению, не дотягивает. \nИгра короткая и это скорее плюс, потому что под конец мне уже надоело отстреливать бесконечные орды врагов и я откровенно скучал. Раздражает \"консольный тип сохранения\", то есть только по чекпоинтам. Очень мешает то,что с собой можно носить только два ствола, а патроны кончаются быстро. Конечно, у нас есть напарница,которая периодически нам их кидает, но для баланса сделали так,что она делает это не часто. Спасибо хоть,что делает. Хотя,есть момент,когда её у нас забирают,а патронов как назло нет и автоматов по продаже тоже. Вот тут пришлось помучаться. В целом же управление удобное и отстрел супостатов проходит весело и задорно, главное двигаться больше. \nСюжет может показаться заумным только школьнику или очень глупому человеку. Всё довольно просто и понятно, и достаточно интересно, хоть и возникают некоторые вопросы относительно кое-каких персонажей. \nМожет показаться, что я игру критикую,но это не так.

Мало того что их любимый город из предыдущих частей сильно изменился, так и выглядело так, будто игра вообще не о том, о чём нужно. Небесный город - Колумбия сменил подводный город Рапчер(Восторг). открытые пространства, гама сменилась с тёмно-сине-зелёной на светлуо-оранджевую-розовую. Всё забурлило, начались волнения и думали что Кен Левин тупо решил сребуить деньжат за название. \nЗатем последовали геймплейные отрывки. Тут уже задумывались \"хмм, а может быть всё не так уж и плохо\". Красочная картинка, основы геймплея перекочевали прямиком из первой части, да ещё и приятная спутница появилась.\nЗа время разработка, irrational games пришлось отказаться от некоторых идей, изменить везульно некоторые вещи(к примеру облик напарницы-Элизабет менялся 3 раза, прежде чем он стал тем, что мы видем сегодня). \nКак не странно, игр получилась не просто на славу, а даже передала идеи и мысли первой части даже лучше чем вторая. Что в Рапчере, что и в Колумбии - одни и те же проблемы. Промышленик Эндою Райен сменился на религиозного (в некотором роде националиста) Комстока. Социальное неравество, рабы, идейный кризис.\nС самого начала ничего не предвещает беды, ходишь себе по небесному городу-утопии, восхищаешься его красотой, порядком. Но потом начинается, сюжетные перепетьи кунают тебя головой в \"реальность\", показывая её изнанку. Многие повороты покажуться вам \"приевшимися\", \"клешированными\", но чем ближе подходишь к концу, начинаешь понимать, что твой мозг начинает расслаиваться и растекаться. Концовка так вообще, выбьет из калеи, не только своей драмотичностью, но и ... безысходность?\nВ плане визульном: разработчики использовали движок unreal 3.5. Картинка красивая, но при этом они поигрались с цветами и аллегорией. Чем ближе к концу, тем темнее и мрачнее, вплоть до самого конца.\nГеймплейно: как и было выше сказано, суть полностью перекочевала из первой части bioshock'a, есть аналог плазмидов(электричевство, гипноз, пламя и т.д), есть оружие(пистолет, автомат, карабин, ракетница, револьвер- стандартный набор). Всё это можно улучшать за деньги, которые не там уж и легко достать. Так же появились новвоведения такие как: спутница Элизабет, которая помогает патронами, оружием, иллюзиями да и просто своим видеом + крюк и рельсы(для более ураганного геймплея) К слову об Элизабет, пока самый живой персонаж-спутник во всей игровой истории(кроме Алекс из Half-Life2). Она реагирет на окружение, тут он танцует на веранде, там она, если выдается минтку, мыслит о том что случилось с городом, тут она грустит. Крайне выраженные черты лица и немного карикатурности и утрированности движения и Вуаля, Элизабет.\nИТОГ: Игра  входит в список обязательных покупок, если вы любитель очень трогательные и замысловатых историй. Но проходя, будьте осторожны, игра не любит халатности. Если начал играть, значит вникай во всё, иначе рискуешь не понять послания, которые сокрыто в игре.","timestamp_created":1405015678,"timestamp_updated":1405015678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11169883","author":{"steamid":"76561198023685695","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":522,"last_played":1438873390},"language":"english","review":"BUY IT!
