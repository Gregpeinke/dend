Pra mim, a Orange Box era algo revolucionário: eram 5 jogos completos em um só pacote. Era incrível. Eu comprei pra poder finalmente jogar a saga HL2 e poder começar a fazer meus mapas no CS:S... mas o que de fato chamou minha atenção foi um jogo diferente que estava espremido entre TF2 e HL: este jogo era Portal.\n\nLembro que apenas abri e comecei a jogar. Não tinha visto review nenhum na internet, não sabia nem do que se tratava. Meu inglês na época ainda era meio porco, então tinha dificuldade de entender a história direito. Meu PC da época também era um lixo, então o jogo rodava a 15fps, no low. E, mesmo com esses problemas, eu fui me encantando por Portal. Era diferente, era sombrio, era inteligente, era misterioso, era desafiador... Era do caralho!\n\nEm uma tacada só eu fechei o jogo. Fiquei admirado. O final foi incrível. Eu queria mais.\nE em 2011, finalmente, veio mais. A experiência que tive com Portal 1 foi única, fantástica, e minha expectativa pro 2 estava muito alta. E a Valve não decepcionou.\n\nO que fizeram com Portal 2 foi simplesmente genial. Eles pegaram um universo rico e cheio de possibilidades, e melhoraram em milhares de vezes. A história ficou impecável. Todo progresso em si, como o plot te envolve, te faz sentir raiva, pena, tristeza, euforia... O background de todos os personagens, como eles são apresentados, o que eles realmente são, e o porque são aquilo que são... enfim!\n\nOutro quesito que achei que não tinha como ficar melhor: os testes. O desafio ficou maior, as possibilidades de encontrar a solução aumentaram, e os elementos novos tornaram tudo ainda mais criativo. E pra fechar, ainda fizeram uma campanha coop, que, de novo, ficou desgraçada de boa!\n\nPor fim, você me pergunta: são por estes motivos que esse jogo é um dos melhores da sua vida? E minha resposta é: sim. Esse jogo fez parte dela. Poucos jogos eu tenho carinho e admiração, e este é um deles. Pode ser que você discorde de mim, mas como mais de 66 mil pessoas concordam comigo, eu acho que razão pelo menos eu tenho.

For being so focused, it was essentially the perfect experience.\n\nPortal 2 takes Portal 1 and adds some new concepts. That alone would make it bigger, however this game doesn't have that same \"focused\" philosophy that the first Portal did. They wanted to create a longer experience and some padding was done because of it. Many times in the game you'll find yourself walking from test chamber to test chamber through the architecture of Aperture Science's walls. I appreciated going \"behind the scenes\" in the first game, but in this game it arguably detracts from the experience after a point.\n\nHowever, a Portal game is still a Portal game and the puzzles that you do go through are all pretty great. As a whole, I still think the game shines--there's just tiny specks in between that fall short.\n\nYou'd think I'd end my review here and say that it's worth recommending, but Portal 2 is more than just its singleplayer campaign.\n\nNew to this sequel is a 2-player co-op mode with FOUR portals, 2 between each player. This is where the real value of the game lies, because there are tons of user-made maps that you can play through with your friends.\n\nWith this in mind, I'd DEFINITELY recommend this game--especially to the people who think that the co-op thing is up their alley.","timestamp_created":1427607578,"timestamp_updated":1427607578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15103680","author":{"steamid":"76561198069555865","num_games_owned":449,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1069,"last_played":1530083932},"language":"english","review":"A great sequel to Portal.

Идет на Win 8.1.;\n>>> Проверено! Игрушка отлично локализована;\n>>> Проверено! Игрушка полноценно поддерживает разрешение экрана 1920*1200;\n\nPortal - разработка Valve Corporation. Опытному геймеру нелегко обсуждать продукты этой компании: каждое обсуждение скатывается либо в благоговейное фанбойство, либо в упоротый троллинг. Я же постараюсь избежать крайностей и говорить объективно.\n\nНачнем издалека: какова идеальная цель существования интерактивного развлечения как такового? Мой ответ: цель существования любой достойной игрушки - дать пользователю новый, желательно уникальный опыт. Что думает по этому поводу современная игровая индустрия? ИМХО - они либо считают не так, либо вообще забили на подобные вопросы. Современные игры погрязли в бытовухе по уши. И вот тут пора рассказать о Portal.\n\nСерия Portal в моих глазах является одним из главных оправданий существования игровой индустрии как таковой. Portal - это псевдонаучная фантастика в лучшем своем проявлении. Эта игрушка не просто позволит вам вжиться в чужую роль - она даст вам шанс получить уникальный опыт, который к тому же НЕВОЗМОЖНО получить в реальном мире. Пока 99,9% игрушек предлагают в лучшем случае взять в руки оружие или лопату\\кирку, Portal предлагает вам невероятные, но реалистичные декорации и переписанные, но все такие же реалистичные и привычные законы физики.\n\nЗдесь есть сюжет, есть графон, есть стиль, есть герои и злодеи. Здесь есть уникальный опыт. Здесь есть Portal.\n\nОЦЕНКА: гениально\\10.\nИТОГ: рекомендую включить эту игрушку в курс МХК. И да - я все же не удержался от перехода в одну из крайностей.","timestamp_created":1427545244,"timestamp_updated":1427545774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.632480204105377197","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15090130","author":{"steamid":"76561198123990691","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1966,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":939,"last_played":1609436621},"language":"german","review":"Das ist das beste Spiel, dass ich je gekauft habe! \nDas kann ich jedem weitermepfehlen.\nTolle Rätsel und ein spannender Spielverlauf.","timestamp_created":1427543980,"timestamp_updated":1427543980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15089574","author":{"steamid":"76561198202936900","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":946,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":614,"last_played":1486593446},"language":"english","review":"Ye","timestamp_created":1427541379,"timestamp_updated":1427541379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15089520","author":{"steamid":"76561198173909765","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":556,"last_played":1422636212},"language":"russian","review":"Пошаговая инструкция, как превратить мозги в картофель 9\\10","timestamp_created":1427541077,"timestamp_updated":1427541077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15088182","author":{"steamid":"76561198049065050","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":2528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2302,"last_played":1478175065},"language":"russian","review":"KanobuNetwork / Дата загрузки: 27 апр. 2011 г.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y47XP-vVkOk\nPlayGround.ru / Дата загрузки: 29 апр. 2011 г.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw24ocZzwbY\npileoftutorials / Опубликовано: 29 окт. 2013 г.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M-PKsijtWM","timestamp_created":1427534476,"timestamp_updated":1427534476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467980295419692993","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15087875","author":{"steamid":"76561198092606814","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":451,"last_played":1635879927},"language":"russian","review":"Игра крутейшая!!!
