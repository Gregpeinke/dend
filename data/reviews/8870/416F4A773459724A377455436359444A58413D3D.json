The biggest thing with this game is that the mild horror aspect of the Previous Bioshock games is completely gone. Never in this game did I feel even the mildest but of suspense or tension due to a horror element. This shows how far away the serious has gotten from its System Shock roots. In general the game feels more focused on jaw dropping set pieces and an extremely immersive setting, while also making sure to not make the game iterative to the previous games. In this since the games perfectly accomplishes what it sets out to do. To be honest the game felt like an action movie. The story was more directly told in this game, with lots more direct character interaction and conversation. To this end I feel like this game is much more casual then the first two. This is made even more apparent by how easy the main game is. On hard I beat the game in 9 hours and thats with alot of side exploration. The combat variety is much more limited this time around as well as the game has pretty been haloized. Theres a two gun limit and a recharging shield with no health or salt(plasmid){Mana} pickups that you can store with you. I do think there was great chemisty between the main characters and it was a likable story. Overall all though I feel the gameplay experience is inferior to previous entries. Still a good game though just not for the reasons I was hoping for.\n\nThe DLC on the other hand went back to the bioshock roots while keeping certain improvements from Infinite's formula. I find it to be one of the best pieces of story DLC ever made. The game still does not feel as scary , but the tension from the originals is definently more present. The game is signifigantly harder as well. It also adds to the story in a suprisingly organic way. If you have the game I highly reccomend getting the DLC if you do not have it. The DLC makes the bundle version of the game a must have on sale since this game does get pretty cheap.","timestamp_created":1468619228,"timestamp_updated":1468619228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24341632","author":{"steamid":"76561197981956213","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1327,"last_played":1467787916},"language":"english","review":"Was alot of fun. >(^_^)<","timestamp_created":1468617262,"timestamp_updated":1468617262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24340110","author":{"steamid":"76561197982768621","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":713,"last_played":1468713667},"language":"danish","review":"asdf","timestamp_created":1468611672,"timestamp_updated":1468611672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24339368","author":{"steamid":"76561198124479198","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2660,"last_played":1422630444},"language":"russian","review":"Что бы мне хотелось написать о данной замечатьльной игре?\nВсего ничего, скажу честно я вам.

Тем самым показав нам , что ГГ как-бы явился основным катализатором этого процесса , как если бы невообразимо огромный , герметичный , паровой котёл уже на пределе своём вовсю кипел ; а герою осталось только либо аккуратно отстегнуть или просто сломать одну из многочисленных , хлипких защёлок закупоривающих крышку , что-бы пар и кипяток под избыточным давлением устремился наружу , поглощая и уничтожая всё на своём пути .

Многие   представленные вашему взору \" революционные сцены \" игрового сюжета знакомы и потому легко узнаваемы .\nОдновременно очень коротко показан возможный альтернативный вариант развития событий периода \" [b]Великой Депрессии[/b] \" , где побеждает движение похожее на социалистическое . Здесь же корень основной проблематики берёт своё начало из глубочайшего , сугубо внутреннего , межэтнического и расового , социального кризиса усугублённого общим экономическим положением .\n\n_ Ну посоны , по шкале \" [b]детективных историй[/b] \" за одну из концовок 5+ или A+ :\n \n[i]Самопожертвование ради спасения целого мира ,\nвот это правда настоящая , геройская сила .[/i]\n\n[h1]Минус[/h1]\n\n_  Углубляясь дальше в [b]сюжет игры[/b] я вдруг поймал себя на мысли - что те из разработчиков которые отвечали за сценарную часть видимо так-же как и я в молодости очень сильно фанатели от научно-фантастического сериала \" [b]Sliders( 1995 - )[/b] \" .

Вместо этого Дополнения выполняют своё прямое предназначение : они Дополняют уже и без того хорошие сюжеты , углубляя или ярче раскрывая характеры казалось бы знакомых персонажей . Нам становятся более понятны их мотивации и проистекающие поступки , а значит и отношение к ним становится более правильным и объективным , а наша ответная реакция более \" адекватной \" для сложившейся при данных обстоятельствах ситуации .\n\n_ И это тот редкий случай , когда детективный сюжет Дополнений действительно затягивает , вызывая стойкий интерес и тебе действительно хочется продолжать играть в купе конечно с относительно разнообразной вариативностью геймплея .\n\n[h1]Вывод[/h1]\n\n_ Яркий пример для заурядной пuдараснu из мировой-игровой индустрии , как науку Философию можно изящно подать в купе с продаваемым и вполне понятным для широкой аудитории игровым продуктом , сильно при этом не опираясь на RPG составляющую .\n\n_ А если в целом резюмировать по обеим частям разобрав одну из [b]самых основных философских мыслей[/b] , то Авторы конечно успешно и очень яркими аргументами доказали нам , что : \" [i]Человеческие пороки уничтожат любую , пусть даже самую светлую на первый взгляд и совершенную на первых порах , мечту[/i] \"(c) .\n\n_ Да и социальная \" [b]Паразитическая Теория[/b] \" не выдержала окончательной критики , в этом очень наглядном , теоретически-цифровом , лабораторном эксперименте .

Keep this in mind, I played the previous two games, and they wowed me completely, with their beautiful, shining atmosphere, and the freedom to roam around collecting audio diaries.  The best part about those games is that nothing felt like a chore, no matter how many times I died, and the unpredictability of Big Daddies popping up was a great feat too.  That being said, as soon as I started playing Bioshock Infinite, finally, I instantly fell in love with it.  What I mostly loved about it was that everything was different and yet it still felt like a Bioshock game, since it had all the essential features but they're upgraded, and like the other two games, nothing felt like a chore here as well. \n\nWhat I also liked about this game is that I actually get to interact with people, rather than listening to them through a radio.  Because of the interaction, I was more invested in what was going on, especially with Elizabeth, who is THE best character in the entire game.  In fact, I would be glad to say that she's my FAVORITE video game character thus far due to her gaming mechanics and her overall personality and powers.  While this is a VERY well-done and excellently executed upgrade, THE BEST PART IS THE STORY!!!!!  I just finished the game, and there are excellent twists I never saw coming.  In fact, I bet a MILLION of M. Night Shamalyans across MILLIONS and MILLIONS of worlds would all say, \"What a Twist.\"  \n\nWhile there may be some aspects of the story that are confusing, everything that is important is answered, and the FINAL ending is up for interpretation. \n\nIf there are people who tell you NOT to buy this game, it is their opinion and accept it for what it is.  That being said, I HIGHLY recommend that you ignore them and buy this game.  Actually, buy all the games.  Do whatever you can to get these games.  Get the remastered collection or the trilogy bundle on Steam.  No matter what you do, you will start in a bottomless wonderland, but ascend to a topless marvel in the end.  \n\nBravo 2K and Irrational

Infinite is set in Columbia; a wonderful and beautiful city in the sky. First looking at the city it seems like a utopia. Everything makes it seem that way. From the colors, to the cheerful feelings you get walking around the city; it seems like nothing could go wrong. But that is far from the truth. There are major social issues that were present during the uprising of America and may still be present in society today. You play as Booker DeWitt. He is a hired gun with a debt to pay. Your mission is to save a girl from the leaders of Columbia and bring her to a mysterious group. It seems like a pretty simple job. But it's more complicated; bonds are formed that cannot be broken. This ultimately uncovers the complicated truth.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is engaging with a very arcadey feel to it. There are different enemy types that appear in different parts of the game. The guns are very well done. For example, you can use a sniper rifle one moment and then pick up another gun more suited for the new job and not worry about losing the powerful sniper rifle. Guns are common and the level design forces you to play each situation differently. Also, the guns don't feel too abundant. There are plenty of collectables found throughout the game that can give some extra bonuses that suit different play styles. The vigors are very varied and it forced me to play adaptively. As for the controls, they are incredibly smooth and crisp. Your character does whatever you tell it to do. Everything about the gameplay was very enjoyable.\n\nGraphics: Developed on the Unreal Engine 3, this game looks incredible. For a game developed in 2013, it still holds up as a very beautiful game. The architecture is some of the best I've seen in a video game. This is a game where the graphics will hold up for quite some time.\n\nStory: Incredible story. I don't want to give too much away so all I'm going to say is: it's the kind of game where at the end, you just sit there and take a while to take it all in. Although it may be a little confusing, there are some articles online that explain exactly what goes on towards the end. It was a masterpiece. This should be the new standard for games; this is art.\n\nCharacters: Some of the best characters I've seen in a video game in such a long time. They were so relatable and lovable. Elizabeth was an amazing character that I actually developed care for. At one point in the story I wanted to cry because of it. It was so sad to see characters develop and be influenced by what was going on. By the end though, you realize that what they went through was what shaped them into the characters at the end.\n\nConclusion: This game was a masterpiece and probably one of my favorite games of all time. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a game with a breathtaking story. This is definetly not a game that will be forgotten. A gem in the narrative game genre.","timestamp_created":1468374224,"timestamp_updated":1468374224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24286760","author":{"steamid":"76561198100724592","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":2904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":803,"last_played":1589964589},"language":"spanish","review":"muy bueno con una final muy triste muy beno","timestamp_created":1468374027,"timestamp_updated":1468374027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24286275","author":{"steamid":"76561198081593169","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":916,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":916,"last_played":1444512511},"language":"spanish","review":"ด้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้ด้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้\nด้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้\n    ด้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้\n            ด้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้\n ด้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้  ด้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้       ด้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้\n      ด้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้ด้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้\n                 ด้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้้้้็็็็็้้้้้็็็็็้้","timestamp_created":1468371663,"timestamp_updated":1468371663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497313916683197021","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24285611","author":{"steamid":"76561198027279342","num_games_owned":420,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1406,"last_played":1596695475},"language":"english","review":"terrific FPS, compelling story","timestamp_created":1468368735,"timestamp_updated":1468368794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24284857","author":{"steamid":"76561198078302171","num_games_owned":383,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1161,"last_played":1468359353},"language":"brazilian","review":"QUE MARAVILHA DE JOGO!

Unterforderung war das vorherrschende Gefühl, wenn man mit dem Karabiner einen Headshot nach dem anderen verteilt und dabei sich das Geld langsam anhäuft, da die wenigsten Plasmidverbesserungen zwingend notwendig sind und ich allein mit Shock Jockey, teils mit Bockender Bronco und vielleicht zwei weiteren, seltener verwendeten Plasmiden das Spiel durchspielte (was in den Vorgängern auch nicht besser war, zugegeben). Optionale Aufgaben bestehen stärker als in den Vorgängern (so kam es mir vor) aus backtracking durch zwar wunderbar auschauende, aber leere Areale. Ich wandere lieber durch düstere, verfallene und verwinkelte Apartments als riesige Flächen vorgesetzt zu bekommen auf denen gekämpft wird. Waffen wie der Revolver sind mächtig  uund fühlen sich auch so an, während die Shotgun mir zu schwach vorkam, und sich die Waffen der beiden Fraktionen teils nur geringfügig unterschieden.
