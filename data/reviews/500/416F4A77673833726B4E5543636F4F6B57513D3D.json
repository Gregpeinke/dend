In fact most people who object to Louis having a gun only do so because he’s black THAT’S RACIST, and racism isn’t cool kids remember that.\n\nAnd last but not least is Francis, he may look shady but how can you judge a man by his appearance, besides it would just be a violation of his privacy to pry into his private live for the purpose of performing a “ridiculous” background check (even if he does look like a criminal).\n\nSo what does this game teach us kids………..it teaches us that guns can kill zombies by the truckload so we all need to do our part by making sure everyone can defend themselves from a threat that technically doesn’t existent yet. So when your parents ask you what you want for your birthday you know what to say.\n\n\n\nYours truly \nNational Rifle Association\n","timestamp_created":1466789308,"timestamp_updated":1466789308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23762949","author":{"steamid":"76561198124928553","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":68,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":68,"last_played":1448895110},"language":"russian","review":"....","timestamp_created":1466788955,"timestamp_updated":1466788955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23761839","author":{"steamid":"76561198271306111","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":279,"last_played":1467460711},"language":"russian","review":"Очень понраавилась игра,купил и думал что ето фигня,а как запустил так понравилась!Во1:в игре дофигаа карт и режимов в которые можно играть  на серверах,с друзьями или же в одиночку.Во2:игра построена на движке суср,поетому физика в Л4Д почти как в КС.Очень понравилась,берите пока незакончилась распродажа!!!","timestamp_created":1466786782,"timestamp_updated":1466786782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23761615","author":{"steamid":"76561198123193581","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1487678391},"language":"english","review":"'stop shooting me!'\n\n11/10 would shoot my NPC-teammate again","timestamp_created":1466786358,"timestamp_updated":1466786358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489856511354446411","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23758797","author":{"steamid":"76561198129188230","num_games_owned":1445,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":426,"last_played":1600275199},"language":"english","review":"Zoey?

It basically plays like Half-Life 2 and looks like an upgraded version of Counter-Strike: Source. Not sure why the system requirements are much higher than Half-Life 2: Episode Two as the real differences are film grain and slightly more detail in the environment...plus shadows that actually change based on the light source. This game doesn't have quick save so you have to be on your guard the whole time. It can get frustrating near the last level of each campaign where you have to fight off waves of zombie hoards and tank monsters. There are some cheap moments where a tank monster will instantly punish you with zero health then having to restart the level (remember there are no checkpoints) so this game is not without its flaws. There are also a few raging moments where there would coincidently be a witch, hunter and smoker for example and then you get gang raped from all directions. The difficultly can be a sudden spike up in some cases if you are new to this game on even normal difficulty. There is also a very limited arsenal of weapons like the sniper rifle, m16a2, colt 45, Uzi, pump action shotgun, and auto shotty, pipe bomb and molotov cocktail. If you can tolerate some of these flaws, then this game is worth checking out.","timestamp_created":1466266544,"timestamp_updated":1466266565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23630622","author":{"steamid":"76561198256975376","num_games_owned":393,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1877,"last_played":1542570243},"language":"brazilian","review":"Excelente jogo, boa jogabilidade, leve para PCs fracos, jogabilidade ótima e viciante !","timestamp_created":1466249351,"timestamp_updated":1466249351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23621403","author":{"steamid":"76561198287208391","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":16559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1358,"last_played":1540247124},"language":"spanish","review":"en verdad el juego es el mejor que he jugado buenas graficas y jugabilidad y su coperativo es muy genial soy fanatico de este juego ase 7 años que lo juego la verdad es muy recomndado","timestamp_created":1466199775,"timestamp_updated":1466199775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23619787","author":{"steamid":"76561198261062636","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1449964801},"language":"english","review":"WOULD THIS GAME WORK ON WINDOWS 10?","timestamp_created":1466193099,"timestamp_updated":1466193099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509948134422302246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23614644","author":{"steamid":"76561198047355590","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":2994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2844,"last_played":1641190682},"language":"english","review":"Proof that old games are fun.","timestamp_created":1466173483,"timestamp_updated":1466173483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23610503","author":{"steamid":"76561198112359087","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":150,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1469656286},"language":"english","review":"Going into this game, I expected an average zombie shooter game. This game came out around the time that zombies were really popular I think? I don't know, I heard alot of kids talking about zombies when this game came out and I still hear talk about mostly L4D2 to this very day.\n\nI love this game. As of this review, I may not have a whole lot of time in this game but from my inital completion of the first single-player campaign \"No Mercy\", I can tell this is a much more different game than I originally thought due to the cooperative gameplay elements that make this game standout from all other zombie survival games I have seen.\n\nThis game is really fucking fun, you just straight up murder zombies and it really feels satisfying seeing as how when you kill these zombies, you are in turn helping your teammates avoid a brutal death to a hoarde. Helping these guys out in need kind of makes you feel a little better as a player. This game has more to keep you on your toes than you'd think, you have to watch over your teammates, the guys that are the difference between winning and losing, survival or death because playing this game solo is really no fun at all. It gives this game a unique challenge factor to it that I can't believe wasn't thought of before. It makes the game different, but alot more fun.\n\nRock on Valve, I almost feel like they can tackle anything and come out with an impressive piece of work. I cannot wait to play L4D2 and try out this game's multiplayer.\n\nI assume however the multiplayer would make this game alot more interesting, seeing as how there are humans playing and not robots. I am looking forward to my first round in multiplayer.\n\nBut thats just my silly little review, if you actually read it, what were you doing in that time? You could've spent that time actually buying this game and playing it. Infact, do that now because I have nothing left to say at the moment.
