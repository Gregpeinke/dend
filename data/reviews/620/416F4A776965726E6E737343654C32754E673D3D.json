Of course, that means that its gonna look either really cheesy or cool, probably both...\n\nI first got Portal 2 on the Xbox 360, and probably got a good 50 hours or so out of it, finishing the single player and multiplayer campaigns. Then, I saw it on computer, and saw that it had a level editor, so I bought it on sale, and essentially payed 5$ for the editor. And now I have over 200 hours on it. That alone speaks for how much I love this game. \n\nGameplay: The gameplay is incredibly unique, and very fun. Everything you do in this game revolves around portals. The game's tutorial doesn't feel like one at all, and teaches you the beginings of \"Thinking with Portals\". The tutorial is in 3 parts over the games first chapter, but its more like an exploration of the concept than a tutorial. First, you use buttons to activate preset portals, then you get a gun that can shoot one portals, then you get the true Portal Gun. The introduction is simple enough for beginners to understand, but engaging enough that series veterans won't be bored out of their minds.  As you progress through the game, you will start to solve tests with test \"elements\". These elements are things like lasers and cubes, which all interact with portals, and each other in unique ways. Each test chamber uses an element in a new way, to keep them from being stale. You travel through multiple parts of Aperture, all unique in their own way. You explore much more than just Aperture and it's factory, unlike the original.  However, the campaign is very short (5-7) hours, and once you beat it, there is really no reason to replay it. The multiplayer is also fun, if you can find a friend to play it with. Playing with random people can be very unpredictable, but if you can find a friend, you'll have a good time. It adds more hours to the game, which is very welcome. The good news is once you beat the game, there are an infinite number of Community puzzles to try out.\n\nStory: This game has a way deeper story than the original. It surpases it in practically all ways. The plot is longer, has more twists, and is more exciting. The characters are more engaging and humorous. Although there are only three of them, they are all memorable and unique. GLaDOS ends up taking a back seat to the two new characters however, in humor and in design. The characters and dialogue are one of the most memorable things about this game.\n\nLevel Editor: The in-game level editor (PTI Editor) will be where most of the community makes their puzzles. This editor will be where all beginner mappers will make their first puzzles. This editor is very easy to use, but is also quite simple. You can design simple chambers with basic elements, but to do anything unique and visually impressive, you need to use Hammer. Hammer is the powerful map-making tool that all of the best mappers use. It is also very confusing to any begginers. It will probably take a while to figure out how to make simple room, and it is way more complicated to make lights or doors or cube droppers. I speak from experience, as a wanna-be-mapper who was tired of the lack of content in PTI. If you can master Hammer, you will be able to easily become a fan-favorite mapper. When it comes to other people's maps though, you will be hard pressed to find quality ones. There is a good amount in top-rated of all time, but once you have done a lot of those, you will find that 95% of the maps are incredibly easy, PTI maps, or just plain impossible.\n\n                  Pro/Con Summary (For those who don't want to read):\n\nPros:\nHilarious dialogue\nFun multiplayer\nOne of a kind experience\nInfinite amount of community chambers to play\nIncludes Hammer editor, in which you can make incredibly detailed and amazing puzzles\nGreat progression of test elements, never gets stale\nDifficulty curve is not too steep or slow\nGood visual diversity considering the setting\n\nCons:\nNot much replay value\nA very short experience\nIt can be hard to find quality community puzzles\nThe PTI editor is simple, but lacking in content, while hammer allows you to make anything, while being complex. espeically for beginners","timestamp_created":1422754359,"timestamp_updated":1422754384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14270356","author":{"steamid":"76561198074486659","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2344,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1176,"last_played":1494124571},"language":"english","review":"Resistance is futile.","timestamp_created":1422751539,"timestamp_updated":1422751539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14270256","author":{"steamid":"76561198116137938","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1648027547},"language":"english","review":"11/10 \nWould Make Infinite Portal Loop Again","timestamp_created":1422750981,"timestamp_updated":1422750981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14268819","author":{"steamid":"76561198160162343","num_games_owned":351,"num_reviews":92,"playtime_forever":1067,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":694,"last_played":1528560974},"language":"turkish","review":"Portal 1 den daha iyi Co-op ta eklenmiş alınır.","timestamp_created":1422744927,"timestamp_updated":1617450211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14268817","author":{"steamid":"76561198169210442","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":748,"last_played":1534859151},"language":"portuguese","review":"Vamos Começar ?\n\nòtimo jogo,ótima historia , jogabilidade boa , personagens super divertidos , multiplayer prefeito , resumindo COMPRE ESTE JOGO !!

Portal 2, on the other hand, is the exact opposite: Not much more is added that hasn't been seen in games before, but you're playing for the plot this time, which despite being quite basic manages to be gripping. The dialogue is flawless, with the voice actors perfectly cast, and the humour is spot on, with the dark humour of the original provided in spades.\n\nThat being said, some of the challenge of the original game is sadly missing, with much of the [spoiler]Old Aperture[/spoiler] tests being bland, with a large number simply being a case of finding the patch of slightly less grey wall and then deciding whether you need to spray gel on it or stand on it. The novelty of these gels wears off rather quickly, trampolines and patches which make you run faster didn't exactly make their debut here, and so you spend much of the [spoiler]Old Aperture[/spoiler] section waiting for it to end.\n\nHowever, it's well worth it when it does. [spoiler]Wheatley's[/spoiler] chambers are possibly the best in the game, and the boss fight is a massive improvement on the slightly repetitive GlaDOS fight of the original, with not one element of it unmemorable. Well worth replaying as well, there's actually more dialogue for that scene than there is [i]time[/i], so it's worth earning a few game overs.\n\nLong story short, great game and an improvement over the original, however not worth playing if you plan to play with sound off or didn't like the original.","timestamp_created":1422743691,"timestamp_updated":1422743691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14267943","author":{"steamid":"76561198133760952","num_games_owned":703,"num_reviews":157,"playtime_forever":875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":875,"last_played":1420641701},"language":"schinese","review":"在下怀着“这是神作”的心情打开了这个游戏。\n但是当我在传送带上救下说着\"I'm different.\"的炮塔，却发现没法把它带进下一个场景的时候，当我听着Cave对于\"Science\"的夸夸其谈的时候，当我朝着月球打开那个传送门的时候，我明白我还是低估了它。\n我得说Portal2超越了神作。\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2015年2月6日更新\nportal的世界观我觉得是我接触过的软科幻里做的最好的了，没什么庞大的星系也不是凭空跳出来的外星科技或者上古神器之类（就是说没有强行高科技的感觉。我一直觉得一个好的游戏要有一个好的系统和立场，或者说立意，portal的系统已经足够成为经典了，但是portal2的立意完全超乎我的想象，上一作和这作的前半段给我的感觉可能还只是对未来的畅想这种等级，但是后半真的是让我整个人都震撼了，整个游戏里包含的对人性，科学，社会的思考完全不亚于任何一个文学作品，所以我才一直都觉得好游戏就是一个艺术品，国内很多游戏有不错的系统但是艺术性确实不够。\n我在垃圾传送带上把那个炮塔拿起来听到它说谢谢的时候我差点就没控制住哭出来，在那一瞬间我有种“那就是我”的感觉，虽然是很奇怪的共鸣但是我实在没法认为这只是个游戏而已","timestamp_created":1422741381,"timestamp_updated":1426163934,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14267421","author":{"steamid":"76561198079344835","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1380,"last_played":1422120996},"language":"russian","review":"SPACE!","timestamp_created":1422739486,"timestamp_updated":1422739486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14266599","author":{"steamid":"76561198076433531","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":764,"last_played":1591496317},"language":"brazilian","review":"TOP","timestamp_created":1422736734,"timestamp_updated":1422736734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14266550","author":{"steamid":"76561198052985190","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1619335474},"language":"russian","review":"Прошел сингл второй раз.

Очень редко от вышеназванных разработчиков можно встретить подобного жанра игру. Вы же понимаете, что я имею ввиду, что классика Valve, такая как Left 4 Dead, Counter-Strike, Half-Life вплотную приближена к оружию, убийству и монстрам. Но не Portal. За всю игру, теоретически, от ваших рук не погибнет ни одно живое существо. Даже не разу не промелькнет и капелька крови (если не учитывать вылетающие из вас брызги при попадании из турели). Правда необычно?\nПусть в нашем арсенале лишь одно оружие (и то оно делает дырки в пространстве, а не во врагах), но это не мешает в полной мере наслаждаться красивым и захватывающим геймплеем. Ведь все дело в том, что игра опирается не на бессмысленную резню \"один против тысячи\", а на то, насколько хорошо работает ваша логика. \nА так же отдельная похвала за возможность прохождения совместных миссий с другом. Сложные задачи удобнее решать с напарником, но возникает дух конкуренции...\nВ целом остается сказать, что игра не заслуживает никакой другой оценки, кроме как 10 из 10.
