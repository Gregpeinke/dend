If you played the original Portal and liked it, read no further -- buy this game! If you are not familiar with Portal or Half-Life, sit down and grab some lemons. \n\nPortal 2 is actually a fine place to begin the games, because it is essentially where most of the series's plot is contained. You play as Chell, a young woman who wakes up from extended cryo sleep to a clumsy, scatterbrained and hilarious A.I. who wants to escape the Aperture Science facility where the game takes place. In doing so, you disturb a murderous A.I. known as G.L.a.D.O.S., who spent the first game testing you, and subsequently, trying to kill you. Because you killed her in the last game, she decides that she will spend the rest of your life testing you, for science and for revenge. \n\nNow, testing is what the gameplay is all about. Each test is a room in which you must use physics to solve a puzzle, thus allowing you to leave the room. You are equipped with the Portal gun, which allows you to open two portals at a time, thus giving you the means to solve these tests and spend several hours creating paradoxes to amuse yourself with.\n\nHonestly, I'd be surprised if you're still reading.

Это самая проработанная,интеллектуальная игра про науку! \n         \nЗабавно, но те люди которые читали положительные отзывы, горели желанием \"затролить\" фанатов своим негативным обзором. Ну, скажем так, он не сможет затролить игру. Потому-что он тупо не найдет минусов. Разве, что скажет: \"сюжет слабоват и/или \"где мой HL3?\". Сюжет? По сути, в такой игре его не должно быть, но он есть и в самый раз. Именно {в самый раз}, сюжет на подобии \"у машины есть разум человека, жизнь которого отдали науке и теперь она мстит им\" - вполне. \n   Кооператив - самый, что есть кооператив. Если в Left 4 Dead 2, в убегу может дойти только один, а в кс затащить тоже только один. То тут, такой х*рни не будет. Если вы идете в кооператив, то там действительно нужна помощь напарника и ни шагу без него! По мимо сюжетных-кооперативных карт, дается возможность обычным игрокам создавать свои камеры. Редактор - хороший. Правда, иногда не хватает меню, где можно выбрать, что тебе скажет Гладос если ты сделаешь так.\n       \nБудет ли продолжение? Не знаю, скорее - нет. Почему? В игру нечего добавлять, потому-что она... 10/10.","timestamp_created":1482088391,"timestamp_updated":1507363032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.681917905807495117","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28453275","author":{"steamid":"76561198118392184","num_games_owned":3137,"num_reviews":326,"playtime_forever":3111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2862,"last_played":1489277810},"language":"french","review":"[i]...is a liiiiiiiiiiie.[/i]\n\n[b]Portal 2[/b], sorti en 2011, est un FPS de type puzzle (énigme) jouable en solo et en coopération, développé par notre bien aimé Valve. On y incarne un sujet de test bien famillier, qui tente de s'échapper à nouveau du centre de test d'Aperture Science.\n\n[h1]Les plus :[/h1]\n\n- Plusieurs ajouts au niveau du gameplay de Portal 2. Notamment le gel répulsif (le bleu, qui fait rebondir tout ce qui le touche), le gel propulsif (le orange, qui permet faire accélerer la personne ou l'objet qui bouge dessus) ainsi que le gel conversif (le blanc, qui permet, quand il est posé sur une surface quelconque, de créer des portails dessus), offrant ainsi un petit vent de fraicheur dans le gameplay de Portal 2.\n- L'histoire est toujours aussi fun, avec des dialogues encore plus absurdes, notamment grâce à Weatley, un nouveau compagnon... original.\n- Il y a de la coopération avec une campagne inédite, où l'on incarne deux robots de test, Atlas and P-Body.\n- Une meilleur durée de vie que l'opus précédent, environ 7-10h pour finir l'histoire principale, et environ la même chose pour le mode coopération. Bien entendu, cela dépend de votre rapidité à résoudre les salles de test.\n- Graphiquement toujours aussi joli. Surtout avec la végétation.\n- Une très bonne communauté, qui a pondu un nombre incalculable de mod, pour le solo comme pour le coop, avec des cartes supplémentaires, afin d'augmenter la durée de vie.\n\n[h1]Les moins :[/h1]\n\n- Si on doit vraiment beaucoup chipoter, peut-être une durée de vie de l'histoire principale un peu plus importante aurait été bienvenue.\n\n[h1]N.B. :[/h1]\n\n- Evaluation de [i]Portal[/i] --> [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kazadrur/recommended/400/]Voir ici[/url]\n- Evaluation du mod [i]Thinking with Time Machine[/i] --> [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kazadrur/recommended/286080/]Voir ici[/url]\n- Evaluation du mod [i]Portal Stories : Mel[/i] --> [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kazadrur/recommended/317400/]Voir ici[/url]\n\n[h1]Conclusion :[/h1]\n\nJe n'ai pas grand chose à  dire de plus pour ce jeu. Il est dans la lignée de son ancêtre, rajoutant du contenu, en sachant être original pour ne pas sentir le réchauffé ou le copié/collé. Bref, Portal 2 fait partie des jeux qui marquent une génération de joueur. Jouez-y, vraiment.\n\n_ _ _ _\n\n[h1]Si vous avez trouvé cette évaluation utile, et que vous voulez en discuter autour d'un verre, venez rejoindre notre [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AlternaTyff#curation]page de curation et nos forums ![/url][/h1]","timestamp_created":1482087114,"timestamp_updated":1484419526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.740525782108306885","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28453117","author":{"steamid":"76561198281756868","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":178,"last_played":1482854358},"language":"schinese","review":"不错的游戏。","timestamp_created":1482086597,"timestamp_updated":1482086597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28450657","author":{"steamid":"76561198107059929","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":831,"last_played":1471567615},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo espetacular, um dos melhores que eu joguei.","timestamp_created":1482078574,"timestamp_updated":1482078574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28450514","author":{"steamid":"76561198066279813","num_games_owned":357,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1208,"last_played":1651779954},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 is a game.\n\nThat's all I have to say.","timestamp_created":1482078179,"timestamp_updated":1482078179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28450241","author":{"steamid":"76561198277050214","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3930,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2699,"last_played":1618452362},"language":"english","review":"just.....................\n\n\n\n\n\nwow","timestamp_created":1482077410,"timestamp_updated":1482077410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50205761194229126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28450051","author":{"steamid":"76561198342461761","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":3144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1403,"last_played":1570754284},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bom!
