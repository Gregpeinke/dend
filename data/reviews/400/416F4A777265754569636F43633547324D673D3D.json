Es wurde am 18. Oktober 2007 in der Orange Box sowie als Einzeltitel bereits am 10. Oktober 2007 über die Spieleplattform Steam veröffentlicht. Ziel des Spieles ist es, mit dem Portalgerät, mit dem man Teleportationsportale erstellen kann, verschiedene Aufgaben zu meistern und Hindernisse zu überwinden. Die Handlung ist im Half-Life-Universum angesiedelt.\n\nDer Spieler hat die Möglichkeit, sich selbst oder Gegenstände zu teleportieren, um damit bestimmte Aufgaben zu lösen. Zu Beginn des Spiels erlangt der Spieler nach und nach Kontrolle über das Mobile Portalgerät von Aperture Science, mit dem blaue oder orangefarbene Teleportationsportale per Schuss auf einer geeigneten Oberfläche erstellt werden können. Zu jedem Zeitpunkt kann nur höchstens ein Portal jeder Farbe existieren, ein neues ersetzt das alte. Materie – auch lebende, wie zum Beispiel der Spieler – und Licht kommen nach dem Eintritt in ein Portal ohne Zeitverzögerung aus dem anderen wieder heraus, Geschwindigkeit und Ausrichtung (bzw. Impuls und Drehimpuls) bleiben dabei unter Berücksichtigung des „Portal-Effekts“ erhalten. Zeigen beispielsweise die Portale in unterschiedliche Himmelsrichtungen, läuft man trotzdem aus dem Zielportal „geradeaus“ heraus, wenn man ins Ursprungsportal „geradeaus“ hineingelaufen ist. Die Geschwindigkeit hineingeworfener Gegenstände bleibt auch erhalten oder wie im Spiel beschrieben wird:\n\n    “Speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.”\n\n    „Was schnell hineingeht, kommt auch schnell wieder heraus.“\n\nDie Farbe dient nur der Unterscheidbarkeit, beide Portale können in beide Richtungen genutzt werden. Auch ein Verweilen „innerhalb“ der Portale ist möglich. Existieren beide Portale, sind nur deren Ränder farbig und man kann, wie durch ein Fenster, durch sie hindurch aus dem jeweils anderen Portal herausblicken.\n\nDurch diese Eigenschaften hat der Spieler viele Möglichkeiten, Hindernisse wie säuregefüllte Schluchten, Metall- oder Glaswände zu umgehen. Eine fortgeschrittene Technik besteht darin, in Decke und Boden übereinander liegende Portale zu erstellen, durch die man im freien Fall eine hohe Geschwindigkeit aufbauen kann, um dann das Deckenportal umzusetzen und dank der eigenen Trägheit sehr weit oder hoch geschleudert zu werden.\n\nVom Spieler geht in Portal keine Gewalt gegen Menschen aus, allerdings schwebt die Protagonistin während des Spieles aufgrund des feindseligen Computer-Gegenspielers oft in Lebensgefahr. Das Blut des Hauptcharakters ist dabei in der deutschen Version grau eingefärbt.\n\nWährend des Spiels übernimmt der Spieler die Kontrolle über Chell, eine junge Frau, die als Testsubjekt für die Forschungseinrichtung Aperture Science Enrichment Center der Aperture Laboratories fungiert. Aperture Laboratories ist ein Konkurrenzunternehmen der Black Mesa Research Facility, in der Half-Life spielt.\n\nDurch den dem Spiel beigelieferten Map-Editor (Valve Hammer Editor, kurz VHE), können Spieler eigene Karten/Level (=Maps) erstellen und diese im Internet zum herunterladen anbieten. Schon kurz nach dem Erscheinen von Portal haben sich Fanseiten, die sich diesem Thema widmen, gebildet.\n\nDas Spiel besticht mit seinem trockenen und interessanten Humor.\nAußerdem sind immer wieder überraschende Wendungen eingebaut. Das Spielprinzip ist sehr originell. Nicht so gut finde ich die kurze Spielzeit von ca. drei Stunden.\nIch mag dieses Spiel einfach und möchte euch nur noch sagen: \"The cake is a lie!\"","timestamp_created":1418141998,"timestamp_updated":1418141998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505358576774597168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13293966","author":{"steamid":"76561198139239300","num_games_owned":883,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":422,"last_played":1641246780},"language":"english","review":"An amazing game.

Guided by an omnipresent voice, you make your way through the different chambers of increasingly difficult tests.\n\nAlthough this synopsis may make this game seem somewhat shallow, it most certainly is not. The main character, Chell, although mute, develops a personality regardless. An attachment is created with this voice guiding you. And, most cryptically, is the hidden areas in the chambers. These give background into Aperture Laboratories, the 'voice', and possibly the sole survivor.\n\nWhen compared to Portal 2, Portal does have some significant flaws. This include a lack of characters and personality which, although there, isn't built upon until later in the game. There aren't as many testing mechanics in the original, but this leads to much more creative test designes, requiring ingenuity over resources.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing, and you will fell dissapointed upon its completion. Portal 2 builds upon the first, and is a must after this is completed.","timestamp_created":1417844092,"timestamp_updated":1417844092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13247063","author":{"steamid":"76561198097839210","num_games_owned":357,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":226,"last_played":1489445986},"language":"english","review":"Fun, simple, and challenging game.

What it lacks in content (you could quite easily finish this game, and all the achievements, in two hours), it makes up for in ingenuity. The portal-gun system is a refreshing element which requires you in many cases to subvert typical puzzle-solving instincts and instead \"think with portals\", as the game advises. Once you wrap your head around the mechanics though, the puzzles rarely offer a reasonably-quick-witted individual a sufficient challenge. Occasionally, a curveball will be thrown in, but each test chamber is little more than a moment's contemplation away from ephihany. Regular FPS players will find the quicker-paced sections of portal-shooting fun, but short lived if you're sure with your aim, and frustating if you're not. The game's main strength comes from it's humour, which is plentifully provided for by the game's \"narrator\", GlaDoS, though the story behind it isn't fully realised until Portal 2, which is, overall, a MUCH better game.

It is quite creepy with the messages on the walls and the atmosphere in and out the test chambers .","timestamp_created":1417689475,"timestamp_updated":1417689475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13223860","author":{"steamid":"76561198136007147","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":229,"last_played":1417688693},"language":"russian","review":"класс понравилось !","timestamp_created":1417688814,"timestamp_updated":1417688814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13221047","author":{"steamid":"76561197993051563","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1617650840},"language":"english","review":"Little late to be reviewing this game but c'mon... it's Portal, if you haven't played this game yet... well freaking play it already!","timestamp_created":1417663482,"timestamp_updated":1417663482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13220042","author":{"steamid":"76561198090092702","num_games_owned":414,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1474940312},"language":"spanish","review":"excelente juego, habia oido cosas buenas de el pero jamas lo habia jugado. ahora veo lo que me perdi y estoy descargando el 2","timestamp_created":1417653865,"timestamp_updated":1417653865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13219067","author":{"steamid":"76561198035884946","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":994,"last_played":1408814023},"language":"english","review":"My jaw still hits the floor every time a gamer tells me they haven't played Portal.

I wouldn't recommend buying it alone, as it is fairly short. However, if you can pick it up in the portal pack or the valve pack, then it is an experience worth having. I'm a bit against the norm in that I don't think valve games are perfection, but they tend to do things in such a 'valve-y' way, even I must admit it's endearing, albeit perhaps a bit minimalistic for my taste. If I was nitpicking, I'd point out it's a source game, so it has the same look (and sound effects) as almost EVERY source game, but the idea was just so original, and the gameplay so well crafted, that I can look past all the nitpicking and wholeheartedly say Portal is one of the best games you can beat in a single sitting.","timestamp_created":1417645669,"timestamp_updated":1417645669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13218271","author":{"steamid":"76561198138505067","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":147,"last_played":1453325375},"language":"english","review":"I cant play this game :P it keeps crashing and crashing !!!
