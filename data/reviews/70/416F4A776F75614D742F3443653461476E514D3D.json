Half-Life offers us a title that mixes different genres, and at the same time deepens them. Regardless of its release date, it would be considered a somewhat outdated FPS, but it is not further from the truth, since at the time it was released, FPS without relevant history, and with a single plot kill everything whatever moves, they were the kings of the market, something that came to change Half-Life forever...\n\n[list]\n\n[*]To begin with, the narration of this game is something completely different from what is usually seen in the game both then and now, and that is that there are no cinematics, absolutely everything that happens, happens in the game, something quite striking taking Keep in mind that it allows greater interaction by the player. Another aspect that complements this is a detail that can catch you off guard, but also very important, and that is that to continue in most sections of the game, it depends on the NPCs, since the game makes you talk to them to receive information, rescue them to receive some benefits and you can even collaborate with them to fight (it is not highly recommended in open field combat, but it can save your life). These 2 details make you feel that the game is much more dynamic, direct and alive than any game of its time could be.\n\n[*]Something that goes very well hand in hand with the previous point is the setting of the title. Despite the years, the setting of Half-Life still feels intensely immersive to this day, to the point of causing from time to time a change of atmosphere from a normal FPS, to a Horror Survival game which can put you off. goosebumps with some ease, which is admirable considering how old it is.\n\n[*]To complement what has already been said before, the design, both artistically and strategically, of the levels and maps is also very well achieved, which from my point of view helps the player understand what is happening at all times. there will be certain occasions when you might get lost for a while due to the absence of a guide or similar, but it is totally overshadowed by how well managed and structured they are, so once you know what to do, the the fun begins.\n\n[*]The artificial intelligence in this title has its flaws, because under certain circumstances they can fall into action loops, or directly do nothing, but in addition to being something (very) rare to see, both enemy and ally artificial intelligence is smart enough to give you a few surprises, such as reacting with scares to your grenades, certain enemies group up after locating you, and even some after seeing you, they are located in such a way that they wait for you to arrive to hit you. in an ambush. An absolute marvel for its time which left me completely amazed.\n\n[*]The soundtrack is not something that is usually mentioned when criticizing Half-Life because it is not a main factor in it, but I think this same factor should be given more relevance taking into account that It really makes you get into the gameplay environment very well, most of the Soundtrack themes (which is free and available here on Steam) are environmental themes that sound throughout the game, but that does not mean that from time to time when, there will be situations in which you will be at great risk, and in several of these, you will be accompanied by pure and simple frantic action themes to kill everything that moves.\n\n[*]The biggest defects of Half-Life from my point of view are 2, the first being the absence of subtitles, and I know, it is a 1998 game made by a group of 30-40 people, but I think it was possible to add subtitles (even if only in English), I mention this because the voices of the characters can sometimes be very confusing due to the low quality of the audio, and in a game where interaction is SO important, it can become a problem (although It really is nothing serious if you put it in a language which you fully understand)\n\n[*]The other (and last) inconvenience that I have come to notice during Half-Life gameplay is the save mechanics, here I think things will get controversial, and that is that, even playing on the highest difficulty, the fact that the game allows you to save a game wherever and whenever you want, it can seriously facilitate some parts of the campaign. The positive side that slightly counteracts this is that once you load the game, the AI ​​does not restart, but rather it continues the action it was performing at the time, so it is not possible to take advantage of some kind of exploit or similar.\n\nNow, it's time to talk about Half-Life heavyweights, gameplay, and story.\n\n[*]The gameplay is an absolute marvel, as it was mentioned before, it is a mixture between puzzles and combats which are the most classic Shooter (FPS), having an entire arsenal of weapons completely different from each other, each one with its advantage and disadvantage, which you will have to master in order to progress. As a result, the gameplay is extremely varied, going from dozens of minutes figuring out how to solve a puzzle to a frenzied ambush at full speed like there's no tomorrow, only to turn into a very tense and grim scene that feels like something out of it. from a horror movie.\n\n[*]The mechanics could be too many taking into account the weapons, but they are very well managed and distributed, but what makes them shine is when they work together with the design of the maps, because sometimes they get to the point where the one that seems to predict your actions, granting you VERY few resources (at least in hard mode) but always what is necessary, despite what you believe otherwise, sometimes forcing you to use your head once in a while to realize that that huge problem you have can be reduced to just changing your tactics.\n\n[*]The story of Half-Life is very strange to be honest, but it doesn't make it really amazing and intriguing. For obvious reasons I will not specify much about it, but after having completed the campaign, I can say that it is a much deeper, more complex and longer story than practically any other FPS of the time, something which is quite innovative, since as well as keeping you focused on the action and periodically solving some puzzles, you do all of this for, and during, the exposition of a really serious and quality plotted story.\n\n[/list]\n\nAs a conclusion or reflection, Half-Life is a title that, despite the years, remains a true jewel of the industry, which completely innovated and restructured the genre in its time and continues to have a huge presence in it. . Speaking personally, I was expecting something good from the amount of comments that I have received about this title, but it was not until I lived the Half-Life experience in flesh and blood when I saw the true almost surreal masterpiece made by a group less than 50 people.","timestamp_created":1642633107,"timestamp_updated":1653064063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535486161708831787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108354326","author":{"steamid":"76561198849661744","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1642697498},"language":"english","review":"Gets frustrating at times but overall a good game.

Half-Life, the \"pioneer\" for all coming story shooters...\n\nWell, Half-Life is like any other game. Either you like it or you hate it.\n\n[b]One shouldn't forget that the game is from 1998 and is therefore one of the really old games.[/b] \n\nDue to the age, it is of course absolutely not comparable with current games, even if they are retro games. Whether they are created from scratch and with a retro look, or are simply technically polished, a Half-Life will always play differently than \"younger\" games.\n\nI'm a total Half Life fan. It's no secret and I don't make any of it.\nThis is probably due to my age and the fact that I played the game for hours after it was released. I even have the packaging with CD-ROM somewhere (if anyone knows what that is).\n\n[b]What makes Half-Life so great is that without it, many of the games we know and play today wouldn't even exist.. [/b]\n\nThe Half-Life engine was then an \"evolution\" of id Software's great Quake engine and Half-Life is still rated 96 / 100 by Metacritic to this day and even made it into the Guinness book as the best-selling first-person shooter.\nHalf-Life was [b]the first first-person shooter to have a story, scripted cutscenes, and an AI.[/b] \nIf I remember correctly, the Gordon Freeman story was inspired by the Stephen King novel „The Mist“, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nI know some who have tried to play the game and I can understand some saying \"great game, I just can't play it because I don't like the control / gameplay\".\nIf you're not used to it or don't know it, then it's an absolutely strange feeling, I'll admit that. \nI just recently played all the sequels again and it's really a weird feeling at times. You can say that, yes.\n\nHalf-Life and Gordon Freeman, for me, an absolute cult classic that you should definitely have played if you can.\nI can warmly recommend [url= https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890]Black Mesa[/url] to anyone who wants to immerse themselves in the Half-Life universe, but doesn't get along with it in the original way. \nBlack Mesa is really fun, looks better and plays a little differently and is definitely worth checking out.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]MY PROS AND CONS (FROM 1998):[/b]\n\n✅ absolutely gripping story\n✅ Great level design\n✅ breathtaking atmosphere\n✅ Pure excitement\n\n❌ basically too old\n\n[hr][/hr][b] PLAYED WITH: ⌨️ 🖱 🎧 [/b]\n[hr][/hr]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/][b] ⮩ CHECK OUT ALL OF MY REVIEWS [/b][/url]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[url]https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/[/url]","timestamp_created":1642589630,"timestamp_updated":1659001554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":51,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.776747405529022217","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108317630","author":{"steamid":"76561198026870633","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1642602843},"language":"english","review":"This is an absolute masterpiece and was way ahead of its time.

kezdjük: 1998-as játék, és helyén kell kezelni. Én értem hogy Quake 2 engine-re épült, és ezért van benne a csúszkálás, de könyörgöm ha már korcsolyázunk, legalább lehetett volna benne kevesebb platform rész. (Még jó hogy bárhol menthetünk.) Apropó Quake engine technikailag persze elavult, mégis rendkívül kidolgozott, és aprólékos a grafika. A fegyverek megjelenítése, újratöltésük animációja, sokat dob az élményen. Ahogy a pisztolyba tárat cserél, a shotgun-ba a töltényt egyenként rakosgatja, majd felhúzza, Az RPG-be egy újabb rakétát helyez. stb. Ez ma már természetes egy FPS-ben, de akkoriban még nem sűrűn fordult elő. A pályarészek (Mivel egy épület komplexumban vagyunk) egymástól jól elkülöníthetők. Laborok, irodahelyiségek, személyzeti szállások, géptermek, szerverszobák, liftaknák, szellőzők, csatorna rendszer, hulladék feldolgozó, radioaktív anyag tároló, stb. nagyon hosszú ideig lehetne sorolni a helyszíneket, amik ráadásul szorosan kapcsolódnak egymáshoz, és néha még oda-vissza és lehet járkálni köztük. Szóval a kidolgozottságra, és a változatosságra nem lehet panasz. Az ellenfelekről már nem sok újat lehet írni, az alienek többnyire lassúak bár ahogy korábban írták gyakran spawnolnak a hátunk mögé, Akit én a legjobban utáltam az rohadt felugráló kis szardarab, ami visítozó hangon rád veti magát, általában, a sötétből és a szellőzőkből.  Fúj gyűlöltem. Szerintem a katonák a legkülönlegesebb ellenfelek a játékban. Jobbára csapatban mozognak, végtelen gránátjuk van, előszeretettel rakják falra a detonátort meg az automata géppuskát. Szóval ja az AI néha egész jó dolgokat tud produkálni. Máskor meg csak állnak mint fasz, a lakodalomban. Nagyon jópofa volt még hogy miután beüt a krach, a hátramarad biztonsági őrök közül, időnként 2-3-at is magadhoz tudsz szólítani. Bár nagyszerű a hangulat, többnyire csak egy kissé feltuningolt FPS, nem sokkal több annál. Hozzáteszem, amikor először felvettem a íjpuskát, és lehetett vele távcsövezni, meg lopakodni, elégedetten csettintettem. Meg hogy még a játék utolsó harmadában is kapsz új fegyvert, meg később egy itemet. Három kisebb-nagyobb negatívumot tudnék felsorolni: Az egyik FPS mivolta ellenére, azért el lehet akadni benne, s bevallom egyszer-egyszer felütöttem a youtube-ot. A másik a Xen-en még szívesen elugrabugráltam és mászkáltam volna, mert szerintem messze az a játék legjobb helyszíne. Rendes történet mesélés, és Cliffhanger, igazából csak a végén van, ami jól össze van rakva,de egy kicsit kiegyensúlyozottabban is lehetett volna adagolni. Mindent összevetve, néhol komor máskor szatírikus. vérgőzös scifi-horror akcó klasszikus ez, ami ha rászánjuk a megfelelő időt és energiát, talán megkaphatjuk belőle azt a bizonyost pluszt. Én a magam részéről, 100/90%-ot adok rá.","timestamp_created":1642556957,"timestamp_updated":1642556957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108299522","author":{"steamid":"76561199008064404","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":989,"last_played":1642555031},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1642555054,"timestamp_updated":1642555054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108297654","author":{"steamid":"76561198401126561","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":508,"last_played":1659337887},"language":"english","review":"Before Alyx.
