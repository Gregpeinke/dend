If you haven't played either, then you need to start with part one. Otherwise, you aren't going to get much of the story or the humor in two. After I played Portal One, my mouth just hung open as I realized that I had just played one of the greatest video games in history, which was a pretty amazing experience. Seriously, if you haven't given the Portal series a chance, I highly recommend it. I know that not everyone is going to like a particular game or series of games, but I think this series is so good, it would be foolish of someone to not at least try the Portal One demo to see if they might enjoy it.\n\nI think the only reason I didn't have that same reaction to Portal 2, is because I had played part one first, so I knew what to expect, and much of the groundbreaking and perfectly executed aspects of the game just didn't have the same effect on me at that point. Nevertheless, taking a step back from it, and keeping an open mind, I think that Portal 2 is equally as good if not better than part one.\n\nJ.K. Simmons and Stephen Merchant appear in Part Two and as I expected they were both spot on. Just brilliant voice over work that was a nice change from the first Portal. While there is no denvying that Glados was well writen and performed, she did become grating to me about 3/4 of the way through in the first game as I grew weary of her somewhat monotone delivery and at that point, predictability. \n\nThere is a nice mix of puzzles, world exploration, and advancement through the facility. It would have been a huge mistake on the part of the developers to force the player to solve testing chambers for the game's entirety, but thankfully they did not. \n\nThe character arcs are well written and keep you on the edge of your seat as you watch their demeanor and personalities change throught the course of the story. Again, this is accomlished largely in part to the perfect voice over work provided by Stephen Merchant. I can't praise his performance enough. \n\nThe graphics are very pretty and the game is well optimized to run on just about any desktop or laptop. I think you could even run this on the Intel HD series IGPs.\n\nThe puzzles are difficult, but not overly. It's a perfect chalenge level. So, anybody shold be able to complete the game to see the beautiful story in it's entirely. \n\nMULTIPLAYER! Oh man, this was such a good move on Valve's part. Not only does it add a whole bunch of new challaneges and levels, but now you can work together with a friend to complete a whole slew of new specially designed co-op puzzles. Most importantly, playing co-op is a crapload of fun. From the satisfaction of completing a level together, to ragging on your teammate for not being able to complete a task necessary to finish the puzzle. The taunt/praise system is hilarious and my friend and I never grew tired of knocking each other upside the head or high fiving each other at the end of each level. The indcator system used to non-verbally communicate with your partner is brilliant and necessary if you can't use VOIP. The only negative comment I have for the co-op portion is that it was too short and there was not much of a story. Small things IMO.\n\nSo anyway, overall Portal 2 is one of the greatest games in the history of PC gaming and I highly suggest you give the series a try even if my review, trailers, or screen shots make it seem like it might not be your cup of tea, You won't know for sure, unless you dive in. So, what are you waiting for?

Let me say that first and foremost. Yes, if you have the money and are considering getting it, you should.\n\nHowever, if you haven't played Portal 1, play that instead. While Portal 2 has more puzzles and better graphics, I don't think it's a better game. The average puzzle in Portal 1 has 4-8 solutions, and the tutorial puzzles show enough that you learn how to use the mechanics, without making you feel like you're being told how to play. Portal 2 takes the subtle parts that made the first game a masterpiece and sort of hamhandles them. The average puzzle in Portal 2 has 1-3 solutions. The introduction of new mechanics, such as the goop, initially makes for more interesting puzzles, but ultimately creates a need to make the puzzles more restrictive and less intuitive. I didn't finish the game. I am an avid puzzle gamer, but one puzzle near the end of the game required such precision, timing, and execution that I couldn't manage it with the level of awareness I had. \n\nOf course, being a very social gamer, a friend and I flew through the multiplayer maps with no difficulty.

It's a puzzle game and it keeps up a rather smooth story and keeps away from making the puzzle ridiculously hard so to move on with the story.  Commical and thrilling if I were to describe living the moments of Portal 2. Despite not having a partner like in co-op, the characters do a great job in entertaining you and encouraging you through the puzzles. Even the storyline in the single player mode can become a facinating discussion topic with your friends. The rules to the puzzle-solving are really simple.  White space, make a portal, go through it. There are the blue, orange, white paint with automated turrets trying to kill you and everything but they easily become part of the game.\n\nCo-op\nThe mascots of Portal 2 (in my opinion), P-body and Atlus, are both very adorable touch to a rather unique co-op puzzle game.  It's a very different experience from the single player, which avoids making the gameplay feel plainly repetitive.  Lots of fun in 10% of the time trying to actually solve the puzzle while other 90% is dwelling in the temptation of wanting to kill each other.  Getting achievements in this silliness adds more laugh to the short 8 hours journey.  (Maybe more, depends on how good you are at killing your partner.)\n\nPost Game\nThere are other challenges you can do, or other puzzles available in Steam workshop.\nYou won't end up playing as often as you do the first few hours after beating the game.  Is it worth the money?  Yes, and even more worth it when it's on sale.  \nIt seems like you can get active in the Portal community, which should be fairly easy to do, and explore more loads of fun Portal 2 has stored within. Just grab some friends to be part of it with you... \n\nI got other games I want to play at the moment, but I feel that I'd definitely come back for more of this.\nFantastic puzzle game! Enjoyable! Graphically nice looking, and amazing character animation and voice acting!","timestamp_created":1386207240,"timestamp_updated":1386207240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7918758","author":{"steamid":"76561198100538449","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1253,"last_played":1537932341},"language":"english","review":"a great game to play for everyone especially for people who like mind/puzzle games. it has a good plot and background story and has a few jokes in the game.","timestamp_created":1386204054,"timestamp_updated":1386204054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7918009","author":{"steamid":"76561198020933573","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":747,"last_played":1407683262},"language":"english","review":"this game is amazing, very time consuming. i have been playing for on record 12 hours and still havent beatten it yet\ni highly trecomend this game for everyone. i have never like any type of puzzle game, but this one i juts LOVE","timestamp_created":1386199880,"timestamp_updated":1386199880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7917608","author":{"steamid":"76561198115696589","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1397759822},"language":"english","review":"in my opinion one of the greatest puzzle games of all time! a must buy","timestamp_created":1386197697,"timestamp_updated":1386197697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7917334","author":{"steamid":"76561198046584167","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2398,"last_played":1445225352},"language":"english","review":"If you have never played portal, get started!
