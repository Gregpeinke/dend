It took me 10 minutes to finish the entire chapter and it's still incredibly fun. \n\nThe reason this was released was to showcase the incredible range rendering and the new feature which was implemented into future valve games, the commentary mode. \n\nSince you get this for free if you own Half Life 2 I see no reason not to check it out.
