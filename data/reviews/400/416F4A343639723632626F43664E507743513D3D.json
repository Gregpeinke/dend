At it's core it's a puzzle game, not something most people would consider mainstream but through a great sense of innovation as well as some truly inspired writing it somehow manages to pull it off.\n\nThe concept of Portal is simple enough. You progress through a series of rooms. In each room you must get from the entrance to the exit overcoming whatever obstacles and dangers might be in there using nothing but your trusty portal gun. The portal gun, quite simply, \"shoots\" a portal entrance onto a flat surface which allows you to travel through it.\n\nThis fairly simple concept does get quite a bit more tricky as you progress through the game as moving platforms, lasers, turrets and many other troublesome entities try to stop you.\n\nThroughout the game you are accompanied by the sometimes scolding, somethings taunting and sometimes soothing voice of G.L.A.D.O.S. The AI in charge of your training and who might be a little mentally unstable as you'll soon discover. Although G.L.A.D.O.S is the only voice you'll hear in the game she does a fantastic job of keeping your entertained throughout your journey. The humor is some of the best you'll see in a game and the storyline is interesting enough that you'll pay attention to every little tidbit you encounter.\n\nThe only negative to be mentioned is the very short length of the game that leaves you wanting more. Sadly, the only alternative to replaying the game and pretending to be surprised is the challenges which are fairly boring rinse and repeat because of their extremely unforgiving nature.\n\nPortal is a great game and one that any Steam user should have in his library, not just because it's been given away for free to all users not once, but twice. But because it is a truly impressive game experience.","timestamp_created":1352930663,"timestamp_updated":1385410634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57564777135848999","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1680664","author":{"steamid":"76561197996357358","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1120,"last_played":1549198189},"language":"english","review":"Unexpected humour, just the right level of challenging and a simple but effective story line make Portal well worth a play.","timestamp_created":1352926814,"timestamp_updated":1513341677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6302424","author":{"steamid":"76561198063281813","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":102,"last_played":1388903671},"language":"english","review":"Portal 1 is short and sweet.
