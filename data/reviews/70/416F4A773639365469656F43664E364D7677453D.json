Many modern games should take note. \n- Gameplay is fun even after so many years.\n- The pacing is great. The game managed to engage and surprise me with each new level. I was never bored.\n- [spoiler]Loved the final boss fight and the finale. It had an almost psychedelic/dream-like feeling to it.[/spoiler]\n- Despite being dated in visuals and audio the game is still able to create very atmospheric and suspenseful moments, because the excellent art direction itself compensates for the aged technology the game is built on.\n\nCONS:\n- Occasional bugs where you get stuck in the geometry but since I quick-save regularly it isn't a game breaking issue for me.\n- NPCs have path-finding issues.\n\nVERDICT:\nRecommended.","timestamp_created":1555211063,"timestamp_updated":1604918850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.634424269199371338","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50118144","author":{"steamid":"76561198126115979","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":3329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3169,"last_played":1608161075},"language":"english","review":"This is where it all started...","timestamp_created":1555190972,"timestamp_updated":1555190972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50112215","author":{"steamid":"76561198069813101","num_games_owned":933,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":342,"playtime_at_review":961,"last_played":1660512206},"language":"spanish","review":"Alguién sabe porque mierda hay tantas actualizaciones ultimamente?\n\nSi, recomiendo el juego, el mejor fps que existe.\n","timestamp_created":1555168791,"timestamp_updated":1555168791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50110734","author":{"steamid":"76561198887805113","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1617826191},"language":"english","review":"A must-play classic, 10/10.","timestamp_created":1555163511,"timestamp_updated":1555163511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50107573","author":{"steamid":"76561198871265482","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":869,"last_played":1609612805},"language":"turkish","review":"oyun harika harika harika ztn oyun cok eski ama 1998 yılında cıkmasına rağmen 2019 da haeln oynanıosa bu bir başarıdır  mükemmel","timestamp_created":1555149990,"timestamp_updated":1555149990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50102776","author":{"steamid":"76561198144054106","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":93,"playtime_forever":368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":368,"last_played":1531520507},"language":"french","review":"Franchement je trouve que Half Life a assez mal vieilli.

But its also one that remembers to be an actual game too, and it's the game part that is incredibly put together still makes it worth it to play even now, even when the gameplay elements are just simple stuff by today's standards. \n\nYou are a scientist named Gordon Freeman, who was working on an experiment that goes bad and aliens start attacking. The story is basic, even at the time and it dosen't get fleshed out until later in the series, but how it's told complements the pacing and gameplay, never has it worked against it.\n\nThe gameplay is where the game still shines. again it's stuff we see in shooters today but the pacing and level design gives us an incredibly well polished game. The game dosen't play all of its cards from the get go, it introduces gameplay mechanics organically as the game goes. You have a well rounded arsenal of weapons, but each one has a niche role. Like you can use the SMG at close or medium range, but the spread means that anything beyond medium rage is wasting ammo. This isn't a bad thing by any means but it's something to keep in mind. The only real issues I have with the gameplay is that there are some parts of the game where its just guesswork, but its few and far in between all this well polished gameplay.\n\nThe AI can be both incredibly stupid and brilliant at the same time. Like the aliens can be eating your corpse when they kill you or explore the environment or other little things that help cement the idea that these are animals not fodder for your guns. At the same time they have some of the more crappy pathfinding I have seen in a game. This is ten times worse with your allies cause it feels more like babysitting.\n\nSome older FPS fan might point their fingers at Half-Life as to why we have FPS campaigns that focus too much on story and not enough on gameplay, but I think it's that alot of developers nowadays copy what Half-Life did without thinking about HOW Half-Life did it and how they made it work. Careful craftsmanship is what make games, not the gameplay elements, and I think Half-Life is a great example of it.","timestamp_created":1555106930,"timestamp_updated":1555106930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50097576","author":{"steamid":"76561198166343745","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1055,"last_played":1540738482},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um clássico que envelheceu muito bem com o tempo.
