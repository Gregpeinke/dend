De principio a fin, el juego te mantiene enganchado con sus niveles muy originales cuya dificultad va aumentando a medida que vas avanzando. Aunque el juego en si es muy corto, sobretodo si ,como yo, ya lo habias jugado, vale completamente la pena y seguramente si es la primera vez que lo juegas te llevara un tiempo resolver todos los niveles. La villana, GlaDos, es espectacular la voz y la interaccion que tiene con nuestro personaje a lo largo del juego.\nSuper recomendable este juego, asi que aprovecha que no esta muy caro\n\nPD: La cancion del final es una de las cosas mas espectaculares que he escuchado en un videojuego","timestamp_created":1550636054,"timestamp_updated":1550636054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49112052","author":{"steamid":"76561198332805789","num_games_owned":346,"num_reviews":93,"playtime_forever":657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1617044227},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1550631355,"timestamp_updated":1610948386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529708921909332275","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49112041","author":{"steamid":"76561198347969250","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1550631041},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic!","timestamp_created":1550631275,"timestamp_updated":1550631275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49110599","author":{"steamid":"76561198224283484","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":161,"last_played":1550610784},"language":"english","review":"The reviews aren't a lie.
