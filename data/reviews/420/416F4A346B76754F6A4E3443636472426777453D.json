The recent news around the leaked storyline of Episode 3 does not necessarily mean the series has reached its end for the possibility of Half-Life 3, but if Valve’s current interests are indicative of anything it’s that single-player experiences are not their priority when multiplayer games and Steam are their present-day future. Out of all the technological incentives I had hoped would bring Gordon Freeman back, namely VR, it’s clear that the future of Half-Life isn’t one constrained by technology but more likely by the lack of desire to continue its legacy. \n\nDoes this recent update diminish everything about the series and what makes all these great games now worthless? Certainly not. Playing the Half-Life 2 games once again reminded me why they are still worthwhile campaigns that have progressively improved upon the faults of the original with every episodic release, and Episode 2 is prime example about how refining the greatest hits of the original can lead to a better experience with every reiteration.  Even if Episode 2 is the end of the series and we only have the story thread for closure, we always have these games high quality and their memories, and now with the closure we can finally dress these wounds.\n\n[h1]From a Tech Demo to a Tech Demolition Project[/h1]\n\nThe best moments of Episode 1 were focused around creating linear, moment-to-moment levels that stressed the limitations of the gunplay with a greater pace and variety of combat sequences.  This also extended to the puzzles themselves that shied away from the seesaw physics obstacles for combat challenges with the environment such as plugging up Antlion holes or kickstarting an elevator in the dark following wire-threads and fending off the hordes of zombies. While the narrative itself boiled down into a bullet-list of objectives about Gordon and Alyx into a synopsis about escaping the destruction of City 17, the pacing of these levels kept the familiarity issues from being a concern. \n\nEpisode 2 takes all these improvements and adds the explorable environments from the base game such as Highway 17 and Water Hazard that remain highly linear, polished areas but with more non-linear elements. Instead of having long-drawn out pauses of the gameplay like the set-up of Ravenholm and having chapters that overstayed their welcome, EP2 manages to convey the variety of its levels far better than EP1 and HL2 in general. Even the narrative elements, which remain sparse as EP1, add a greater sense of world-building through the new environments, the plot itself and the additional threats introduced in EP2. When you combine the additions of EP1 and 2 to the Half-Life 2 experience, there is not only a far greater narrative experience but also a greater gameplay-focused campaign that was always the most enjoyable reason to replay the original.\n\nThis last point is one of the many reasons why the long wait for Episode 3 has been to the detriment of the series’ names because if EP3 was anywhere near the quality of EP2 (or even EP1 with a stronger narrative focus) the conclusion to Half-Life 2 would have made it a true successor to the series. Without its inclusion, even if it was less combat orientated and a simple interactive walking-sim experience that wrapped everything up with the story we have for EP3, that feeling of incompleteness will always be a black mark on the future of Half-Life. However, any form of closure is better left than nothing, although this attitude has always posed a problem for the Half-Life franchise.\n\n[h1]The Last Epistle of the Freeman and His Apostles[/h1]\n\nIf you have not read the ending letter, I would suggest you do when you have replayed the games for yourself to let what would have happened be easier to imagine from the scant details of this thread: [url= https://pastebin.com/uYecqiuu]Link[/url]. I will not spoil that experience.\n\nIt’s not a conspiracy to suggest that whether we had Episode 3 or Half-Life 3 there would not be any sense of finality as Half-Life is a series against the idea of closure. Every game, and even the expansions of Half-Life 1, refuses to resolve all its story-threads which leaves the player with a multitude of questions on a cliffhanger. If you read the ending to Episode 3, the ending has some closure fans have desired but it remains an unfinished storyline as much as Episode 2. That feeling of never feeling finished was rather the point as Laidlaw has stated about the series’ future, “I expected every installment would end without resolution, forever and ever…,” and that attitude is likely the reason why any future for Half-Life will be avoided at any cost rather than giving into the fans’ expectations.\n\nWith the amount of public backlash games receive for endings to franchises such as Mass Effect and for the result of games not living up to the hype such as Duke Nukem: Forever or No Man’s Sky, it’s understandable why Valve would shy away from creating a conclusion that intentionally would end without closure. This is the only logical reason why Valve would refuse to create the game in spite of the age of the Source Engine and Valve’s tendency to refine a game only once to meet their standards. Between the two possibilities of creating the finale to Half-Life that will not bring closure and not creating the game, it’s easier for Valve to live with the consequences of creating a product doomed to fail. This sort of artistic design behind Half-Life was doomed to end badly whether today or in the future, and the concession of a few words written (not) by Gordon Freeman himself to send him off gives the fans the solace that they need while still desiring for his return against all the odds. \n\t\nGiven the circumstances of what Episode 3 involves perhaps this unconventional means of communication for a game from a dead-icon who never spoke a word yet remained a striking personality is what was intended all along. A message written from another time for people of another time and place who feel lost without his influence in the many lives the Freeman impacted in his games.","timestamp_created":1503939959,"timestamp_updated":1503939972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580178022384643555","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34556622","author":{"steamid":"76561198177466701","num_games_owned":378,"num_reviews":112,"playtime_forever":255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79,"last_played":1519590492},"language":"english","review":"I know you're out there, Gordon.","timestamp_created":1503937230,"timestamp_updated":1503937230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.409104973077774048","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34555132","author":{"steamid":"76561198053118698","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":597,"last_played":1505442522},"language":"english","review":"Release 3 Gaben","timestamp_created":1503933172,"timestamp_updated":1503933172,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505874216556549072","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34554461","author":{"steamid":"76561198386967515","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1514172313},"language":"schinese","review":"不好玩，自由度低，太难玩了，各种限制条件，妈的，卡在杀两个卫兵一个多小时，实在没耐心了，卫兵吃180多发子弹都死不了？只能用煤气罐炸死？游戏体验非常不好，地图各种绕绕绕，很容易迷路啊，卡住不知道怎么走，不查攻略根本玩不下去。。查了攻略也贼难玩，还出3想多了。。。","timestamp_created":1503931291,"timestamp_updated":1503931291,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.216954305768013","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34552193","author":{"steamid":"76561197995947072","num_games_owned":334,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":276,"last_played":1389070544},"language":"english","review":"The HL series are all great individual titles but if you can't handle stories ending on a cliffhanger with no resolution, do not play these titles.

I can hear your complaint already, \"Gordon Freeman, we have not heard from you in ages!\" Well, if you care to hear excuses, I have plenty, the greatest of them being I've been in other dimensions and whatnot, unable to reach you by the usual means. This was the case until eighteen months ago, when I experienced a critical change in my circumstances, and was redeposited on these shores. In the time since, I have been able to think occasionally about how best to describe the intervening years, my years of silence. I do first apologize for the wait, and that done, hasten to finally explain (albeit briefly, quickly, and in very little detail) events following those described in my previous letter (referred to herewith as Episode 2).\n\nTo begin with, as you may recall from the closing paragraphs of my previous missive, the death of Eli Vance shook us all. The Research & Rebellion team was traumatized, unable to be sure how much of our plan might be compromised, and whether it made any sense to go on at all as we had intended. And yet, once Eli had been buried, we found the strength and courage to regroup. It was the strong belief of his brave daughter, the feisty Alyx Vance, that we should continue on as her father had wished. We had the Arctic coordinates, transmitted by Eli's long-time assistant, Dr. Judith Mossman, which we believed to mark the location of the lost research vessel Borealis. Eli had felt strongly that the Borealis should be destroyed rather than allow it to fall into the hands of the Combine. Others on our team disagreed, believing that the Borealis might hold the secret to the revolution's success. Either way, the arguments were moot until we found the vessel. Therefore, immediately after the service for Dr. Vance, Alyx and I boarded a helicopter and set off for the Arctic; a much larger support team, mainly militia, was to follow by separate transport.\n\nIt is still unclear to me exactly what brought down our little aircraft. The following hours spent traversing the frigid waste in a blizzard are also a jumbled blur, ill-remembered and poorly defined. The next thing I clearly recall is our final approach to the coordinates Dr. Mossman has provided, and where we expected to find the Borealis. What we found instead was a complex fortified installation, showing all the hallmarks of sinister Combine technology. It surrounded a large open field of ice. Of the Hypnos itself there was no sign…or not at first. But as we stealthily infiltrated the Combine installation, we noticed a recurent, strangely coherent auroral effect–as of a vast hologram fading in and out of view. This bizarre phenomenon initially seemed an effect caused by an immense Combine lensing system, Alyx and I soon realized that what we were actually seeing was the research vessel Borealis itself, phasing in and out of existence at the focus of the Combine devices. The aliens had erected their compound to study and seize the ship whenever it materialized. What Dr. Mossman had provided were not coordinates for where the sub was located, but instead for where it was predicted to arrive. The vessel was oscillating in and out of our reality, its pulses were gradually steadying, but there was no guarantee it would settle into place for long–or at all. We determined that we must put ourselves into position to board it at the instant it became completely physical.\n\nAt this point we were briefly detained–not captured by the Combine, as we feared at first, but by minions of our former nemesis, the conniving and duplicitous Wallace Breen. Dr. Breen was not as we had last seen him–which is to say, he was not dead. At some point, the Combine had saved out an earlier version of his consciousness, and upon his physical demise, they had imprinted the back-up personality into a biological blank resembling an enormous slug. The BreenGrub, despite occupying a position of relative power in the Combine hierarchy, seemed nervous and frightened of me in particular. Wallace did not know how his previous incarnation, the original Dr. Breen, had died. He knew only that I was responsible. Therefore the slug treated us with great caution. Still, he soon confessed (never able to keep quiet for long) that he was himself a prisoner of the Combine. He took no pleasure from his current grotesque existence, and pleaded with us to end his life. Alyx believed that a quick death was more than Wallace Breen deserved, but for my part, I felt a modicum of pity and compassion. Out of Alyx's sight, I might have done something to hasten the slug's demise before we proceeded.\n\nNot far from where we had been detained by Dr. Breen, we found Judith Mossman being held in a Combine interrogation cell. Things were tense between Judith and Alyx, as might be imagined. Alyx blamed Judith for her father's death…news of which, Judith was devastated to hear for the first time. Judith tried to convince Alyx that she had been a double agent serving the resistance all along, doing only what Eli had asked of her, even though she knew it meant she risked being seen by her peers–by all of us–as a traitor. I was convinced; Alyx less so. But from a pragmatic point of view, we depended on Dr. Mossman; for along with the Borealis coordinates, she possessed resonance keys which would be necessary to bring the vessel fully into our plane of existence.\n\nWe skirmished with Combine soldiers protecting a Combine research post, then Dr. Mossman attuned the Borealis to precisely the frequencies needed to bring it into (brief) coherence. In the short time available to us, we scrambled aboard the ship, with an unknown number of Combine agents close behind. The ship cohered for only a short time, and then its oscillations resume. It was too late for our own military support, which arrived and joined the Combine forces in battle just as we rebounded between universes, once again unmoored.\n\nWhat happened next is even harder to explain. Alyx Vance, Dr. Mossman and myself sought control of the ship–its power source, its control room, its navigation center. The ships's history proved nonlinear. Years before, during the Combine invasion, various members of an earlier science team, working in the hull of a dry-docked vessel situated at the Aperture Science Research Facility in Michigan, had assembled what they called the Bootstrap Device. If it worked as intended, it would emit a field large enough to surround the ship. This field would then itself travel instantaneously to any chosen destination without having to cover the intervening space. There was no need for entry or exit portals, or any other devices; it was entirely self-contained. Unfortunately, the device had never been tested. As the Combine pushed Earth into the Seven Hour War, the aliens seized control of our most important research facilities. The staff of the Borealis, with no other wish than to keep the ship out of Combine hands, acted in desperation. The switched on the field and flung the Borealis toward the most distant destination they could target: Arctica. What they did not realize was that the Bootstrap Device travelled in time as well as space. Nor was it limited to one time or one location. The Borealis, and the moment of its activation, were stretched across space and time, between the nearly forgotten Lake Huron of the Seven Hour War and the present day Arctic; it was pulled taut as an elastic band, vibrating, except where at certain points along its length one could find still points, like the harmonic spots along a vibrating guitar string. One of these harmonics was where we boarded, but the string ran forward and back, in both time and space, and we were soon pulled in every direction ourselves.\n\nFor the rest of Half Life Episode 3's story go here -------> https://github.com/Jackathan/MarcLaidlaw-Epistle3/blob/master/Epistle3_Corrected.md","timestamp_created":1503721277,"timestamp_updated":1503721277,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540559291839599609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34495776","author":{"steamid":"76561198012454544","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1506225900},"language":"english","review":"FRIENDSHIP ENDED WTIH GABE\nNOW MARC IS MY NEW BEST FRIEND","timestamp_created":1503719548,"timestamp_updated":1503719548,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537920534610748291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34494848","author":{"steamid":"76561198044354237","num_games_owned":2200,"num_reviews":114,"playtime_forever":498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1628977480},"language":"polish","review":"Wake up Volvo...
