Aside from \"more of that Half Life\" purposes. The game is shorter than Opposing Force, which to be honest is welcome since the new content is limited to the point of barely being noticeable, so if it was longer it would probably overstay its welcome. In fact I find it hard to name a difference beyond the fact that Barney gets hids armor from dead security guards instead of the hubs. It felt like a pilot episode of Half Life in the sence that they had a little bit of everything in it, but it never felt connected or coherent. Especially that Xen segment where Barney literally pops in for tea and cookies and to throw a teleporter switch. You know, all in a security guard's regular rdaily activity. In any case, it's a good game though it feels kinda bland compared to what could have been done with it.","timestamp_created":1593695960,"timestamp_updated":1593695960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71870369","author":{"steamid":"76561198007540184","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":100,"playtime_forever":297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":297,"last_played":1566682529},"language":"english","review":"It may be the weakest of the original trilogy, not to mention the shortest by far, but this is still fun.

I feel like Gandalf when he told Bilbo \"You haven't aged a day.\" It's magical. Voice acting is very humorous, not because of puns or jokes (well, maybe a bit), but because of how bad it is, which I like too. But the best part, is adding this perspective of the Black Mesa disaster (making this the third perspective), makes it truly feel like just that; a disaster that affected a lot more people than the main protagonist of the main game (Gordon Freeman). It makes it feel like you are a part of the world, rather than the world revolving around you knowing these events affect others, not just yourself. I kinda wish other major games had side spin-offs of other perspectives like this.\n\nI give Half-Life: Blue Shift:\n\n7.2 Trigger Squeezes out of 10\n\nI feel like it's best to play this game after Half-Life 2, however.

Por lo que si le metes onda, te terminas el juego en unos 40 o 30 min.\n\n-Esta expansión tiene un montón de bugs, y aunque la mayoria sean \"gamebreaking\", se pueden parchear.\n\n-El juego solamente tiene doblaje oficial al inglés. Por lo que si lo queres en otro idioma, vas a tener que buscar en internet.\n\n[b] Recomiendo este juego por si queres exprimir más la historia de Half-Life y sus personajes.

La historia está muy bien desarrollada (no es muy compleja en todo caso), no existe ningún punto en el juego en el que la historia pase a segundo plano y sucumbamos ante una lluvia de sangre y balas sin sentido. Los diálogos son de lo mejor, sin duda, esto porque son variados y enriquecen mucho el transfondo de la historia narrada en Half-Life. Sin embargo, un aspecto muy negativo es que para quienes tengan como preferencia de idioma al español se encontrarán con que el juego mezcla diálogos en español y en inglés a mansalva. Esto, porque los diálogos originales de Half-Life: Blue Shift nunca fueron doblados al español. Si tienes un dominio decente del inglés no tendrás mayores problemas, pero hay ocasiones en que las acciones que debes llevar a cabo para avanzar en la aventura se te entregan exclusivamente en forma de diálogos. Si las entiendes, genial; si no, te jodes.\n\nOtros aspectos negativos son la ausencia de nuevos enemigos y armas, cosa que vemos en Half-Life: Opposing Force (1998) llevado a cabo de forma ejemplar. Recordar que Half-Life: Blue Shift fue desarrollado después (2001). Las horas de juego que puede ofrecer esta aventura también son reducidas comparado con sus títulos hermanos. En lo personal, me tomó 3.6 horas terminar Half-Life: Blue Shift en dificultad normal (Half-Life: 13.3 horas - Half-Life: Opposing Force: 6.6 horas). Sin embargo, esto lo perdono por su precio (es el juego más barato de la línea Half-Life). También se extrañan, y mucho, niveles contra jefes. En Half-Life: Blue Shift no existe ningún enfrentamiento de ningún tipo contra algún jefe (ni si quiera en el clímax de la aventura).\n\nEn definitiva, recomiendo totalmente este título. Un imperdible para todo seguidor de la saga de Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1592973403,"timestamp_updated":1592973403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71250722","author":{"steamid":"76561198243222046","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":721,"last_played":1546709583},"language":"english","review":"play as barney calhoun in this half life expansion! in this expansion you play as a guard assigned to blue shift, when all of the sudden, scientists need help with the elevator in another sector! you help them, but suddenly.. the elevator shakes! and then all chaos ensues, houndeyes, vortigaunts, headcrabs! everything is back to ravage the facility, then the elevator collapses, and a passed out barney wakes up to find the scientists dead, with a houndeye feasting on a guard. what happens next? play and you'll find out!","timestamp_created":1592961335,"timestamp_updated":1592961335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71240691","author":{"steamid":"76561198441531741","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":698,"last_played":1588992595},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1592943194,"timestamp_updated":1592943194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71238773","author":{"steamid":"76561198108383681","num_games_owned":645,"num_reviews":730,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1592939978},"language":"english","review":"Really nice add-on, another look at life in Black Mesa.
