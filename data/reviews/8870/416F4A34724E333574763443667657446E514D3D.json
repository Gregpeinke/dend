Wow! What a getaway. This is what I'm talking about when I say action adventure. The player is an early 20th century soldier type with a dark past on a mission to rescue a young woman from the leader of a religious cult that lives on a city that floats above the clouds. A story that is twisting and winding at every turn like the various ways you can move across the floating buildings of this majestic sky city. The combat takes time to grasp as there are various ways to approach it. Player is armed with upgradeable guns and bottled superpowers called vigors to juggle the different enemies in all out combat. The game has no stealth options though. Player is helped in combat by an invincible portal jumping companion who gives health and ammo when needed. Yeah. This is a game I recommend to lovers of story rich single player action adventure games for sure.","timestamp_created":1642687217,"timestamp_updated":1642745293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108389638","author":{"steamid":"76561198339148057","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1691,"last_played":1532341522},"language":"koreana","review":"갓-겜","timestamp_created":1642686876,"timestamp_updated":1642686876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108389576","author":{"steamid":"76561198160284265","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1130,"last_played":1652276486},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏体验一流，被游戏的美术风格所吸引到，很喜欢线性叙述故事FPS游戏，也喜欢这个游戏所写下的故事，很喜欢伊丽莎白一路上的陪伴，谢谢你，被夜莺守护的公主","timestamp_created":1642686809,"timestamp_updated":1642686809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108389188","author":{"steamid":"76561198959926410","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":565,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":565,"last_played":1642686189},"language":"koreana","review":"그저갓","timestamp_created":1642686381,"timestamp_updated":1642686381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108386444","author":{"steamid":"76561198206604443","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":68,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":68,"last_played":1502706146},"language":"schinese","review":"总有一天会玩的！","timestamp_created":1642682919,"timestamp_updated":1642682919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108385273","author":{"steamid":"76561198925169744","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":252,"last_played":1642947929},"language":"turkish","review":"güzel

5/10 game that fails to live up to BioShock 1 and 2 and ends up being an over-pretentious dumbed-down FPS worthy only of buying on sale and playing when you are either drunk, bored or just curious. Play Dishonored instead that does everything this game tried to do but 10 times better. \n\nBasically the Fallout 4 of the BioShock series. What Prometheus did the Aliens franchise, Infinite did the BioShock franchise. It’s the ugly stepchild of the 3 games. This game had so much more to offer based on its early ideas, demo footage and concept art that it's a shame the Bioshock series ended on what many fans consider to be the first game. It has neat ideas, it not overly flawed, but it’s basically a cheap and rather boring mainstream FPS title that fails to capture the magic of the first games. It has it’s creative moments, and there are moments that are pretty fun, but it lacks the themes of the first game, has clunky worldbuilding and a setting that often takes you out of it. The racism themes are laughable at times with how cartoon like they come out as. It’s full of the illusion of choice with cheap plot twists that make no sense.\n\nImagine if you took Bioshock, took it away from creepy and enigmatic Rapture completely, focused away the more subtle and nuanced way the first two Bioshocks handled topics such as capitalism, free will, collectivist, religion, discrimination, poverty, drug abuse, etc, and had them clunkily inserted into an overarching racism and dimension/time travel plotline that ends up making the viewing more confused about trying to make sense of the point of anything going on rather than actually enjoying the game. The first two Bioshocks set you in the decaying city of rapture, filled with dangerous mutants out to kill you, parts of the city that were falling about and becoming consumed by the ocean, where you had to think and carefully plan how to take down the big daddies to get the ADAM you needed to survive, where you have to scavenge everything around you and took careful considerations on what weapons you upgraded. It was a dark disturbing environment, where you learned about Rapture’s promising start that ended in complete failure and landed you in the hellhole that is current Rapture, an underwater city that could have actually been built with technology at the time. \n\nInfinite’s world is just a flying steampunk city that is at a complete mismatch with the tone and gameplay of the original games. At times it can mimic it, but it’s story, worldbuilding, ADAM replacement, and time travel/dimension and focus on mainstream FPS gameplay with little to no playing involving make for a lackluster game in what should have been Bioshock’s capstone, a franchise rooted as far back as System Shock. This game as well as Burial at Sea killed the franchise, so badly that some speculate it was one purpose. Where I can actually enjoy Fallout 4 for it’s faults as it still added as many features to the game as it took away, leaving a dumb-downed version of Fallout that still improved other Fallout games in some ways, Infinite feels like a downgrade of Bioshock, with lackluster gunplay, a lackluster story, and a setting that is so far removed from the environment created by the first two BioShock’s that it feels like a completely different game entirely. The game is incredibly linier, while enemies that lack in variety with easy encounters. It doesn’t help that you basically revive instantly if you die anyway, you just lose money. When it is difficult it just feels poorly designed rather difficult in an engaging way. \n\nWhile there are far, far, far worse games out there that make Infinite look like a masterpiece, there are also far better games and FPSs out there that take full advantage of their gameplay features. Doom Eternal, for instance, has many of the same movement focused gameplay and enemy types as Infinite, but features much more strategy and movement and harder enemies that make it a blast compared to Infinite. Wolfenstein the New Order has a protagonist far better than Booker could ever be and far more engaging gameplay. Hell, Infinite itself feels like such a rip-off of Dishonored at this point. that I would honestly say that Dishonored is more of a steampunk BioShock game that Infinite is. If you consider buying this game, consider just picking up Dishonored instead. Like I said before, while Infinite isn’t a bad game itself, it’s far from a good game either. It’s a mediocre game that you could probably enjoy if you got it for a super cheap price, but is it really worth your time when you could be playing something else instead?\n\nBesides Cyberpunk 2077, this game was one of the biggest disappointments for me. There was so much room for something great here, but they really dropped the L on this hard. If you want a mind-bending redemption plot where choice matters in a dark and gloomy steampunk setting where gameplay focused on stealth, action, and magic, where you fight against a totalitarian dictator in order to save an important girl, all with immersive sim elements, just Play Dishonored. \n\nNot recommending for how overrated the game is. Once you strip past the pretty visuals it's a lastluster FPS.","timestamp_created":1642658327,"timestamp_updated":1642658327,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.426452040672302246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108371380","author":{"steamid":"76561199028983604","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":176,"playtime_at_review":1005,"last_played":1660508362},"language":"spanish","review":"muy

i first saw Bioshock Infinite i said to myself this is most likely gonna be my least favorite Bioshock game but i was wrong this game was amazing not better than the original but still better than number 2.\nThe story was good in my opinion but i did search it up on google after. I liked Jeremiah Fink looking away from his racist side and other characters fx the Lutece twins. Enemies was also pretty good like the handyman and fireman.\nGuns was not the greatest you could only hold 2 weapons so when you came to a area where the enemies didn't have the guns you have upgrade so you could not get ammo so you had to pick home the bad weapons with zero upgrades sucked.

I also only played the base game.\n\nThe gameplay was pretty fun. Some of the guns were much better than others. My favorites were the sniper, handcannon, shotgun, and repeater. I relied on 3 vigors during my playthrough- the shock, the fireball, and the horsey one. The mechanics are generally satisfying- especially the sky-hook. The tears were a cool way to force me into every part of an arena. None of the arenas or enemy types felt particularly unfair, even on Hard, with the exception of the ghost boss who was a total bullet sponge (although not even that difficult to fight). The AI was passable in this regard too. If zombies that slow walk straight towards you was a 1 and Halo: Combat Evolved was a 10, I'd rate the enemies a 4 or 5.\n\nThe story was terrible. I found that for being a very politically charged game, a lot of its ideas were either boilerplate (Columbia, which is just a stand-in for American society as a whole, is pretty racist) or incredibly stupid (in that it feels like Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama co-wrote the last half of the story). Elizabeth is a walking inconsistent deus ex machina. Some of the other events feel like they were written to push the gameplay scenario a certain way. There is a 20 minute exposition dump at the end, and it is incredibly boring (and not enlightening) for how long it is. It wraps up the story, but in a way that forced me to accept it.\n\nStill recommend because it was incredibly cheap and I got a good 8 hours of fun.","timestamp_created":1642566484,"timestamp_updated":1642566811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108304549","author":{"steamid":"76561198972645726","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2495,"last_played":1658709875},"language":"english","review":"yeah you kinda play it then look up a video on the ending after","timestamp_created":1642562612,"timestamp_updated":1642562612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108303436","author":{"steamid":"76561198026810851","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":470,"last_played":1642734769},"language":"english","review":"bio shock is the best series of games but infinite holds a special place in my heart","timestamp_created":1642560956,"timestamp_updated":1642560956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108303095","author":{"steamid":"76561198881684922","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1643597678},"language":"english","review":"Elizabeth is a Wifu","timestamp_created":1642560446,"timestamp_updated":1642560446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108299453","author":{"steamid":"76561198861045086","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1655143834},"language":"english","review":"Really Awesome! i like it.","timestamp_created":1642554933,"timestamp_updated":1642554933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108299256","author":{"steamid":"76561198397717881","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":974,"last_played":1624803452},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo absurdo demais!

Способности в этой игре действительно весело и интересно использовать,при чем все,они щикарно дополняют геймплей и делают его более веселым и зрелищным.

Следующий огромный плюс игры - милая спутница Элизабет которая будет с вами большую часть игры и будет вам всячески помогать,общаться с вами и делиться своими мыслями и переживаниями и не упустит шанс прихвастнуть своим умением взламывать замки,желательно к слову обшаривать каждый уголок дабы найти отмычки и деньги,в игре и просто пруд пруди,хотя могло бы быть и больше). По ходу игры менялся не только характер героини,но а так же ее внешний вид и альтернативная внешность Элизабест с каре мне понравилась куда больше.
