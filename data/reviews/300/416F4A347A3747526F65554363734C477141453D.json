Damals und auch nachdem es eigenständig wurde zählte es für mich zu den besten WW2 Taktik-Shootern. Man konnte wunderbar in Clan-Runden oder auf Lan-Partys zocken. \n\nNachdem Day of Defeat Source rauskam, war ich hin und hergerissen. Die neue Grafik und auch Source haben dazu beigetragen das Spiel zu verbessern. Allerdings hat man leider auch die Haptik der Waffen, den Schaden und auch allgemein an verschiedenen Dingen rumgeschraubt. Z. B. Wurden Gewehrgranaten ergänzt am Karabiner usw. \n\nJa DoD Source ist nach wie vor ein gutes Spiel, und nein DoD Source nervt mich weil die Waffen-Haptik so verändert wurde. Durch die sparsamen und schlechten Licht-, Sound- und Nebeleffekte (ich finde im Halflife 1 Teil besser) ging leider auch viel der düsteren Atmosphere verloren die eben eine Kriegssimulation

It's more slow and strategic than its Call of Duty counterpart, demanding that the player exercise some form of caution and thinking when going into battle. Every gun in the game has a distinct use that warrants a different play style from the player. The class and weapons that you'll use ultimately depends on what kind of FPS gamer you are, so choose wisely. The game and its mechanics are good on their own, at least if you are willing to be more tactical than you would be in most other FPS games. Some of the servers are still full of active players, but they will rip you a new one if you're new to this sort of thing. Just keep playing and you'll find yourself passively adapting to the strategic condition of the match. On the whole, I would recommend it if you want in on some online World War II action.
