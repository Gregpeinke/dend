It excels at impressing the player with it's setpieces, aesthetic and story. When I first played it, it impressed me immensely too. So much that I gave it a 10/10 and hardly found anything to criticize it for. In retrospect, there are some things to criticize:\n\nThe gunplay isn't the worst thing I've ever played by a long shot, however a lot of the enemies really are bullet sponges and sometimes it can feel like your guns lack punch. The vigors have their utility, however they feel less powerful and aren't used as creatively as the plasmids from the original Bioshock. Overall the weapon system feels more janky and not as flexible as in Bioshock, probably due to modern shooter design.\n\nThe atmosphere and graphics are stunning and really hold up well most of the time, but when they don't, man does it look bad. Some of the props and effects are extremely low quality if you look at them closely, NPCs look stiff and unvaried, and some of the character models just look uncanny and disproportionate, especially the female characters, which is a shame when your companion throughout the game, Elizabeth, is also affected by this.\n\nHowever the story and universe are really what's selling Bioshock Infinite, despite their flaws and inconsistencies. Besides Elizabeth's grander personal story, it brings up interesting themes of class struggle, racism, industrialization and more as you help initiate a socialist revolution in Columbia against the patriotic, religious, reactionary and americana-driven state upheld by the Founders. It's a shame that the game's message, similar to Bioshock 1 and 2, seems to be influenced by the horsehoe theory that \"both extremes are bad\" quite a lot, however that's retconned for the better 2 DLCs later.\n\nAt the end of the day, Bioshock Infinite is an interesting experience that's worth playing through at least once and has some minor replayability, even if you just wanna replay it for the story.\n\n8/10 - A cool experience.","timestamp_created":1483409097,"timestamp_updated":1586884349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496944993734359741","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28962992","author":{"steamid":"76561198256742951","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":826,"last_played":1618445966},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bueno la verdad, lo recomiendo mucho en lo que a la historia y jugabilidad se refiere\nMe encanto la historia el final me dejo con una especie de masturbacion mental que tarde tiempo en entenderle un poco a la historia c:\n\npero el juego es buenisimo, pero me hubiera encantado hubiera jefes epicos y el juego hubiera sido excelente (mi opinion personal).","timestamp_created":1483408536,"timestamp_updated":1483408536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28962947","author":{"steamid":"76561198312900908","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2086,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1689,"last_played":1561154788},"language":"english","review":"Its a huge change from the previous games. the color scheme and settings are a complete opposite from teh first two bioshocks.
