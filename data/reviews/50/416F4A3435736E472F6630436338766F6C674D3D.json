I was a little disappointed, but I still recommend it, so here's some context.\n\nAfter several years without playing games, I got a computer and started trying to catch up with some old games I had played but either didn't finish or outright hadn't played. A game I had not finished was Half-Life and it was a favorite of mine back in the day, so of course I got Half-Life and everything related I could find, so of course that meant getting either all or most of the official games in the franchise (except for Alyx since I don't have VR... yet).\n\nI was really excited to get back to the Half-Life universe and when I read about Blue Shift and Opposing Force I remember that the consensus seemed to be like Blue Shift was not as good as Opposing Force, but I got them both and decided to play them anyway.\n\nI found myself actually enjoying Blue Shift quite a lot, even if it's true that it's not as good as Half-Life but I didn't expect it to be. I liked the story and I found Barney actually likable, felt like a more grounded Half-Life story than Gordon's, just a guy trying to escape and save others in the way, I liked that.\n\nSo of course when it was time to play Opposing Force my expectations were high, but here's the thing, I actually found myself more frustrated playing Opposing Force than playing Blue Shift.\n\nI get why some people would prefer Opposing Force over Blue Shift, but I actually found most of the changes to lean to annoying instead of exciting, for example, most of the new creatures I ended up hating more than any of the originals. I ended up hating most if not all of the Race X creatures and a good part of the second half is mainly those creatures and the AI with the Black Ops agents felt broken with the agents engaged in combat with the Race X creatures but preferring to get back to shooting the marine than the creatures even if I was just taking cover for a moment.\n\nAnd even if some people also prefer Opposing Force over Blue Shift because of the weapons, I found myself overwhelmed with the excess of options so even if there were some new weapons I actually really liked, I found that there were many weapons you just don't use after you find better weapons later in the game. I would have preferred to have less options but some options I would get back too more often.\n\nAlso, I was surprised at the lack of some things Black Mesa should have like more HEV chargers, I found I liked better the \"armor\" mechanics of Blue Shift with Barney having to get vests and helmets than Shepard using an HEV vest and I think found only one charging station that seemed like it was from the military.\n\nLastly, I found myself liking Barney better than Shepard because after all, Barney's story seemed to be more grounded and made better use of NPCs, unlike Shepard who seemed to find other marines that seemed to have a function for just a really small part of the map and then they're just left behind. I don't know, I guess I would have preferred better scripted sequences where not only the marines, but also all the Otises had better fates, was it so hard to just keep like the 2 or 3 special marines kind of moving along with Shepard's story? Have them be separated and be like \"We'll meet you at X place\" and if you get there you find them there, add new dialogue to progress the story and repeat. The way the story is told in Opposing Force doesn't make me like Shepard better than Gordon or Barney since Shepard doesn't feel like a hero with a goal, he doesn't feel like he's trying to save anyone but himself, or maybe I missed something but again, I found myself enjoying Blue Shift more just because I ended up liking Barney more. Also, even if I wanted Shepard to remain with his team for more time, I also found the AI being kind of annoying, the repeated dialogues get tired after a while and it's just so hard to get them to cross a door.\n\nSo all in all, I do recommend playing Opposing Force, I also think my expectations probably didn't help since I expected this to be better than it ended up being.\n\nIn all honesty, I'd say Half-Life Echoes is better than both Blue Shift and Opposing Force. I'd recommend playing Half-Life Echoes and showing support to the creator if you want more Half-Life, and then play Blue Shift and Opposing Force.","timestamp_created":1641088685,"timestamp_updated":1641088685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107099110","author":{"steamid":"76561198311436865","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":90,"playtime_forever":8,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1640806948},"language":"brazilian","review":"Poderia ter legendas ;3;","timestamp_created":1641085349,"timestamp_updated":1641085349,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.435537040233612061","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107096713","author":{"steamid":"76561199044012625","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1647824842},"language":"english","review":"What an amazing spin-off.\nI love how Valve added to the Half Life canon with this game.\nThe tie-ins to the main story, the unique enemies, the awesome gameplay.\nThis is a game that knows what it's doing.\n10/10\n","timestamp_created":1641082755,"timestamp_updated":1641082755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107091909","author":{"steamid":"76561198352518084","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1593958875},"language":"english","review":"very nice","timestamp_created":1641077897,"timestamp_updated":1641077906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107091683","author":{"steamid":"76561198869619868","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":229,"last_played":1641432558},"language":"english","review":"This is better than the orginal half life, it has multiplayer more guns, its worth it","timestamp_created":1641077674,"timestamp_updated":1641077674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107089484","author":{"steamid":"76561198143292267","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1641274275},"language":"english","review":"Adrian Shephard can have my kids","timestamp_created":1641075576,"timestamp_updated":1641075576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107084805","author":{"steamid":"76561198437967307","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4,"playtime_at_review":133,"last_played":1660544258},"language":"english","review":"Here you will see why I love Half-Life: Opposing Force, but in my review you will read about why I gave it a negative review due to some problems.\n\nI love Half-Life: Opposing Force I love the story behind Shepherd.

Life Opposing Force is one of the most interesting and action packed game I have ever played. I always wanted to play the Half Life series. Opposing Force has Shepard a United States Marine HECU soldier being in Black Mesa. Although the game has no cut scenes or huge amounts of dialogue it can leave the player clueless if they don't know the story of Half Life or played Half Life. The good news being this game doesn't require story. You can hop on any time to play this and really not worry about story. The game play is great and fast pace. It does create a few challenges here and there with certain enemies. One of the most interesting is that in Opposing Force training mode is different from Half Life and Blueshift. instead of being in Black Mesa the player is placed in boot camp which helps create a more entertaining feeling. Opposing Force has lots of fun moments and a masterpiece! 10/10","timestamp_created":1640764284,"timestamp_updated":1640764284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106794690","author":{"steamid":"76561198209798988","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":377,"last_played":1640727332},"language":"english","review":"SIR YES SIR OORAH *starts twerking*","timestamp_created":1640748348,"timestamp_updated":1640748348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616565704345703125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106793186","author":{"steamid":"76561199152443426","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":25781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24822,"last_played":1640815527},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1640746611,"timestamp_updated":1640746611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106788788","author":{"steamid":"76561199087386118","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1642108527},"language":"latam","review":"Excelente expansión para el Half Life original, campaña nueva, nuevos enemigos, nuevas armas, igual de divertido y frenético.
