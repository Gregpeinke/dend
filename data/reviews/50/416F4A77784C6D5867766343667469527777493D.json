Вы увидите Чёрную Мезу глазами бойца, по имени, Шепард. Зачем прибыли военные, каковы их цели и почему они отступили, на все вопросы игра даёт ответ. Есть уровни, где был сам Фримен. Один раз мы его даже увидим! \nМонстров стало гораздо больше, пушки стали разнообразнее (относительно первой части). Сюжет интересен своими головоломками и нейтрализацией воинов Зена, чего только стоят музыкальные вставки (барабанная дробь), когда вступаешь в динамическую перестрелку!\nСетевой режим динамичен, на мой взгляд, интереснее чем в первой части (или мне попался такой сервер).

Also, despite Valve's reputation for supporting their games, it still has some severe bugs. This one might just be nitpicking because I'm sure it's just due to the age and engine, but I don't like how floaty the physics feel. The story has kind of a cool premise, but doesn't really go anywhere, apparently isn't even 'canon' to the series, and has an anticlimactic ending imo.

The game itself has some really good ideas but the mess of bugs that just get you stuck is painful, I've gotten stuck in elevators, walls, even once in the floor. Loading a quicksave can also crash your game from time to time.\n\n\nSome parts of the game are also massively frustrating thanks to very rare health and suit refilling opportunities and the resilience of some enemies, there are parts where this feeling is especially present thanks to the stupid amount of enemy spawned in a tiny area, enemies that have a gigantic amount of health in some cases. While battling the enemies in this game you will probably die, a lot, and you will need to respawn, the problem is that many of the autosave points are in areas that will make you repeat a boring vent or a puzzle you've already completed and have to repeat, this issue can of course be avoided by quicksaving, but as mentioned before, it likes to sometimes crash the game. Another problem I think is important is how weapons are handled, there are a lot of new weapons but most of them won't actually get much ammo during the game.\n\nOverall, it's not the worst of games but it does seem like no one play tested it due to the amount of bugs and frustrating instances during the time you spend playing.\n\nAlso, Otis stops being used fairly soon and he's so much better than the marines, unlike the marines Otis won't actually shoot you in the back while fighting. He also loves candy, you can't not love him.","timestamp_created":1610845216,"timestamp_updated":1610845216,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84821436","author":{"steamid":"76561198185099907","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":538,"last_played":1610844288},"language":"english","review":"This game was pretty cool.

Gearbox cogió los mejores elementos del juego original y los concentró en un juego de 6-7 horas que quizá tenga menos ambiciones narrativas y de inmersión, pero que  en mi opinión es incluso mejor que el Half Life porque el diseño de niveles me parece más sólido y satisfactorio. Por lo demás, es el mismo juego a nivel de gameplay, y a nivel narrativo simplemente ofrece una nueva perspectiva sobre los mismos eventos.\nLa expansión añade unas cuantas armas que no están nada mal, como el lanza-esporas, el francotirador o el M249. El barnacle es otra buena incorporación, abriendo nuevas posibilidades para atravesar los niveles. El añadir compañeros aliados fue una buena idea también, su inteligencia artificial no es muy buena, pero le dan variedad y algo de vida a los niveles en los que aparecen, además de funcionar como perfectos señuelos en los tiroteos.\nPor decir algo malo, las cuerdas, que sirven para subir, bajar o balancearse de una plataforma a otra, no están muy bien implementadas en mi opinión, son un poco imprecisas e incómodas de usar. Por otro lado, la visión nocturna está bien, pero la retícula del arma deja de verse, al ser ésta del mismo verde que tiñe la pantalla con la visión nocturna activada (algo que seguramente se puede arreglar con algún mod). \nEn conclusión, si te gusta el Half Life, te gustará el Opposing Force. Es más de lo mismo pero mejor. En mi opinión es muy recomendable, bastante más que Blue Shift (que tan poco está mal, ojo).","timestamp_created":1610838989,"timestamp_updated":1610838989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84813154","author":{"steamid":"76561198358964659","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1596,"last_played":1626021924},"language":"swedish","review":"I beated it on hard mode so yes","timestamp_created":1610833010,"timestamp_updated":1626021961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84797747","author":{"steamid":"76561198226823268","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":576,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":576,"last_played":1610814822},"language":"turkish","review":"Half Life'ı seviyorsanız oynamanız gerek.
