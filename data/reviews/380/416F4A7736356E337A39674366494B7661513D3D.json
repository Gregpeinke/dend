Игра является первой частью в трилогии эпизодов — продолжений Half-Life 2.\n\nЗначительную часть Episode One игрок проходит, взаимодействуя с компьютерным персонажем — Аликс Вэнс, что является нестандартным приёмом для серии Half-Life. Эпизод состоит из 5 глав (уровней), рассчитанных на 4-6 часов игры,[5] и рекламного ролика второго эпизода. Сюжет игры продолжает историю Half-Life и Half-Life 2, и начинается с момента, на котором завершилась предыдущая игра: игрок в роли Гордона Фримена вместе с Аликс Вэнс должен успеть сбежать из охваченного хаосом Сити 17, пока Цитадель Альянса, которой Фримен нанёс непоправимый ущерб, не уничтожила вместе с собой весь город.","timestamp_created":1482666421,"timestamp_updated":1482666421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568785190582275391","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28629925","author":{"steamid":"76561198020832158","num_games_owned":402,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57,"last_played":1482843500},"language":"russian","review":"Достойное продолжение,но короткое.","timestamp_created":1482666335,"timestamp_updated":1482666335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500460267066955566","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28611997","author":{"steamid":"76561198189725071","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":280,"last_played":1509407311},"language":"russian","review":"10 из 10 когда халф лайв 3333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333","timestamp_created":1482618234,"timestamp_updated":1482618234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28608820","author":{"steamid":"76561198119625011","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1477522050},"language":"english","review":"Legendary; pure excellence!","timestamp_created":1482611426,"timestamp_updated":1482611426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28606901","author":{"steamid":"76561198218092588","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1496017655},"language":"english","review":"zombines.....\n\n\nzombines everywhere","timestamp_created":1482607662,"timestamp_updated":1482607662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58269500732421875","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28593749","author":{"steamid":"76561198314673447","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1535484369},"language":"turkish","review":"Half Life serisinin tamamı gibi güzel bir seneryoya sahip akıcı heyecanlı bir oyun.

And I utterly hated this game, at the time I thought everything was poorly designed with my main complaint being the lack of ammo and weapons for the amount of enemies you have to kill. I considered it one of the worst game I ever played and it turned me off of Half life so much that I didn't bother buying the 2nd episode. I still haven't played it and I'm planning on buying it tomorrow during the Holiday Sale.\n\nBut after completing Half life 2 with some mods I decided to install episode one again and take it for a spin, fully expecting to hate it again. I was pleasantly surprised though Episode one is still the weakest game in the Half Life Franchise. First off my initial complaint of the lack of ammo for your weapons just... isn't a thing anymore. Maybe I just sucked and wasted too much ammo but I never had a problem. Though I wish that the crowbar was given to the player in the beginning of the game, instead of the half-way point where you no longer need it. Having a viable melee weapon early on in the game against the headcrab zombies would have been really nice instead of having to constantly run around the map looking for cement blocks to shoot at them with your Grav Gun.\n\nAlso the game is really dark, this in of itself isn't an issue but due to the fact that your flashlight uses energy you basically have to stop and stand still in the dark for a few moments while your flashlight charges, which really kills the game flow for me. I wish they just made the Flashlight not use your suit's battery so it could stay on indefinitely.\n\nI also really liked the Zombine enemy. They become a priority when dealing with hordes of Zombies and they can be actually quite helpful for you when they pull out a grenade and go kamikaze. If you're quick enough to get away they can  usually kill the horde of zombies for you. You can also shoot the grenade out of their hand or snatch it from them with the Grav Gun. It's all these things that makes them a fun dynamic new enemy which makes up for the lack of new weapons or features.\n\nThere are also a lot of great gunfights with the Combine and the firefight in the Hospital is definitely the best part of Episode one. Also Alyx is a treat too though I found her animation to be a little stiff and lifeless at times. Beat the game and when you're on the train, just look at Alyx and you'll see what I mean. She looks like a Mannequin at points and for a game whose main selling point is having Alyx fighting with you it seems like a big oversight, especially since the source engine has proven before that its quite good at making life-like animations. \n\nBut the biggest problem I have with the game is that it is waaay too short. I have around 6.9 hours clocked in and thats after 2 playthroughs. I believe my first playthrough took me about four hours and my last playthough just shy of three. Even in a market in which single player campaigns are getting increasingly short, there is no excuse for Episode one to be this short and it is simply not worth the asking price of $8, even when you take mods like MINERVA into consideration.\n\nUltimately I would recommend Episode One but with a big asterisk: Do not pay full price for it and understand that it is the weakest game in the Half Life Series, even a game like Blue Shift I feel is better than Episode one. But it has some cool gunfights and helps to continue the story and transition into Episode two. Pay at most $4 and make sure you play the Minerva mod at some point to get your full money's worth.","timestamp_created":1482372819,"timestamp_updated":1482373134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560090780258178711","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28516336","author":{"steamid":"76561198084213372","num_games_owned":1884,"num_reviews":168,"playtime_forever":520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":520,"last_played":1482355762},"language":"english","review":"Well its the first of - so far - two sequels to Half-Life 2.\nIts what you expect, if you loved Half-Life 1-2, youll love this one;\nReally short but a bit new gameplay mechanics and ideas, nice action and a continuation of the great story cliffhanger!\n8,5/10","timestamp_created":1482356097,"timestamp_updated":1482356097,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.631687402725219727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28515543","author":{"steamid":"76561198161472741","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":366,"last_played":1628430617},"language":"english","review":"the first time playing is 8/4/2016","timestamp_created":1482353106,"timestamp_updated":1482353106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28491242","author":{"steamid":"76561197975171803","num_games_owned":648,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":174,"last_played":1482259638},"language":"english","review":"just had ago 8 years later and not as good as i recalled very shore and looks dated now but still fun","timestamp_created":1482259719,"timestamp_updated":1482259719,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.429009169340133667","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28486151","author":{"steamid":"76561198174612409","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1500031404},"language":"russian","review":"Отличный эпизод отличной игры","timestamp_created":1482241550,"timestamp_updated":1482241550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28471671","author":{"steamid":"76561198325723431","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1478572652},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩。","timestamp_created":1482169005,"timestamp_updated":1482169005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28467502","author":{"steamid":"76561198031098946","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1612201415},"language":"russian","review":"Играешь щас в это после Колды новой, Батлы, и понимаешь в какое же фуфло скатились шутэры по механике.

more.","timestamp_created":1480721478,"timestamp_updated":1480721478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28148007","author":{"steamid":"76561198089736370","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1486258173},"language":"english","review":"so

Particularly FPS games. Now I understand why so many of those tedious stand and waste time moments exist in games. Half Life 2.\n\nSo many times in this very short episode do you stand there watching a wheel go round slowly while you open a shutter. For no other reason than to waste our time.\n\nI enjoy the physics puzzles still. They should be used more in gaming.\n\nThe AI drove me insane though! Several times I got trapped in a doorway with Alex stood behind me not moving. Where I had to load or kill myself to get free.\n\nI have no real care for anything in this world. To be honest I have almost no idea what the f*** I just did for the last couple of hours. Why does this episode even exist?\n\nYou wake up. Lurch from area to area doing \"stuff\" and then the credits roll. That's pretty much it. The slimsy bit of story that exists kind of gets forgotten until the last scene.\n\nMaybe back in the day this was excellent but honestly this gameplay no longer stands up. The last few years we've seen the resurfacing of open world games. That is for the best. \n\nLinear ass, time wasting shooters are no longer entertaining for me.\n\nPlus since the whole \"Chapter 3\" has yet to emerge in any form I guess the second chapter is going to be just as pointless story wise.\n\nYes I apreciate this is an old game but honestly I'm feeling like you had to be there nearer to its release to understand the appeal.
