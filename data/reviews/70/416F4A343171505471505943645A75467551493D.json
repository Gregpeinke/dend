Had I known it was an FPS I might have pushed through, but just walking around felt boring, I quickly switched to another game. Oh silly young me..\n\nNot only is the 'walking simulator' one of my favorite genres nowadays, when I actually played it on my PC many years later I finally got it. And I still consider it to have one of the best opening sequences today, the slowly creeping tension before all hell breaks loose, brilliant! It's a thrilling adventure with many memorable moments (I really love the ending) and a pioneer in environmental storytelling. While obviously dated in some regards, 22 years later it still holds up pretty well I think. I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it yet, and if the age is an obstacle check out the modern fan remake Black Mesa.","timestamp_created":1607879422,"timestamp_updated":1607890117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600263595581054688","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82282094","author":{"steamid":"76561198991618493","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":2410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":424,"last_played":1658693642},"language":"english","review":"Great game.

Je to pravda? \n\nOcitnete se v kůži vědce Gordona Freemana, který žije normální den v laboratoři Black Mesa. Při jednom experimentu se ale začnou dít nehezké věci. Omylem otevře portál na mimozemskou planetu Xen, a najednou je celý komplex zaplněn neznámými mimozemšťany. Black Mesa se obrátí vzhůru nohama. Pracovníci umírají, budova se rozpadá a vojáci kteří přišli vědcům na pomoct... no... moc nepomáhají.\nJe to tedy vše na Gordnovy, který se musí dostat z Black Mesy - otevřít portál na Xen a všechny zachránit.\n\nZačneme storytellingem. Co se mně osobně a hromadě dalších zalíbilo, byl styl vyprávění. Není to jako u dnešních titulů, kde je hromada cutscén, dialogů a scriptů.\nJe to uděláno tak, že vás hra postupem času učí a malýma detailama vám říká, co se děje.\nDejme tomu, že vojáci přijeli do Black Mesy - hráč si myslí, že budou přátelští, ale přes sklo vidí par vojáků zmasakrovat nevinné vědce - v ten moment člověku za PC dojde, že asi nejsou moc friendly jak si myslel.\nA takových momentů je plná hra. Nic vám tu nebudu spoilovat, ale storytelling to má báječný!\n\nGameplay. Jakpak se asi drží?\nNo, je to hra z roku 97, takže první věc, co mě napadla byl f a k t, že se to nebude ovládat zrovna dobře.\nOpak je ale pravdou. Až na menší skluzy, které Gordon dělá (na které si ale po chvilce hraní zvyknete) se hra ovládá jak by jste čekali.\nTo samé gunplay. Je velmi svižný a docela dobře udělaný, takže vás střelba nebude vůbec nudit. A ještě ke všemu vám hra obohacuje gunplay novýma zbraněma, které postupem příběhem získáte. Od pistole po mp5 z granátometem až dokonce k RPG, nebo plasmové zbrani. Vybere si opravdu každý!\n\nJeště bych si rád pokecal o atmosféře, protože ó můj bože - ta hra má zatraceně dobrou atmosféru!\nStrach, když se prodíráte trubkami Black Mesy, až po děsivý charakter design dělá z této hry nezapomenutelný zážitek.\nA musím se přiznat, že mě hra i několikrát vystrašila, a to bez použití levných jumpscarů!\n\nAll and all je to velmi zábavná hra, která rozhodně patří mezi must-play každého hráče, ale byla opravdu na tu dobu tak dobrá, že by dokázala úplně změnit jeden herní žánr a gaming komunitu jako takovou?\nAno... jedno velké ANO!\n\nPopravdě se mi těžko hledalo něco špatného na tomto titulu, ale i tak jsem něco našel...\nPoslední cca hodina hraní je klukům z VALVe moc nepovedla a finální bossfight stojí taky za nic, ale i přes tyhle malé detaily si ode mě hra zaslouží:\n\n9,5 / 10\n\nTakže... ano,\nza těch pár éček to rozhodně stojí!","timestamp_created":1607708902,"timestamp_updated":1607789279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82094183","author":{"steamid":"76561198377605773","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1153,"last_played":1656974564},"language":"russian","review":"Мне нравиться","timestamp_created":1607708623,"timestamp_updated":1607708623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57769310474395752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82092684","author":{"steamid":"76561198046289474","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":951,"last_played":1607610461},"language":"russian","review":"[b]Данную игру я прошёл в далёком 2004 на Sega Dreamcast вместе с [u]Blue Shift[/u] и [u]Opposing Force[/u].

Com uma variedade enorme de armas e inimigos. Com uma história que não é algo emocionante mas o jogador sempre sabe o que está acontecendo, mesmo o jogo sendo totalmente em inglês e sem legenda, o que só prejudica os diálogos. Nunca chega a um ponto repetitivo que nem Death Stranding, sempre a algo novo. Uma hora tu anda em um trenzinho subterrâneo, passa por um campo minado com helicópteros te atirando, mata um alien com garras saindo de um buraco, ativa reatores para ativar a energia dos portais e ir para um planeta alienígena e atravessa mais portais ainda, fazendo a paisagem do planeta mudar e fazendo o jogador matar um alien gigante com um saco maior ainda pendurado nele, depois vai para uma fábrica alienígena e mata um alien gigantesco que mais parece um bebê. Os gráficos eram muito bom para a época, levando em consideração que naquela mesma década Doom tinha sido lançado e nem era um 3d de verdade ainda","timestamp_created":1607684421,"timestamp_updated":1607684421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82061749","author":{"steamid":"76561198403094666","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1629735595},"language":"turkish","review":"İyi oyunda benim beyin yetmedi takılı kaldım beyniniz yeterse oynanacak bir oyun","timestamp_created":1607681777,"timestamp_updated":1607681777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41qPTqPYCdZuFuQI="}
