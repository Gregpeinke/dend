They should develop games like these again. Imagine if Portal 2 is this awesome , how awesome HL3 could be? Valve pls  start earn money with honest work again and we will be grateful. Loyal followers should be treasued once again. \nValve is not Valve without them or it's games.  \n\nPortal 2 is beautiful , it envolved from the humble starts of Portal 1. Yet it gives the same sinister,bizzare feeling.  + We have our same old dark humour.\nThe Aperture facility is pure madness yet it's enthralling, beatiful and terrible at the same time. In the main campaing you just want to escape from this \"beatiful madness\" fast as u can.  ;)\n\nThe puzzles are much harder and it has a co-op  campaing so you can play with friends. There are a lot of achievements compared to Portal 1.\n\nGlaDOS is.... you will just come to hate and fear her especially if you played the first game you will hate her even more. Trust me I was not happy to see her again... So the plan is to \"escape\" with a fellow who seems to be helpful ,but for this certain fellow \"escaping\" means a different thing.\n\nHowever you will experience  this \"escape\" plan  isn't the best idea either  especially if you become a lab rat again \"for science\"... More so if you just realized the creator of this plan is the biggest moron of all time and wants to be in charge of a facility he can't even handle... \n\nThrough this epic journey you will learn Aperture's history while you adventure in the long lost sections of the facilty. \nHow GlaDOS was created, her purpose and betrayal? Who is your little \"helper\"? You will find your answers ,but your situation will become an even bigger mess as you race with time to avoid the  catastrophe and your certain death.\n\n11/10 , would become a monster again who makes an alliance with a POTATO to defeat a moron for the sake of escaping for real.","timestamp_created":1435525593,"timestamp_updated":1435527129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16767740","author":{"steamid":"76561198077785043","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1965,"last_played":1599534518},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1435523895,"timestamp_updated":1435523895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500109076499938965","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16767436","author":{"steamid":"76561198202996153","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":955,"last_played":1651280201},"language":"english","review":"Can't.

Where I felt mildly disappointed was in regards to the replay value, including bonus content. The original game had an incredible challenge mode at the end that was easily as entertaining as the main game, and greatly extended the play time. There were also several (small) hidden areas.\n\nPortal 2's hidden areas are all relatively small, while the much larger budget should have allowed for some branching paths or other additional hidden elements to allow replayability.\nThe bonus maps have been basically replaced by time trials of main levels (boring) and player-created content. In theory, player content is great, but the reality makes it very hard to find the best levels. You constantly have to face a wall of more or less randomly chosen maps with names like \"deception 2\" and little description. After 3 minutes of loading, you still don't know whether the map is any good.\n\nI still recommend the game for the main content, but I hope for a litte more should another sequel come out.","timestamp_created":1435404091,"timestamp_updated":1435404091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16737908","author":{"steamid":"76561198150314085","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":621,"last_played":1583693889},"language":"russian","review":"Кароче, Я проснулся , походу у меня проблемы с мозгом, ладно, ко мне пришёл пиздюк по имени Вуитли, окей.
