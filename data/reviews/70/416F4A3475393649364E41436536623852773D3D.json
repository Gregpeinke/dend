I remember playing the demo, Half-Life: Uplink and going crazy for it. So, what did I think of the full game?\n\nIt blew my F**KING mind! Mere words are insufficient to describe how freaking AWESOME this game was (and still is). I shall however attempt to do just that.\nThe story is excellent. You begin as Gordon Freeman, a scientist in a secret laboratory complex called Black Mesa. The suspense builds as you make your way to the test labs and then, once there, it all goes horribly wrong. Your world is thrown upside down. Black Mesa has suffered a catastrophic system failure. Your friends and colleagues are dead or dying. It seems you are trapped far underground. But worse is yet to come.\n\nCombat is good and fun seeing enemies gibbed by your explosives. There is a lot to explore. The facility is vast, although not every door can be opened. Music is good and fits into the location of Black Mesa and the level you are on. Enemies are varied and vary in ability. Each section/level has its own theme and look, along with its own challenges.\n\nHalf-Life was helped back in the day by the hundreds of mods that gamers made, enhancing and extending the Black Mesa complex. With them, the game seemed to last forever, which is no bad thing.\nThe game comes with multiplayer and I must say was an absolute delight to be involved in. I spent many hours with my friends competing and having much fun in the process. I actually became rather good at it, if I do say so myself.\n\nAfter over 15 years the graphics obviously shows its age but in all honesty, who cares? I don't. It's actually one of the reasons I love the game and have such fond memories of it. Most of the character models look and sound the same, so making out who is who is almost impossible, which shows in the sequel.\n\nThere may be Half-Life II and Black Mesa, which are graphically superior but if not already done so, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you play this game. You shall not be disappointed.\n\n10/10 (for its time)\n","timestamp_created":1447433588,"timestamp_updated":1447433588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602019548416137695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19051567","author":{"steamid":"76561198256070646","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1033,"last_played":1459745477},"language":"english","review":"For a 17 year old game (at this time) it still remains a fun and enjoyable adventure, when you play the game you will notice sort of phases of \"I have so much ammo and health\" to points in which you will scream about not having enough and having to rely on vending machines to restore health (yes you can do that). The story plays rather well however it is not as intense as the sequel in which the sequel is 11 years old (at this time).

Second and final flaw, a few bugs that need fixing. But overall the game is solid and is a fantastic title that defines \"old school\". I would definetly recommend this game to anyone who plays first person shooters or loves classic games. Also Gabe Newell, I would try and see if Gordon could try and travel back in time and prevent the disaster at black mesa. It would be an option that i think would be great in Half Life 3.

The graphics will look dated to some, and the sound can be unbearable to others, but the story and the way the environment is layed out makes you realize how much work went into this (It must have been amazing to play this in 1998).\n\nThe game is the classic shooter experience where you grind through waves of enemies, sometimes fighting a boss or one of the huge mobs that appear from time to time. The game is very hard, even at the lower difficulties (much harder than HL2) and is a good challenge for fans of old-school FPS classics such as Doom and Quake.\n\nI recommend any game from the Half-Life series because of the effort that went into making these games.
