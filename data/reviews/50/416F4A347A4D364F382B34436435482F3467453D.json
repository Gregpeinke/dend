The game features the character Adrian Shepherd, a HECU Corporal, trapped in the Facilty and has to fight his way through the Facility and also defeat the mysterious Race X with a whole bunch of new weapons!\n\nThe gameplay is just as solid as the original with the exception of new levels, creatures, and more imporantly new weapons and oh boy the weapons are pretty solid. Each new weapon provides a new way to shoot down the imposing foes as well as some new ways to complete puzzles such as a barnacle to latch on to other surfaces and much much more! If there is a few gripe I could make it would the Nightvision feature that isn't really helpful from its ugly green glow and the annoying difficultly curve near the end where you pretty much have to use the new weapons to defeat them quickly before the defeat you.\n\nOverall, Opposing Force gave us of what the original Half Life did but with brand new features that make the game a new experience all together! But again the only bad things is the late game difficulty and of course the game's age as a FPS, however, I still enjoyed my time playing at a HECU.\n\nAnd then Adrian Shepherd was never heard from again.","timestamp_created":1576424801,"timestamp_updated":1576424801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.664875984191894531","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59898536","author":{"steamid":"76561198127189504","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1576412870},"language":"russian","review":"oxyet","timestamp_created":1576411796,"timestamp_updated":1576411796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59893942","author":{"steamid":"76561198202122947","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1588849179},"language":"english","review":"Hella Fun to play I mowed down so many Black Ops DAMN YOU ALL BLACK OPS","timestamp_created":1576406152,"timestamp_updated":1576406152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59892603","author":{"steamid":"76561198838202874","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":218873,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194134,"last_played":1645646847},"language":"russian","review":"Mainly for those who love the old school","timestamp_created":1576404406,"timestamp_updated":1635694071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59889859","author":{"steamid":"76561199003230512","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3889,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3227,"last_played":1576734760},"language":"english","review":"I mean it ok not good ok","timestamp_created":1576400612,"timestamp_updated":1576400612,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.406932950019836426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59886562","author":{"steamid":"76561198415539324","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5876,"last_played":1652052568},"language":"english","review":"Low space, runs on anything, and has a greater weapon variety than HL1.

Заранее давайте познакомимся с главным героем этого дополнения. Зовут его Адриан Шепард, 22 года, так же как и Гордон молчалив как рыба, и по званию капрал. Да все верно! В Opposing Force мы будем играть за бывалого военного, которому дано только одна цель - зачистить комплекс \"Black Mes\" от свидетелей и от надвигающейся орды пришельцев. План по зачистке уже с самого начала пошла не по плану. Не успели военные долететь до комплекса, как пришельцы быстро сбивают надвигающейся вертолёты, и вертолёт в котором сидел Шепард исключением не стал. \n\nЧерез некоторое время Шепард приходит в себя, и видит, как сослуживцев без пощады кромсают пачками, а ему ничего не остаётся кроме как снова потерять сознание. Проходить ещё какое-то время, и Шепард вновь приходит себя, однако уже в самом комплексе, и в окружении учёных. Нетрудно заметить, что учёные, несмотря на то, что они должны бояться военных наоборот стараются помочь им тем, чем смогут. Немного побродив по комнате, Шепард находит свой бронежилет и шлем с ночным видением, надев их, появляется стандартный интерфейс игры.\n\nДействия в Opposing Force происходят где-то в середине приключений Гордона Фримена. Немного побродив по комплексу, Шепард сумел воссоединиться с главными силами военных, и те дают приказ немедленно отступать, и прекратить всяческие попытки ликвидировать Фримена. Напоследок радист сообщает, что уцелевшие должны дать координаты последних воздушных атак, и после этого уходить восвояси. Казалось бы ура, игра окончена! Ага, хуй там! Прям в момент эвакуации, ворота внезапно стали закрываться, не давая возможности эвакуироваться. Виновником этого стал G-man, который показав снова свой похуистичный взгляд уходит прочь. После таких палок в колёса Шепарду ничего не остаётся, кроме как самому выбраться из комплекса.\n\nВ плане подачи сюжета ничего не поменялось. Opposing Force как и оригинальная Half-Life рассказывает сюжет подаётся в виде окружения, фразами неписей, и действиями Шепарда. Единственное чем дополнение отличается от оригинала - содержание. Сюжет в дополнении одновременно сочетает юмор и серьёзность. Взять хотя бы тренировочный лагерь в уровне подготовки, где к Шепарду польностью относятся как к ничтожеству. Или же достаточно вспомнить полноватого охранника, который невзначай скажет что в молодости он был худым.\n\nСам же Адриан Шепард как главный герой куда правдоподобен чем Фримен. Ведь если Шепард в плане боевой подготовки не вызывает никаких вопросов, то как 27 летний учёный, ни разу не служивший в армии умеет в совершенстве владеть всеми видами оружия игра никак не раскрывала. \n\nГОДЫ ТРЕНИРОВОК БЫЛИ НЕ ЗРЯ...\n\nВ сравнение с оригинальной Half-Life, Opposing Force не миксует несколько жанров сразу, однако это не значит, что дополнение от этого стала хуже. Opposing Force по большей мере является шутером, а количество головоломок сведено к минимуму. Зато арсенал оружия серьёзно расширился. Помимо старых пушек, в Opposing Force завезли ещё больше оружия. Шепард в отличие от Фримена может вооружиться следующими орудиями:\n1)Снайперской винтовкой, позволяющая делать хедшоты издалека;\n2) Пулемётом, который несмотря на свою высокую отдачу способен превратить в фарш даже самых крупных существ;\n3) Инопланетной плазменной винтовкой, истинную мощь которой я к сожалению познал лишь под конец игры;\n4) Что? Говорите что это такой себе ассортимент? А КАК НАСЧЁТ ЕБАНОЙ ПОРТАЛЬНОЙ ПУШКИ?! Я не шучу! Достаточно одного выстрела, и даже крупный гад разлетится на кусочки. \n\nВпрочем в Opposing Force добавились новые типы врагов. Огромный наверное таракан, который без каких-либо усилий расплющит Шепарда. Пришелец с тараканом в виде оружия, который после смерти попробует застать врасплох собственным же оружием. И, что внезапно, в качестве людских противников выступит то ли спецназ в чёрном, то ли специальные агенты, которые также как и военные не только очищают комплекс от инопланетной швали, но и от свидетелей. \n\nИсходя из всего написанного Half-Life: Opposing Force стоящее дополнение. Дополнение не только предлагает посмотреть на происходящее другими глазами, но и не боится время от времени быть несерьёзной. Прибавьте к этому ещё расширенныей арсенал оружия и бестиария, то данный аддон можно смело считать лучшим для первой Half-Life.\n","timestamp_created":1576155516,"timestamp_updated":1576155516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.711214423179626465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59696309","author":{"steamid":"76561198049269068","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1227,"last_played":1587521312},"language":"english","review":"Classic game.

For a product made by an entirely different studio, it was still a great experience, although obviously not on par with the original's groundbreaking journey. There are times where it will feel like the four hours it takes to beat the game is wearing thin, but this is usually not the case, as most of the time you will have an action-packed adventure pushing you to forward and excited to see more of what it has to offer. Some battles feel uninspired or ridiculous in the sense that it pits you against multiple incredibly difficult enemies at a time in an attempt to escape the responsibility of creating actually quality fights, but there are more fun battles than not, so it isn't a major issue. A great addition that helps the game feel fresh is the addition of many new enemies, weapons, and character skins. When there are a limited variety of skins for the various non-playable characters you meet, the immersion can kind of be broken, but [i]Half-Life: Opposing Force[/i] makes sure to add plenty into the mix to avoid that.\n\nThe gameplay here is just as great as the original, it feels like an additional side story to the pre-existing game, but with fun, creative changes in certain functions of the world that make for more dynamic gameplay, even if some feel more like gimmicks added just to say they added something new. Nonetheless, this does add a lot to keep it fresh for the few hour run it demands from you, although I found myself playing for about thirty minutes to an hour at most at a time until completing it instead of long stretches of gameplay like for the original, which in comparison would have me glued to the computer for hours just enthralled with what I was playing. This is one of the main differences in quality that puts [i]Half-Life: Opposing Force[/i] those couple of levels below the original, the replayability here feels much more slim, so there is no doubt I'm more likely to go back and play through [i]Half-Life[/i] again rather than this expansion pack. This is not to knock the overall experience, just to put a wedge between them quality-wise. \n\nWith all that said, [i]Half-Life: Opposing Force[/i] is still an excellent experience. Many of the fantastic gameplay mechanics that made the original so great are still here, and you can tell the developers tried their best to live up to [i]Valve's[/i] original masterpiece, and the love present here is felt, even if it doesn't hit that almost unreachable mark [i]Half-Life[/i] set. If you are a [i]Half-Life[/i] fan, this is an expansion pack you can't go wrong with, as it pumps a breath of fresh air back into the critically acclaimed series and takes a different approach and gives a alternate perspective on the events at Black Mesa.\n\n[b][RATING: 7.9/10][/b]","timestamp_created":1576122037,"timestamp_updated":1624158075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50205761194229126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59691562","author":{"steamid":"76561198293069552","num_games_owned":414,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1575526306},"language":"english","review":"I love the game, and i love the characters Including the main character Adrian Shephard, i just wish there was more games about him for all we know he is still in stasis doing Nothing at all","timestamp_created":1576117453,"timestamp_updated":1576117453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59684424","author":{"steamid":"76561197963156312","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1966,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1629,"last_played":1654027539},"language":"english","review":"is gud","timestamp_created":1576104405,"timestamp_updated":1576104405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59671423","author":{"steamid":"76561198122576597","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":328,"last_played":1609871651},"language":"english","review":"Pretty fun\n","timestamp_created":1576086000,"timestamp_updated":1576086000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59671360","author":{"steamid":"76561198940882651","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1569510756},"language":"russian","review":"Единственная халва которую я прошел\nСама мне понравилась как группа КАЗЕННЫЙ УНИТАЗ\nНо под конец настопиздело и я включил no target и no clip","timestamp_created":1576085922,"timestamp_updated":1576085922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59659964","author":{"steamid":"76561197995276300","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":452,"last_played":1575898715},"language":"english","review":"It's a classic.

However this being 1999 the AI wasn't quite there yet and you'll notice their pathfinding is terrible and they can't hold their own in a firefight, often wandering straight into the line of fire.","timestamp_created":1575885967,"timestamp_updated":1575885967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59546300","author":{"steamid":"76561198072798913","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":236,"last_played":1576099232},"language":"finnish","review":"good shit","timestamp_created":1575881747,"timestamp_updated":1575881747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59545862","author":{"steamid":"76561198368099358","num_games_owned":728,"num_reviews":173,"playtime_forever":248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":248,"last_played":1575879742},"language":"english","review":"[h1] Half Life: Opposing Force [/h1] \n\n[b] A Worthy Expansion To A Classic FPS [/b]\n\n[b] Half Life: Opposing Force [/b] does what many expansion packs fail to do - it provides meaningful and fun content that actually \"expands\" and pushes forward the original game's experience. By taking control of Andrew Shepard, a member of the military group sent in to kill Gordan Freeman, you get to see the game's original story from a different angle. The level design is improved, the arsenal of weaponry is refined and expanded, and there are new enemies to fight along the way, culminating in a successful expansion of the Half-Life formula!\n\nThe levels in [b] Half Life: Opposing Force [/b] provide new sections of the Black Mesa research facility to play through. These areas include new tram levels, sewer levels, and even more encounters with the Pit Monster from the original title.  The jumps and landscape are smoothed a bit better, leading to less instances of falling to your death or getting caught on the environment and staying stuck (although it still happened multiple times). While buggy, the levels look interesting, and play just as well as the original titles.\n\nThere are also new additions to Shepard's arsenal, such as an LMG, Transporter gun, Electric Shock Rifle, Heavy Pistol, and a grappling hook. This adds new ways to approach combat, as well as get around the environment, something that still occurred in the base game but at a much less frequent rate. Enemies also pack these weapons as well, so the ability to take and deal a lot of damage is enticing.\n\nLastly, new enemy types are introduced. All seem to be dangerous, ranging from Shock Troopers to Voltigores, to even an encounter with a helicopter like in the base game. These enemies introduce a new level of difficulty to the title, and cause the player to have to approach each section with care and awareness. I did feel that some sections of the game where multiple Voltigores would spawn were a too difficult, but I have to give Gearbox credit for adding something different to the Half-Life experience.\n\nAll in all, this was a fun expansion to play through, and I [b] Recommend [/b] it to any fans of the original game or FPS games in general. There was enough new content, enemies, and locations to run through, despite it still being a retelling of the base game from a different perspective a la [b] Half Life: Blue Shift [/b]. Unlike that expansion, [b] Half Life: Opposing Force [/b] serves as a fun change of pace for the original game, which is good enough for myself!\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 (Great) [/h2]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my curator page for my thoughts on a variety of other games!\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/37542043-ADHD-Reviews/","timestamp_created":1575880695,"timestamp_updated":1609317725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59541405","author":{"steamid":"76561197996723021","num_games_owned":853,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1579514895},"language":"english","review":"i never forget first i played it.\nStill loving it\nForget about Freeman !","timestamp_created":1575870726,"timestamp_updated":1575870726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59537473","author":{"steamid":"76561198160428350","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1576190371},"language":"turkish","review":".","timestamp_created":1575862968,"timestamp_updated":1575862968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59520037","author":{"steamid":"76561197990411723","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":286,"last_played":1586701213},"language":"english","review":"Damn this game is AWESOME!","timestamp_created":1575836301,"timestamp_updated":1575836301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59504919","author":{"steamid":"76561198219304111","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":454,"last_played":1587387538},"language":"english","review":"poop","timestamp_created":1575820621,"timestamp_updated":1575820621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zM6O8+4Cd5H/4gE="}
