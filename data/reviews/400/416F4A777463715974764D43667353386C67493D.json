Los gráficos, música, jugabilidad y dificultad están en su punto. Sin embargo, destaco más la ambientación, que consigue exitosamente dar una sensación de soledad y aislamiento, pero al mismo tiempo sentirse vigilado.

Portal pushes that formula to an extreme, removing the enemies entirely in favor of physics and momentum based puzzles. It serves as soft-prequel to the Half-Life series taking place in the facility of Black Mesa's biggest competitor, Aperture Science. Where Black Mesa failed at their teleportation experiments, Aperture seems to have perfected it, localizing their portal tech to the size of a handheld gun. The portal gun is an absolute blast to play with, and Valve seems to know this since they built a game centered around the mechanic. Though short, the campaign is tight from start to finish. There's some well written humor here and you'll love the antagonist, GlaDOS. It's an instant classic and exemplifies Valve when they were at their peak.","timestamp_created":1595269463,"timestamp_updated":1595269463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73013005","author":{"steamid":"76561198276377043","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":1089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":309,"last_played":1637023405},"language":"english","review":"yummmmmy cake","timestamp_created":1595269256,"timestamp_updated":1595269256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73012220","author":{"steamid":"76561199040593847","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1412,"last_played":1587075596},"language":"english","review":"Came back to play this again after ten years and it still blows my mind.\n\nI've never wanted to cry so hard during the credits of a game. \n\nNext game?
