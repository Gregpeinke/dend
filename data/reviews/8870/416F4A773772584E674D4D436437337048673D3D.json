Not to belittle the game it's most definetely one of the top First Person Shooters on the market today. Now the story, though filled with plot holes, is something else. The story starts off very slow because they throw you in this random universe and in the middle of a story; I was left what the hell was going on for a good quarter of the game till I assumed it'll all be explained as i go or in the end and for the most part it was.

You are a part of the story, trying to find out as much about the character you play as well as solving the mystery of Columbia.  It is one of the best integrated story experiences I've ever experienced.  And the ending will make you think... about everything you did on the way to the ending...\n\nGRAPHICS: About 50 artists under strong artistic vision control produced one of the most viscerally real and coherent environments ever accomplished in an FPS.  It's eye-candy; it's a visual treat that will have you stop and admire the lush detail, well-themed work with respect and awe.  Epic updated the Unreal engine to make it push new limits.\n\nAUDIO: Compelling ambient effects and environmental effects, good voice acting and tremendous period soundtrack.  I laughed the first time I heard \"Girls just want to have fun\" on a 1912 circus piano, but it turns out that was a subtle part of the plot (quantum timelines) - won't spoil it, play the game.  Only complaint is that 360 audio tunes out key dialogue if you turn away from the person, rather than on distance.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Smooth, intuitive, well laid out, logical, no complaints.  NPC integration of Elizabeth makes her actually useful in combat as a support role.  Boss battles are balanced and sensical; but difficulty of Hard is actually Hard in this game.\n\nThe game felt short; it could have been longer, but you still end the game fulfilled.

Такая игра захватывает и не отпускает до самого конца. Конец оригинальной игры вызвал бурю эмоций и поставил огромую кучу вопросов относительно того, что произошло дальше. Я никогда не думал, что в играх (а тем более шутерах) может быть такой закрученный сюжет, ведь даже не всякий фильм может похвастаться такой заворажающей историей. Игра рассчитана на довольно умного игрока, не в вмысле уровня игры, а в вмысле понимания сути сюжета. Кто-то может пройти и не понять, что хотели сказать разработчики. Можно пройти много игр, но такая игра как Bioshock Infinite запомниться на долго. Это одна из тех игр, которые могут проходиться несколько раз, и каждый раз это вызывает сильные чувства.\nСейчас я подведу итоги того, что мне понравилось, а что нет:\n-Сюжет [10/10] (думаю тут объяснять нечего)\n-Графика[9/10] (графика радует глаз, но некоторые моменты мне лично не понравились, а именно дождь (он выглядит по мне не очень). Но может я просто придираюсь)\n-Дизаин уровней [9/10] (построение их мне понравилось, но при первом прохождении я иногда просто не понимал куда идти. А так всё отлично)\n-Озвучка[10/10] (отличная озвучка от професиальных актёров, очень понравилось. Кто-то скажет \"а вот русской озвучки нет\", но русская озвучка по-моему испортила бы ощущение от игры)\n-NPC[9/10] (на удивление разработчики не обманули - NPC действительно очень умные. И это относиться в первую очередь к Элизабет - я нигде не видел, чтобы напарник бежал перед тобой (и это относиться не только к скриптовым сценам, а вообще). Враги тоже довольно хорошие: не тупые, но не читерски точные , вообще разработчики нашли \"золотую середину\". Из минусов разве что их колличество под конец игры, но это как говориться кому как - меня это лично немного напрягало)\n-Из минусов я могу отметить разве что: отсуствие мультиплеера (но отличный сюжет окупает этот недостаток), и довольно таки большой вес: мой биошок со всеми длц на данный момент весит ~30 гб, но людей с быстрым интернетом это не дожно особо волновать.\nЯ рекомендую эту игру всем, кто хочет получить удовольствие от прохождения хорошей игры, и через долгий промежуток времени вспоминать об этом, как о отлично проведённом времени.","timestamp_created":1387298676,"timestamp_updated":1387298676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8080990","author":{"steamid":"76561198058895975","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1247,"last_played":1486844937},"language":"russian","review":"blowmybrain","timestamp_created":1387298225,"timestamp_updated":1387298225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8080343","author":{"steamid":"76561198079900875","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":701,"last_played":1396529764},"language":"russian","review":"не могу не порекомендовать:)","timestamp_created":1387294732,"timestamp_updated":1387294732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552285552024841309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7rXNgMMCd73pHg=="}
