Yo hacia tiempo que habia terminado el bioshock infinite para xbox 360. Y como me gusto tanto y termino siendo el mejor de los 3 para mi no me intereso jugar los dlc. Pero ahora que se que estaban en oferta los compre junto con el juego original. Y nunca me he sentido tan satisfecho, de terminar una saga. \n\nEl juego principal es mas lineal que los anteriores, no se basa tanto en explorar sino en ir cumpliendo las misiones a medida que avanzas para adelante en la historia, en este juego no encontraras big dadys o little sisters para cosechar adam y mejorar los plasmidos, ni tampoco finales alternativos. Pero si algo que esta relacionado con los 2 primeros bioshock. Y grandiosamente ejecutado si te gustan mucho las muy buenas historias en los videojuegos. Es muy fundamental si, conseguir todo el dinero posible para mejorar las armas y comprar suministros, Su accion es frenetica pero muy emocionante y visceral si sabes usar bien los plasmidos y las armas. Los DLC son otra cosa porque cambian radicalmente la jugabilidad. Pasa a ser de supervivencia tirando a sigilo. Asi que ahi si vas a necesitar de mucha habilidad para superar los enemigos. Es mas cercano a la mecanica original de los primeros. Pero en verdad es una experiencia maravillosa y sumamente alucinante.\n\nLa historia me hizo volar la imaginacion. Es de esas historias que solo las encontras en peliculas como las de David Fisher, Criss Nolan, y Darren Aranovfky. Muy retorcida, profunda, dramatica, que hara de tu mente un rompecabezas. Algo sumamente magistral, y nunca antes visto en un videojuego. Si sos feminista o progresista, no te tomes en serio la narrativa. Porque como esta ambientada en los años 10 y 50 te va a mostrar como era la sociedad en ese entonces. Racista, machista, conservadora etc. Pero este juego muestra una critica hacia esa sociedad. Asi que si algo te parece ofensivo sabe que en esa epoca la gente era asi. Retrograda.\n\nEl apartado artistico me parecio de los mas bellos y hermosos de la pasada generacion. Un grandioso esplendor de estilo art nuvo, y art deco retrofuturista, Me encanto todo, Los enemigos, los escenarios, todo. Una delicia para los ojos a cada instante. \n\nEl sonido me parecio exquisito tambien. Increible como han podido en un videojuego de accion usar instrumentos clasicos de ambientacion. Es sumamente admirable en los momentos de mayor tiroteo. Nunca vi nada igual desde Rule of rose.\n\nSi los primeros bioshock te gustaron, Este ultimo y los 2 dlc te van a encantar. Tu cita obligada si son fan de la serie.\nNO SE LO PIERDAN!!!!!","timestamp_created":1558920754,"timestamp_updated":1632091223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50876071","author":{"steamid":"76561198038485910","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":596,"last_played":1590086722},"language":"english","review":"The divine story, the same graphics.

Not the power aspect shoved in because Bioshock had it, but the rail system. Being able to jump from rail to rail at high speeds while jumping down on the enemy below to shoot them is simply fun. It makes the otherwise boring cover shooter mechanics more fun when you can jump and fly across the shooting gallery. \n\tWhat I don’t like is the story. While the racist flying city of Columbia is a neat backdrop for the game, even if it doesn’t make too much sense, the whole time space aspect of the story just feels like a contrived way to connect Bioshock 1 into Infinite. Near the end, it moves from an irritating aspect of the story to a complete disaster as the ending makes absolutely no sense. The characters can be quite irritating too, to the point where you can’t really root for anyone because they are all a bunch of selfish assholes, include the main characters. \n\tWhile the combat can be fun, it isn’t enough to support the terrible story and characters, especially when half or less of the game makes use of the rail system, the other half just continues as a regular cover shooter. I can’t recommend a game with this many flaws when there isn’t much worth seeing behind said flaws.","timestamp_created":1558790646,"timestamp_updated":1558790646,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527294933795928955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50830634","author":{"steamid":"76561198124132291","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1080,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":918,"last_played":1660485483},"language":"schinese","review":"很多FPS游戏，体验的是刷刷刷的跑路，获得装备的快感，但是这个游戏，在结局的落幕的那个瞬间，我感到了极度的空虚，仿佛代入了男主，对于伊丽莎白充满愧疚的爱。\n\n空虚过后慢慢回想了开局到结局的过程，这段冲往自由的过程就越来越显得珍贵，仿佛伊丽莎白就是个活生生的人，陪着我们度过了那短暂却充满艺术气息的奇妙冒险。","timestamp_created":1558785717,"timestamp_updated":1558785717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50828203","author":{"steamid":"76561198105530049","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1468159786},"language":"english","review":"The story was extremely good, even though I didn't play any other BioShock game before.

I've already mentioned the same problem in all the reviews to the previous games, but I guess that surprisingly, it makes sense for the devs to respawn the mobs each time a room had been cleared and looted by a player and see how they survive yet another fight with yet another batch of enemies spawned in the same room once again, while having only 5 rounds of bullets left and zero salts thanks to other same stupid respawns in the previous rooms.\n\nFortunately, in the main game, as well as in Episode 2, this is not the case.","timestamp_created":1558649237,"timestamp_updated":1558649294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50790677","author":{"steamid":"76561198195005837","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":2555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2395,"last_played":1559233112},"language":"brazilian","review":"Divertido,bonito e uma ótima história.O que mais você pode querer de um jogo que te faz rir e chorar?","timestamp_created":1558646136,"timestamp_updated":1558646136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50790050","author":{"steamid":"76561198863084327","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3129,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1595,"last_played":1645318570},"language":"spanish","review":"Hermosa banda sonora y wea xd","timestamp_created":1558643128,"timestamp_updated":1558643128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50789848","author":{"steamid":"76561197987296225","num_games_owned":1308,"num_reviews":120,"playtime_forever":2132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2132,"last_played":1395847249},"language":"russian","review":"Я рекомендую эту игру.","timestamp_created":1558642327,"timestamp_updated":1558642327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50789342","author":{"steamid":"76561198127521066","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":551,"last_played":1593178499},"language":"english","review":"Honestly this game is basically perfection.

En jugabilidad es muy divertido, no es muy difícil si juegas a dificultad normal pero la cosa cambia al aumentarla. A veces puede llegar a cansar el estar todo el tiempo con el objetivo de disparar usando esa combinación de poderes y armas de fuego, pero ahí es donde entra en juego el ámbito mas destacable de este videojuego que es su historia. La historia empieza lenta, contándole al jugador como van las cosas pero muy despacio, lo que hace que al principio pueda parecer aburrido, pero que después te engancha mas y mas. Los personajes, aunque pocos, son brutales, y están muy bien diseñados, tanto en lo narrativo, lo gráfico e incluso hablando de doblajes, los cuales son bastante buenos. El transcurso de la historia es super entretenido y todo el tiempo te va a hacer pedirte jugar mas para saber que va a pasar después. ¿Y el final? Es una violada de cerebro brutal, es increíble. \nJuego recomendado para todos: 10/10","timestamp_created":1558400406,"timestamp_updated":1558400406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50744241","author":{"steamid":"76561198332152310","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1201,"last_played":1581630389},"language":"brazilian","review":"-Para quem esse jogo foi desenvolvido?\n( ) Espermatozóides\n( ) Crianças\n(x) Tudo e todos\n( ) Adolescentes\n( ) Adultos\n( ) Pessoas que conhecem a morte\n\n--Texturas, Gráficos, Lindeza?\n( ) Tela de iodo\n( ) 220 x 120p\n( ) Meia boca, tem piores\n( ) Dentro da média atual\n(x) Quase um The Witcher 3\n( ) The witcher 3\n( ) Isso veio de outra dimensão\n\n--Falhas\n( ) Isso é uma falha\n( ) Bug pra todo lado, tipo tiro em favela no Rio\n( ) Muita falha mas dá pra jogar\n( ) Bugs que são legais e não atrapalham\n(x) Sem falhas, nem nunca precisou de atualizações\n( ) Ese jogo saiu perfeito do forno\n\n--É difícil?\n( ) Basta assisitr o jogo\n( ) Zera com uma guitarra\n( ) Pega logo as manha, mas sempre normal\n( x ) Bem desafiador, as vezes difícil\n( ) Parece Dark Souls\n( ) Equiparável a Dark Souls\n( ) É necessário morrer (de verdade) pra zerar\n\n--Quanto tempo pra acabar Sapoha\n( ) Você acaba antes de sair do menu\n( ) Tempo necessário pra cantar Faroeste Caboclo\n(x) Tempo de jogo Dos jogos exclusivos da sony\n( ) Muito tempo, no minimo umas 40 horas\n( ) Skyrim da vida\n( ) Praticamente um MMORPG\n\n--Tem uma história?\n( ) Não, um Pubg da vida\n( ) tem história só pra não dizer que não tem\n( ) Dá pra gostar da história, se esforçando \n(x) Consegue te arrancar uma lágrima ou duas\n( ) Nivel The Last Of Us\n( ) Dava pra fazer um livro nivel Harry Potter\n( ) Deveria constar no curriculo do Ensino médio\n\n--Audio, músicas\n( ) Nivel do Funk Brasilero\n( ) Jogue mutado\n( ) Dá pra escutar\n(x) Os caras capricharam no áudio\n( ) Baixe a play list pra escutar no ônibus\n( ) Toque o tema no seu casamento\n\n--Trambolho necessário pra rodar\n( ) Nokia 1995\n( ) Windows 98 sem placa de video\n(x) Um PC decente, com uma gt 1030\n( ) Um PC já considerado gamer\n( ) Invista no minimo 4k em hardware\n( ) SLI de 1080ti\n( ) Esqueça, a tecnologia atual não dá conta","timestamp_created":1558400253,"timestamp_updated":1558400253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xJf56+oCcbvJwQE="}
