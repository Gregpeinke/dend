Character development, continuing the story arc, and psychological hurdles are all present, as you would expect, given the first Portal game. I must say it was every bit exilharating playing through it on the PC the second time as it was on the PS3.\n\nDLC: (kindof spoilerish) Secondly, the Portal 2 Testing Initiative for the PC version of the game is one of the greatest inventions of modern gaming. Countless thousands of intricate, confounding puzzles that you can download and play through - all created by users like you - are available in the 'Community' section for the game on the Steam platform. The tool is so in-depth that many of the unique puzzles I have played through have had traps that caught me completely off-guard, which subsequently left me fearing for my life even though real me wasn't in any real danger - and I loved it.\n\nMultiplayer: This aspect of the game is, in my opinion, less fulfilling. There is not a story, really, you have to work with your friend to solve the puzzles. There's not much more to it than that. That's not to say the multiplayer is not fun, though! My brother and I spent hours playing together solving them as a team, hitting each other and whatnot as siblings do.

Probably my favorite game since the original Unreal Tournament 15 years ago.  I'm giving it the nod over the first Mafia because it does NOT contain a profanity-inducing car race.\n\nThere is practically nothing about this game that doesn't work.  The characters are impeccably written and adeptly acted.  The puzzles are challenging but rarely frustrating, and as such very rewarding when you finish them.  It's stable as a rock and oozes style and polish.\n\nAnd it's a hilarious game to boot.  Those \"crap\" turrets made me laugh harder than I have in several years.  Seriously, I was dying.\n\nHaven't tried co-op (yet) but I have no doubt it will be just as swoon-worthy as the single-player campaign.  So get it already!\n\nUPDATE: I did play co-op and loved it.  Word of advice: if you're playing co-op for the first time, make sure the person you're playing with is also playing it for the first time. Otherwise you'll get constantly nagged and prodded and told where to go.  It works better when you both figure out the levels together.\n\nUPDATE #2: It looks like this will be the review I always revise to get Steam Awards XP points. But hey, it's Portal 2! It's still awesome. Go get it.\n\nUPDATE #3: Time for some more XP. If I'm updating this, the game is probably on sale now.

It saved where I was falling over and over again so I just went back and loaded the autosave. Also coop is a great expierence to have with your friends.
