Bu oyun hikaye konusunda benden 10/10 aldı. karakterlerin bu kadar cana yakın olması insanı oyuna çok bağlıyor içinde gibi hissettiriyor. Oyun bitince yaşadığım boşluğu galiba en son Cod'daki Ghost ölünce yaşamıştım.  10/10 would buy again and again and again.

First of I would like to say that the basic mechanics are very good and are interesting because they have not really been explored before in any game. I will break this review down into several parts but it will not be too long.\n\nStory- you may think a puzzle game like this may not have a good story but its better than good. Its easy to understand but has enough twists and turns to make this story engaging and interesting. It is also full of jokes that are quite subtle and some not so subtle. My favourite character was wheatly (played by steven merchant) as he was funny and kind of adorable in parts. But Glad0s was also halarious and intreging as she occasionally gives you clues about your parents.\n\nGameplay- It gives you very little to play with at the outset but as the game pushes forward it gets a lot harder and gives you more means to complete the chambers. It gives you a new mechanic, lets you master it and then introduces you to more and this repeats throughout the game to keep portal from getting stale.\n\nGraphics- Runs on the source engine (sorry if I am wrong) which is what most if not all of valves games use. The graphics are very simple but timeless as the is never much colour in most of the game in this bleak, torn apart testing facility. Portal 2 will run on most computers and runs on my laptop which runs games like complete crap.\n\nExtra- There is little to no lore in the portal universe at the moment but they still hav loads of good easter eggs like singing turrets and the lab rat location which are really eerie and creepy. I love the music for portal and have bought the soundtrack for portal and portal 2. This is my favourite valve game along with left 4 dead 2 and I would recomend it to pretty much anyone.

I love everything Valve, and so my review might be a little biased. But I don't think that really matters when everyone thinks the same about this puzzle solving game.\n\nFirst, let's talk graphics. I've tried out the original Portal demo before ever playing Portal 2, and when I saw the graphics in Portal 2 I was honestly stunned. It looked amazing for it's time and it still holds up pretty well today, considering the fact that it was made 4 years ago, in 2011. While it may not look as good as most titles from the years between the game's release and now, I believe that the graphics has done it's job perfectly. It creates an atmosphere that almost makes you feel like you're there, trapped within the Aperture Laboratories with the rogue A.I. GLaDOS as you solve puzzles to try and escape the facility.\n\nNow we move on to gameplay. If you've played the original Portal, then this would feel similar, but different. Valve has made many tweaks to the movement and the portal mechanics. An example of this is the fact that portals no longer actually travel, they just appear when you shoot them instead of flying through the air like in the original. This prevents you from shooting a portal in a portal like the original. The gel mechanic added quite a bit to Portal 2. It gave the players a way to alter your usual movement in the form of 3 gels: Repulsion Gel, that is blue in color and allows you to bounce on it to reach higher elevations; Propulsion Gel, that is orange in color and speeds you up when running across the gel; and Conversion Gel, which is white in color and allows you to place a Portal on any surface that the gel covers. These 3 gels add variety to the game, without completely straying away from the fact that it's mainly about the portals.\n\nThe sound. The sound design in this game is superb. It adds to the atmosphere that the graphics visually create, without being too over the top. All the ambient noises you hear while walking through the ruined facility, the dripping water, falling rocks... it all feels like it's actually there. The music is amazing too. It perfectly fits the puzzles you are solving and are nice to listen to when thinking. It's so good that I listen to it in my spare time (or maybe I just love Soundtrack.)\n\nNow to the final part, the story. The story, that was nearly non-existant in the first game, became a huge narrative with a ton of lore of its own; and as Valve has shown, time and time again, that they are excellent at crafting lore. Every character got a backstory, be it with the dialogue, the secrets in the game or even the comic that Valve released. It became a great story that matched the puzzle game mechanics of equal proportions. The characters that Valve had created were so rich in personality, I couldn't help but play the game again and again just to see those characters again.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys atmospheric environments, puzzle solving, and lore.\nIf I had to give a final verdict, it would be none other than a 10/10. \nI have no problems with this game, and yes, this is my opinion, if you don't like it, then sure, that's your opinion. \nAnd I respect that.","timestamp_created":1451337510,"timestamp_updated":1451337510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20046326","author":{"steamid":"76561198262377107","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1451335514},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1451337290,"timestamp_updated":1451337290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20046106","author":{"steamid":"76561198035689393","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1435202856},"language":"english","review":"Riduculously funny","timestamp_created":1451336803,"timestamp_updated":1451336803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20045986","author":{"steamid":"76561198127452661","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":366,"last_played":1451394736},"language":"tchinese","review":"GOOD 劇情還滿讓我想不太到的哈哈，沒玩過1代，這次買了合集包，2代通關之後會在去玩1代的","timestamp_created":1451336617,"timestamp_updated":1451336617,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20045711","author":{"steamid":"76561198144061035","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1626012144},"language":"turkish","review":"Bir tane sohpeti iyi bir arkadaşınız varsa alınabilicek en iyi oyun çok zevkle bitirdik :))","timestamp_created":1451336080,"timestamp_updated":1451336080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20045655","author":{"steamid":"76561198140110433","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1943,"last_played":1583934984},"language":"english","review":"One of the best puzzle games I've played so far.\n\nStory: Not bad.\nCharacters: damn awesome.
