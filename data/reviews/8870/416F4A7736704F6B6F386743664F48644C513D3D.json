(Ich werde BioShock trotzdem noch eine Chance geben, nur möchte ich mich voll darauf einlassen können). Diesen fatalen Fehler wollte ich beim dritten Teil nicht machen, daher gab es ein von mir selbst ausgehangenes Verbot für andere Spiele in dieser Zeit (so würde ich es auch jedem empfehlen, welcher nicht vor hat das Ding in einem Rutsch durch zu spielen). Trotz einer recht beachtlichen Laufzeit von 10 bis 13 Stunden ging \"BioShock Infinite\" wie im Flug vorbei, weil man es wirklich wie in Trance erlebt. \"Erlebt\" ist wohl das richtige Wort dafür, denn dieses Spiel ist ein wahrhaft atemberaubendes Erlebnis, von Anfang bis Ende. Die geniale Story lässt einen Twist auf den Nächsten und eine denkwürdige Szene auf die Nächste folgen. Die Level Größe war für mich genau richtig, denn man kann sich hier weder verlaufen (der Pfeil hat geholfen), noch das Gefühl von Linearität bekommen. Das Design der Stadt Columbia ist schlichtweg wunderschön und detailverliebt, obwohl leider hin und wieder Klone auftauchen, doch diese fallen in den rasanten und actionreichen Gefechten selten auf. Dabei hat man eine überschaubare Anzahl an Waffen zur Auswahl, welche in Verbindung mit den immer wichtiger werdenden Plasmiden gut funktionieren. Das Spiel mit verschiedenen Features, wie den Luftschienen hat gute Unterhaltung und Kurzweil zur Folge. \nAbseits vom Bombast gelingt es dem Spiel mit kleinen Szenen und Stellen noch viel dichter und fesselnder zu sein. Fast jedes Ereignis bleibt bis kurz vor Schluss ein großes Rätsel. Wenn einem dann im letzten Drittel (und auch im sonstigen Verlauf) ein Twist nach dem nächsten durchs Gehirn peitscht, ist die Auflösung so genial, so unvorhersehbar und so unübertrefflich, dass ich das Gefühl hatte, es hier mit einer besten Geschichten (auch verglichen mit allen Filmen dieser Welt) aller Zeiten zu tun zu haben. Hier steckt das wahre Genie des Spiels (welches man wohl erst nach dem lesen von diversen Erklärungen und Nächten voller Überlegungen erkennt): Alles ist wirklich sinnvoll wie ein gigantisches Puzzle verbunden, um den Spieler dann in kompletter Fassungslosigkeit zurück zu lassen. Selten waren Charaktere so tiefgehend und so gut wie hier. Vor allem Elizabeth ist ein fantastischer Charakter, welcher sofort Interesse für ihre Hintergrundgeschichte weckt. Auch Fans der ersten beiden Teile werden mit reichlichen Referenzen und Zitaten bedient. Auch sonst werden reichliche Anspielungen auf Wissenschaftliche Theorien gemacht. Was das Verständnis all dieser angeht, so setzt „BioShock“ dieses voraus.\nBei einer solchen Story wird das gute Gameplay fast zur Nebensache. Wobei man auch sagen muss, dass man hier nicht besonders gefordert wird, wenn es um Skill geht. Die große Herausforderung ist es sich die vielen kleinen Story Details während der Shooter Einlagen zu merken. \nEinen Multiplayer hat man sich zum Glück verkniffen, Errungenschaften gibt`s dennoch.\nAlles in allem ist \"BioShock Infinite\" ein optisch opulenter, erwachsener Meilenstein (und ein Meisterwerk) was Erzählung, Spannung, Atmosphäre, Wendungen, Tiefgang und Charaktere angeht und bietet ein Finale welches mit so viel Fingerspitzengefühl inszeniert und erzählt wird, dass es seinesgleichen sucht. Welcher Banause heute noch meint Spiele währen Kulturgut zweiter Klasse, der wird seine Meinung durch dieses Meisterwerk ändern (müssen).","timestamp_created":1410275898,"timestamp_updated":1410278632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12034525","author":{"steamid":"76561198052353368","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":764,"last_played":1592493428},"language":"brazilian","review":"O game até que é legal de jogar, os gráficos são excelentes, a história é muito boa, as mecânica do jogo, os personagens enfim é uma excelente aquisição.

When I first entered the city in the sky, I was astonished by the deep, beautiful design and the love to detail that I encountered. The atmosphere of the roaring 20s and industrial progress was amazingly integrated and makes me as a lover of history smile even more. \nElizabeth is with no doubt one of the best sidekicks ever animated for gaming, with her unique character and beautiful model she is definitely able to stand next to Alyx Vance in the row for best sidekicks in gaming. \nBut now to the gameplay: The gameplay itself works fluently and offers a great experience with the vigors  which bring a great deal of variety with them, but there is not a lot the player does except shooting and killing. You do not have to think at all, just walk through corridors and shoot people, since you can always check where you have to go. \nAlso, Elizabeth is maybe a little bit too much of a help, since it is pretty hard to find a battle challenging when someone keeps throwing medicine and salts at someone, making you some kind of demigod. \nFazit: Bioshock Infinte is beautiful and astonishing in its great graphics and its unique, breathtaking design, but only offers a minimum variety in terms of gameplay.

As an exciting adventure with blazing gunfights this MAY suffice. Not on hard difficulty anyways...\n\nBioShock Infinite is peculiar in that it seems to hit the gaming equivalent of the uncanny valley. Its just shy of perfection and because of it all its flaws somehow become twisted deformities. Perhaps medium difficulty is all it takes to make this game perfect. If I can even stomach the thought of a second playthrough I may find out.\n\nDifficulty. Early on I thought it had managed the perfect sweet spot of challenge. Not quite beating me mercilessly for my mistakes, not quite allowing me to move unopposed. I could freely run and gun and I was quite enjoying, hard difficulty was doing what its supposed to. As the difficulty increases, the ability to enjoy a run-and-gun experience diminishes as dry humping walls and picking enemies off with headshots becomes the norm. Taking on multiple enemies simultaneously while exposed is almost futile with how quickly you can end up dead. I'm (HOPEFULLY) nearing the end of this calamity of a game and by this point i've resorted to abusing enemy AI as much as possible because some fights are just beyond doable without dying. The battle outside Comstock's house was so many levels of busted. Enemies that respawn virtually the second I kill them? An enemy that can in one hit take out shields and a significant chunk of health if i'm too close? Multiple enemies in a relatively small area ensuring staying there and surviving is nigh impossible? I camped quite a ways away, abusing the ability to endlessly recycle mesquitos to buy me time while I chipped away at the important enemy, who has enough health to survive your average nuclear warhead.\n\nThis is not the game design of something that has positive reviews thrown at it like its a story about Mother freakin' Theresa saving orphans from Nazis.\n\nPlot. Its great and all, but the plot has become the crux of what holds this game together for me, and why i'm still bothering to play to the end. There's that small sliver of naive hope in my head saying \"don't worry, they knew better at one point, things will get better!\" When i'm not enjoying the story I find myself thinking \"why am I doing this at all?\" I'll spin my scroll wheel quickly to watch the screen shake while running from place to place. I'll stop playing and just lay down because that's less boring (i'm not exaggerating). I enter combat with the literal thought \"not this crap again PLEASE\". I'm more excited by picking up another voxaphone than any new upgrade or secret stash of goodies. I might as well just a watch all the cutscenes on Youtube.\n\nCombat. BioShock Infinite started out as something that I wanted, an alternative to the cover-based combat that permeates most modern shooters and even some that I like and play. It was fast-paced and I rarely spent a moment in combat out of motion. Those were the moments where I needed to sit back, wait, and let my shields recharge. The melee enemies are in someways a brilliant addition despite their (general) ease to pick off because toss a couple in or have them flank and you'll enjoy getting bashed in the head. Being fluid and dictating combat instead of having it dictated for you was rewarded, and you're armed with vigors from lightning to crows to mad dash attacks to help keep things offensive rather than defensive. Skylines are a great thing, the mobility it offers leads to exciting possibilities as you jump like a madman on one enemy then turn to her buddy and fill his face with buckshot.\n\nBut, as its heart, BioShock Infinite was built with the current generation of FPS players in mind. Who totally need every micromanagement instruction this game has to offer lest they get bored because the game isn't condescending enough. Cover combat became the norm as enemies became tougher to deal with and you're guided every step of the way. Right down to being reminded to use vigors. It says something poor when a game has to remind you to use one of its central mechanics.\n\nThere's also a big problem of a lot of guns in BSI just being awful. I found the Vox weaponry as worthwhile as something out of Ride to Hell Retribution. It says something equally poor when I can compare any part of a game to Ride to Hell.\n\nSo, BioShock Infinite. Pick it up for $5 and give it a go. Don't bother with hard unless you're looking for a sleeping aid. I'm sure on medium it ends up being a great game, and that's fine, but I can do the same with a lot of games that are normally played passively with an emphasis on cover combat. I can play CoD4 on hardened where there isn't the artificial difficulty of veteran preventing me from running at heavily fortified houses quickly picking enemies off and clearing rooms with a shotgun, but there just isn't any challenge to be had.\n\nMy fingers are still crossed for the remote (see completely unlikely) possibility that medium manages to somehow fix the faults which cripple what could've been one of the best games ever made.","timestamp_created":1410235601,"timestamp_updated":1410235654,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493421077728271484","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12030903","author":{"steamid":"76561197968596822","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1607296216},"language":"english","review":"I have played all Bioshock games before this and I am super angry at this moment because I was about half way through this game when it corrupted my save files for no good reason.

While the characters that you meet in the game are quite well done, I found that the music was quite awesome. I am not a religious person but I did like that small break in the game where Booker and Elizabeth break into a very cool song. \nThe thing that I didn't like about the game was the final battle, that seemed to video gamey for such a mature story. And yes the story is what drives you forward, all the ambiguosness makes your want to find what the hell those two are talking about ( He doesn't row!) makes sense later.\nSome will say that the gunplay doesn't feel right or that the gameplay might be too easy, I may agree if I didn't just stick to he carbine and machine gun. Some will say that the lack of innovative weapons is a \"deal breaker\", not eveything has to be re-invented. I found that the weapons were just fine for killing everything I seen. The powers that you get are quite interesting and I never really used them as I prefered to get headshots and hold my ground near a corner, my style of playing really didn't warrant all the powers and skyhooks. I shoot and move, repeat. I still enjoyed it though and will play again using the powers and that crazy ass skyhook.\nGraphics are quite good and the sounds are also good, the music is what I enjoyed.

Infinite also makes an unnessisarily complex plot in an attempt for good story telling (just because you are confused at the ending doesn't mean it was a good story) honestly the excessive use of the multiverse just makes it more complex than needed.

Arquitetura dos edifícios, os afeitos sonoros, dublagem dos personagens, trilhas sonoras, tudo compôe um cenário que lhe absorve e faz você acreditar que está vivendo naquela Columbia inspirada nos Estados Unidos no início do século XX.\nO jogo tem um enredo ótimo, cheio de surpresas e sem barrigas, ou seja; é explicado até o ponto certo de ser instigante. Sem explicar demais, nem de menos, deixando margem para interpretações e para a imaginação do jogador fazer também sua parte.\nA Jogabilidade é muito fluída no PC (no console não joguei), sem nenhum problema nessa parte.\nAs únicas coisas que pecam e na dificuldade do jogo. Achei o modo normal um tanto \"easy\". E o fato do combate se tornar um pouco repetitivo com o tempo. Mas quando comecei a enjoar o jogo acabou, ou seja... Souberam a hora de fechar o \"parque\". Também senti falta de uma batalha final mais épica, talvez contra algum vilão mais expressivo e difícil de matar, mas talvez isso não fosse tão interessante para o enredo final do game.\nSó para concluir, é um jogo que recomendo fortemente. Visualmente lindo e divertido, a Elizabeth é cativante, a história é ótima e ambientação perfeita.","timestamp_created":1410019996,"timestamp_updated":1410020134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12000798","author":{"steamid":"76561198002624036","num_games_owned":701,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":391,"last_played":1410016090},"language":"italian","review":"Potete divertirvi, oppure potete giocare a Bioshock Infinite.\n\nNulla a che vedere con le atmosfere che hanno rese celebre Bioshock\nCombattimenti noiosi e difficoltà calcolata per chi, poverino, ha moncherini al posto delle mani\nPossibilità di usare i poteri in modo creativo non pervenuta\nLa varietà dei poteri è pari a quella delle canzoni di Ligabue\nIl tuo avatar è tenuto in vita forzatamente da una balia che ha poteri molto funzionali ad allungare la storia in modo pretestuoso... tipo Lost\n\nInsomma, considerando gli standard attuali è un buon gioco, e ha il pregio di avermi ricordato perché avessi smesso di videogiocare\n\nVoto: 5 (che significa che 5 euri li vale anche, ma di sicuro non più di 5 ore del vostro tempo)","timestamp_created":1410017488,"timestamp_updated":1410017488,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.433717727661132813","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12000751","author":{"steamid":"76561198134009269","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":545,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1578255968},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая графика!
