There's plenty of run and gun action interspersed with puzzles. Some of the puzzles though, feel more \"I, Spy\" than brain teasers. The level, \"Power Struggle\" almost can't be beat in two different areas unless you are super observant or you just happen to guess correctly--I say guess because the mechanics of the game aren't established so clearly in the beginning enough for a player to figure some moments out. \n\nSPOILER: one puzzle involving the use of a metal barrel to complete a circuit for a dynamite comes to mind--the gray metal barrel is surrounded by wooden crates so it's difficult to spot to begin with. \n\nSecondly, the dynamite on the metal door does not explode even if you shoot it with APC's, which is a problem because this logic puzzle relies on you understanding the game more than real logic. There's only one way to solve the puzzle, which is not intuitive because it's difficult to understand that the barrel could be used for anything. Another issue from an earlier level--a ladder is hidden behind a shadowy wall, and it was so difficult to find. \n\nYet some other puzzles require creative arrangements of crates and barrels. It would've been fun had not the barrel arrangement require absolute precision on the player's part. Hours are spent fine-tuning barrel placements to get things to work.\n\nOther than that, it was a fun diversion--short gameplay that felt long due to the repetitive nature of looking for these \"I, Spy\" elements. It is fun learning more about the teleportation device the scientists at Black Mesa created. I would've loved to see an earlier cameo of Gordon Freeman. The music, while simple and only one track, is pretty cool. I really thought I was going to encounter Gordon hacking at some zombies with his crowbar.
