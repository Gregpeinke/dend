I have never played a shoot to date that has as good a story as Bioshock – Infinite. As a series known for its clincher plot twists, Infinite definitely takes the cake, almost guaranteeing a second playthrough out of it so you can fully understand the magnitude of its ending. An absolutely phenomenal story with incredibly written protagonists. \n\nThe two story based DLC Episodes, Burial At Sea, are amazing & create a cyclical nature to the Bioshock series. Burial At Sea will end, & Bioshock 1 will begin.\n\n[b][u]Is This Even Fun?:[/u][/b]\nBioshock – Infinite plays very similarly to the first two games while always feeling fresh & unique. It is like Bioshock 1 meets Doom 4. The combat pacing is very fast & the range of Weapons & Vigors you are given is pretty broad. There is so much going on in this game for a linear shooter. It is more linear than the first two games. Your customization in the Weapons you can carry & bonuses you can equip are more limited, but more focused if that makes sense. You do get a companion that follows you around, Elizabeth, & her AI is amazing. I think most companions in future games should be based off her; she is incredibly useful!\n\nThe Burial At Sea DLCs change up gameplay a bit harkening back to the original Bioshock which is pretty cool. The third DLC, Clash In the Clouds, is an Arena based DLC which is only fun due to the strength of the fast paced, chaotic, combat in this game.\n\n[b][u]100% Achievements?:[/u][/b]\nUnlocking 100% of the Achievements is tricky… but possible. 79/80 Achievements are doable, some being harder than others. But there is one Achievement in the Clash In the Clouds DLC that is an absolute nightmare. It essentially requires you to complete 60 mini-Achievements with challenges ranging from simple to obscene. Good luck with that! Check out my 100% Achievement Walkthrough, A Cynical Guide: Bioshock – Infinite for more details.\n\n[b][u]Is It Worth Buying?:[/u][/b]\nEven if you have never played Bioshock 1 or 2, this is a game every true gamer should play. It has one of the best stories I have ever witnessed in a shooter, or most games in general. You must play this game!\n\n[b]10/10[/b]","timestamp_created":1612829654,"timestamp_updated":1612829682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559858024120330811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86235488","author":{"steamid":"76561198045812831","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":863,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":863,"last_played":1527305985},"language":"english","review":"Beautiful game that's world-building, story-telling, voice-acting, graphics, etc still hold up to this day.

Elizabeth is such a smart character, her AI design is amazing. The story is sad but really interesting and unique, i never even once got distracted playing it. The DLC provides a decent story and almost as long as the main story, it links alot of things together, its just fantastic.

Сам сюжет захватывает с первых минут, Лютесы для меня просто краши которых я по сей день обожаю, Букер ДеВитт именно тот кто подходит на роль последней части трилогии, она рушит шаблоны, первые две части действительно были хороши, они показывали мир антиутопии очень красочно что-ли (хоть игра в очень темных тонах), но Infinite наоборот очень красочна и сочная хоть и поднимает тему немного отошедшую от тех что были ранее. Первые две части показывали молчаливость героев, в то время как Букер очень любит и поговорить с Комстоком, и посетовать на то что его чуть не утопил идиотский священник.

Even though lethal weapons are harder to use, you get a non-lethal crossbow with different types of bolts. Stealth is the big aspect in this episode. Listen to this: there are different types of floors, and each type makes different amount of noise. There are regular floors, carpet floors, metal floors; there are also water puddles and broken glass that will give your position away; light and dark places play a big role too. I forgot to mention, there are vents in this game. I fucking love vents. Since we are at the topic of the vents, another thing this episode adds is verticality in the level design. A lot of encounters have a few different approaches. Really reminded me of Arkane Studios level design. Lets not forget the Batman Arkham series hooks and rooms designed around taking enemies down 1 by 1.    \n\nI didn't really like the gameplay loop in the base game, since it lost the strategic touch that B1 and B2 had. Episode 1 was a pleasant surprise, because it was actually hard on 'hard' difficulty and you really had to manage the resources. Episode 2 just brought it to another level.   \n\nSide note: 1998 difficulty mode is also really fun, you should try it.","timestamp_created":1612717511,"timestamp_updated":1612717511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587393403053283691","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86149500","author":{"steamid":"76561199084188059","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":719,"last_played":1614054322},"language":"schinese","review":"通关本体之后一定要通关DLC这样故事会形成一个闭环。像是德剧 暗黑 一样 发生过的一定会发生","timestamp_created":1612714707,"timestamp_updated":1612714707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86149484","author":{"steamid":"76561198252291752","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":889,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":889,"last_played":1612714158},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite is such a fun game with an incredible atmosphere.
