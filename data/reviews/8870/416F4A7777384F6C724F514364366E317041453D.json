Como a ambientação clara bem diferente dos jogos escuros e amedrontadores anteriores.\nEste jogo completa a trilogia de Bioshock, inicialmente sem qualquer ligação, mas que é mais tarde explicada. Suas novas formas de locomoção torna o jogo bem diferente, bem mais dinâmico, apesar de vc poder carregar apenas 2 armas com munição bem limitada, mais os diversos encontros com inimigos únicos, faz dele bem mais desafiador que os anteriores.\n\nÉ expressamente necessário jogar a DLC Enterro no Oceano para entender por completo a história deste jogo e sua ligação com Rapture. O entendimento do que liga os dois jogos fica meio vago no jogo principal, que deixa para o player interpretar, mas a DLC liga com firmesa as 2 cidades. Por sinal é uma DLC maravilhosa, com mecânicas únicas dela, que a meu ver deveriam ter vindo no jogo base.\n\nNota final

ball 你们！！！\n绝对都是剧透！！！\n\n感谢steam夏促推荐，看到了几个测评后，完全不管别人说这是一个恐怖游戏，直接就把游戏跟DLC入手，果然完全没有让我失望，在通关了主线后，眼泪刷刷的掉了几分钟，再到海葬，除了打架桥段，几乎都是在哭着看剧情。\n（人太感性了没办法，上回玩奇异人生哭了半小时）\n\n这个宇宙充满了常量与变量，现在将来过去也不过是语法。\n充满神秘的对话，隐晦的文字。让人云里雾里的开头，震惊着到达哥伦比亚，各种剧透全程在提示着你，只是你看不懂罢了。\n摸索着找到伊丽莎白，所有的谜题开始慢慢开始展现。\n当结尾一次又一次的回到故事的开头，听男女卢特斯说着隐晦的话语，离开船只，爬上梯子，进入灯塔，开门，再次开门，心中震撼无法述说，看着布克在牧师面前作出的两个完全不同的选择后，游戏里所有破碎的信息一一拼凑起来，串成一个了震撼心灵的爱与救赎故事。\n当伊丽莎白问布克“Are you afraid of god？”布克回答：“No，I afraid of you.”视角转换，如果这段对话发生在伊丽莎白跟康斯托克间，康斯托克的回答也许会是：“Yes，and I not afraid of you.”如此，截然不同选择，最后造成的结局也已经霍然开朗。\n很多人会这一款生化奇兵无限的剧情拿美国末日（the last of us）对比，两款游戏都是在13年发售的，虽然画面及玩法风格相差很大，但是剧情的确都是沉浸式电影叙述类游戏的标杆，美国末日相比之下知名度及赞誉比生化奇兵要多很多，这点我深感可惜。两者的设定相同不外乎主角设定跟背景的设定，两位主角都有着一样的背景，都曾经失去女儿（虽然我刚开始玩的时候甚至都搞不清楚安娜就是男主女儿），都颓废过，都是欠了债要还，而还债的方式都是跟一个女孩有关，最后都是为了这个女孩放弃了一切（也是都属于战神级别）。两个故事都是在科幻的世界观中进行，哥伦比亚带给我震撼远远大于废土波士顿，飞在空中的城市，刚到哥伦比亚的一瞬间，我真的觉得到了天堂。\n不得不说英灵殿中的义和团运动走廊跟伤膝河大屠杀走廊令我深感震撼，这种真真假假的历史背景是我玩的所有游戏最为吸引我的地方。\n而最后从男主做的选择来说，布克做的选择更令我感到震撼，失落良久，而乔尔，我却是一时震惊，却没有更多的感觉。（但是我是真的喜欢艾利啊）\n其实玩完无限的第一时间想到的根本就不是美国末日，如果不看别人的评论，我甚至都不知道原来有这么多人会想到美国末日。我想到的是烧显卡《量子破碎》，因为其中的时空宿命论跟本作的时空位面无限论作为两个完全相反的观点却都让我深深着迷。在叙述方式上，剧情关键点的神转折，故事进展的无力感，量子破碎跟无限都做到了，但是量子破碎因为其剧情太好了，遮盖了游戏本身，以至于大家都觉得自己是花钱买了一部美剧，而缺少了自身的带入感。而无限做得最好的地方就是，他无时无刻不在告诉你这是一个游戏，可是你还是觉得自己就是主角，就是注定要拯救伊丽莎白的人，而当你无力被迫随着剧情走下去时，你充满了悲伤与愤怒。\n（而如今两部游戏的共同点就是，都不会再有续作了）\n当一个游戏能让人做到共情时，这个游戏我觉得就已经十分成功了。\n\n\n我目前还是对恐怖游戏这个耿耿于怀，我本来已经相信这不是一个恐怖游戏了，最多来点剧情杀又怎么样，结果在玩到伊丽莎白被抓走去救她结果进到未来位面的那个精神病院里，我吓得整个人魂都飞掉了，身边没有伊丽莎白给我送弹药，差点整个人都绝望，一回头又是一个剧情杀，差点没吓出心脏病。还好整个游戏也就这段恐怖。\n\n最后得知有情人终成父女的我喊了好多句wc，他们两个真的太有爱了好咩。\n心中神作之一，满分必须。","timestamp_created":1530707163,"timestamp_updated":1530785394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.673045158386230469","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43294701","author":{"steamid":"76561198086401777","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1258,"last_played":1530961857},"language":"turkish","review":"\"Bring

Ama tabiki her oyunun kusuru olduğu gibi bu oyunun kusurlarıda var bunlara değinmek gerekirse Oyunda Vigor denen güçlerimiz resmen gösterişten ibaret ben oyunun yarısına sadece silah kullanarak gelmişim farkında değildim :D vigorları gösteriş için kullandım açıkcası biraz cool duruyor :D yoksa bir şey yaptığı yok . Oyundaki en büyük sıkıntı bana göre hikaye çok iyi olmasına rağmen sunum yetersiz geldi bana internetten hafif bir araştırmayla aklımdaki soru işaretlerini ancak geçirebildim , keşke bunları oyun içinde daha düzgün bir şekilde anlayabilseydik daha iyi olurdu .\nFiyat olaraksa indirimlerde 12.25TL ye düşüyor , türkçe yama da mevcut oynamadıysanız yaklaşık 10 saatlik bir maceraya şans verin

Had a couple of friends who worked on this.\n\nIt's even weirder being in a position where I feel that a fair rating for the title is negative.\n\n[h1]Game Design Flaws[/h1]\n\nLet's start with the core of the product- the nuts and bolts of the game design.  Here's where things started to go wrong.\n\nA.  Let's start with the UI and the elements touched by it, starting with the health and Salt system.\n\nRather than simply borrow Call of Duty's simple, straightforward \"heroic health\" concept, where taking non-fatal damage results in a brief period where the player has to seek cover and recuperate, the game has two different health bars; one for health, which is static, one for a \"shield\" that is dynamic.  It's nonsensical and it just gets in the way of the game.\n\nSalt has the same problems.  It's a resource we're supposed to use heavily in combat (although, for the most part, it's not necessary- see later).  But there are very few active uses available, and Salt's supposed to be a depleting resource.\n\nAmmunition is displayed in a reasonable way, although it would've benefited from a bar-style animation rather than a numeric counter to make it easier to read from the corner of the eye.\n\nNavigation of the largely-linear maps is horribly managed.  The main UI doesn't make it clear where we're supposed to go; there's a whole 'nother key-press for that, that activates a system that is actually a little taxing on the CPU, because it's apparently running some sort of pathfinding call.\n\nB.  Now let's talk about core game-balance and design.\n\nB1.  [b]What is the game design dealing with, actually?[/b]\n\nThe heart and soul of Bioshock Infinity is that it's an arena shooter, similar to the Call of Duty series in structure.  The player walks into arenas and guns down huge numbers of pretty dim-witted foes.  I know that somebody will get mad at comparing the two games, but just go play the two back-to-back; they're not that different, really.\n\nI know that people have said all sorts of things about the [i]supposedly-wonderful story[/i], but honestly, I thought it was pretty meh; blah-blah, Quantum Physics == Magic, All Racists Should Be Shot In The Face, Revolutions Can Get Ugly, Don't Worry About Paradoxes, The End.  The ending, which the likes of PC Gamer thought was \"deep\", is [u]utter garbage of the worst deus ex machina type, designed to wrap up a poorly-developed main story without any heroic evolution or resolution[/u].\n\nSo, it's an arena shooter with a meh story, trying to be Deep, but largely failing.\n\nWhat about the art?\n\nOK, here I have to give the game's creators credit where it's due.  The Art Department nailed the game's look pretty solidly throughout.  Eventually, the re-use of visual elements in the level designs gets tiring (seriously, everybody had the exact same style of desk in 1912, apparently) but it's all very pretty, animations are good, etc.\n\nB2.  [b]So, it's a pretentious arena-shooter.  What went wrong?[/b]\n\nGreat arena shooters (Serious Sam, Quake, CoD, Half Life, Painkiller et al) all have some things in common.  They all have an interesting variety of weapons that are all effective in their niche roles.  Players can carry an absurd number of guns and a plethora of ammo and use the weapons that best-fit the need of the moment.  Movement is relatively fast and clean.  If there are hand-to-hand weapons, they're usually utterly lethal (Painkiller probably takes the all-time \"best\" here, but the Crowbar from Half Life is always worth remembering, as are the instant-death takedowns of CoD).\n\nDespite having all these great examples of how to build a fun arena-shooter sitting around, and despite, after design changes, settling on an arena-shooter design, Bioshock Infinity's designers managed to mess it all up.\n\nB3.  [b]Weapon Tuning.[/b]\n\nThe weapons are unbelievably poorly tuned.  Their stats and effects strongly feel like something that got iterated upon, rather poorly, by a committee that didn't know what it wanted the outcome to be.  \n\nFor example, there's the Pistol and the Hand Cannon.  Given the difference in time when you get the weapons, the scarcity of ammunition and low ammo-count, one would expect the Hand Cannon to be a really superior weapon.  It isn't; the Pistol head-shots more efficiently against weak enemies and the Hand Cannon simply doesn't deal enough damage on non-headshots to be noticeably more efficient over time, let alone more efficient for ammo available.\n\nI could go on and on about every single weapon in this game and how they could have been differentiated more effectively, but in the interests of brevity, I'll refrain.\n\nB3.  [b]Non-Combat Gameplay is Largely Boring.[/b]\n\nGameplay consists of entering arenas, killing huge numbers of enemies... then having long, boring sections where we're supposed to search every object and carefully scrounge up ammunition, food and Salt.  These weren't fun moments; they weren't \"exploring the wonderful world we built\" moments; instead, it felt like drudgery after the first half-hour.  Why?  Well, there's hardly anything interesting about wandering through strangely-abandoned rooms randomly hitting the F key to search every object that blinks \"hey, I might have Stuff in me\".  It was particularly irritating that so often, the Stuff we got was random garbage that wasn't even relevant; ooh, thanks, Irrational, I really needed more Machine Gun bullets... not.\n\nBut this was followed up by puzzles that weren't actually puzzles, but were just FedEx quests, and lots of walking around, looking at the scenery.  Now, for what it's worth, the scenery's gorgeous... but that's no compensation for the lack of actually-interesting gameplay.  The game would've been better if it had had more random encounters in the searchable areas, jump-scares to keep us on our toes, or encounters with regular folks... anything, really, other than endless empty rooms near the latest arena we've smashed, where the optimal way to play is to search Every Goshdarn Thing.\n\nSo... search around the levels, search everything, maybe get sent on a FedEx quest.  That's the whole of the non-combat gameplay worth mentioning.\n\nB3.  [b]Puzzling Set-Pieces.[/b]\n\nThere are some elaborate set-piece fights.  Some of them create huge difficulty spikes.  On Medium difficulty, this didn't actually matter; the game's very easy overall.  But they were weird moments where things got much, much more randomly hard.\n\nB3.  [b]An absolutely horrible end-boss fight.[/b]\n\nAll I'm going to say here is that I totally saw it coming, because it had been done several times before in the game.  Let's just say that it's uninteresting and emotionally unsatisfying.\n\n[h1]But What About That Art and Story, Eh?[/h1]\n\nTo be frank, the best Art money can buy won't save a game that's so boring, bland and poorly thought-out.  And the story came across as more pretentious than great.  All of the bad guys were straw men and at the end of the day, I didn't feel like a hero, nor did I like Elizabeth.\n\nBioshock Infinite feels like something that got iterated on too many times by a committee that couldn't agree on how to tie their shoes, let alone design a game.  I doubt if all of these problems can all be laid on Levine's desk, although he should bear most of the blame; this was his project to lead, and if he didn't play it all the way through a couple of times during final alphas to make sure it didn't suck and see everything that I've just mentioned, that's entirely his fault.  I know that fixing the meh story was out of reach, but a lot of what I've talked about here was actually fixable and would have improved the game.  \n\nI feel really sorry for all the good people at Irrational who lost their jobs over this not selling well, though.","timestamp_created":1530567156,"timestamp_updated":1530567156,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485573887825012207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43253153","author":{"steamid":"76561197991157579","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2667,"last_played":1637825462},"language":"english","review":"Well I finished the main game for Bioshock Infinite.

Gerçekten kelimelerle tarif edilemeyecek derinlikte fakat kısaca inceleyeyim.\nKonumuz; \"Kızı getir , borcu sil\" gibi görünsede tamamiyle bambaşka bir dokuda.\n\nHikaye ; \nİnanılmaz derinlikte bir hikayesi var. Piyasada böyle bir oyun var mı bilemiyorum. Çünkü film senaryosu olabilecek derinlikte. Zaman- mekan algısı , quantum fiziği , ikonografi ve dini göndermeleriyle inanılmaz bir hikaye bütünlüğü oluşturuyor.  Olabildiğinde detaylı hazrılanmış hikaye gerçek quantum fiziği teorileriyle harmanlanmış. Sosyolojik olarak karakterler oyunun sonuna doğru gelişiyor ve bambaşka insan oluyorlar. Diyalog yapılarına kadar , tavırlarına kadar her şeyleri değişiyor ve hikayenin ileriye gittiğini anlıyorsunuz. Asla kendini tekrar etmiyor. Spoiler vermemek için detaylarından pek bahsetmiyorum genel anlamda kendimizi olayın içnide buluyoruz ve Elizabeth adında bir kızı kurtarmaya çalışıyoruz :) \nÖnümüzü kesip sürekli soru soran ikizler' de cabası :) \n\nOynayış ; \nÇok rahat oyun mekanikleri var. Savaş alanı kısayolları çok iyi. Savaşırken Elizabethin kendi başının çaresine bakması ve bize mermi , tuz , para vb şeyleri atması , yırtıklar açarak destek olması da cabası.\n\nGrafikler ; \nOyun temelinde cell-shade diyebileceğimiz ama daha pastel olan görsellere sahip. Şehrin ışıklandırması harika , ışıl ışıl olan yerlerden karanlık yerlere kadar çok güzel bir atmosferi var ve şehrin kendi başına yaşadığını iliklerinizie kadar hissediyorsunuz. Sosyal yapı şehirde duruyor. İnsanlar birçok aktivitede bulunuyorlar vb,\n\nMüzikler ; yerli yerinde kullanılmış klasik , amerikan folk tarzı müzikler kullanılmış ve hiçbir detay atlanmamış. Tüyleriniz diken diken oluyor.\n\nSon olarak ; \nOyun her haliyle detaylara önem vermiş. Elizabeth'le ilk karşılaştığımızda bize vurulan kitaptan tutun ( bize kitapla saldırıyor ve kitap kuantum mekaniği üzerine ) isa ve çoban muhabbeti ve dini göndermeler olabildiğince güzel bir derinlik katmış. Çok katmanlı bir yapıya sahip.
