Graalem gier video. I nie bez powodu, każda część Half Life-a była przełomem w grach, i to nie podlega dyskusji. Dyskusji podlega jednak to, czy te gry do dziś są tak świetne jak kiedyś. Jako gracz zdecydowałem się zagrać w tego Św. Graala. Niestety w mojej opinii pierwsza część była już zbyt przestarzała, i była już dla mnie nudnym i topornym shooterem. Dlatego do HL2 podchodziłem z ogromną dozą dystansu, wiedząc że mogę się zawieść. Efekt: Wymaksowałem podstawkę i epizody pod względem osiągnięć, czego nie robię tak naprawdę nigdy.\n\nHalf Life 2 po 16 latach od premiery nie zestarzał się ani trochę, w kwestii doświadczenia. To jedna z najlepszych przygód growych jakie miałem okazję przeżyć. Rzadko o której grze mogę powiedzieć \"przygoda\" nawet o moim ulubionym Devil May Cry 5. Z czego to wynika?\n\nZacznijmy od fabuły. Ta jest raczej szczątkowa, ale ogólem z przyjemnością ogląda się wydarzenia występujące w grze. Postacie są bardzo dobrze napisane i zapadają w pamięć. A motyw G-Mana moim zdaniem powala. Gra pod koniec Epizodu 2 wali po nerach plot twistami, i zostawia srogiego i bolesnego cliffhangera. Ogółem lore świata nie jest podana na tacy a trzeba się trochę w to wgłębić. Dla mnie: Świetnie wpasowuje się to w tajemniczy klimat gry. A skoro przy nim jesteśmy:\n\nKlimat w HL 2 powala. Oto wpadamy do City 17 - miasta położonego gdzieś na bloku Wschodnim, opanowanego (jak cała Ziemia) przez rasę obcych: Kombinat. Wszystko pasuje to niemal idealnie. Typowo swojska surowa architektura, połączona z brutalistyczną industrialną technologią Kombinatu tworzy klimat gęsty jak tłum ludzi na wyprzedaży w Biedronce. Oprócz miasta odwiedzimy różne tereny pozamiejskie, które działają na wyobraźnię, brakiem ludzi. Ma się naprawdę wrażenie obcowania z opuszczonym terenem. Klimatu dodaje też warstwa audio. Dźwięki otoczenia, kosmitów Xen, żołnierzy Kombinatu, alarmów.. Wszystko brzmi poprostu świetnie. Muzyka też jest super, i jest rzadko używana. I moim zdaniem dobrze. Cisza w grze potęguje uczucie, że ten świat niemal umarł. Będąc przyzwyczajony do udźwiękowionych patetyczną nutą menu głównych, Half Life 2 wprowadził w klimat gry właśnie ciszą. Jedyne co słychać w menu, to otoczenie wyświetlone w tle.\n\nJednakże największą zaletą gry jest jej różnorodność: Dawno nie miałem do czynienia z grą która tak genialnie tasuje mechaniki i elementy gameplayu: Na początku uciekamy po dachach. W jednym etapie jedziemy poduszkowcem, w drugiej bawimy się Gravity gunem z mechanicznym psem, potem mamy motyw horrorowy wydostając się z Ravenholm, potem jeździmy autem, przechodzimy pod fundamentami mostu, uważamy by nie zaatakowały nas Mrówkolwy, potem je kontrolujemy, jeszcze gdzie indziej kierujemy powstaniem.... Ta gra nie pozwala się nudzić. A temat liznąłem bardzo powierzchownie. Gra ma liczne ucieczki, bitwy czy zagadki związane z fizyką, i nie ma się uczucia że cały czas robimy to samo.A w epizodach ilość tych wydarzeń rośnie. Naprawdę świetnie zaprojektowany gameplay. Jedynie do czego mogę się przyczepić, to do momentu z powstaniem w podstawce. Gra, w tym momencie mi naprawdę nieprzyjemnie się dłużyła. Jednak mogę to wybaczyć, bo lekko nużący endgame to norma nawet i dziś. Czego nie mogę wybaczyć to latarki. Serio nie rozumiem zamysłu latarki wyłączającej się po kilkudziesięciu sekundach, w każdej starszej grze. Co gorsza żre tą samą energię co sprint i oddech pod wodą. Absolutny bezsens załatany dopiero w Epizodzie 2.\n\nNa koniec wspomnę o warstwie technicznej. Gra mimo 16 lat na karku wygląda i działa naprawdę dobrze. Możliwe że to przez patche od Valve (bo wątpię by na premierę miała tryb VR w opcjach....). I dobrze, bo gra działa też świetnie, nie potrzebowałem żadnych patchy na wysokie rozdzielczości, a gra ani razu mi się nie wysypała. Fizyka zdążyła się już lekko zestarzeć, ale ta gra była pierwszą grą która używała fizyki na taką skalę, więc można przymknąć na to oko.\n\nPodsumowując: Half Life 2 to nie tylko świetna gra nawet dziś 16 lat od premiery. To doskonała przygoda dziś w 2020, gdzie wyszła masa tytułów, starające się przebić dzieło od Valve. I w mojej opinii, do dziś żadna gra tego nie zrobiła. Half Life 2 to zdecydowanie dzieło ponadczasowe, i godne najwyższej noty na Metacriticu. Takich gier nie ma, i myślę że jeszcze długo nie będzie.\n\n[b]Ocena:[/b] 10/10","timestamp_created":1585597253,"timestamp_updated":1585656814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":31,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.763732314109802246","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66191166","author":{"steamid":"76561198086434931","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2156,"last_played":1633334088},"language":"english","review":"best game created.","timestamp_created":1585597196,"timestamp_updated":1585597196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66190725","author":{"steamid":"76561198843298436","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":2852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108,"last_played":1619520079},"language":"russian","review":"История героя,насилием зомби и насекомых","timestamp_created":1585596811,"timestamp_updated":1585596811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66190557","author":{"steamid":"76561198851286301","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":2169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":565,"last_played":1627210457},"language":"turkish","review":".","timestamp_created":1585596675,"timestamp_updated":1649573007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66190509","author":{"steamid":"76561198866536921","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1053,"last_played":1646497107},"language":"turkish","review":"oyun 2004 yapımı sanırsın valve ekibi 2030 yılında zaman makinesi icat etmiş 2004e gelipte oyun yapmışlar","timestamp_created":1585596632,"timestamp_updated":1585596632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66189498","author":{"steamid":"76561198856275071","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":912,"last_played":1640697247},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очинь крутайа, мни всйо панравилась!","timestamp_created":1585595784,"timestamp_updated":1585595784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559585452079772949","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66189141","author":{"steamid":"76561198359857253","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1609001004},"language":"english","review":"Epic Game.

Колорит постсоветского пространства, вывески на русском, советские машины добавляют ещё большее очарование. Честно говоря, даже не знаю, по каким критериям можно определить, что игра - шедевр, но когда играешь в half-life, внутри всё время таится именно это чувство:\"Я играю в шедевр\".
