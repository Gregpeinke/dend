But there are some games that are often forgotten, even though many people have them due to buying the Valve Complete Pack. Games like Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, Alien Swarm. Some of them pretty good, others - more questionable. So I'm going to review the [i]BEST[/i] one of them: Ricochet!\n\nRicochet is a first person shooter, although I like to call it a first-person thrower: you literally throw discs at each other in hope of actually hitting anyone (and that's a major problem for a reason I'm going to talk about later). It was supposed to be a fun online experience with fast-paced gameplay and small, but complex maps, made in an authentic futuristic style (what else can you call a game full of colored platforms in space?!) There are a few power-ups that might give you an advantage over your hypothetical opponents, like the ability to throw quicker discs, throw three at once and others. You gain points by killing people (pushing them off the platforms mostly), and you get a bonus by [i]ricocheting[/i] the discs off of some weirg diagonal... things. They glow yellow, that's what's important!\n\nRicochet was never supposed to be competitive or serious, it was just a fun experience. So why did Counter-Strike get as popular as it did, but not Ricochet? I actually don't know. The game has one weird quirk: you can't shoot up or down. But that's definitely not the main problem, after all, you don't even need to: it would mess with the gameplay.\n\nSo, what's holding it back? Back in the day - probably, the existence of better, more hyped games in the same package. And a lack of content, I guess. Now? Well, you remember how I said that it's an online experience? Yeah, about that. Ricochet is so innovative, that you could even call it the first singleplayer online shooter ([b]THROWER![/b]) with no bots! No one plays this game. This is an unending cycle of not playing: if there's no one playing, there's no one to play with, so why even bother staying on a server for more than a minute? It's kinda sand, because this kind of game might actually become pretty popular with updated graphics and some [i]actual[/i] players. I'm not able to rate it, because I can only assume what gameplay might have been like, since, erm, no one plays it!\n\nThe only thing left to do is to quietly wait for...\n[h1]RICOCHET 2[/h1]\n\ntldr; best game ever 420/10 would rico the chet again","timestamp_created":1543618800,"timestamp_updated":1543618800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.657184481620788574","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47193653","author":{"steamid":"76561198140443683","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1558890423},"language":"english","review":"Why didn't this appear in the Artifact trailer with the Marvel like intro?

I became suicidal, cutting deep into my wrists and wishing the emotional turmoil would end. I opened up my computer and planned to have one last good time before I ended my pain-stricken and worthless life. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a notification popped up on my desktop, a steam gift, I could only wonder what it was. I finally used my last essence of courage and wonder I had left in my battered and bruised body to open it. Ricochet emerged on my screen. ♥♥♥♥ it, I might as well have some fun on my last day of measly existence. I downloaded and opened the game. A flash of colour, the amazing soundtrack, enjoyment. I came to the epiphany that it had not been a worthless journey. I had rediscovered Jesus. No not Jesus, one who is greater than he, the legendary Gaben. I played it for hours on end. Win after Win. My wife came to her senses and realised the sexy alpha male she was missing out on. She came home, all my children in her hands.\n'I miss you' she cried.\n'Eat a shit Bethany, I have Ricochet now'.\nI slammed the door in that bitches face. I could hear her wail into the cold night air, her cries piercing the air like a gunshot in an enclosed room. She got in the stupid, run down car that she drove, pilling the disgusting fruit of my loins into it. Good, I hope that she died. I returned to my computer to see a notification, Ricochet. I opened it and it was a direct message with a picture attachment, a fully naked Gaben in a silk curtain stared into the camera. The captioning was, 'Hey sexy, if you really love me, you'll put your♥♥♥♥♥♥in the usb drive, see you soon, x', at first, I was repulsed and confused, but it occurred to me, this was the will of the aforementioned higher power. Of Gaben the Great himself. Without further hesitation, I did as I was instructed, it hurt, but it was a required evil. I became sucked into the machine, Dick first, and arrived in the map 'rc_deathmatch2', and saw a lone figure crouched on the ground, after closer inspection, I realised they were just short. I walked over and saw the familiar angelic face, and glasses, I saw the sly grin spread across his face, he took a step toward me.\n' Hey man, you want some skins', he said sexily.\nI ran and embraced him, lifting him off the ground.\n'I love you, Gaben',\n'I love you too',\nWe stepped off the path and hopped in the Legendary Kart, one seat. Only one/\n'Where am I supposed to sit?' I whined.\n'Oh, about that, you can just sit on daddy's lap' he winked.\nI sat down and felt his raging erection touch the tip of my dick We sped off into the sunset, into a life of wonder and romance.\n\nFin.","timestamp_created":1543319128,"timestamp_updated":1543319128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":92,"votes_funny":148,"weighted_vote_score":"0.847392141819000244","comment_count":18,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47099570","author":{"steamid":"76561198157765505","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":17,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1515346579},"language":"english","review":"Great game with an amazing community, but hold off until VALVe releases the sequel.","timestamp_created":1543289619,"timestamp_updated":1561949447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47095981","author":{"steamid":"76561198199621235","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":24,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24,"last_played":1532492356},"language":"english","review":"epik gaem fir epic gamers","timestamp_created":1543284705,"timestamp_updated":1543284705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529780566692352295","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47080932","author":{"steamid":"76561198382769364","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":28,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1658884409},"language":"spanish","review":"Ricochet GOTY 2018","timestamp_created":1543267673,"timestamp_updated":1543267673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47051239","author":{"steamid":"76561197984938155","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":98,"playtime_forever":93,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61,"last_played":1587568954},"language":"english","review":"This is what happens when Valve doesn't devour good ideas/devs for profits.

And really we had the highest quality votes. Genuine votes! Votes should be rated against the playerbase, per capita. That way we would have had 20000% repersentation and would have swept everything. But I suppose those other guys probably were paid to vote. Nobody plays those games anyway. We freely exercised our right as internet citizens to vote for what we wanted, and so we should have got it. All we can say for sure that the awards are rigged.\n\nBut maybe that's just it. The hype is exploding at this point, and Gaben doesn't want to kill anybody just yet. You see, Ricochet 2 is going to come out at the exact moment that Gaben reveals that Ricochet has won game of the year for the last 17 years. Sales will explode. All will be revealed! Artifact is actually just a test platform for the ricochet card game. Danger zone is as so for the ricochet battle royale. The steam machines are concepts for the new ricochet console.

Though the dlc is expensive, it's worth it, and after all, you can never have too many crates (keys sold seperately).","timestamp_created":1542840094,"timestamp_updated":1545190818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570040881633758545","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46046938","author":{"steamid":"76561198196227601","num_games_owned":2460,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":53,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1542838705},"language":"english","review":"I want more community of this game, plz install it and play with me","timestamp_created":1542837028,"timestamp_updated":1542837028,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46018195","author":{"steamid":"76561198112972007","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":16882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16882,"last_played":1576331846},"language":"latam","review":"Después de casi 300 horas de juego puedo decir que el sistema de emparejamiento es perfecto. En los rangos altos lleva mucho tiempo buscar un juego (casi 4 minutos) y el nerf que pusieron en el disco trajo un nuevo meta en esta temporada 20. Sin mencionar la reelaboración de la banda sonora que es un deleite visual. Debe tener cuidado, los usuarios de bajo perfil necesitarán una tarjeta de sonido Creative Sound Blaster ZxR de 116 dB con procesador de audio Sound Core3D para ejecutar los efectos de sonido en la competencia. gg wp mejor inversión del año GOTY  DIOS MIO PERO QUE JUEGAZO","timestamp_created":1542833324,"timestamp_updated":1609777050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469214737415313721","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45993856","author":{"steamid":"76561198218393641","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":124,"last_played":1617333740},"language":"english","review":"Does anyone even play this game?","timestamp_created":1542830829,"timestamp_updated":1542830829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45991054","author":{"steamid":"76561198314424223","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1651500351},"language":"german","review":"Best Fan Base ever","timestamp_created":1542830548,"timestamp_updated":1542830548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45972507","author":{"steamid":"76561198112322113","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44,"last_played":1648316565},"language":"english","review":"valve pls make a GOTU-Edition for all colectors of the game. thx","timestamp_created":1542828322,"timestamp_updated":1542828322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45937017","author":{"steamid":"76561197980893868","num_games_owned":1508,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":16446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15131,"last_played":1593456050},"language":"english","review":"It's nice to play a competative multiplayer game where you don't get bothered by other people.","timestamp_created":1542824543,"timestamp_updated":1542824543,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45935045","author":{"steamid":"76561198043015096","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":140,"last_played":1588927991},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever","timestamp_created":1542824303,"timestamp_updated":1589966253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45876049","author":{"steamid":"76561198366848055","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24,"last_played":1580095109},"language":"spanish","review":"Recomendado para LAL","timestamp_created":1542526804,"timestamp_updated":1542526804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45864761","author":{"steamid":"76561198317364375","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":29,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29,"last_played":1561964573},"language":"russian","review":"если не играть, то норм","timestamp_created":1542472978,"timestamp_updated":1542472978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45805276","author":{"steamid":"76561198101836682","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1536373784},"language":"schinese","review":"V社的上古作品 喜加1","timestamp_created":1542171468,"timestamp_updated":1560008438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45791548","author":{"steamid":"76561198203961431","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":1653,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1542093641},"language":"russian","review":"-Гойб, можит сдилаим игру бисплатная?
