juego es una maravilla pero no esta exenta de errores, en un principio lo que vemos es la mejor obra narrativa en shooters en su tiempo, teniamos wolfenstein, doom, quake entre otros, pero ralmente pocos ofrecían una historia a la altura del gamplay, este juego primero empieza con una sección tranquila, luego se nos insinua un poco que las cosas igual no van ta bien para llegar al momento en que revienta el portal a una nueva dimencion y salen seres que nos quieren ver muertos, la premisa es sensilla pero cumple y es mucho mejor que la completa ausencia de ella en los demás juegos de la época salvo por algunos documentos, a continuación voy a dar algunos pros y contras\n\npros:\n-el diseño de niveles es limpio, no te agobia con muchos datos en pantalla y cuando necesitas usar la palanca para romper un vidrio y seguir avanzando la pone en frente del vidrio, de tal forma en que uno sabe que tiene que hacer sin que el juego se lo tire a la cara con un texto o una voz no tan inmersiva\n\n-la variedad de armas es aceptable, y te fuerza a usar algunas en situaciones que lo ameriten para poder librarte rápido de los enemigos, si se juntan muchos resistentes quizá optes por el revolver, si estamos hablando de blindados quizá un lanzamisiles\n\n-la inteligencia artificial, algunos enemigos primitivos prefieren comer carne antes que atacarte si esta en el suelo, los soldados se coordinan entre si de tal forma de que fuerzan al jugador a usar la cabeza, muchas veces no sabia donde se metían los enemigos para acto seguido recibir un disparo por la espalda muy bien pensado, los demás enemigos dependiendo de su inteligencia son mas o menos capaces de montar estrategias pero o compensan con poder de fuego\n\n-la ambientación, recorremos por distintos lados muy bien ambientados y cada pasillo esta con otro detalle que no ponen en el anterior, es un no parar, estas esquivando turbinas trituradoras de basura y al nivel siguiente debajo de la escalera ves a un zombie comiéndose un cadáver mientras que las luces parpadean y dejan una escena terriblemente aterradora con solo 2 elementos, esto es increíble pero lamentablemente se pierde un poco cuando llegamos a la recta final\n\n-los scipts, una de las cosas que permiten la inmercion en el juego son los scrips, puede ver científicos discutiendo por ahi, otros hablandote a ti directamnete para comentarte cosas y todo se siente muy natural, tanto así que el que gordon freeman (el protagonista) sea mudo pasa a un segundo plano, de tal forma que no lo ves como una limitación si no como un lienzo en blanco en el que ponerle a freeman la personalidad que quieras, con sus limitaciones de ser un shooter lineal claro, y los npc nos hablan de forma casual, de forma en que sentimos que somos alguien en ese lugar\n\ncontras:\n\n-el ritmo de la obra, nosotros interpretamos a gordon freeman, se supone que somos un cientificos, pero a la hora de la verdad somos capaces de corres a 800km por hora y disparar a todo lo que se mueva de forma muy absurda, y eso mata la inmercion, y llegas a no mirar la inteligencia artificial de las cosas desde el capitulo 3 dond ya cuentas con el arsenal suficiente ara ir como en coom ethernal, rusheando enemigos como si no hubiera un mañana, y la historia se reduce a la de una borrachera que salio mal\n\n-después de cambiar y cambiar el estilo de los niveles resulta muy pero que muy agotador, en plan, al inicio todo bien pero luego dices, o mira que guapo, cuanto va a durar hasta que lo cambien por algo que igual no esta tan bien, sin desmecerer el diseño de niveles, en un 70% es divertido, pero cuando llegas al tramo final es cuando te das cuenta que igual no es tan impactante como creías en un inicio, y eso deja una gran decepción, y hay pequeñas decepciones por el camino\n\n-la maldita obsesión de ponerse a disparar a todo lo que se mueva, el juego intenta ser mas maduro que los demás en su época, pero cosas como que anda se pueda resolver de formas ya no digo pacificas, si no de varias maneras, en el tramo final los enemigos no te atacan a menos que tu lo hagas, pero el juego esta tan concentrado en acostumbrarte a disparar que esas mecánicas se pierden en un mar de tiros, pierden visibilidad, yo mismo e terminado haciendo lo mismo hasta enterarme a través de Internet sobre esas mecánicas\n\n-los npc pueden ser asesinados de nuestra parte, pero ojo, si matamos a uno necesario para continuar, pum, pierdes de forma automática, 0 creíble y deja a gordon como un psicopata asesino, un game over en todos los casos es igual poco inmercivo, pero no nos deja con npc de primera y segunda como llega  hacer half-life\n\n-la puntería de los aliados es peor que la de los bots de csgo en dificultad sin bots\n\n-luego de jugar un tiempo te aburres de los científicos y guardias, son clones\n\n-las pausas constantes para tener que cargar cosas, si hicieran que se pudiera cargar todo directamente ahora que tenemos pcs lo suficientemente ponte se arreglaría, pero es un detalle menor","timestamp_created":1587549206,"timestamp_updated":1590538434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496183216571807861","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67799756","author":{"steamid":"76561198263119458","num_games_owned":548,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":919,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":873,"last_played":1634684999},"language":"spanish","review":"Un
