Человечество вымирает, зло уничтожает все ценное в мире людей и активно продолжают опустошать ресурсы планеты Земля.\nДействия игры начинаются в городе City 17, где мы под видом обычного гражданского приезжаем в оккупированный город Альянсом, видим, что везде стоят метрополицейские и в случае любого действия, которое не понравится метрополиции, получите по лицу шоковой дубинкой. (Слушайте прям, как у нас рабы Путина клоунов Навального избивают) Среди метрополицейских оказывается шпион, наш старый знакомый Барни из черной мезы, который помогает Фриману скрытся от метрополиции хоть и не надолго и рассказывает все вещи, что происходит в мире. В попытках метрополиции нас арестовать, на помощь к нам приходит всеми полюбившаяся Алекс, которая в следующих частях будет везде за нами бегать как хвостик.\nМинусов нет!\nПлюсы:\n1) Очень классный игровой сюжет;\n2) Очень хорошо проработанные локации и графика для своего времени, которые даже на сегодня могут потягаться с любой новинкой;\n3) Хороший саундтрек;\n4) Не бедный на тот момент арсенал вооружений.\n5) Очень умно проработанные NN, которые потом стали прорывом в игровой индустрии.

The amazing soundtrack, story and world all came together to form a fantastic post apocalyptic Sci-Fi journey. The world feels so real, excelling at creating the illusion of a world still reeling from the consequences of an alien invasion. The dystopian atmosphere oozing from every aspect of this futuristic post-war Eastern Europe is extremely well executed. The game still looks great 18 years later and is still able to capture the essence of a world ensnared by the combine’s clutches. The synthetic soundtrack is also a work of art, a key element to that world building, helping to raise the tension and pump adrenaline during battles, to state somber tones of melancholy during down time and to create a truly haunting or horrific atmosphere when it wants to instill fear in you. The game is packed with amazing set pieces and sequences that are some of the biggest highlights from the game. Hovering through the canal in the airboat and driving across the coast via highway 17 are memorable and exciting sections of HL2.  Almost all of the weapons in this game feel satisfying to use and some such as the gravity gun and the hyper charged gravity gun in the end game are a load of fun to play around with. The level design feels smooth as you trek from one level to another making your way through city 17 and the areas around it. Mini puzzles provide a bit of down time and conveniently placed explosive barrels scattered throughout the ruins where combine soldiers pop out help elevate your enjoyment of the game. The story is seamless, aided by all of the aforementioned elements to be able to tell a captivating story with likable and real characters. During Gordon’s return to City 17 you truly feel like there is war being raged in the streets as you fight alongside rebels and take down the combine forces. In the endgame the Citadel was fascinatingly created and fed my ever-growing hunger to learn more about the lore of this world. This game is just so good! Packed with exceptionally well written dialogue, excellent music, an incredible story and gameplay loop and a fun load of mechanics to play with in a physics sandbox, Half Life 2 has become one of my favorite games of all

life 2 isnt perfect \n\nhalf life 2 is a great game. one of my favorites. but it's not perfect, and is not immune to criticism, and i'll do just that. i will mainly be using half life 1 as a comparison.\n\npart 1 - enemies and weapons\n     half life 2 has a good arsenal and an average cast of enemies. just to get this out of the way, the gravity gun is amazing. great weapon, but other than that, half life 2 doesnt add much to the original's arsenal. it foregoes the tripmines and the satchel charges, the snarks and the hivehand, the tau cannon and the gluon gun, and more; including none of the weapons added in opposing force as well. while yes, it does add the pulse rifle, that weapon adds very little to the sandbox, just being a pretty standard rifle, and the bugbait, which cool, i feel is only really useful in a couple chapters. i think overall, half life 2s arsenal is small but practical, while half life 1s is larger and more experimental, and more interesting imo. i also believe that half life 2 has more room for its fewer weapons to shine, i.e., ravenholm. but still, that doesnt save it from a mostly average arsenal.\n\n     the enemies are pretty boring. its 99% headcrabs and zombies, and like 1% combine, which are just the hecu from hl1 but with masks on a gameplay level. they scrapped the majority of the xen creatures from half life 1 in the sequel, such as the bullsquid, houndeyes, controllers, ictheasaurs, grunts, vortiguants (as enemies), and more. they also removed the black ops assassins, which makes sense, but they didnt replace them with a combine equivalent either.\nhalf life 2 added in the striders and the antlions. the antlions made for a cool chapter, and not much else. the striders were super cool the first time you saw them, and after that they because a nusience. plus, half life 2 features no bosses. at all. \n\n     when compared to other games released that year, which i will be using doom 3 and halo 2, the weapons and enemies are still lackluster. doom 3 had the bfg9k, which needs no introduction, a chainsaw, and a weapon called the soul cube, which will become usable after consuming the souls of your enemies, after which, dealing massive damage. and in halo 2, you have duel weilding and many alien weapons, such as the energy sword, gravity hammer, and more. would half life 2 be better off with mechanics like these? debatable, but the purpose of that was to show that half life 2 was not made in an age where all weapons were boring. and yes, it does have the gravity gun, an aanzing weapon. if only valve added in more like it. the weapons feel fine, and nothing more.\n\npart 2 - story\n\n     half life 2s story is confused, and retcons much of half life 1. for example, barney represents the entire security force from black mesa, which us just stupid. barney in as shown in half life blue shift, was the guy gordon saw once on the train ride. they never spoke. how do they know each other? why does barney act like gordons his best friend. barney isnt a bad character, he's just a bad character in the context of who he is from half life 1. the same thing goes for dr kleiner and eli vance. not bad characters, but just bad characters for who we know them as from half life 1. they arent as bad as barney in this department, though. on a similar note, why is gordon freeman practically seen as the messiah? how did anyone even know he killed the nihalanth? the gman plucked him out as soon as he did it. as far as everyone should know, gordon was dead. but nope, the entire world knows what he did, wich in he end, wasnt even that signifacant because the combine took over anyway. half life 1 follows show, dont tell to a tea, but half life 2 will lock you in a room with a character while they just talk and then pause like you're gonna respond. i feel like the story in half life 2 is much cooler if you took out the characters. if you took out the rebellion, if you were left with just gordon and the combine. because gordon freeman isn't a character. he is the player. if the game would take a more hands off approach and treat him as such, it would be better off for it. and besides, we all killed the black mesa employees anyway.\n\npart 3 - setting\n     this is where half life 2 nails it. i really can't complain about it. city 17 is great. thats really all i can say. \n\npart 4 - the episodes\n     episode 1 doesnt change a whole lot, in fact, i'd say it gets a little worse in some departments.\nfirst of all, the weapons are the exact same as the base game, but there is an achievement where you play thru all of episode 1 with only the gravity gun, which makes it much more interesting. episode 1 also introduces zombine, zombified combine which are more powerful. it also adds poisonous headcrabs, and zombies which are covered in poisonous headcrabs. are you starting to notice a trend? its all zombies and headcrabs. its even worse than the base game in this way. somehow. to address the elephant in the room, alyx. alyx is everywhere, and she doesnt shut up. please. this is a cry for help. i'm stuck in an elevator with alyx vance and she wont let me go. send help.\n\n      episode 2 is great, i'd say its better than the base game. first, it adds in white forest, to improve on the already great setting. in regards to the weapons, it doesnt add any new equipable items, but it does add the magnessun sphere, which makes fighting striders much more enjoyable. and it adds a new enemy, the hunter, which is very fun to fight. and the story is pretty good in this one too. it treats you less like jesus christ and more like a guy in the resistance when at the base in white forest. and you meet the guy who's casserole you blew up in half life 1. the gman is also much more important in this one, speaking to the player at multiple points in the game. also less alyx, which is an automatic improvement. overall, episode 2 improves on many of my issues with the base game, and is just good fun.\n\npart 5 - conclusion\n     half life 2 is a great game, and a bad sequel. i love it, but i cant help but like half life 1 more. half life 2 is great, but it isnt perfect.","timestamp_created":1649547730,"timestamp_updated":1659767150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113605858","author":{"steamid":"76561198033048610","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":933,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":927,"last_played":1650624364},"language":"russian","review":"Шикарна

haven't finished this game yet i have 4 chapters left but hell is it a GOOD game some aspects kinda suck. But the best parts are the characters are very well written and are quite funny the cutscenes are amazing since they aren't really cutscenes you are just stuck in  a small room while the characters are talking so that makes the players be interested. Also the puzzel segments the physics and the horror segment are preety neat . The game also kinda has a directors cut level that is additional \"Lost Coast\". I really recommend this AMAZING game but i suggest you should buy The Orange Box instead of just Half-Life 2 but if you don't just don't but atleast in my opinion buy the 2 additional episodes and maybe Lost Coast.\n               ~OVERALL~ Very Good Game I recommend","timestamp_created":1649504220,"timestamp_updated":1649504220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113570595","author":{"steamid":"76561199179281435","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1649534000},"language":"russian","review":":)","timestamp_created":1649500780,"timestamp_updated":1649500780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113569395","author":{"steamid":"76561199081949002","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1832,"last_played":1652889696},"language":"english","review":"Classic, fun and original game.

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a \"hit\" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family.","timestamp_created":1649491128,"timestamp_updated":1649491128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520000040531158447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113564126","author":{"steamid":"76561198362352560","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4301,"last_played":1649874666},"language":"russian","review":"ОА","timestamp_created":1649489944,"timestamp_updated":1649489944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113561659","author":{"steamid":"76561199096246257","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":24,"playtime_at_review":1738,"last_played":1659966273},"language":"english","review":"good

game is literally in all ways better than the first one. It was fun most of the time and 10x less moments that made me want to bomb valve headquarters for making them. The story wasn't necessarily better since it seems the half life games aren't focused on having a story but it at least made sense instead of aimlessly wandering through a suffocating facility with the same colors for 100 hours. I also really liked the new gameplay mechanics like the \"squads\" throughout the game and the gravity gun. Definitely worth trying if it goes on sale","timestamp_created":1649454065,"timestamp_updated":1649454065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113541836","author":{"steamid":"76561199016384824","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":258,"last_played":1651876510},"language":"english","review":"so fun\n","timestamp_created":1649449846,"timestamp_updated":1649449846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113536669","author":{"steamid":"76561199157890937","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":1202,"last_played":1660162449},"language":"brazilian","review":"haha pew pew pow pow\nphack you combine suldiers\noh suuldier who will they ever find to replace you\ndid you know that if a combined soldier does a wrong job, his family will suffer?\nfreeman killed millions of families\nhaha like and sus cribe for more sexy sex sx facts!!\n\ni know where you live\ni live in your walls\ni know you are awake\nlook at your walls.\n","timestamp_created":1649442372,"timestamp_updated":1649442372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113532250","author":{"steamid":"76561199132799316","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":676,"last_played":1649083181},"language":"russian","review":"Прикольна","timestamp_created":1649436338,"timestamp_updated":1649436338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113531112","author":{"steamid":"76561198176703815","num_games_owned":336,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1236,"last_played":1648094224},"language":"spanish","review":"Posta no hay nada que decir sobre Half-Life y su universo.
