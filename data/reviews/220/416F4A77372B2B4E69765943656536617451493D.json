So now we have the sequel that for some is considered to be even better and even has been called game of the decade. I however completely disagree with this sentiment. In this review I will explain why I feel this game isn't that good and why it's imo a big step down from the original game in almost every way. But before that, let's talk about things it does do well first.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n1. The Gravity Gun is a nice addition that adds some layers of depth to the combat, allowing you to grab anything in the environment and use them to your advantage whether it be an explosive Barrell or a saw blade. It also allows you to grab items that are otherwise out of reach.\n\n2. The Characters are really good with Alyx Vance who is a really solid sidekick character who has lots of personality, Barney Calhoun makes his return from Blue Shift and he's also a fun companion with many memorable quotes such as \"About that beer I owed ya\", Mayor Breen takes the role of the villain in this game and he's very charismatic and entertaining to watch, Eli Vance is the father of Alyx Vance and is a pretty chill and laid back guy who just wants things to be good, and there's Dr. Kleiner who is your typical run of the mill scientist.\n\n3. The Physics Puzzles were a nice new addition that did add on to some parts and many games in the future would use them somewhat.\n\n4. The first chapter up till about Ravenholm is mostly solid with Water Hazard and the aformentioned Ravenholm being the 2 highlights of this game. \n\n5. The G-Man is back and better than ever, that's all I need to say about that.\n\n\nBut uhh yeah that's all the positives I can think of..so without further ado, let's talk about the flaws.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n1. The Story is just bad, it has nothing to do with Half-Life 1 outside of forced mentions of the Black Mesa Incident and it just boils down to your average everyday Resistance vs Evil Empire storyline that's been done to death and seen many times both before and after this game, and this game certainly doesn't try to do the story in a unique or interesting way to stand out amongst the rest.\n\n2. The Gunplay is so so but feels a little janky, however unlike Half-Life 1 the gun selection here is pretty poor with guns having weak sound effects to them and they're also worsened by the fact that the amount of ammo you can carry on you for each gun is severely limited. The Magnum for instance can only hold 12 additional bullets at a time, this is really a problem when you consider that there is tons of ammo lying around that you can't even use because the game decides you just aren't allowed to have more.\n\n3. Enemies once again rely on hitscan instead of projectiles, however it's much worse here considering the sheer greater amount of enemies and open areas. I get Hitscan is sorta common but it isn't a problem when implemented well. Half-Life 2 just implements it really poorly so it's a con. There are medkits scattered around too but that doesn't excuse poor design in my eyes.\n\n4. Speaking of Enemies: The Striders warrant their own con because these enemies are total BS, they're essentially giant spider like creatures with guns on them and the only way to take them down is to shoot them with 3 rockets. The problem is that they can shoot down your rockets and if they do, you're left eating their gunfire while you wait for the Rocket to hit the ground and explode just so you can fire another off, not to mention this forces you to scavange for ammo while fighting them which can easily lead you to being killed. The Combine Helicopters also do this and so they get lumped in with this issue.\n\n\n5. The AUX Power meter here causes many problems. Basically put: if you sprint it uses up the meter, if you use your flashlight it uses power and if you swim it uses power. When the meter runs out you have to sit and be patient and wait till it slowly and I do mean slowly recharges so you can do one of the above actions again. This is a problem because if you use your flashlight while swimming it quickly drains your power and you'll drown rather quick. Same goes for if you decide to sprint and the meter goes, no flashlight for you. It's bad\n\n\n6. The level design is pretty poor and generic. They boil down to a bunch of streets, stretches of land or a building, no locations really stand out or are fun to blast through, not to mention sometimes there is a lack of direction in a lot of these levels as well so really the level design is bad.\n\n7. Speaking of levels: The chapters just go on for far too long, the biggest offender is Highway 17 which is the longest of the game and far overstays it's welcome. It basically boils down to Driving the car to an area, fighting some combine with Rebels and then driving off to repeat the process. Also add onto the fact that the Jeep handles like crap and the first person view makes it hard to back up when the Jeep gets stuck, which only leads to more frustration and more time spent on the chapter.\n\n8. On the topic of Chapters: They seriously go downhill after Ravenholm, with awful chapters like the above mentioned Highway 17 but also return to City 17 which boils down to a bunch of hordes of Striders and combine and feels incredibly rushed and lazy.\n\n9. This game lacks a serious atmosphere, the awesome survival horror aspect of the first game is tossed out in favor of a generic by the numbers FPS game that is incredibly repetitive. The World and story also fail to really add any atmosphere to the game. The only part of the game that even remotely has any kind of atmosphere is Ravenholm and it seemed like that would be a return to the Survival Horror style of Half-Life 1, sadly RavenHolm fails to deliver on this despite being an otherwise highlight of the game. The biggest problem is there really is no sense of danger and with Father Grigori treating the killing of Zombies and creatures in Ravenholm as an everyday job or hobby instead of taking it seriously or acting even remotely like he's in danger, the chapter just fails to build a great horror atmosphere that the first game honestly did well.\n\n10. The graphics in this game are abysmal even for 2004 standards. When games like Burnout 3, Metal Gear Solid 3 came out the same year and look far better, you know it's a problem. Hell 007 Nightfire for GameCube, Xbox and PS2 looks far better than this game and that game came out 2 years prior in 2002!!. This isn't even bringing up Doom 3 which completely blows this game out of the water.\n\n11. Once again Gordon Freeman doesn't speak and this is a problem considering there is a more consistent cast of characters in this game so it really makes them look like they're talking to a ghost and ruins a lot of tension the plot could've had. Oh and on the topic of Gordon and the other characters? Why does everyone treat him as some sort of legendary hero and why does he trust anyone and just instantly accepts being a part of the resistance? If I woke up from years of stasis, I'd question everyone and seriously ask what the hell is going on here, because the fact that Gordon doesn't bat an eye at anything going on is seriously just bad storywriting.\n\n\n\nSo yeah as a whole this game is very flawed. While again I feel it isn't a bad game, but I can't help but feel harsher on it when people constantly talk it up like it's the best game ever when it really isn't and imo has very obvious flaws that hinder the experience. The first game had it's issues for sure, but I feel the positives far outweighed them, Here though it feels like things actively bringing down the experience. I feel mostly the game screams missed potential with many cool ideas not being executed well. I'd say only get this for cheap and if you want to play them all.\n\nI would give Half-Life 2 a 5.5/10","timestamp_created":1606709104,"timestamp_updated":1652241485,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.419634163379669189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81163342","author":{"steamid":"76561197961158140","num_games_owned":392,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":201,"last_played":1403058067},"language":"english","review":"Just

the best game of all time. You can find here 14 amazing chapters, most of them being the most climatic ones I have ever seen in any video game (the revolution in the city 17 is quite boring as it is just TONS of combines throwed at you every 5 seconds that you have to defeat in order to continue your jurney). Here are my ratings:\n\nPoint insertion: 9/10 - Very good introduction to the game - sets the overall game direction, lets you interact and play with the enviroment without anybody bothering you during it.\n\n\"A red letter day\": 8/10 - Really short one, but does its purpose very well (\"fabular start chapter\").\n\nRoute kanal: 8/10 - Introduction to first enemy types very good climate while travelling through the canals. One really nice \"escape the helicopter part\".\n\nWater hazard: 9/10 - I do not know why, but the peace it sometimes offers just gets me. Also keeps you engaged with some small fights with enemy squads.\n\nBlack mesa east: 8/10 - Really short chapter just like \"Red letter day\" does a fabular purpose, not much more to say about it except that it just does it well.\n\n\"We don't go to revenholm...\": 10/10 - One of the few \"10s\" i gave to any chapter in any game - as a horror, shooter, and dark plot fan this chapter just checks all the boxes for me and from what I know other people as well, the puzzles are great, the combat as well sometimes got scared by a jumpscare but not often (mostly becouse i play horrors to much to get scared by a black headcrab jumpng from the tdark too many times) and the dark plot that it has makes this chapter perfect for me).\n\nHighway 17: 10/10 - After a great chapter another comes afterwards, I heard from other people that it is not that great becouse it is boring and the car mechanics are junky made. I only agree with the car, YES the controls are sometimes really bad but I don't think that it makes the chapter itself bad. The climate that it has is the greatest I have ever encountered in any game. Rideing through these clifs and coasts with a giant abyss just next to you buys me leaving no chance for other chapters. It also has some encounters with enemy squads to keep you not asleep and some puzzles to keep your mind working.\n\nSandtraps: 9/10 - The chapter for the most part looks exacly the same as the previous one, I don't really know why they separated them from each other. The only part that is different is the jumping one at the end that I do not really like becouse it is quite frustrating so that's why I gaved it one point less.\n\nNova prospekt: 7/10 - Not so high rating becouse of the fact that this chapter has too many enemy encounters but it is not that bad the climate is preserved and that is the most important factor for me. I also like the dark feeling of knowing how many bad things happened in the Nova prospekt prison.\n\nEntanglement: 8/10 - Quite similar to the  previous one but It has less enemy fights and more puzzles which lack of could be feelt in Nova prospekt chapter - has a good balance of all Half-Life games that I know and love.\n\nAnticitizen one: 4/10 - This one and the next one are the two and the only chapters that I just don't like. It looses all climate and exchanges it for TONS of fights with enemy groups and I get that some people like it but I think it doesn't fit in this game, I would rather it was not here, to be instantly teleported by rebelians to the citadel and start my part with the revolution from there while others are fighting in the town... \n\nFollow Freeman: 6/10 - Just like the previous one this chapter really suffers from lack of climate. It starts with a quite long part looking simularly to Route kanal chapter which I really like but then it turns into Anticitizen One part 2 not a long time after. I don't have anything else than what I have already written in the previous chapter rating so let's just go the the next one...\n\nOur benefactors: 9/10 - After two bad ones we again get a really good one - in the middle has a GREAT plot twist that turns the game to completly other but as many things this game does it does it well. We get another portion of very good climate. The whole place looks completly different than what we have seen before and the we for the first encounter higher amounts of combine elites. I thing this makes it a REALLY well made endgame chapter.\n\nDark energy: 9/10 - This chapter is very short and does purely a purpose of an ending. We have a final fight here which was meaby not the most epic but for sure one of the better ones I have seen in a video game. Also the feeling of the game being incomplete after the G-man appers for the final time really did its purpose of me wanting to play Half-Life 2: episode one after this game...\n\nOverally even though I didn't give 10/10 to all chapters (in fact to MOST of them) ALL of these chapters, the bad and the good ones, really fit together and they make an overally GREAT game that I recomend you to play. The achievements are also well made and don't require you to ruin your playthrough. Most of them just requires you to be more patient and that just makes you enjoy the game better, focus on details you would normaly miss. Here are some overall ratings if you are still not sure to buy this game or you are just simply curious about my opinion:\n\nPlot: 10/10\n\nClimate: 10/10\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n\n\nOVERALL: 10/10\n\nAnd trust me I am demanding and don't give \"10s\" to everything (in fact this is the only game that got 10/10 overall rating).\n\nI hope I helped you decide. I personaly think everybody should play a classic such as this game...","timestamp_created":1606683927,"timestamp_updated":1607959575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81124406","author":{"steamid":"76561198071962916","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1290,"last_played":1650538604},"language":"english","review":"Probably

Имея революционную на то время графику, физику и сюжет, я не удивлён, почему она стала такой популярной. Я купил набор со всеми играми данной серии, и на за что не жалею. Данный набор с такими шедеврами как ХЛ1, ДЛС к ней, ХЛ2 и все ДЛС к ней, ХЛ2 Десмач, ХЛ Соурс и ХЛ Соурс Десмач (а вот эти две игры уже посредственные) и ТФ Классик определённо стоит своих денег, а со скидкой тем более!
