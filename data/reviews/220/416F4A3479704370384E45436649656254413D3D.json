The game is full of little challenges; parkour, mind puzzles, mazes, and just when you think that you've reached a safezone - BOOM! - there's some new enemy to fight. Ravenholme had me terrified, and I think it was because of the pacing and the atmosphere. \n\nThe ending of the game is the next thing I'm going to ramble on about. (Don't worry, no spoilers.) The ending of this game left me asking so many questions. I have yet to play Episode One or Episode Two, but from what I've heard Episode Two comes with an even bigger cliffhanger. I can't describe how amazingly cryptic the ending to Half Life 2 is, you'll just have to experience it yourself. \n\n9/10 Pacing\n\n10/10 Soundtrack\n\n9/10 Story\n\n9/10 Graphics (For 2004)\n\n10/10 DOG","timestamp_created":1451287051,"timestamp_updated":1451287051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20023354","author":{"steamid":"76561198076266804","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1820,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1728,"last_played":1553576795},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2 is a game when you are finished with it, you think its need a sequal. \nBut when that sequal comes out and you finish it, you demand another sequal.\nAnd soon after that, you keep wanting more sequals.\nToo bad valve doesen't like numbers after two.\n10/10","timestamp_created":1451282713,"timestamp_updated":1451282713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20022065","author":{"steamid":"76561198016640796","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1187,"last_played":1563056273},"language":"english","review":"I can't believe I hadn't played this sooner.

Снова загружаемся. 4 минуты игры - синий экран и хард ресет. Ладно, может что-то с системой. Переустанавливаем систему по-чистому. Все работает. Batman Arkham Knight - 70+ FPS на максималках, StarCraft 2 - идет без нареканий, GTA, Saints Row - все отлично идет. Запускаем HL2 - 6 минут и синий экран. Коды ошибок недвусмысленно указывают на отсуствие оптимизации под Win 7 х64, обращение к устаревшим драйверам и посему - падение системы/откат драйверов. Тогда возникает вопрос: почему неоптимизировано? И если так, то игра должна вообще отдаваться бесплатно. Сколько лет прошло - это раз, под старшие системы оптимизации минимум - это два.
