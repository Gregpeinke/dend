That cliff-hanger is certainly one of the more infamous ones. Even now, I cannot believe they left it off with that for over ten years. But Valve are a dedicated group, and are finally coming back to us, the players and the fans. \n\nAs for the game in question here, it's great. The terrain-morphing still looks awesome, the writing here is even better and more heart-felt... I could even argue that non-fans would be able to just jump into this game to see all of its fun moments. \n\nOnce again, Valve was able to effectively iterate on Half-Life 2's previous ideas. I adore the many set-pieces, that INCREDIBLE G-Man cutscene, and the tangible tensions that you're presented with as a player. It's a much more dramatic experience from Episode 1, and it uses all of its cards to the fullest -- all jam-packed into a short 4-hour experience. I mean, damn, that is impressive in itself. \n\nYeah, that last-section was tedious, long, and frustrating, but everything around it is still as strong as you can get in terms of the franchise.\n\nAnd, since this is the last main-line Half-Life review of mine until another sequel comes out, I want to mention how incredible Kevin Bailey was for the Half-Life series. Seriously, he fucking nailed it, from 1-Episode 2. Every track has a place, every sound effect is almost hauntingly memorable. I miss him as the sound designer and composer, but Jesus, Episode 2 was a great way to go out. And his final stride would be Portal, which is another discussion for another time. \n\nThis game totally represents all the strengths of Valve and its previous writers, level designers, and composers. You wanna know why they're one of the best? Here ya go.","timestamp_created":1602987222,"timestamp_updated":1602987222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77734838","author":{"steamid":"76561198880662899","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1610304327},"language":"english","review":"epic gordon adventure but cliff hanger bad and im poor and cant afford half life alyx","timestamp_created":1602984749,"timestamp_updated":1602984749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77731277","author":{"steamid":"76561198865608702","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1603075184},"language":"english","review":"advisors are just space worms","timestamp_created":1602978165,"timestamp_updated":1602978165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77710845","author":{"steamid":"76561198978235664","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":226,"last_played":1602950548},"language":"schinese","review":"G胖不会数三:(","timestamp_created":1602950582,"timestamp_updated":1602950582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77701793","author":{"steamid":"76561198412996786","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":93,"playtime_at_review":433,"last_played":1660475838},"language":"english","review":"Best game of its time.","timestamp_created":1602939387,"timestamp_updated":1602939387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77701010","author":{"steamid":"76561198350583817","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67,"last_played":1636326822},"language":"russian","review":"Я только начал проходить!
