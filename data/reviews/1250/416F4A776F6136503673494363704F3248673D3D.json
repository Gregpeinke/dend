Wow. \n\nThis game is... odd. To say the least. Don't be scared off by its massive amount of professed gore, as in the game image, this is not how the actual game looks or feels. It feels as if it's run off of a very old source engine, but that's not actually a bad thing. It brings back the old Doom-style play-style of things that go in one line and try to kill you. The headshot dynamics are quite fun, and really the only way to handle the higher difficulties of this game. The only drawback, I'd say, is the network connectivity. As the Source engine it's handled on does not work well with multiplayer connections with single private peers, it's often hard to connect even with a person playing the same game. This drawback is almost nullified by the massive amount of multiplayer servers in it itself. The leveling system is quite intricate, even in the bulky non-conforming pattern of previous source engine games. It takes a while to level up, and you have to complete various tasks to do so. A lot of times. The weapons themselves have interesting personalities, and the developers of this game are still updating it as time goes on. All in all, a very good game. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a wave-by-wave first person shooter that has an incredible community, a sweet old-style feel, and wonderful husks.","timestamp_created":1386616248,"timestamp_updated":1397671872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7984930","author":{"steamid":"76561198009461674","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12447,"last_played":1405486140},"language":"english","review":"Need a game where you can mindlessly kill things alongside 5 other friends?

I have 360 total hours put into this game, which is extremely high considering my gaming ADD, especially after I complete what I feel I \"need\" to do.\n\nBut that's all just points towards my review on this game.  No matter what other game I buy, try, and enjoy, I always find myself coming back to Killing Floor.  There's just something about the way the game works that draws me in, and I love every minute of it.  The waves mechanic is fun, as well as the co-op play with your friends or even random strangers on a server.  There's plenty of a selection of weapons for each class, and each class has it's own perks.  Not to mention the seasonal promotions they have every year for Summer, Halloween and Christmas.  Tripwire continues to support this game when many developers would have dropped it to make their next big plan come to fruition.  New weapons are introduced every so often, as are new player skins.  This is usually DLC, but, considering the price of the game, is well worth it to customize yourself a little further.\n\nOverall, this game has had me hooked since the day I bought it YEARS ago, and I still play it avidly to this day.  I give this a full 10/10, and I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy shooting zombies (specimens, they're called on here), teamwork, and relentless onslaughts of enemies.  That feeling when you complete a long, suicidal (or harder) game with a pack of friends, man, and you see that achievement flash up on your screen?  One of the best gaming feelings you'll ever get.","timestamp_created":1386577559,"timestamp_updated":1386577559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7979870","author":{"steamid":"76561198074176109","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1495,"last_played":1439951937},"language":"english","review":"Having to get new weapons everytime you die is really a killing chore.","timestamp_created":1386577380,"timestamp_updated":1386577380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7979736","author":{"steamid":"76561197963953229","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1336,"last_played":1430403556},"language":"russian","review":"Очень красивый зомби шутер!","timestamp_created":1386575677,"timestamp_updated":1386575677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7979699","author":{"steamid":"76561198010306083","num_games_owned":366,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2543,"last_played":1357286400},"language":"english","review":"This is a game that Ryan wants me to play","timestamp_created":1386575316,"timestamp_updated":1386575316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7979689","author":{"steamid":"76561198065449616","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":425,"last_played":1571942021},"language":"english","review":"A very great game especially with friends, and very nice players","timestamp_created":1386575148,"timestamp_updated":1386575148,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7979666","author":{"steamid":"76561198001431530","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":445,"last_played":1374434411},"language":"russian","review":"Трешняк тот еще =))","timestamp_created":1386574672,"timestamp_updated":1386574672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7979535","author":{"steamid":"76561197972978926","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6080,"last_played":1491614116},"language":"dutch","review":"owyeah!!!!","timestamp_created":1386572939,"timestamp_updated":1386572939,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7979476","author":{"steamid":"76561198017316728","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":7629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6777,"last_played":1497843106},"language":"english","review":"This is one of those hidden gems only Steam can offer.

While it seems most enjoyable when playing with a friend, there's still a lot of fun to be had solo (but it's likely to be more challenging until you get the hang of it). There's a large number of maps bundled with the game, and most--though not all--are designed very well with a nice balance of flow and defendability.\n\nOn the downside, I expected a little more enemy variety (not counting model swaps that seem to be seasonal), especially with regards to the Patriarch--who'll you'll fight at the end of every single match. It was also off-putting to me just how much content is paid DLC, and how that fact is right in your face most of the time.  That being said, there's still a lot of content in the base game, and the DLC tends to be just icing on the cake. There's also some free content released every now and then.\n\nPros:\n- Very satisfying combat\n- Rewarding skill progression\n- Excellent co-op, great solo play\n- Good map selection\n\nCons:\n- In-your-face paid DLC\n- Limited enemy variety","timestamp_created":1386555793,"timestamp_updated":1386555793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7977672","author":{"steamid":"76561198040883231","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1405,"last_played":1562880286},"language":"english","review":"I love this game.  At first glance I was afraid it was just another Left 4 Dead style game, but it really does manage to distinguish itself.  You fight off waves of enemies, and can weld doors to create defensible areas (though the enemies can break them down).  It's emphasis on defense over mobility really appeals to me. \n\n That being said, you DO need to keep moving as well.  The maps are freaking huge and after every wave you have a limited time to get to the store (which changes location each wave), so you end up rushing over and then just finding the nearest place to defend until the next wave is nearly beaten, and then rushing off again.\n\nI like the class system as well.  Commandos, for example, can see invisible enemies and all enemy health bars when no other class can.  Asymetrical gameplay for the win!\n\nI also like the difficulty levels.  Enemies get more health, sure, but the time between waves gets shorter, money gets harder to get, etc etc.  The effect is that on the easiest difficulty you really are just learning the game (no time or money pressure), which is always nice.  Once I got a feel for the mechanics going up in difficulty wasn't that hard (even though I wasn't too high a level yet).  From what I understand the highest difficulty levels require huge amounts of strategy, so I'm not there yet, but it sounds like it'll be a fun end-game.","timestamp_created":1386555000,"timestamp_updated":1386555000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7977594","author":{"steamid":"76561198035019909","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8663,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8549,"last_played":1410147108},"language":"english","review":"Best Zombie survival game ever.","timestamp_created":1386554533,"timestamp_updated":1386554533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501557648181915283","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7977460","author":{"steamid":"76561197961558817","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8102,"last_played":1452147741},"language":"english","review":"the most pointless game of all time. lots of fun however","timestamp_created":1386553598,"timestamp_updated":1386553598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7977457","author":{"steamid":"76561198083702022","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1586194646},"language":"english","review":"This game is simply amazing.But in a way this game is more complex then you think.Trying to take this game on normal or hard difficulty for the first time is way to hard.It is most suggested to play with a friend.","timestamp_created":1386553578,"timestamp_updated":1386553578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534883737564086914","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7977416","author":{"steamid":"76561198104024848","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":621,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":330,"last_played":1425772401},"language":"english","review":"Great game, very cool to play with friends I totally recommend it.","timestamp_created":1386553338,"timestamp_updated":1386553338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7977147","author":{"steamid":"76561198054453482","num_games_owned":402,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":335,"last_played":1404113401},"language":"english","review":"Its fun its fucked up and its a good way to waste time with friends","timestamp_created":1386551785,"timestamp_updated":1386551785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7977119","author":{"steamid":"76561198055517321","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":923,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1537010024},"language":"english","review":"a fun game\n","timestamp_created":1386551629,"timestamp_updated":1386551629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7976970","author":{"steamid":"76561198109606362","num_games_owned":1924,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":2172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1540476349},"language":"english","review":"This game is awsome sometimes better than left 4 dead.
