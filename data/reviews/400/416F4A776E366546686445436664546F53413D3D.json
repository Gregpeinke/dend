Das Problem ist, dass das Spiel sehr kurz ist (ca. 5 Stunden, wenn man gut ist), weswegen man das Spiel schnell durchgespielt hat, und aufgrund des fehlenden Mehrspielermodus´, keinen Content mehr bietet. Wenn man das Spiel einmal durchgespielt hat, ist alles, was einem blebt, es nochmal durchzuspielen, was ich sehr schade finde. Das Spiel ist für 9,99€ allerdingst nicht zu teuer, da es einen schönen Zeitvertreib darstellt, sich durch Testkammern zu rätseln.\nIch kann das Spiel sehr empfehlen, da die Story abwechslungsreich und mit vielen verschiedenen Mechaniken geprägt ist. \nMein Rating: 8/10","timestamp_created":1447856423,"timestamp_updated":1491642182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19143895","author":{"steamid":"76561198003587212","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":262,"last_played":1447685644},"language":"portuguese","review":"Um bom jogo para passar o tempo.","timestamp_created":1447852771,"timestamp_updated":1447852771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19143383","author":{"steamid":"76561198086570037","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1435160799},"language":"english","review":"Stupidly confusing.\n\nI'll rate this\n1 Companion Cube / 1 Companion Cube.\n\nGLaDOS, the coldest person(?)

You try to escape.\nBefore you crucify me for saying it, let me continue. The monologues of Glados are great to listen to. The sense of humour is amazing and it even is able to make you feel bad for knocking over the turrets.\n\nGameplay:\nThey managed to make this game complicated with a very simple mechanic, which is the portal system. Basically a teleport system, which you use to solve puzzles with. One cool thing about it is that instead of using physics on other stuff to solve puzzles, you use physics on yourself to go through the puzzle.\n\nDifficulty:\nIt's a puzzle game with no real help after the tutorial levels. For me it was fairly challenging, but I'm not really into puzzle games anyway. The game is about 2-3hrs and skilled players can finish it in even 1-2hrs.\n\nOverall:\nThis is a good-looking puzzle game with a fair bit of humour. If you're into puzzle games get this game now.

В этот портал провалится охранная турель и упадет на вторую турель с потолка. Потому, что в потолке вы сделали второй портал. Затем вслед за турелью вы сами прыгаете в первый, стреляете в стену, под действием гравитации набираете скорость и вылетаете из второго.\nВ \"Portal\" можно увидеть себя с 3 сторон одновременно. А можно вывалится из потолка вниз головой. Можно выпрыгнуть из стены и набирая скорость влететь в другую стену, в то время как под ногами будет гореть смертельный огонь. В этой игре мы научились использовать силу притяжения и воспринимать любую стену как возможность спрыгнуть с потолка на пол. Как бы странно это не звучало, но гравитация тут ощущается совершенно по другому.\nРеализация выше всяких похвал. \"Portal\" игра одной идеи, но так как тут это сделано, другой команде-разработчику повторить было бы невероятно сложно. Несомненным достоинством является и сюжет, который не блещет глубиной, но при наличии фантазии наваливается на игрока всей своей атмосферностью. Да один тортик чего стоит. Оценить это произведение сложно, потому, что \"Portal\" не обычная игра. Это скорее реализация технической задумки. Однако я уверен, что во время финальных титров и трека \"Still Alive\", вы будете просить еще и искренне чувствовать восхищение от проведенного за \"Portal\" времени.\nРейтинг - 90/100\n","timestamp_created":1447582545,"timestamp_updated":1447582545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19089579","author":{"steamid":"76561198203569489","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":335,"last_played":1449393359},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego sorprendente en toda regla, es bastante corto una hora, horita y media pero muy muy interesante.","timestamp_created":1447577745,"timestamp_updated":1447577745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19088938","author":{"steamid":"76561198155884237","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1658616185},"language":"polish","review":"fajna gierka ;) ale Portal2 lepsze ;)","timestamp_created":1447574425,"timestamp_updated":1447574425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19088843","author":{"steamid":"76561198191356863","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":347,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":274,"last_played":1589814314},"language":"polish","review":"Super gra polecam!\n\nPlusy:\n+ładna grafika\n+ciekawa fabuła \n+zrozumiałe poziomy (czasem \"rozkmina\")\nMinusy:\n-mało poziomów\n\nGra warta polecenia.\n","timestamp_created":1447573855,"timestamp_updated":1447573855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19088717","author":{"steamid":"76561198157660188","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":178,"last_played":1423296295},"language":"english","review":"Do you know how to do a 360 no scope portal shot?\n\nNo?\n\nYou failed me, Timmy, so disappointed\n\n10/10 \nPlease buy this game for real, do not pirate it, I repeat, DO NOT PIRATE IT!","timestamp_created":1447573142,"timestamp_updated":1447573142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn6eFhdECfdToSA=="}
