о прохождении которой невозможно забыть[/h1]\nСтоит признать, что Portal 2 - лучшая трёхмерная головоломка. В этой игре просиходит некая компенсация многих мелочей по сравнению с первой частью, и вот несколько отличий:\n1. Игра стала длиннее и даже самый быстрый спидран имеет длину аж в 58 минут. \n2. Разнообразие здесь огромное, больше различных мелких деталей, локаций, новые элементы головоломок и многое другое. \n3. Редизайн многих вещей стал большим плюсом. ГЛэДОС выглядит более живой с новой внешностью, модули стали более человечными и т.д.\n4. Сложность головоломок тоже тут проявляется, при чём, очень с хорошим переходом. Каждую главу мы узнаем о новых приспособлениях, постепенно игра заставляет нас напрягать мозги всё больше и больше, что приятно как никак. \n5. Русский дубляж... Он тут шикарен. ГЛэДОС больше не говорит безэмоциональным и скучным голосом, а человечным, приятным голосом. Турели получили няшный и писклявый голосок как в оригинале, что делает их очень милыми. \n6. Сюжет, да, он тут тоже теперь есть. В первой части мы довольно плохо получаем информацию о предыстории, но здесь это подправленно, и нам её подают очень аккуратно, на протяжении всей игры. \n7. Кооператив. Кроме шикарной одиночной кампании, в игру добавили увлекательный кооператив с двумя роботами. Сюжет есть вообщем-то и там. При желании можно включить микрофон, а можно общаться и просто по чату. \n8. Достижения. Не многие увлекаются получением достижений в играх, но здесь их действительно интересно получать. Достижения тут добавляют небольшую мотивацию играть больше. \nВот вообщем такой список, ну а так, игра явно останется на месте одной из самых крутых головоломок за историю на очень долгое время.

Our camera is hijacked by a robot Whitley (a module, in the sense of a small robot) responsible for the safety of all people in the complex, then he accidentally resurrects GLADOSS and we have to kick her robotic ass again. Then we dance to her tune while Whitley comes up with an escape plan. We run, turn off the turret factory, such cute robots that kill all living things in sight, close the production of neurotoxin, and go straight to GLADOSS. There, after pressing the button, we betray Whitley's control, he wants to let us go, makes potatoes out of GLADOSS, freaks out, and throws us into a chasm several kilometers long. We survive, go through the trials again, and kick Whitley's ass, together with GLADOSS, by opening a portal in space and sending him to KO-O-O-O-O-OSMO-O-O-OS!

[/url] [/td] [/tr][/table]\n\n[h1]Portal 2 is a Masterpiece![/h1]\nPortal 2 is amazing. It is the most well-rounded, thought out, and polished game that i have ever played. It is the single highest rated game on steam, and one of the most iconic video games of all time. I think it may even be my favourite game of all time.\n\n[h2] Sum-Up[/h2]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Pros[/th]\n        [th]Cons[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\n        1.

It is truly worth every cent.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Content & Replay Value:[/th]\n        [td]The campaign will take you around 5 hours to complete, and with over 700k workshop items and great fun in coop, I would say the replay value in this game is more then enough.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h2]Pros[/h2]\n[b]1. [/b]\nYour goal is once again to escape. The writing and the way that the plot develops has a perfect execution, and all of the world building that takes place throughout the narrative makes sense and fits perfectly into the lore of the world. On top of this, the pacing of the world is perfect and split onto various sections with a different major event happening in each of them. The story is great and when you think you get it, it turns the entire story around and flips up the characters. As you’re working towards your escape, the plot line serves as a backdrop for the puzzles and problems that you’re solving along the way. It is the perfect balance between narrative and gameplay, and everything ties together perfectly.\n\n[b]2.[/b]\nMany games struggle with humor. They either try too hard, and create unbelievable and unrealistic characters, or they don’t try hard enough, and it ends up being too serious. I believe Portal 2 is the perfect middle ground. GLaDOS constantly hurls insults at you, and the humor is extremely dark and depressing. It makes her into a much more well-rounded villain, and adds some depth to what would otherwise be a stale and overdone redemption story. Many of the jokes in this game had me laughing out loud and it seemed extremely fitting with the setting and situation. Her dark and dry humor is accented perfectly with Wheatly’s charismatic and energetic personality, and the combo go together perfectly. The underlying comedy helps to turn the story into something much more lively and engaging. \n\n[b]3. [/b]\nThe puzzles in portal are absolutely mind-bending. They make use of objects in the environment, as well as the levels themselves, and even the physics system in the game. You cant simply portal your way to the other side, you have to make use of light bridges, lasers, jump pads, and other entities in order to overcome the obstacles that you’re presented with. Not to mention the addition of the gels that really change up the gameplay from the first game and make for some interesting puzzles later on in your play through. Long story short, the puzzles in Portal 2 are amazing!\n\n[b]4. [/b]\nYou can play through portal 2 in single-player mode, and go through the story with all of its ups and downs. And this is where a majority of this review is centered, but imagine going through the rooms with not two, but four portals. The complexity found in the puzzles really shines when you put your head together with a friend in order to figure out what the hell is going on. The Co-Op is about 5 hours long and you can team up with a friend to try and make it through all of the challenging levels without the story and plot found in the campaign. It is more of a cooperative puzzle-solving experience instead of a plot, and it really requires good teamwork. \n\n[h2]Cons / Bugs[/h2]\nI find it truly rare these days to find a game with no cons or bugs. It is just my subjective opinion, but even so, it is very rare that I find games like this. I believe it is important to note that, and it should get some praise for being so great.\n\n[h3]The Judgement: Portal 2 is a true masterpiece[/h3]\nThe outstanding story, awesome puzzles and amazing humor is showcased due to the simplicity and intentionality found in this game. Everything in the game is there for a reason, and that reason is highlighted once again by the amazing story. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and challenging game.\n\n[table]    [tr] [td] [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40524737/] Follow my Curator Page if you want to see more of my reviews!
