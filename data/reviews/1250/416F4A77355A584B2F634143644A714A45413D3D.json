It seems to run on even the lowest grade of pcs. I've never had an issue with it, and I've enjoyed every moment I've spent playing it. Definately a must buy. If you are afraid of zombies and putting off buying this game because of it, please note that you eventually figure out how the zombies are coded and it becomes more of a 'kill the target' game rather than 'oh sweet baby Rassilon, I'm being attacked by zombies' game. There are skill types so you can play with the weapons that you are most comfortable with. For me that is Melee, and for one of my friends, that's Medic. They usually dress up the game for each holiday, so that's always incredibly entertaining.","timestamp_created":1381109809,"timestamp_updated":1381109809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7325327","author":{"steamid":"76561198020507313","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":834,"last_played":1535809281},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego on-line.

Foi lançado em 2009 e ganhou bastante destaque na época, alcançando o topo de vendas da Steam. Em 2012 a Tripwire notificou que o jogo havia vendido mais de 1 milhão de cópias, um número considerado, pois só tem portabilidade para computador. O jogo é no estilo survivor horror, focado no multiplayer. O player terá que trabalhar em equipe para conseguir vencer as hordas de monstros zumbis, que surgirão no decorrer do jogo, além das hordas irem aumentando em número aparecerá uma variedade de monstros maior, alguns no estilo mini-boss. Colocando dificuldade e variando o combate, isto exige que os players se organizem e façam estratégias, não é possível ganhar as partidas se todos ficarem correndo pelo mapa, a estratégia principal é manter o time\npor perto. Como é um jogo de classes, será preciso interação entre elas, cada classe tem a sua função especifica que juntas tornam o grupo muito forte capaz de sobreviver. Apesar de ser um jogo sem história e o inimigo ser apenas a IA. Não é um jogo fácil e para se alcançar níveis altos e jogar em dificuldades maiores é preciso dedicação e aprendizado de jogo. A produtora faz um trabalho fantástico para manter este jogo vivo, ainda está muito ativo em 2013. A Tripwire liberou um SDK onde a comunidade desenvolveu uma infinidade de mapas novos, e até mods de jogo. Há servidores onde é possível se jogar com uma quantidade muito grande de jogadores e não apenas 4 como no tradicional. Além disso há sempre eventos em determinadas épocas do ano onde o jogo passa por uma atualização e os mapas e inimigos ganham uma cara nova para a festividade, por exemplo no dia das bruxas. É um jogo simples de uma maneira geral, para mim é mais um jogo que vence devido a sua simplicidade. Como é um jogo leve pode ser jogado em qualquer computador comprado atualmente, notebook etc. E até em computadores mais antigos, as constantes promoções trazem jogadores novos ao game. Acredito que este jogo possa ser jogado por pessoas que não estão muito dentro dos games, é um ótimo jogo introdutório. Não posso mencionar a trilha sonora é interessante, acredito que sejam músicas desenvolvidas para o jogo, pois elas se encaixam perfeitamente no ambiente do jogo. É um jogo que deve ser lembrado, dizem que na sua versão mod, inspirou no desenvolvimento do maior e mais famoso Left 4 Dead. Possuo 50 horas de jogo e recomendo, principalmente para quem não tem um PC potente e quer ter um jogo de qualidade, que pode ser jogado todos os dias.","timestamp_created":1380137651,"timestamp_updated":1380137651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4583354","author":{"steamid":"76561198039373430","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7082,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5934,"last_played":1554386908},"language":"english","review":"6/5 you need this awesome game","timestamp_created":1380121515,"timestamp_updated":1511741375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2479224","author":{"steamid":"76561198007989044","num_games_owned":4094,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":22754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13608,"last_played":1622723844},"language":"russian","review":"Честно говоря, примитивная концепция и механика, но чертовски затягивает.
