The only downsides were that the controls were a bit janky, the speed along with the collision physics of the player sometimes was weird when going over platforming obstacles, but I guess it's because I have played many more newer games and wasn't familiar with the older game movement, I would just recommend to save the game multiple times thorughout the platforming puzzles if you want to make it easier.

Honestly, starting with the next installment, Half-Life 2, it does a decent job basically creating an entirely different storyline. If you're a big fan of getting ALL of the in-jokes and references, then yes, plot-wise you could start here for sure.\n\nIt's fairly short, about a ten hour romp. It's the oldest game I've every actually played and finished, and I have to admit I think they were still in the midst of figuring out how to scale difficulty back in 1998 (you can save anywhere so it's not a big deal, but there were plenty of times I'd be reloading a save like a hundred darn times).\n\nOverall it's a very fun shooter with lots of atmosphere and action and comedy and everything you can ask for. You can see how this short little escape from a strange scientific facility became the starting point for one of the biggest names in gaming.\n\nHELLO GORDON haahhahahahahahah funy GORDON

It's a great fps that defined the new way of storytelling. Has a lot of cool guns and enemies and plot and generally there's just a lot of great stuff. However it's also an old game. Graphics aren't THAT bad but still, they're from 1998. You can also find some bugs here and there, for example I got stuck in the vent corner a lot of times. And of course, the Xen dimension. Damn it's bad. Jumping, jumping, jumping and then you die because you couldn't reach the next platform when long-jumping. Xen has a potential to look good - just look at Black Mesa screens - and in Half-Life it doesn't. Don't get me wrong, Half-Life still is awesome - until you go to Xen. The final boss is good. I enjoyed it. However I still have this feeling that Black Mesa did everything just better even though I haven't play it yet while writing this review so I'm just depending on reviews and screens I've seen in the internet. I will play Black Mesa and then I will update if in my opinion it's worth to play Half-Life or skip it and go straight to Black Mesa. For now, still depending only on the internet reviews and screens from Black Mesa, I'd say that you can skip Half-Life and play Black Mesa instead unless you are big fan of Half-Life series, 'cause for example you played HL2 and episodes at first- then I think you should know the original.","timestamp_created":1641323154,"timestamp_updated":1641323154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107318943","author":{"steamid":"76561198029661665","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6,"playtime_at_review":1357,"last_played":1660501541},"language":"english","review":"This

was drawn to Half-Life by its place in the history of video games, and its reputation as one of the greatest games of all time. Though it was certainly important for its time, I would not strongly recommend it for anyone looking for an extremely engaging experience, especially if they are more interested in story than (undoubtably good) gameplay. The atmosphere and plot are exciting at the beginning, but the game progressed at a very slow pace, and lost its wonderful creepiness after a while. By the final scenes, I was expecting to be rewarded for many long hours I had put into Freeman's battle, but I never found the epic climax I was hoping for. I must admit that due to some 'technical issues' I was not able to reach the very end of the game, so I will be charitable and say I probably missed something. In the final analysis, I think this game is a bit overrated, though I am sure there will be many who disagree with me.","timestamp_created":1641306312,"timestamp_updated":1641306312,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518654227256774902","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107299994","author":{"steamid":"76561199036088993","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":966,"last_played":1646587935},"language":"english","review":"This is a great game.
