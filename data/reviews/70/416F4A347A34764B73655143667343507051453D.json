It's stil buggy, the invisible bullet spread is as insipid as it has ever been, meaning full-auto will render your bullets useless after a second, because the people who made this game never shot a gun in their lives. \n\nThere are plenty of sudden-death traps requiring plenty of trial and error, because that's something every action fan loves. The levels are mostly linear, with dead-ends and sudden-death traps showing you otherwise. Not to mention that the aiming, for the weapons that do exist, is shit. The weapons handle like shit, are mostly boring and completely secondary to playing the game. \n\nMost of the time you will be exploiting cover, exploting the stupid ai, waiting for the insta-death helicopters to fly past you (because waiting and doing nothing for extended periods of time is fun and meaningful), navigating the mazes with death traps. \n\nIf anything, this game has always been overrated and I've never completed this game ever, nor will I, because of how boring it ends up being towards the end. \n\nThere are plenty of good games showcasing GOOD aspects of nostalgic shooters, this has never been one of them. Shooting games should have satisfying guns, good shooting mechanics and if there are puzzles, make them interesting, not tedious. \n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1531001388,"timestamp_updated":1531001388,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.451233327388763428","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43385749","author":{"steamid":"76561198268716990","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":985,"last_played":1605294361},"language":"turkish","review":"Çocukluğumuzun oyunu, az oynamadık, süpürge kullanan şerefsizdir dedik iyi tamam güzel de\n\nOyunu aldım oynuyorum silahların görünümleri normal bildiğimizden farklı  bende?","timestamp_created":1530998073,"timestamp_updated":1530998314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43385738","author":{"steamid":"76561198256322106","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1551974610},"language":"english","review":"it's an old game but still nice to play","timestamp_created":1530998047,"timestamp_updated":1530998047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43385437","author":{"steamid":"76561198836266774","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1657498861},"language":"english","review":"This game is amazing.It makes you feel like you are in the game and the world feels alive with characters that have personalites and most of all a great game 10/10","timestamp_created":1530997164,"timestamp_updated":1530997164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43384139","author":{"steamid":"76561198180646063","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":588,"last_played":1541879252},"language":"english","review":"[Graphics]\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☑ Paint.exe\n\n[Gameplay]\n☐ Very good\n☑ Good\n☐ It‘s just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Starring at walls is better\n☐ Just don‘t\n\n[Soundtrack]\n☐ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☑ Good\n☑ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n[Audience]\n☐ Kids\n☐ Teens\n☑ Nerds\n☑ Adults\n☑ Human\n\n[PC Requirements]\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boiiiiii\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n[Difficulity]\n☐ Just press ‚A‘\n☐ Easy\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n[Story]\n☐ Story?\n☐ Text or Audio floating around\n☐ Average\n☑ Good\n☑ Lovley\n☐ It‘ll replace your life\n\n[Game Time]\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☑ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n[Price]\n☐ It’s free\n☑ Worth the price\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money\n\n[Bugs]\n☑ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs/glitches\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n[Notes] \nSome people might take one look at this game and be wondering by bother in this time and age but if you're 90s kid like myself you know the hype for this game.

[/b]\nCan we all just agree that Half Life as a series is the best FPS series out there?\n\n[i] (TL;DR at bottom.) [/i]\n\nIn Half Life, you play as Gordon Freeman, a scientist at Black Mesa, running late for work. You work at a lab that runs test on anomalies and such. It seems like a normal day at work, until you enter the test chamber and something goes horribly wrong. Creatures from a strange place called [i] \"Xen\" [/i] seemingly teleport in and ruin the whole place. Everything is going wrong, and you have to escape. Now, the rest is up to you, as the story in this game is amazingly showcased, with the famous style that Half Life has. \n\nThe gameplay of Half Life feels like that classic 90's feel. (of course) It doesn't have those arrows in modern games saying \"Go here!\" \"Go there!\" All that crap. Instead, you have to navigate through the puzzles by yourself, and it really makes the game more immersive. Also, I love Half Life because of the weapon selection, like come on, a hand that shoots bees? It's honestly amazing. I also like how the game introduces mechanics to you. It doesn't throw stuff at you and expects you to do it, [i] *cough cough hdtf cough cough* [/i] it uses the \"Tell, Show, Do\" system of teaching you stuff.\n\nOverall, Half Life is a really nice game. If you don't have it yet, I'd get the anthology or wait for a sale. Or if you really want to get it, go for it. It's worth it. Anyways, time for TL;DR.\n\n[b] TL;DR - Half Life has good mechanics, storyline, and overall, it's worth it.
