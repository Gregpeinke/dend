[/h1]\n\nAlthough it took me a year to come back to it after getting stuck on a stupidly easy section in Ravenholm, I can safely say this is my absolute favourite title and probably some of the best the videogame industry can offer.\n\nThis simple-looking FPS was the revolution of its genre back in the day and still proudly stays as a standard for most modern titles. To really understand why, it is always best to experience it by yourself but I will try to briefly summarise the main aspects of the game and what makes it so special.\n\nLets start off with what is, in my opinion, the most polished aspect of this title: the level design and environment. The claustrophobic and decayed look of HL2's levels really goes to show the lengthy creation process this game had to undergo, its pretty impressive how the developers managed to squeeze so much content and gameplay into very tight spaces and narrow structures (be it to save on resources or to flesh out the world). Every building is very intuitively thought through and constantly shows you new paths that lead to new rooms filled with well placed enemies and props that you can use to your advantage, as well as some simple puzzles here and there to sort of show off the impressive capabilities of the Source engine (for its time obviously) which still holds up really well both in graphics and physics. All this neatly combined with the worn and rough aspect of modern Eastern European architecture, surfaces and various objects that immerse you into the experience.  \n\nAs for any other FPS game the gunplay is one of Half-Life 2's pillars and I wouldn't say Valve nails this completely (at least by today's standards) but it is pretty solid too. Each weapon provided feels polished, special and satisfying to shoot and can be used at nearly any given moment which makes for some interesting gunfights. Using the gravity gun is encouraged too as it is very fun and rewarding, spicing up each encounter.\n\nThe story is engaging and constantly pushing you further while having some very interesting lore. The characters feel alive and human, with defects and virtues that make them relatable. The music is the cherry on top, energizing you in combat and immersing you in the more cinematic moments, it is also great to listen on its own.\n\nThis game never frustrated or infuriated me and constantly rewarded me for my exploration, curiosity and observation, something that I absolutely loved. It aged like fine wine and deserves just as much praise as it got back in its day. \n\nIn conclusion, I would like to end this review with the same words I started it with, [b]its an absolute must play[/b].","timestamp_created":1542229759,"timestamp_updated":1580156803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557321250438690186","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45813155","author":{"steamid":"76561198811330379","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1576914682},"language":"russian","review":"Надеюсь,что внуки и правнуки в неё поиграют\n:$","timestamp_created":1542214453,"timestamp_updated":1542214453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45812932","author":{"steamid":"76561198344290192","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1652550194},"language":"russian","review":"я худею..","timestamp_created":1542213434,"timestamp_updated":1542213434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496183216571807861","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45811541","author":{"steamid":"76561198869331288","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1634,"last_played":1575531387},"language":"russian","review":"не жалею , что потратил деньги и 40 часов жизни на этот шедевр","timestamp_created":1542207369,"timestamp_updated":1542207369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45810818","author":{"steamid":"76561198408446929","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":534,"last_played":1586878643},"language":"english","review":"Hunt Down the Freeman: Freeman Edition","timestamp_created":1542204371,"timestamp_updated":1542204371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45807525","author":{"steamid":"76561198242984542","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":21426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2653,"last_played":1658388918},"language":"english","review":"It's alright.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1542186406,"timestamp_updated":1637800362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45805571","author":{"steamid":"76561198202484086","num_games_owned":256,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":676,"last_played":1585727077},"language":"english","review":"Honestly should be played by everyone at least once.

Gordon Freeman viene risvegliato dal G-Man e catapultato a City 17, una delle tante cittadelle erette dai Combine in seguito alla loro invasione della Terra. Il suo scopo sarà sopravvivere in alcuni fra gli scenari più ostili del mondo e rovesciare il regime di Wallace Breen, una sua vecchia conoscenza di Black Mesa.\nAncora oggi si fa fatica a credere che un gioco con questo comparto tecnico risalga al lontano 2004. La prima interazione del Source Engine presenta degli elementi che oggigiorno sono standard, compresa una fisica di gioco a mio parere ancora senza eguali. Ogni singolo elemento è stato curato nei minimi particolari e il gameplay risulta sempre fresco e divertente. Complici l'ottima IA di nemici e alleati, ma soprattutto la Gravity Gun, arma peculiare con cui è possibile attrarre e respingere ogni singolo oggetto presente negli scenari. La sua presenza ci permette non solo di sbarazzarci delle forze nemiche in maniera creativa, ma soprattutto di risolvere i numerosi puzzle ambientali.\nLe uniche critiche che sento di muovere a questo capolavoro videoludico, sono i frequenti caricamenti che spezzano l'azione e il doppiaggio italiano affidato a dei sintetizzatori vocali con risultati esilaranti.\nInfine vorrei lasciare un messaggio al team di Valve: quando ci sarà concesso di godere della conclusione di questa storia?

Or was it just less than my expectation, but still a great game? \n\nWell...it is a good game, but it is no longer as amazing as it was initially hailed. That's fine, though, it is a 13 year old game and it still looks relatively good. A solid frame rate and no problems with running it on Win10. Essentially this is an fps on a rail and there are flaws and disappointments; there is only ever generally one way to go and only very slight deviations on how to get there, in this respect it seems to have less freedom than the previous game; the game tends to revolve around travel from one large pitched battle arena to another. These are not the only things that let the game down either; the puzzles are considerably easier and the gameplay isn't very varied, you are on a boat and a buggy, but that's about it, the rest of the time you are on foot except for the odd 5 seconds on a zip line or observing only from a rail. By the standards of today's games, this is a little uninventive. Even by contemporary standards, such as CoD: United Offensive (released in the same year) it has less varied gameplay. There you were in a plane, a jeep, a sidecar, a lorry, a boat and a tank. It's also a considerably shorter game than the first Half Life. \n\nNow don't get me wrong, much of this disappointment is actually rather small and it is also disappointment only in relation to expectations. The story is good, the weaponry is good and ammo is scare enough to need to think about which one you use, but the Gravity gun is an overloaded weapon to give you...happily though not always the best for each situation. The dystopian future that Dr Freeman has been called back into is wonderfully realised in some sections of the game. The initial city sections after arrival and processing look like something out of 1984 or Equilibrium and the Combine HQ human harvest rail run is a complete joy to watch roll by and observe. The buildings are atmospheric and there is a constant sense of chase and escape in the game that adds to the feeling of panic and fear that helps drive you along and to the momentary rest periods...it's just that there is something missing. That final bit of balance in the game that elevates it from a good game to a great one. The Highway 17 section is a good example of this. To be presented with the apparent freedom of a highway run seems amazing but it doesn't quite deliver. The road is so bland that SEGA's Outrun seems more glorious a backdrop and it's possible to avoid much of the trouble and to drive off the road without intending to because it's all so grey. What you get are tedious sections of drive between fixed place battles against the Combine. Again in the Combine HQ there is a section in an open central lift that is effectively little more than a static swarm shooting section...both examples are a bit of a let down and disappointingly too straightforward. \n\nAll in all though this remains a good shooter, with some amazing sections, but no longer as great as contemporary reviews made out when laid against current expectations. Whilst this might seem unfair, people will only be reading this to consider purchasing the game today. The graphics undoubtedly wowed at the time as did the flexibility of the gravity gun. Today they look average and overall, this is a fine, but ultimately rather ordinary fps rail shooter. No doubt some of these comments will brand me as some sort of gaming apostate with the offended group thinkers for daring to find some faults or for not quietly hiding my mild disappointment, but there we are. At the retail price of £7 though, there really isn't any reason not to recommend this game and at that price you will certainly enjoy it...go get it Gordon.","timestamp_created":1541707072,"timestamp_updated":1582919646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45707738","author":{"steamid":"76561198280449993","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":1931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1931,"last_played":1541681792},"language":"english","review":"I played this game for the first time now in 2018, and even after all those years after its release in 2004, it's an excellent game even if you're not a fan of HL.
