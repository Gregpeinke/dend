It isn't the best FPS narrative game I've ever played and completed though. The gunplay is fun and the vigors add a bit more spice to the combat. The vigors are all unique from shooting fireballs to allowing yourself to freaking capture enemy bullets in a fiery ball that grows until you decide to throw it back at them and kill 'em all. The story doesn't fall short. It ties up the trilogy alright along with a nice twist. \n\n    Another thing, difficulty. I honestly wouldn't recommend hard mode. It's just annoying honestly. It just uses up more ammunition and melee attacks to kill the damn enemies. I played hard mode until the ending battle, which was cool to say the least, but not outright amazing. Then after losing 3 times (It's a long battle) I decided to switch it to medium. I'd say play at medium the whole game, but I don't know what to tell the people who are new to this whole genre. \n\n    Also if you decide to pick up this game I'd highly recommend not making a loadout e.g. always using this certain gun and this certain gun because you can only hold up to two guns. Vigors are fine to keep the same I guess. \n\n    To wrap this up I'd say the graphics are great for a 2013 game and there are barely any technical issues except when using the skyline. It's a bit weird sometimes when you're trying to aim but overall I give this game an 8/10","timestamp_created":1514494994,"timestamp_updated":1514495047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38794328","author":{"steamid":"76561198417200759","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":696,"last_played":1587691145},"language":"english","review":"i first had some game breaking glitch wear the crowd would not spawn in the begining of the game i restarted the game a couple times and fixed it.    also aftet playing the game.                  the girl in the cover is actually your daughter  i just saved you 7 bucks go play bio 1 if you havint its way more better but graphicly this game is better\n","timestamp_created":1514494104,"timestamp_updated":1514494104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444770276546478271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38794012","author":{"steamid":"76561198148242101","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":108,"last_played":1609517903},"language":"schinese","review":"很棒的游戏，虽然官方说没有中文，但其实可以在库里右键点击游戏，属性，语言，设置繁体中文","timestamp_created":1514493466,"timestamp_updated":1514493466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38793984","author":{"steamid":"76561198211033153","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1892,"last_played":1540386502},"language":"russian","review":"Игра вышла в 2013 году , а прошел я ее только сейчас , в 2017 , аж 4 года спустя, все эти 4 года я очень хотел в нее поиграть и пройти проникнувшись историей и сюжетом.

I loved every second of playing it, and am determined to give it another play through at some point because I feel it deserves it. The graphics and world are beautiful, the guns (especially the sniper) are flawless, and the dang story writing. Yikes.\n\nEven minor details like facial expressions are done to perfection.\n\nCombat flows well, guns are fairly strong and the sky rail and execution system adds a whole other way to fight than generic FPSing. I loved the sky hook executions too :P\n\nThe game also does an amazing job of world building, like referencing actual historical events and creating extremely believable characters and situations...IF you know, there was a giant floating city magically hidden in the sky.\n\nI think too that playing the burial at sea DLC missions are pretty much required to get a grasp on the whole story and how this game is even Bioshock. Infinite is a great game on its own, but then you play the DLC and see how everything connects and its just... Wow.\n\nGranted, it's not perfect... Some enemies are quite bullet spongey, sometimes combat feels repetitve (especially towards the end), and Booker can often feel like a glass man until you upgrade health and shield a lot.

I am docking a single point, because of a frustrating save mechanism I'm not a fan of, and that is that you have no control over when you save, you have to reach a checkpoint, or start a mission all over, but honestly, it's such a tiny issue I'm not bothered by it too much.\n\nWill it Run? - 9/10 - To be honest, this game isn't the easiest thing to run on low-end computers, however, don't let that deter you from buying this game, even if you have weak hardware, the story is so incredible, that even on my low-end laptop which ran at only 30fps on lowest settings, I still enjoyed the game, not because of the graphics, but because of the story.\n\nGraphics - 10/10 - There's one particular thing about the graphical style of this game I enjoy very much, it's that they didn't go for photorealism, even though, with the engine they were using to develop this game, they easily could have gone for that, instead, they went for a more artistic slightly-cartoonish animation style that I REALLY enjoyed, this graphical style is great because 10 years from now, this game still will look great (need proof?

No puedo estarle más agradecido.\n\nPor encima de las mecánicas de juego de los FPS, que son lo que siempre me echa para atrás de estos juegos, tenemos un producto excelente. Partimos de un setting absolutamente real, y, sin darnos cuenta, el juego nos introduce en una distopía completamente redonda y coherente (para ser una distopía). Los primeros compases del juego son sublimes, y personalmente me los pasé mirando absoltuamente todo, regocijándome en el arte, en el mimo, en el cuidado que le han puesto al juego: todos y cada uno de los elementos que aparecen en la pantalla están pensados para que sean coherentes con lo que el juego nos quiere contar.\n\nY luego empieza la acción. El control es muy bueno, preciso y rápido. La variedad de armas y de enemigos es más que suficiente, y los añadidos especiales de los Bioshock siguen siendo interesantes, divertidos y espectaculares en esta iteración. Tenemos aquí un FPS al uso con elementos diferenciadores que son  necesarios para que el personaje se desenvuelva en el entorno que nos propone el juego, pero básicamente es un FPS, con todo lo bueno y todo lo malo que eso implica.\n\nLos personajes son carismáticos. Cuando la historia, sublime, se va desvelando vamos conociéndolos un poco más cada vez y vamos empatizando con ellos, de forma que terminamos por cogerles cariño u odiarles, según sea el caso.

What is so important about Elizabeth? How is Colombia staying up? These are just a few examples, that thankfully are answered. \n\nBioshock Infinite is a shooter. You carry around two guns at all times and can switch them out at almost any time. They feel very powerful and there's a lot of diversity in each gun, but it is possible to just play the entire game with the same two guns. Along with your firearms you have plasti- uhm I mean vigors. They serve as your special abilities such as: setting the enemy on fire, or mind controlling the enemy into fighting for you. They can be combined for some interesting combinations such as flaming crows, but for most of the game I ignored them, not seeing much of a use for them.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a very well written game. It manages to keep you interested for its 13+ hour plot. The world of Colombia is revealed through voxophones in the game, which are your standard audiolog collectible items. In my opinion, it's worth going through and finding as many as you can, because they greatly add to the backstory and the enjoyment of the game. Throughout the game, its philosophy is very present and sort of shoved down your throat. This is very evident in the ending which I personally thought was just silly, and too ambitious.\n\nGraphically the games looks very beautiful and stands up even amongst some of todays newer releases.\n The sound engineering was very well done, the guns sounded loud and powerful, peoples conversations got louder the closer to them you got. The sound is great and I reccomend you play with headphones for an added experience.\n I was able to run the game on ultra settings at sixty frames throughout the entire game. My pc for reference has a 1060 3gb model and an i5-7500, so nothing too special. As long as you don't have a toaster pc, you should be good.\n\nTLDR; very fun game with solid gunplay and special abilities, though you [i]can[/i] largely ignore that. The story is very well written and is sure to keep your attention, even though they have to turn to audiologs to build the world. Finally the game is very well optimized and you shouldn't have too much trouble running the game unless you have a toaster pc. Definitely a fun game, 8/10.\n","timestamp_created":1514240095,"timestamp_updated":1514240095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38673921","author":{"steamid":"76561198219933151","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2296,"last_played":1512853654},"language":"english","review":"Geat fucking game\n the end will fuck you up but great game","timestamp_created":1514238551,"timestamp_updated":1514238551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38673617","author":{"steamid":"76561198152169543","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1103,"last_played":1514484861},"language":"turkish","review":"Fazla uzatmaya gerek yok, oynadığım açık ara eeeeen iyi senaryo, tartışmasız şekilde.
