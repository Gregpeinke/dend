But it was also slightly experimental and short as a result. Portal 2 is a full game in length and it expands brilliantly on the universe around Aperture Science. It also brings back the puzzles and adds new elements to the mix that add to the challlenge. A lot of the game, however, reminds me of the 2nd half of the first Portal, and that was the most intriguing part of the game. They've added fantastic voice acting to the already great voice of GlaDOS with new characters that are all very interesting. Graphically (environmentally), the game offers much more variety as well.\n\nThis is in my opinion the best sequel ever, but since Portal was pretty short, that might not be entirely fair. Still, if you like Portal and haven't played this yet, then you're missing out. Hugely. Portal 2 is fantastic. It's a must-play.","timestamp_created":1419255035,"timestamp_updated":1419255035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13522020","author":{"steamid":"76561198068769851","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":571,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1449347922},"language":"russian","review":"хуйня ссаная, думать надо, не играйте.","timestamp_created":1419254743,"timestamp_updated":1419254743,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.245394766330718994","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13521955","author":{"steamid":"76561198036865016","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1597439960},"language":"russian","review":"12 тортов из 10.

Portal 2 has some truly stunning designs and bright ideas, most notably it's brand new, innovative Multiplayer mode. When I joined a server, I met this other player called Wheatley, who was very helpful and sounded alot like Stephen Merchant. Of course, it doesn't come without its flaws. For example, I was very dissapointed to find that the commentary mode didn't feature as much commentary as I anticipated and I was surprised to find my gun didn't come with any ammo - which meant that dealing with the tricky sentry guns became more dangerous that I'd anticipated. Overall, I think that Portal 2 is a fabulous start to the Dragon Age: Inquisition family and whilst the multiplayer was okay (but pretty empty at some points), I found myself with a delicious cheese toastie at the end, so everything turned okay I guess.\n\n★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★☆\n\n68/69 Stars ~ EuroGamer.com","timestamp_created":1419241477,"timestamp_updated":1419241477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13518749","author":{"steamid":"76561198099298037","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1197,"last_played":1560572692},"language":"english","review":"it had less memes than the 1st...\n\nthank.","timestamp_created":1419241237,"timestamp_updated":1419241237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13518728","author":{"steamid":"76561198126943238","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":411,"last_played":1561275864},"language":"koreana","review":"Very good!!","timestamp_created":1419241099,"timestamp_updated":1419241099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13518540","author":{"steamid":"76561198051891347","num_games_owned":1154,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":916,"last_played":1467408875},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely stunning game, looks wonderful, excellent mechanics, fantastically deep storyline, overall just beautiful.
