Portal 2 to kontynuacja niesamowicie wciągającej gry logicznej Portal. Wydana została przez studio Valve odpowiedzialne za takietyltuły jak Half Life czy Team Fortress. Po przejściu tego tytułu mogę wreszcie napisać chyba sensowną recencję. Zacznijmy od tego, że gre tę poleciłbym każdemu. Czemu? Mocny wątek fabularny wraz z ogromnymi mapami do eksplorowania zmieszany z trybem gry logicznej daje niezły mętlik w głowie. Po paru godzinach gry stajesz się znudzony, jednak tak jak by na życzenie dzieje się coś nowego co wciąga Cię do dalszej gry. W produkcji wcielamy się w ostatniego żywgo człowieka próbując uciec z placówki badawczej Aperture Science. W tej części nasz odwieczny wróg GLaDOS staje się naszym sprzymierzeńcem gdy w nieoczekiwanym zwrocie akcji zdradza nas nasz przyjaciel rdzeń Wheatley. W tym tytule nie brakuje niczego co powinno zakłócić rozgrywkę. Ukryte Easter Eggi wprawiają grającego w strach ale fabuła gry podpowiada Ci abyś śmialo szedł na przód. Wyposażony jedynie w przenośne działo 2 portalowe dumnie kroczysz przez komory testowe oraz opuszczone części budynku. Samo przejście tytuły nie jest łatwe ponieważ jest to piekielnie trudne nawet jeśli nie mamy tu wielu przeciwników. A to tylko pierwsza część gry. Po ukończeniu trybu jednoosobowego możemy zagrać ze znajomymi w tryb kooperacyjny wcielając się w dwa roboty twórców naukowców z Aperture. Tryb coop to zupełnie nowe poziomy i urozmaicona rozgrywka. Mimo to znajdę jeden błąd i problem w tej grze. Grafika. Bowiem silnik Source jest już trochę przestarzały i o ile tekstury są bardzo ładne to niestety shadery (testowane na najwyższych ustawieniach) są nieudane i widać w nich wyraźnie piksele. Ten mały problem nie przeszkadza jednak w grze. Podsumowując gra jest naprawdę świetna.

The graphics are very improved, still feeling comparable in beauty to many of the 2014 releases we're familiar with.\n\nThe workshop support really gets to me. Yeah, you can make a whole pile of really nice looking chambers, fully functioning. ..But they're all big, open boxes in plain new aperture theme. They lack the aesthetics that make Portal 2.. Portal 2. Every single wall or floor is just a box. There's not really a lot you can do with it, and it's alright for blocking out before you open it in Hammer.. Which makes a lot of the workshop submissions - even top rated ones - look shoddy unless they go through the full effort of making it within the Hammer editor.\n\nOverall though? 8/10\nExcellent valve title.

We had our fun and solved the puzzles all while we gathered achievements even though I’m not the biggest fan of them. I also had my fair share of screwing my buddy over by flipping a switch or not and getting rid of portals at the “right” time. Fun was had (at my buddy’s or my personal expense) and I figured I should now probably tackle the single player campaign.\n\nThe story carries over from the first. You’re the same woman (Chell) and I believe you’ve been in stasis for 50 years. You still look as good as you did when you killed GLaDOS those many years ago. The story wakes you to a new player in the Portal universe: Wheatley. Wheatley is hilarious! I love the banter that goes on (I would say between you and him, but you don’t really talk) as he “narrates” the goings-on.\n\nWarning: the rest of the review contains what someone could consider a spoiler even if it’s a mild one (just in case you’re like me and up to this point haven’t actually played Portal 2 yet).\n\nThe story evolves and you eventually come to the realization that GLaDOS was killed, but she wasn’t erased when you accidentally bring her back online thanks to Wheatley’s “help”. What then ensues is a back and forth comedy, loads of puzzles, and a few great twists and realizations that, while not Earth shattering, is very interesting Portal trivia to know. The story was very fun and if you don’t feel the need to get through it, I can’t understand where you’re coming from.\n\nThey introduce a few new elements as well to help differentiate Portal 2 from the first. There a gels that get splattered around certain levels that can help the player run faster, jump higher or even create new surfaces to put a portal on. This really added a new level of thinking for the sequel. Also, there are tractor beams (as shown in the picture below), light bridges (which were super fun in co-op) and laser redirection cubes to, you know… that redirect lasers and such (or kill a buddy).\n\nThe co-op is as fun as the single player. You miss out on the banter between Wheatley and GLaDOS, but if you feel the need to be called not as good as your friend and then have GLaDOS sing your praise and tear down your friend or sometimes just both of you at the same time, co-op has it all! That, and the puzzles require more thinking than normal since the two of you both have portal guns and you’ll have to work them in tandem with the usual timing and well thought out plans.\n\nScore: Tasty!\n\nPortal 2 is the perfect evolution from its’ predecessor. The puzzles are about on par with the first game as far as difficulty where some you’ll just walk through while others will have you scratching your head for a while. In case you love them, Portal 2 has enough achievements for the hunters (and enough for people like me to just give up on getting them all). With the fantastic humor in the solo campaign and the very well thought out puzzles for co-op, Valve did a great job with this sequel. The only lament that I’ve got is that Valve doesn’t tend to make trilogies (even though I can’t figure out how they would progress from this point). I guess they could do something with more of the co-op stuff… four player Portal anyone?","timestamp_created":1407506210,"timestamp_updated":1428279851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.443070054054260254","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11601220","author":{"steamid":"76561198021417924","num_games_owned":527,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3074,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1154,"last_played":1630355441},"language":"english","review":"My favourite game and easily one of the best games ever made.\nThere is no (puzzle) game quite like it.

Everything is perfect if you like logic games. \nWhat is great is a some variety of challenges, and game slowly introduce new tools, and combine them in resonable speed. Also there is some variety of locations. Moreover it has some kind of plot with character development. Good monologues. Very funny. Purrfect. It was some time since i felt so much satisfaction after ending.","timestamp_created":1407325371,"timestamp_updated":1407325371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11572672","author":{"steamid":"76561198088480091","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":172,"last_played":1656563261},"language":"russian","review":"Игра супер,графика хорошая,но кто не любит думать в играх то это игра не для вас!!!Игра на 5+","timestamp_created":1407319860,"timestamp_updated":1407319860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11572484","author":{"steamid":"76561198043160985","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":488,"last_played":1408108552},"language":"russian","review":"СУПЕР ДУРАТСКАЯ ИГРА ЖДАЛ ЦЕЛЫЙ ГОД ДУМАЛ ИГРА КЛЕВАЯ А НЕТ ЗАПУСКАЮ ВЫДАЕТ ОШИБКУ","timestamp_created":1407318735,"timestamp_updated":1407318735,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.322484344244003296","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11571725","author":{"steamid":"76561198132686189","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1617,"last_played":1485020620},"language":"french","review":"Bonjour,\n\nLe jeu est vraiment très bon et je passe bonnes soirées grâce à lui.","timestamp_created":1407312893,"timestamp_updated":1407312893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501187384128570557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11571164","author":{"steamid":"76561198129769913","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":870,"last_played":1579170309},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень хорошая!
