Bioshock infinite review ]:\nГлавный герой Букер ДеВитт бывший военный ранее работающий в агентстве Пинкертона,а ныне частный детектив со всеми присущими привычками(курение,алкоголь и азартные игры) попадает в парящий город Колумбию с одной целью:найти девушку по имени Элизабет, являющуюся решением всех его проблем.\nПозже Букер и Элизабет объединившись оказываются в центре гражданской войны между властями города и мятежными рабочими.\nБлагодаря сверхъестественым способностям Элизабет,герои раскрывают мрачные секреты города и своего собственного прошлого.\nНа первый взгляд Колумбия может показаться игроку утопией,но на деле представляет собой рассадник расизма и элитизма, где представители национальных и расовых меньшинств исполняют в городе роль дешёвой рабочей силы и подвергаются жестокому угнетению а богатые возведены над бедными.\nЭлизабет в роли напарника переодически подбрасывает игроку монеты,амуницию,соли(заменяющие в этой части Еву и являющиеся их аналогом) и открывает разломы помогающие в бою.\nГрафика стала более яркой(соответственно тону игры) и современной(если не учитывать например модельки птиц).\nБлагодаря тому что игра стала более шутерной одним из главных нововведений является третья полоска-характерика \"щит\",который блокирует определенное количество урона прежде чем вы начнёте терять ваше здоровье.\nСпециально для любителей сложностей в игру введен режим хардкор названный \"1999\".\nОружейный арсенал остался примерно прежним, но с собой вы можете носить только два образца.\nПрокачивается оружие и тоники в специальных торговых автоматах(но цены там кусачие, так что придется копить и обдумывать свои траты).\nКак ты предыдущих частях, игрок может находить аудиозаписи («воксофоны») и видеозаписи («кинетоскопы») расширяющие и углубляющие сюжет.\nОтдельные части одежды (шляпа,рубашка,брюки и ботинки) спрятанные в закоулках и других потаённых местах, будут давать вам пассивные бафы немного меняющие ход геймплея.\nВместо плазмидов в парящем городе в ходу тоники,с новыми или переработанными(из прошлых частей) функциями(например теперь можно ставить различные ловушки).\nТеперь ваши противники не безумные мутанты, а по большей части солдаты и полицейские(они научились группироваться и обходить игрока что показывает улучшение искусственного интеллекта) считающие вас угрозой обществу, которое поклоняется пророку Комстоку - основателю и самопровозглашённому лидеру города.\nИгра интересная и поэтому отличная, но рекомендую покупать ее только на распродажах или в сторонних магазинах потому что обычная цена как всегда великовата.","timestamp_created":1595084498,"timestamp_updated":1595084498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72899124","author":{"steamid":"76561198837785049","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1619871306},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩","timestamp_created":1595084074,"timestamp_updated":1595084074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72899121","author":{"steamid":"76561198378120309","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1448,"last_played":1595084530},"language":"schinese","review":"如果还有机会，我会把航线设置为2.2°E,

Hoy en día el juego esta muy bien en sentido de su jugabilidad y gráficos,no envejeció nada mal.\nPero hablar de Bioshock infinite como un juego individual se me hace muy difícil,ya que aunque en la historia principal no se trata el lore de la saga,sigue siendo muy imperativo saber de la historia de los juegos anteriores sobre todo para los DLCS(Burial at sea 1 y 2) que son muy buenos y traen un cierre a toda la saga. Por eso recomiendo fuertemente el comprarse la versión collection(Bioshock 1,2 y sus dlcs)para seguir toda la historia completa,la cual es sumamente inmersiva y te deja unos grandes personajes con una cantidad de tiempo aceptable. Lo único \"Malo\" talvez sería el hecho de que no disponemos de un online(salvo el del 2).

I would much rather cycle to only 4-5 Vigors and have 4-5 weapons in their place. Movement is a bit clunky for my taste.\n[b]GRAPHICS [/b]\n8/10. I love the art style of the Bioshock games.
