Horas y horas de diversión y entretenimiento en resolución de puzles y rompecabezas. La campaña es algo sublime, que mezcla la acción y tensión de la trama con entretenimiento, diversión y diálogo por parte de los personajes. El modo cooperativo, que te dará cientos de horas de diversión sin límites, ya que gracias al  Workshop tendrás nuevos desafíos constantemente para ti y tu compañero, unos que te harán sufrir alomejor, pero la interacción con tu compañero es sin duda lo que te hará reir sin parar.\nPara disfrutar de este juego en su totalidad recomiendo tener un amigo con el que te puedas entender (idioma), ya que sino las cámaras cooperativas podrían ser un suplicio.\nLa calidad-precio que nos ofrece Valve con este tipo de juegos cada día tiene mi más sincero reconocimiento. Gracias Valve.","timestamp_created":1398784957,"timestamp_updated":1398784957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9971021","author":{"steamid":"76561198019857493","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":893,"last_played":1398626884},"language":"english","review":"Brilliant game, it carrys on well from the first on and i love the story","timestamp_created":1398782118,"timestamp_updated":1398782118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9971001","author":{"steamid":"76561198086485106","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":1353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1058,"last_played":1535798984},"language":"italian","review":"This game have no defects\n10/10","timestamp_created":1398782018,"timestamp_updated":1422534859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9970932","author":{"steamid":"76561197995814053","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":482,"last_played":1501178945},"language":"russian","review":"good game, makes one think head and include logic","timestamp_created":1398781447,"timestamp_updated":1398781447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9970673","author":{"steamid":"76561198091760099","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":546,"last_played":1463953407},"language":"english","review":"This.

The scale of the levels is fairly large and very open leaving you free to roam around and take in the little details. Some added mechanics like the gels are fun and create more interesting puzzles. The humor is sometimes dark but mostly goofy.\n\nThat being said, there is a particular feature of the game that is just plain broken. It's a HUD that is supposed to be opened in multiplayer but you can still access it in single player and if you do there is no way to get out of it. You have to exit the game and reload. Frustrating, because the key that triggers it is right next to the wasd keys. Eventually I had to unmap the key in the settings in order to avoid it happening again. Some levels are also just plain poorly designed. Had an invisible wall blocking me from portal jumping onto a platform. In terms of narrative, I think they took a step back. Part of what made Portal so interesting was how much was left unexplained and the weirdly Ikea-esque feeling it had. With this game, I felt like I was just wandering around in a ware house most of the time. The sound track was also grating. Was ready to turn off the music close to the end.\n\nIt's safe to say, I have my fair share of gripes with this game. The physics are something though and I feel it's a cool game to play if you're demoing your gaming rig to some one. Admittedly I did chuckle some times too. I haven't completed multiplayer though, but I did enjoy the ending for single player. I'd recommend it, but I doubt I'll play it again.\n\n7/10","timestamp_created":1398748779,"timestamp_updated":1398748779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9967799","author":{"steamid":"76561198114979766","num_games_owned":366,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1512,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":82,"last_played":1562274475},"language":"russian","review":"Могу сакзать одно.\nОна у меня просто не запустилась...\nНаверное, хороший знак.","timestamp_created":1398743239,"timestamp_updated":1398743239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527022898197174072","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9967792","author":{"steamid":"76561198047982956","num_games_owned":523,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1002,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":962,"last_played":1590116982},"language":"spanish","review":"Gran juego, excelente historia, un juego que te hace pensar en todas las posibilidades.\n\nAltamente recomendable.

If you love puzzle games, this is the game for you. There are some problems, one of them is in the singleplayer, where I feel it gets hard fast. And you can get stuck on some missions, you can sit there and work it out for a long time, or cheat and look up that chamber. The test chamber creation is brilliant, and is great if you finish the campaign, so you still play the game. The story has some funny moments, which leads me on to the Co-op. Co-op is longer then singleplayer and has more funny moments, when GLaDOS was saying \"Blah blah blah blah\" When the computer was speaking a load of rubbish. I have heard people say that the Co-op against someone he is very good at the game is boring, so you will need a friend, but there is still the button to find a random person to play with","timestamp_created":1398706267,"timestamp_updated":1398706267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9963465","author":{"steamid":"76561198127236637","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":318,"last_played":1397238125},"language":"english","review":"This game is really good- Better,advanced and complicated levels, that means that these levels are better than the portal 1 levels.
