to be honest, I do have a few nitpicks with some bugs, and I don't adore the game yet (I say yet because I've played through it once and haven't modded it), but I think this is a must-play regardless. Gameplay is insanely fun, the story is really intriguing especially when you get deep into it, looks great despite its age, some intelligent puzzles, great boss fights, a vast amount of enemies, what else could you ask for???\n\nPuzzles are very crafty, but I find some of them to be either buggy or have some stupid way of figuring out the solution.\n\nFor gameplay, there is a varied way of approaching fights, but for the most part the game is pretty much linear (which is okay), however once you get to Xen shit goes baller with the boost jump, platforming, and slew of new enemies, which help to really vary the gameplay!\n\nYes, it looks outdated, but I think it's great looking for the style. That's also why Black Mesa exists.\n\nCharacters are charming, especially the scientists which are hilarious, and add more to the game than you'd think.\n\nThis game is a 9.5/10 for me. It has so much to it despite a few annoying bugs, and while you may not love it at first, I bet if you play it more than once it'll grow on you","timestamp_created":1600491113,"timestamp_updated":1600491113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76205258","author":{"steamid":"76561199038112748","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":359,"last_played":1650774856},"language":"english","review":"It's a fun classic, play it.","timestamp_created":1600490206,"timestamp_updated":1600490206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76205179","author":{"steamid":"76561198847612032","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1659158966},"language":"spanish","review":"i can say anyting only play it","timestamp_created":1600490049,"timestamp_updated":1600490049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76203666","author":{"steamid":"76561198125870048","num_games_owned":327,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":232,"last_played":1509743460},"language":"english","review":"Fucking awful game, do not buy","timestamp_created":1600487209,"timestamp_updated":1600487209,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.383665263652801514","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76203374","author":{"steamid":"76561199081113285","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5788,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3236,"last_played":1657777938},"language":"english","review":"Good game.

Easily one of my favorite games of all time and I only started playing it this year. The main game is great. I love running through the halls of the Black Mesa Research Facility and blasting aliens and HECU grunts. The only parts of the game I could really do without are On A Rail and the majority of Interloper. Xen in general was kind of an anticlimactic disappointment after the downright amazing game before it. When you start playing Xen, you wish you were back in the Black Mesa Facility and that feeling never goes away even after you defeat Nihilanth. Speaking of Nihilanth, I found the fight to be way too easy. Nihilanth does next to nothing except for use cheap attacks that can kill you even if you're at full health. I would've preferred a much more interesting fight for a final boss but when it was over, there was still a great sense of accomplishment. Everything before Xen is great but Xen itself is mediocre. I love this game to death and the online multiplayer adds to that. The multiplayer is very fun and I'm online most days due to the multiplayer. I've replayed the campaign for a second time partially and I'm loving it all over again. Valve made an excellent product when they released Half-Life. It's just too much fun to stay away from for long.\n\nIn short, 8.5/10 would highly recommend regardless of whether or not it's on sale. I'd say $10.00 is way too low for Half-Life. I would've gladly paid more for it.","timestamp_created":1600477136,"timestamp_updated":1605024567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76198225","author":{"steamid":"76561198277185294","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":646,"last_played":1632431770},"language":"english","review":"one of the games of all time","timestamp_created":1600477133,"timestamp_updated":1659888434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76192739","author":{"steamid":"76561198155533431","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":130,"playtime_forever":292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":70,"last_played":1653174243},"language":"english","review":"Literally played this game that I've already beat on the Source version just to check out the amazing new feature of being able to exit back to the main menu while in the singleplayer campaign.
