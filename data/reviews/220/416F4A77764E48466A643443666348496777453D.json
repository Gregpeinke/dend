A few grey hairs are showing, but [b]HL2[/b] is still a fun and excellently-designed game worthy of your time.\n\nThe most obvious sign of ageing is, of course, the graphics.  However, while modern games may look better [b]HL2[/b] still looks good enough.  NPCs look sufficiently human for suspension of disbelief, the backgrounds are convincingly sell the world and it's always clear what's going on.\n\nSecond, some modern players may be unhappy with the lack of regenerating health.  Ultimately that's a matter of taste, but [b]HL2[/b] was clearly balanced around this, and medpacks are plentiful.  Unless you're playing on hard, this shouldn't be a problem for anyone who's played an FPS.\n\nLastly, there are some weaknesses on the narrative side.  One moment that I think was intended as a shock was so strongly telegraphed, the only surprise was that it [i]wasn't[/i] a red herring.  The fact that you need to do the same stupid action [i]twice[/i] to proceed in the Citadel casts a shadow on an otherwise excellent final level.  And most disappointingly, the story does not so much end as just stop.  These are only minor blemishes on otherwise strong storytelling, however.  The use of environmental cues and \"show, don't tell\" is excellent.  The named NPCs are all nicely fleshed out, and the interactions between them are particularly believable.  These factors ensure that while the plot may not win awards, it is well-told.\n\nAside from the story, the gameplay of [b]HL2[/b] is great fun.  The core shooting mechanics work well, with enemies that can still provide a few surprises.  These are presented in a number of different yet exciting set-pieces.  Notable highlights include running Combine over in the airboat; the pseudo-horror section of Ravenholm, and the fear that poison headcrabs offer; crossing the bridge in Highway 17; getting antlion allies, even if they do tend to get in the way; and the assault on the Citadel.\n\nThat last point nicely leads into the Gravity Gun, still one of the most fun FPS weapons ever.  It's the kind of brilliant idea that's simple and obvious in hindsight.  The basic fun of throwing things around is complemented by the tricks available with skill and practice.  In a sense, you haven't really played [b]HL2[/b] till you get it.  The rest of the weapon selection is pretty decent, too, balanced if not so remarkable.\n\n[b]Half-Life 2[/b] deserves its praise.  Though it cannot have the same impact now as on release, time has not made its gameplay any less fun.  I'm certainly glad that I was finally able to play it.","timestamp_created":1503816515,"timestamp_updated":1503816515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34521895","author":{"steamid":"76561198016066134","num_games_owned":1065,"num_reviews":218,"playtime_forever":984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":981,"last_played":1597517812},"language":"english","review":"*copied from my HL2: Update review*\n\nI don't really think Half-Life needs an introduction, and neither does Half-Life 2. Being the second game in the series, it improves on a lot of things when compared to the first HL. The physics, graphics and the facial animations which are still very good today mixed with overall good pacing, a fairly good story that has some mysteries that are still unsolved, good gameplay and great atmosphere made this a masterpiece in 2004 and still a good game in 2018.\n\n Some things haven't aged well, though. Most of the textures are poor up-close and the overall geometry of the game is blocky. The gunplay may be quite annoying for some (it is for me) as it has this weird spread pattern and the bullets don't go where the reticle is (the Magnum and the crossbow are an exception), but you get the hang of it after some time.

This coincidence also occurred with System Shock, Wolfenstein: The New Order and The Evil Within, so if this trend is something more than mere chance then the next time I have a craving for BioShock will be when the next title is announced. In all seriousness, though I am not exaggerating the odd timing on my part, it’s nice to finally have closure to a long-awaited finale with the series as now it’s a perfect time to reflect about how a MIT graduate would become one of the most venerated names not only of modern FPSs but of modern video-games.\n\nAs far as discussing the leaked information of Half Life 2: Episode 3, I will not discuss it until the very end of Half-Life 2: Episode 2 as that is when it will be the most relevant after reliving the series from beginning to end. This review will mainly focus on the merits and issues with Half-Life 2 itself. However, what I want to stress to those who desire to burn away Gordon Freeman’s legacy out of spite is to consider if those memories are worth destroying after all the time, the thrills and the heartaches they have brought without closure, and now we can carry on with peace of mind and the end of the Half-Life 3 memes. (We still have “Where is Xen?” to keep us occupied for Black Mesa.)\n\n[h1]Following the Source That Can Only Be Felt[/h1]\n\nWhen it comes to the gameplay of Half-Life 2 itself it’s not the FPS mechanics themselves that have withstood the test of time; instead, it’s the immersion and the thoughtfulness of the Source Engine to create a focused, well-paced and seemingly freeform campaign that does all it can to disguise its linearity. The first-person perspective itself is merely the catalyst for the innerworkings of HL2 that have made its campaign so venerated as it was on release as it is nowadays, and it’s how this information is conveyed to the player for the sake of immersion. Where series like The Elder Scrolls and Bethesda’s Fallout games attempt to accomplish this feat with the worlds of the Creation Engine, HL2 and the Source engine manage to create as seemingly real of a place in the small-scale with as much depth behind the smoke and mirrors. These tricks have often been referred to as the “invisible tutorials” and level-design structure that guides the player without waypoint markers for direction.\n\nHowever, one thing that has made Half-Life 2 dated more so than its episodic sequels is not the usage of its quiet-time moments that might as well be cutscenes but rather a consequence of these invisible tutorials of HL2. Similar to the problem of invisible walls in open-worlds, once the illusion of player agency and the tutorials become more blatant on repeated playthroughs the illusion makes the artificiality of these moments harder to ignore. This wouldn’t be nearly as much of a problem if it wasn’t for the fact that the game has these moments from beginning to end littered throughout the campaign with invisible, audio and simple gameplay tutorials that seem more present than the actual gameplay. The worst offenders are the blatant tech-demo puzzles meant to show off the Source engine rather than being interesting set-pieces driven by the player feedback with the environment that appear as potholes on the overall pacing of the gameplay such as the many seesaw/weight puzzles.\n\nProbably the one touted mark of excellence that has been untouched for over ten years is the overall pacing and level-design itself that keeps the simplified FPS mechanics from becoming tiresome. Environments like scripted, intense thrills of Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt are contrasted with the immense scale of the speeder-boat of the Water Hazard chapter as well as the adventure alongside Highway 17 that possess optional landmarks for exploration. Combined with the moments to reflect on the journey with NPCs or peaceful environments to the next location these breathers act as momentary pauses between the highs and lows of the campaign that has made HL2 unparalleled with its quality of excellence from beginning to end despite having issues of its own gameplay and its series’ continuity.\n\n[h1]Nostalgia at Baggage Claim #2[/h1]\n\nIt’s uncommon for me ever to play a series out of order unless it’s a reboot with more modern mechanics to become invested into the franchise first, but with the Half Life series Half Life 2 was my first experience into this world. This is perhaps why the issues with the continuity across HL1 and HL2 have little to any bearing on my view of the game other than being inconsistent across the series even if we excuse the expansions of HL1 as being non-canonical. However, it’s mainly the lackluster narrative driven by a pointless silent protagonist along with characters that have aged poorly with time.\n\nAs was the case with Jack from BioShock, the absence of the protagonist’s voice adds little, if anything, to the experience beyond what HL1 attempted to convey as the growth of Gordon Freeman from a scientist to super-soldier with the player’s skill in a meta-sense. HL2 assumes this pinnacle of Gordon Freeman has become this world’s second coming of Christ for some reason as he was one of many survivors of the Black Mesa incident that would idolize Freeman fora resistance group against new alien overlords on the Earth. Besides the obvious retcons of the series, the narrative itself is serviceable at best that really has little going for it other than the journey itself through the Source engine that enhances the simple resistance fighter storyline into an epic of its own.\n\nWhere the game really shows its age is the characterization of Gordon Freeman and other characters with clear, distinct personalities with mainly superficial differences when it comes to the plot. Gordon himself is a reclusive, silent type jokingly referred to as a man of few words; Alyx Vance is an endearing character on her own with little to say about her personality other than upbeat; Gordon’s friends, Barny, Dr. Kleiner and Eli all retain some semblance of their past selves with quirks of their own such as Dr. Kleiner’s infatuation with his new pet, Lamar; and the villains of the games have simplified motives and clear personalities that designate them as villains. It may be harsh to criticize these caricatures as being simple but given how the game is mainly character focused when it comes to the narrative the issues with their overall simplicity highlight their issues with time.\n\n[h1]In the Meantime… This is Where I Get Off[/h1]\n\nTime, of all Half Life’s antagonists, is mainly the one entity that has left its mark on the legacy as the technical issues of the Source Engine can be forgiven yet the game designs and characters themselves will only show their wear with further age. Where Half-Life 1 will be benefited from its lack of series’ baggage and a simplified, timeless conflict for a game, Half-Life 2 and its sequels will show its dated nature because of its legacy. While Half-Life 2 is by no means a bad game for a first playthrough or the hundredth, the acclaim in which it has become venerated is mainly due to its nostalgia behind its name more so than the merits of its games.  However, unlike the original, the episodic sequels would improve on the flaws of the original by focusing more on the gameplay than their storytelling merits.","timestamp_created":1503783955,"timestamp_updated":1503783955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568388819694519043","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34514936","author":{"steamid":"76561198096221356","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1045,"last_played":1536721569},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game!","timestamp_created":1503783931,"timestamp_updated":1503790664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34514464","author":{"steamid":"76561198030499415","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":156,"last_played":1503787692},"language":"english","review":"What an incredible game and experience.

algum dia, num futuro não muito distante, houver algum tipo de material sobre a história dos games, não tenho dúvidas de que Half-Life será um dos que estarão no seleto grupo daqueles que serão lembrados. Este título é algo que vai além de um simples jogo. É quase que uma obra de arte. \nGráfico; física; enredo; som; interação com o cenário... tudo é de altíssima qualidade e, sobretudo, muito à frente de sua época. É um jogo que te surpreende a cada episódio. E detalhe, isso tudo numa engine (source) absurdamente bem otimizada. \nComo tive o privilégio, na minha adolescência, de pegar os jogos da safra de 2004 nos seus lançamentos (RIP ATi Radeon 9600 Pro) tenho vivas as memórias do quão impressionados ficávamos e o fascínio que o HL nos proporsionava. Para os padrões da época era um jogo que estava muito à frente do seu tempo. Prova disso são os inúmeros prêmios que o mesmo recebeu e ainda recebe. \nSem dúvidas um dos melhores jogos de todos os tempos. Um jogo inovador e com um conjunto de obra de um nível quase que estratosférico. Inclusive, talvez esteja aí o porquê de a Valve nem mesmo ter tido audácia suficiente para dar sequência à série. O trono que ela ocupa é tão alto que, se fossem trazer uma continuação, a excelência seria nada mais do que uma obrigação; um dever; o mínimo esperado... ou seja, uma tarefa nenhum pouco fácil. Fazendo com que, talvez, seja mais inteligente manter tudo como está e ser lembrada como a detentora de um dos títulos mais bem avaliados e idolatrados da história dos games do que arriscar e trazer algo que, eventualmente venha a fracassar. Se lançassem uma continuação hoje, teriam quase que mostrar algo maior do que APENAS um jogo. \n\nPra todos que gostam de um bom FPS, HL não só vale a pena como... deve ser jogado. \nExtraordinário!","timestamp_created":1503718683,"timestamp_updated":1503719284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34495537","author":{"steamid":"76561198066397754","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":116,"last_played":1450654675},"language":"english","review":"I feel like while this anger is justified, its being pointed in the wrong direction.\n\nThis and Half Life 1 are so important to gaming, and not just because they were good games, but for what they did to gaming as a whole.\n\nThis whole game led to the creation of Steam, The Orange Box which let us discover so much more games, the crazy amount of mods and expansions that started a whole new generation of game devs, it showed us the hilarity and fun of the Source engine, and so much more.\n\nDon't be angry that it ended in a way you didn't like, be happy that it happened and gave you so many goods memories, and will continue to bring great memories forever.\n\nWhile you have let us down many times, thank you Valve, for making one of the most important games not just for the community, but for us.\n\n(Also the game is fucking great and is a fresh take on the FPS genre that you should definitly play it).","timestamp_created":1503718493,"timestamp_updated":1503774901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58879929780960083","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34494968","author":{"steamid":"76561198147136406","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":66,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44,"last_played":1521589858},"language":"english","review":"I ususally avoid writing reviews but this is my exception.\n\nWhen Gabe said that he sees Half-Life as a \"regret\" during a reddit Q&A, I couldn't believe it.\n\nBut after what Marc posted, it explains everything.

Itse pidän tätä yhtenä kaikkien aikojen yliarvostetuinpana pelinä. Huono peli tämä ei ole, mutta ei myöskään niin hyvä mitä liian monet antavat ymmärtää.\n\nPelin tarina alkaa kun mykkä ja lähes näkymätön Gordon Freeman saapuu kaupunki 17 ja liittyy vallankumoukseen. Vastapuoli on raskaasti aseistautunut ja liittolaiset ovat selviä altavastaavia tässä tappelussa. Mutta onneksi apuna on nyt messia Gordon Vapaamies, Half-Lifen Jeesus Kristus.\n\nPuolielämä kakkosen dystopinen maailma on varsin hienon näköinen ja graafisessa mielessä peli on todella hieno kokonaisuus. Oli sitten kyseessä ympäristö tai hahmoanimaatio, peliä on kiva katsella. Myös pelattavuus toimii hyvin ja ohjattavuus toimii varsinkin räiskinnässä.\nRäiskintä on yksi osa peliä ja helposti se osa joka toimii parhaiten. Aseita on paljon ja niissä on oikeasti eroja. Toiminta tarjoaa vaihtelua aseiden lisäksi myös vihollisilla. Combinen sotilaiden lisäksi vastassa on ties mitä mutantteja. Toiminnassa pelin ainoa oikeasti oma juttu on painovoima-ase, jolla ympäristöä voi käyttää vihollisia vastaan.\nAjoittain pelissä päästään myös ajelemaan ajoneuvoilla jotka tuovat peliin hieman vaihtelua. Tämän lisäksi pelissä on ajoittaisia pulmanratkontapätkiä, mutta itse koen ne pelkkinä hidasteina, ei mitään järin hauskaa puuhaa.\n\nMitä tulee tarinaan niin sitä ei suoranaisesti tuputeta pelaajalle. Pelissä ei ole välianimaatioita tai mitään sellaista. Pelaaja on jatkuvasti ohjaksissa ja tarina avautuu lähinnä ympäristöä tutkimalla ja kuuntelemalla mitä pelihahmot juttelevat. Gordon ei mykkänä sano mitään.\nPelihahmoista Alyx Vance on ainoa johon kiintyy edes vähän enemmän. Siis tohtori Kleiner ja hänen lemmikkinsä Lamar ovat omalla tavallaan varsin hyvä osa peliä, mutta kyllä Alyx on se osa josta eniten välittää. Vähän sama tilanne kuni BioShock Infinitessä Elizabethin kanssa.\nKaikki varmaan tietävät että tämä peli jää tarinallisesti kesken ja monet odottavat kielipitkällä Half-Life 3:n ilmestymistä. Siis onhan tämä kiva peli mutta ei tarina nyt niin kiinnostava ole.\n\nTäytyy sanoa että tämä on sellainen peli jonka kohdalla se kaikki kritiikki jätetään pois. Itse en todellakaan nostaisi tätä peliä järin korkealle, ei taida mahtua edes top 100 parhaat pelit listalle. Kyseessä ei ole huono peli, mutta kyllä siinä tiettyä toistoa on ja välillä peli on joko tylsä tai rasittava. \nPääasia on kuitenkin se että peli toimii varsin hyvin. Pari kertaa piti uudelleenlada aiemmasta tallennuksesta kun peli bugitti niin että seuraavaan osuuteen ei päässyt, mutta aika vähän virheitä pelissä on. Siinä ei kuitenkaan ole niin paljoa koukkuja jotka tekisivät siitä niin hyvän kuin monet antavat ymmärtää.\nParempiakin räiskintäpelejä on ja paremmalla tarinalla varustettuja pelejä on, puhumattakaan paremmista pelihahmoista.\n\nOmalla kohdalla tätä peliä varjostaa se, että tästä kuulee niin paljon kehuja. Kehut voivat olla myrkkyä pelille, sillä silloin sitä kohtaan nousee tiettyjä odotuksia. Itse en vain voi nosta tätä kokonaisuutta kovin ylös, sillä se ei vain tarjoa niin paljoa. Ihan kiva peli, mutta ei mitään järin ihmeellistä.\n\n\n+ Hienon näköinen\n+ Toimiva räiskintä\n+ Sopivasti vaihtelua\n\n- Ajoittainen hitaus ja puuduttavuus\n- Tylsä tarinaltaan ja hahmoiltaan\n\n\nArvosana: 6,5/10","timestamp_created":1503702027,"timestamp_updated":1503702146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34491432","author":{"steamid":"76561198007944821","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":962,"last_played":1578773600},"language":"english","review":"This series got the ending it desperatley needed, but NOT the one it deserved goddammit\n\nAlso another relevant quote \"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain\"\n\n","timestamp_created":1503700138,"timestamp_updated":1503700138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34490920","author":{"steamid":"76561197983622636","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1171,"last_played":1585337321},"language":"english","review":"It died in a pastebin.","timestamp_created":1503698277,"timestamp_updated":1515395400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501415848731994629","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34490793","author":{"steamid":"76561198018711706","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9632,"last_played":1588707920},"language":"english","review":"my dad left me","timestamp_created":1503697817,"timestamp_updated":1503697817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504252254962921143","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34490742","author":{"steamid":"76561198185045935","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1042,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1595719283},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would play gabe sim again","timestamp_created":1503697658,"timestamp_updated":1503697658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34490693","author":{"steamid":"76561198001427617","num_games_owned":495,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1643,"last_played":1470081193},"language":"russian","review":"★★★★★★★★★★\n\n ☁ ヽ ☁｀ ☁ 、 ☁ ヽ｀ ☁ ヽ ☁ 、 ☁\nヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ\nヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ、\n｀ヽ｀ヽ｀(ಥ﹏ಥ) ﾉ☂ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽ\n｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀\n｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀","timestamp_created":1503697461,"timestamp_updated":1503697625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532571911811828613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34490150","author":{"steamid":"76561198062489528","num_games_owned":277,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1500372649},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 1998 - 2017 RIP.","timestamp_created":1503695518,"timestamp_updated":1503695518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34489817","author":{"steamid":"76561198051621530","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1467943761},"language":"english","review":"10 Years since Half Life 2, no signs of Half Life 3.
