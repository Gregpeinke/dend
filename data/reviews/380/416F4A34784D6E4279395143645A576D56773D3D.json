To nadal świetny shooter, ale słaby Half-Life. Przez te 4 godziny (naprawdę cienko, nawet jak na dodatek) fabuła w zasadzie nie posuwa się do przodu - cały czas uciekamy z City 17 - rozgrywka jest mało różnorodna, a do tego kończy się cliffhangerem.

The game is short, with just 5 chapters but still fun to play. Alyx, the second main character, helps you and is more around you than in the last game. In the beggining she is a bit annoying, saying \"What the hell\" too many times but later on she's very helpful. A nice detail is Alyx's reaction if you flashlight her in the face. The gameplay and graphics are very similar to HL2 with some new features in gameplay, like covering the exit hole for Antilions with cars. Overall, Half-Life 2: Episode One is a fun and short game and you can finnish it in less than 5-10 hours.\n\nPERSONAL RATE: 9/10","timestamp_created":1467190521,"timestamp_updated":1467190521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23914279","author":{"steamid":"76561198116234567","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":454,"last_played":1467223300},"language":"english","review":"very good game, i love it!!!","timestamp_created":1467173633,"timestamp_updated":1467173633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23911985","author":{"steamid":"76561198152071629","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":316,"last_played":1452572681},"language":"english","review":"By far, one of the best games I've ever played with myself and some best friends of mine.

It has AMAZING graphics, NEW ENEMIES for you to kill and the classic ones of course, it's a VALVE game which makes it a OUTSTANDING game, it has NEW ENVIRONMENTS (kinda) and last but not least Alyx is helpful for the first time in a Half-Life game as she helps you to destroy tons of enemies, even though she can die now(in a mission or in one chapter at least) apart from opening doors, keeping you company and talking to you all the time. In my opinion this is an AMAZING expansion to the Half-Life 2 game and if you own Half-Life 2 then you must play it!!

Instead of spending several more years making Half-Life 3, Valve would release smaller iterations over shorter spans of time, which would also let them refine their work as they went - although they never did end up making the last episode.\n\nComing out two years after HL2, Episode One was a relatively understated success, with enhancements made in AI and the Source engine taking the technical spotlight. Viewed from a distance, it's more of an extension than an expansion. There aren't as many setpieces to remember the game by as in HL2, considering the game mostly takes place in the quotidian corridors of the Citadel and City 17, the aforementioned enhancements made for improved combat within those areas.\n\nIt's not nearly as long, dealing primarily with the aftermath of HL2's finale, but in the process avoids the drag that game sometimes suffered from. There's a decent variety on display: the first third of the game only gives you one weapon to work with (albeit a powerful one), the second third is almost survival horror, and the final third is a roaring return to Combine-destroying action. While the variety of tone and mechanics are more connected than HL2's, they also don't have the variance that HL2's displayed. I suppose that's fitting for an episodic sequel, though.\n\nYou're partnered the entire time with Alyx Vance, who is thankfully more helpful and humorous here than annoying, and it's with that you realize that Valve also meant Episode One to be an exercise in character development that did more than just have you stand around for 5 minutes every time an NPC opens their mouth. The game is largely a success in that department too, and Valve's signature stealth brilliance in writing, not to mention the aforementioned AI improvements, manage to make her not merely cool, but human. The only real criticism is the increased number of dialogue scenes (where you [i]do[/i] stand around for 5 minutes) overall compared to HL2, given Episode One isn't half as long as that game was.\n\nIf you're reading this, you probably already own it, but if you don't - or do and haven't played it for some reason - and were a fan of Half-Life 2, I'd say go for it. At the very least, it's a good bookend between its predecessor and its more ambitious sequel, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/420]Episode Two[/url].","timestamp_created":1466826268,"timestamp_updated":1527016316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579429566860198975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23750807","author":{"steamid":"76561197965666217","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":75,"playtime_forever":169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":169,"last_played":86400},"language":"german","review":"Lest mein Review zu Half-Life.

Игра была запланирована как первая часть трилогии, но как известно, до сих пор эта трилогия так и не имеет окончания. Движок облагородили, подтянули текстуры, добавили освещение HDR, улучшили ИИ. \"Episode One\" стал выглядеть существенно приятней оригинала. Но вот в целом, разумеется соблюдая общую планку качества игр от \"Valve\", первый из эпизодов получился не совсем ровный. Иногда проседает геймплей, иногда его слегка затягивают, что выглядит странно в условиях бедного на локации сюжета. По сути из \"City-17\" вы и не выходите, пробегая всю игру за 4.5 часа.\nТем не менее, важность \"Episode One\" крайне велика. Развитие общего сюжета, новые персонажи, для фанатов все это имеет куда большее значение, чем любые минусы, которые можно встретить.\n[b] Рейтинг - 80/100 [/b]","timestamp_created":1463503634,"timestamp_updated":1463503886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":42,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.792784571647644043","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23037374","author":{"steamid":"76561198055508656","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":131,"playtime_forever":528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1597922147},"language":"english","review":"This game is pretty cool.","timestamp_created":1463492161,"timestamp_updated":1463492161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.428878456354141235","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23035164","author":{"steamid":"76561198081402352","num_games_owned":479,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":250,"last_played":1653646485},"language":"schinese","review":"怎么说呢，本人出生以来，第一次接触halflife系列，就是halflife2，刚开始时看表哥玩的，2006年左右。后来自己开始尝试，当时玩到运河船道那一关就打不过去了，就气馁了，看着后面灰色的关卡图案，别提多失望了，半夜做梦都梦见自己达到了后面的关卡。当时我不到十岁，所以对未解锁但有关卡的图标，特别好奇。（做梦时真的想象着后面的关卡，当时我才6-7岁）当时我表哥不让我动他的电脑，我是趁他不注意才玩的，除了他没人有可能知道咋玩，虽然他也不知道。他玩第一章时，第一关就卡住了，就把游戏删了。\n\n之后再和半条命2打交道是10岁左右的时候，还是看我表哥玩，他下了个破解版的，所有关卡全通了的，我别提多开心了，只可惜，他的电脑出了bug，超级卡。当时玩《跟着弗里曼》一关，画面没动，就被狙击手狙死了。\n\n12岁时，我对计算机也有了更多的了解，我便自己开始玩半条命2。我自己第一次下载，还下了个带病毒的，把家里电脑整瘫痪了。之后总算下了一个完整版的，自己乐在其中。之后13岁，我有了我自己的电脑，半条命2也是装上的首选。半条命2第一章，也紧随其后。\n\n不过16岁时，因为小弟的勾引，我入了steam（别打我！）我当时还是别人送我的激活码，我激活了半条命2，拥有了steam的第三款游戏。其实就是2015年8月末。\n\n我和半条命整整十年的历程，如今，这依然是我最爱的游戏之一。起源引擎不断在更新，这也很令我欣慰，记得刚接触时，人说话嘴不动。其实，我第一次将半条命从头打到尾，也是在2015年年底。之前只是玩了几个关卡而已。我和我小兄弟，一起玩半条命2，玩《沙地陷阱》，老有人把车开翻，我们笑着，从未互相指责。\n\n真的很期待半条命3，因为这部游戏即使再优秀，也可能会被比下去，除了新作，也是为了让它再次站上高峰。这既是童年的回忆，也是未来的展望。","timestamp_created":1463480981,"timestamp_updated":1463480981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22953766","author":{"steamid":"76561198132821288","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103,"last_played":1438050302},"language":"russian","review":"-Вы готовы дети \n- Да, Капитан! \n-Я не слыыышуууу!\n-ТАК ТОЧНО, КАПИТАН!\nКТОООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООО.....................\nКто не проживает на дне океана\nGabe Nuel !\nНе жёлтая губка, взрослый мужик без изьяна...\nGabe Nuel !\nКто побеждает всегда и везде\nGabe Nuel !\nКто также ловок как рыба в воде\nGabe Nuel !\nGabe Nuel !\nGabe Nuel !\nGabe Nuel !","timestamp_created":1463143553,"timestamp_updated":1463143553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22952841","author":{"steamid":"76561198122099634","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1466615042},"language":"russian","review":"Кто HL2 знает тот заметит некоторые необычности:\n1.

The game starts with Gordon being found by Alyx in the rubble of the ruined City 17, Alyx has no idea of how she or Gordon survived the blast of the Combine's teleporter reactor. But upon contacting Eli it turns out that the explosion to the Combine's reactor has caused a rift into the Xem's world and must be stabilized at once. That means Gordon and Alyx must return to the place they tried to escape from in order to stabilize the reactor and escape from City 17 along with the help of the remaining survivors of the city. The game offers the same great experience you enjoy in Half-Life 2 along with some puzzles to solve and some challenges that will keep you on your feet like only using a Gravity Gun for a weapon until Gordon obtains weapons he's familiar with.
