Der Unterschied zu Half-life ist das diese Spiele keine Sessions von Gameplay zwischen die Story passagen ballern, die mir nach fünf Minuten bereits den Appetit genommen haben. Ich sage nicht, dass man einen Haufen Gameplay Mechaniken haben muss, aber bitte ein wenig Abwechselung. Auch wenn ich es mal jetzt sage, wie ich es glaube: Abwechselung würde die langweiligen veralteten Kämpfe nicht interessanter machen. Es würde es erträglicher machen, das Spiel lange am Stück zu spielen, jedoch habe ich bereits gesagt, dass die Kämpfe mich das Spiel nach fünf Minuten schließen lassen.

I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1620746420,"timestamp_updated":1620746420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":166,"votes_funny":37,"weighted_vote_score":"0.814338803291320801","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91825010","author":{"steamid":"76561199015955314","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":59,"playtime_at_review":330,"last_played":1660504703},"language":"russian","review":"самая лучшая игра","timestamp_created":1620745737,"timestamp_updated":1620745737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91823974","author":{"steamid":"76561198428317622","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":5198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2233,"last_played":1658443940},"language":"english","review":"⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⠛⠉⠉⠉⠉⠋⠉⠉⠙⠛⠛⠻⠿⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠋⠁⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠈⠉⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⣿⡟⠁⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠙⢻⣿⣿⣿\n⣿⠏⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⢀⣔⢤⣄⡀⠄⡄⡀⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⢻⣿⣿\n⠏⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⢀⣀⣨⣵⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⣦⣤⣀⣿⣷⡐⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⢿⣿\n⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠐⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⡀⠄⠄⠄⢚⣿\n⣆⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠛⠛⠛⠛⣿⢿⣿⣿⣿⡿⢟⣻⣄⣤⣮⡝⣿\n⣿⠆⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠉⠘⣿⡗⡕⣋⢉⣩⣽⣬⣭⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣝⣻⣷⣿\n⣿⣦⡀⠄⠄⠠⢀⠄⠄⠁⠄⠄⣿⣿⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⣿\n⣿⣿⣿⡆⠄⠄⠰⣶⡗⠄⠄⠄⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣌⠙⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡛⠱⢿\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⡀⠄⠄⠿⣿⠄⠄⠄⠨⡿⠿⠿⣿⣟⣿⣯⣹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⡀\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠄⠄⠄⢷⣦⠄⠄⠐⢶⢾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⡄⠄⠄⠉⠄⠄⠄⢉⣽⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠄\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠋⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠈⠛⠿⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋⠄⠄\n⣿⠿⠛⠉⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠘⠿⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠋⠄⠄⠄⠄\nWhere is half life 3?\n","timestamp_created":1620744495,"timestamp_updated":1620744495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465648829936981201","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91822717","author":{"steamid":"76561198828654586","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":1249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":484,"last_played":1660073226},"language":"turkish","review":"Sunucular hala yaşıyor,online oynanır,hikayesi de iyi.","timestamp_created":1620742852,"timestamp_updated":1620742852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91822446","author":{"steamid":"76561198077939398","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":97,"playtime_forever":512,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":350,"last_played":1620831103},"language":"turkish","review":"Yarım Hayat","timestamp_created":1620742509,"timestamp_updated":1620742509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91809897","author":{"steamid":"76561199033776402","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":396,"last_played":1657304337},"language":"russian","review":"Круто,но может быстро надоесть","timestamp_created":1620722499,"timestamp_updated":1620722499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91805156","author":{"steamid":"76561199107383883","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1642771586},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life is a very nice game.

Played Half-Life 2 about two years later after buying it to play Garry's Mod, which I loved. I knew enough of the story to get through the second game and loved it. One of the best games I've ever played. \n\nFINALLY got around to playing the majority of Half-Life 1 for the last couple of weeks. I've played the first 30 minutes on and off over the last 5 years. First 30 minutes is slow and boring IMO. But I pushed through. And dear god, I've been missing out. The game is not your standard FPS. You \"could\" go in guns blazing, but the game heavily encourages you to be at least a little smart about how you play. You get to a point where you actually enjoy reloading a save after scanning how many enemies are in a room, and blowing them up with trip mines and grenades. Then taking the rest out with your trusty shotgun. At one point I spent five minutes brain storming how to take out these soldiers in the generator room elevator in a creative way. I ended up setting a trip mine right in the middle of the elevator, pressed the button and laughed my ass off as they came down and exploded in a gory mess.\n\nThat's when I knew this game was special. The goldsrc engine isn't Source, I know. It's certainly not that impressive. But the creative gameplay mechanics makes up for it. You'll spend a lot of time in the first half playing the \"where the f*ck do I go\" game, but you'll get the hang of it. Don't feel bad for looking up Youtube walkthroughs though. IMO, if you spend too much time trying to figure out where to go, it gets boring and makes you want to quit. So I say go for it. \n\nTL;DR: This game is fucking awesome. Standard FPS players will take some time to get used to it. But it's worth it.","timestamp_created":1620684382,"timestamp_updated":1620684382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91788898","author":{"steamid":"76561198019251229","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":7006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":56,"playtime_at_review":3444,"last_played":1660412281},"language":"czech","review":"Co říct?

been over a decade since the last time I played this masterpiece of a game and it's just as I remembered it when first playing it. \n\nI can imagine it's pretty difficult for gamers nowadays to play (close to the original) Half-Life 1, considering that there's a source version as well as the superior Black Mesa version. That being said, there's something truly special about the vanilla version.\n\nHaving gone back after all these years, I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. The game still holds well even after all these years. It ran perfectly on my system, it easily supported 2k resolution and overall the game ran flawlessly, with only this weird echo in the game that's bothersome at first, but you get used to it eventually (never figured out how to turn it off).\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, I really do, it's one of the games that enhanced story telling in games as well as improving the overall FPS genre. On that same breath, I understand that this game is pretty old now. If graphics is a bother to you, then perhaps consider playing the Black Mesa version. It's really worth getting into the game.","timestamp_created":1620623783,"timestamp_updated":1620623783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91748654","author":{"steamid":"76561198953139772","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1185,"last_played":1645198310},"language":"english","review":"This game i perfection.\nI find this game impressive since this is made in 1998.\nI'll give it a thumbs up because valve deserves it.","timestamp_created":1620623244,"timestamp_updated":1620623244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91747706","author":{"steamid":"76561199125412443","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":41,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1659996901},"language":"english","review":"","timestamp_created":1620621080,"timestamp_updated":1620621080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91747376","author":{"steamid":"76561199057813934","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":738,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":288,"last_played":1620861847},"language":"english","review":"Played half life 2 in my childhood back in 2012 but i am finally playing this and it was worth it.","timestamp_created":1620620387,"timestamp_updated":1620620387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91741777","author":{"steamid":"76561198152052014","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4660,"last_played":1653941818},"language":"turkish","review":"Bu oyunu oynamayıp ben bu grafiklerle oynamam diyenler black mesa oynayabilir.

Özellikle o ilk yarısındaki tesis havası cidden aşırı güzeldi. Ancak ikinci yarısındaki Xen kısımları da bir o kadar berbat. Hem yol bulma olsun hem sinir bozucu platformlar olsun ilk oynayışınız ise (benim gibi) büyük ihtimal kanser olacaksınız. Tasarım demişken düşman tasarımlarının da cidden güzel olduğunu söylemekte fayda var, her ne kadar çeşitlerinin az olduğu ve arttırılabileceğini düşünsem bile.\n\nHikaye konusunda maalesef oyun hiçbir şey vermiyor. Etrafta bulunup okunabilecek bir şey olsa neyse ama olayları nereye gittiğinizden ve kiminle kapıştığınızdan çıkartmak zorunda kalıyorsunuz genelde maalesef. Hikayesi ile de öne çıktığı söylenen sırf yarım kaldığından son oyunu beklenen bir serinin ilk oyunun hikaye anlamında daha dolu olmasını beklerdim. Karakter konusunda da genelde sınıfta kalıyor. Özellikle konuşmamasına rağmen yedirilen Freeman karakterinin konuşmaya zaten pek ihtiyacı olmuyor zira karşısındaki karakterler şunu yap, sonra bunu yap vs. emir kalıpları ile kısa 1-2 cümle kurup karakterimizi alana tekrar geri salıyorlar.\n\nSes ve müzik konusunda da iyi bir iş olduğunu söylemek gerek. Özellikle bazı bölümlerdeki müzikler cidden çok güzel tek sıkıntıları kısa olmaları :d\n\nSon olarak(uyarı mahiyetinde) oyunda bazı yerlerde karakteriniz zemine batıyor ve çıkmıyor. Bu yüzden sık sık save alın. Ve birde Veri Yürütme Engelleyicisi(DEP)'ni oyun için kapatın yoksa belli bir save aldıktan sonra oyun kendi kendine kapatıyor.\n\nSonuç olarak her ne kadar 20 yılı aşırmış olsa bile elinizde hala gideri olan bir oyun var. Zaten indirimlerde almayanı dövüyorlar, zamanınızı da hak edecek bir yapım var karşınızda.","timestamp_created":1620566758,"timestamp_updated":1620566758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504470944404602051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91707976","author":{"steamid":"76561199047856693","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":315,"last_played":1620549613},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING","timestamp_created":1620565000,"timestamp_updated":1620565000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91707848","author":{"steamid":"76561197973425464","num_games_owned":1204,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1265,"last_played":1649341813},"language":"english","review":"A true masterpiece that lives on even to this day.","timestamp_created":1620564834,"timestamp_updated":1620564834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91706828","author":{"steamid":"76561199052992584","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":708,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":629,"last_played":1649771930},"language":"turkish","review":"müq","timestamp_created":1620563511,"timestamp_updated":1620563511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91704416","author":{"steamid":"76561198085786024","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":350,"last_played":1621547276},"language":"english","review":"when's half life 1 part 2 coming out?","timestamp_created":1620560242,"timestamp_updated":1620560242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1dy6qPkCcMbp3QI="}
