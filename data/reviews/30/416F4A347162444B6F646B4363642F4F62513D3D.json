А если её ещё и хорошо сделать, то тогда просто СУПЕР! \nКак по моему, корни \"Counter-Strike\" (Мой отзыв на \"Counter-Strike\" вы можете найти здесь: Игра для PC \"Counter-Strike 1.6\" (2000)) вошли в \"Day of Defeat\"! Но всё же с небольшими изменениями. Хотя и сам в официальных источниках её ссылают больше к модификация \"Half-Life\". \n\nНачну с оружия, в игре очень большое разнообразие оружия. Тут так же всё зависит от команды + иногда можно встретить на серверах оружия, которые в одиночной игре не присутствуют. К примеру пулемёт и этот же пулемёт, но с прицелом. \nЕсть снайперская на каждую команду по одному виду. Так же и с пистолетами, к примеру у немцев можно увидеть Люгер-P08. А у Англичан уже совсем другой. \nЭто мне очень понравилось. \nТак же есть: два вида винтовок(не у каждой команды обе), два вида пулемёта(не у каждой команды оба), базука и ещё несколько. \n\nТак... теперь поговорим о игровых режимах:\n1. Захват флага (Тут я думаю всё понятно и объяснять не надо)\n2. Уничтожение цели (Тоже самое что и установка бомбы и защита территории от тех, кто залаживает бомбу как в \"Counter-Strike\")\n3. Захват цели (Что-то похожее на захват флага, но захватываем не флаг, а к примеру: машину, танк и т. д.)\n4. Захват предмета ( Украл, принёс и ты молодец, спаситель!)\n\nЧто может делать ваш персонаж? А вот что:\n1. Ускориться (По умолчанию Shift)\n2. Лечь (По умолчанию Z)\n3. Бросить оружие (По умолчанию G)\n4. Подобрать гранату (По умолчанию E) \nОчень интересная функция. Узнал о ней только тогда, когда начал писать этот отзыв и решил немного прочитать об этой игре. Суть: граната, которую бросил ваш противник, может быть переброшена снова! То есть вы можете поднять эту гранату и бросить в любое направление. \n\nМинусов особых не нашёл, но есть одно, НО! ИИ (искусственный интеллект частенько видит то, что к примеру обычный игрок не видит: он может выстрелить в вас из кустов, даже если вы очень хорошо спрячетесь.\n\nЧитеров (игроки играющие с вспомогательными программами, которые позволяют им автоматически нацеливаться и видеть через стены) не встречал, но уверен что таковые есть. Школьников кричащих в микрофон тоже нет, так как их особо такие игры не устраивают, поэтому чаще вы увидите взрослых от 17 до 45 лет. НО, к сожалению был один неприятный момент, был не школьник, а мужчина по 40 лет, кричащий в микрофон что-то на немецком(не знаю что, потому что изучаю английский), хотя мужчина очень хорошо знал русский. Не могу точно утверждать, что он неадекватен, возможно просто входил в роль:)\n\nЗвук в игре проработан хорошо! Даже очень хорошо, вы можете услышать ракету, которая может упасть в определённые места на карте. И да! Хочу заметить, что эти ракеты пускают не игроки, а они прилетают, как сказать, с других территорий войны. И это выглядит очень классно, увеличивает атмосферу в игре. Что придаёт хороший стимул играть.\n\nГрафика в игре для того времени нормальная. Сейчас не все игры могут похвастаться и такой графикой. Взрывы сопровождаются осколками, грязью. От выстрелов следов не остаётся, хотя может я и не замечал. Но стёкла от выстрелов точно ломаются. \n\nТак же есть много зданий, в которые можно зайти и покемперить(сидя на хорошем местечке убивать всех подряд, некрасиво, не советую). Для того года это была хорошая вещь, не открытый мир, но всё же!\n\nСо временем игра начинает терять своих игроков:*(\nНо, она не теряет своих фанатов!

The graphics are not up to par with modern games, seeing that it was made in the late 90's. Day of Defeat provides hours of enjoyable fun. The game itself isn't complicated as it doesn't contain any bells and whistle such as unlockable content, because of this, it makes the game even more enjoyable. If you buy this game and are running it on a modern computer, you will have to type nofobo in the launch options in order to run.\n\n     Day of Defeat t is easy to learn yet it is hard to master. It has high quality game play, with several fun game modes. Many of the weapons are very powerful, and taking in consideration that there is no medic, you generally die pretty quick. The majority of the maps are small (compared to Battlefield 1942), and there are no open maps like you would see in most shooters. There are plenty of classes ranging from snipers machine gunners and rifleman. \n\n     All in all this is a really fun game, and is still played by many bringing back a nostalgic feeling every time it is played. In the end this game has great game play and old graphics, so in other words if you don't care about graphics, but game play is what matters to you, this game is for you","timestamp_created":1483737349,"timestamp_updated":1483739611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580419540405273438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29048575","author":{"steamid":"76561198309988909","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1483671980},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom, muito bom.","timestamp_created":1483663420,"timestamp_updated":1483663420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29011549","author":{"steamid":"76561198239040554","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1480385403},"language":"english","review":"I WAS DEFEATED","timestamp_created":1483549982,"timestamp_updated":1483549982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28986187","author":{"steamid":"76561198337221988","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":84,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52,"last_played":1553794680},"language":"spanish","review":"- Muy buen juego, excelente jugabilidad.

Same scenario as my Deathmatch Classic review, I was on my Dad's old Steam account and I saw Day of Defeat on it and when I was really little I used love The Military and World War II so this game was so fun to play when I was young. Now I'm not into the army anymore but this game is still very fun to play plus it brings me back to when I was a young chap.","timestamp_created":1482890511,"timestamp_updated":1482990025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.662115156650543213","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qbDKodkCcd/ObQ=="}
