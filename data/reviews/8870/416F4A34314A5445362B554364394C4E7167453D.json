Элизабет. Она чудо, самый живой и красивый персонаж, что я видел в играх. Мимика, выражения лица, всё как настоящее, даже рассердившись, она всё равно прекрасна! И вдобавок к этому, ещё и помогает в бою, патроны? Да, пожалуйста! Аптечку/Соли? Будь любезна! Отхлестать тебя плёткой, грязная свинья? О да, накажи меня!\n2. Дизайн уровней и красота Колумбии убили наповал. Невозможно передать словами, как ощущаешь объём каждой постройки, даже \"дом Элизабет\", находясь в нескольких километрах, давит своей величиной! \n3. Очень круто сделали перемещение по локации с помощью крюка-магнита, с ним игра приобретает некую кинематографичность, кучу тактик и хорошее подспорье в мордобое.\n4. От сюжета едет крыша. Он настолько круто продуман, сложен, запутан, что я минут 10 после конца игры не мог прийти в себя.\n5. По атмосфере третья часть переплюнула даже первую, которая была едва ли не лучшая в этом плане. Каждый угол мира, как живой. Взрослые болтают о житейских делах, детишки плещутся в луже гидранта, на ярмарке можно отведать ваты и хот-доги.\n6. Оружия теперь выше крыши, и в кои то веки, оно не только красиво стреляет, но и демонстрирует всю свою мощь. Энергетики доступны все по мере прохождения, большая часть сильно отличается от того, что производят в Востороге. Ещё появился щит, который при уничтожении снова пополняется через некоторое время.\n7. Прокачка идёт через глюк-бутылочки (HP-Щит-Мана) и шмот, который даёт различные бонусы. Те же пассивные навыки в Восторге, только в профиль.\n8. Над звуковым и музыкальным сопровождением поработали на славу, композиция Will the Circle be Unbroken до сих пор из головы не выходит.\n9. Русская локализация от CGInfo.TV это почти эталон качественной озвучки, никакие Фаргусы и Бука рядом не стояли. Что уж говорить, Букера озвучивает Пётр Гланц, один из самых известных актёров дубляжа.\n10. Очень хорошая оптимизация и стабильность игры, не было ни единого вылета!\n\n\n[h1][I]✎∿Плюс-Минус[/I][/h1]\n\n1. Не сказать, что графика сильно шагнула вперёд, но свет и лучи солнца сделаны просто шикарно. Тени здесь посредственные, особенно на лицах персонажей.\n2. Смену оружия видимо решили сделать ближе к реальности, больше двух носить не получится. Тоже самое и с энергетиками, они не пропадают, но в панель активных также не больше двух, что неудобно.\n\n\n[h1][I]✎∿Минусы[/I][/h1]\n\n1. У всех, кроме ключевых героев, страшные eбaлищa в количестве 2-3 типов, напоминает какое-то фрик-шоу с баянами и гусями. Странный отбор у Комстока, однако.\n\n\n[h1][i]✎∿Итого[/i][/h1]\n\n[b]Третья часть вобрала в себя всё самое лучшее, добавила много интересных механик, сломала все сюжетные границы времени и пространства. Даже поменяв дизайн водных глубин на небесную ввысь, атмосфера игры не стала хуже, а наоборот, подняла планку качества. Эта игра дарит неповторимый опыт, эмоции и частенько напоминает хорошее драматическое кино.

I loved Bioshock 1 and 2, and this game feels like someone who heard about those two games was assigned to make the third, I can't believe it's by the same studio and the same director.\n\nFirst of all, the shooting is so incredibly boring and generic. You can only carry two guns at a time, one of the many stupid cliches this game picked up from other generic games. The guns all have the same gratification factor as a pea shooter, and the upgrades are boring, standard, incremental bumps in damage, spread, ammo count... I'm already yawning. They are also incredibly expensive, requiring you to grind or cheese some feature in order to earn enough money to justify them. They also only apply to individual guns, so while you might favor a shotgun and carbine build and invest all your money into them, the game still might suddenly force an underpowered pistol and smg on you when you run out of ammo.\n\nThere is also a clothes upgrade system that provides occasionally useful, but equally boring character upgrades that are relatively rare and forgettable.\n\n If only there were another game that did guns and upgrades right... Oh yeah, there's BIOSHOCK 2, where you could hold oodles of guns that had situational advantages and you could upgrade your preferred ones and mix them with your powers and tonic upgrades to have a legitimate build that complemented your play style. \n\nYou also have a shield for no explicable reason that recharges when you hide around corners sucking your thumb a la Halo, which is a terrible way to pace the action, and another generic cliche stolen from other video games.\n\nThe powers in this game are clearly an afterthought, even though they were the mainstay of the previous two entries. They either slightly damage your opponents or momentarily waylay them. They are all a variation of that theme, even though there are supposedly 8 different vigors. Compare them to the plasmids of Bioshock two, where you had 12 different powers that did totally different things, and could be used in conjunction with different upgrades, tonics, weapons, and ammunition types to amazing effect, lending itself to multiple playthroughs with different playstyles.\n\nNow for the story, on paper it seems like a passable episode of twilight zone but in execution it's just a mess. The acting is so ham-fisted, coming from talented actors that have given great performances in other media. Anyone calling it a stylistic choice outs themselves as not understanding the style of the pulpy, retrofuturistic genre. The worst offense comes from the cringeworthily cliched characters themselves, who on the whole fail to grow or change meaningfully throughout the story, with the possible exception of Elizabeth, who makes the odd transition from naive Disney princess to a reject Rick and Morty character over the duration of one bad day.\n\nThe DLCs seem to have been based on oh-so-edgy fan fiction published on Tumblr by someone who watched the Maltese Falcon once and has a fetish for female endangerment and mutilation. I'll be honest, I couldn't bring myself to finish them so it's possible that they all turn out to be a brilliant practical joke.\n\nCompare that to Bioshock 1 and 2, where each character was steeped in charisma and enigma, so it was equally suprising and compelling if they chose to act treacherously or honorably. \n\nThe level design, though featuring gorgeous art direction, is comprised of (for the most part) endless linear corridor shooting that only serve to highlight the mediocre shooting and powers. They are occasionally broken up by the skyline sequences, in which you can attach yourself to a rail and move about the level on different floating platforms, an enjoyable feature wasted on this linear game, one that would have been better served in a more open-world format.\n\nThe exceptional part of this game is, as I have said, the art direction. The game takes place on a floating city in a steampunk alternate history of the early 1900s. The city features that delightful post-colonial architecture typical of the era, decorated with extremely colorful trappings exemplary of the 1900s exceptionalist americana. All this against a backdrop of whimsical inventions ripped straight from a Jules Verne novel. If all the enemies were removed this game would be the best walking simulator of all time. \n\nAll in all, I have to recommend Bioshock 2 to absolutely everyone. I hesitate to recommend Bioshock Infinite to anyone except pretentious neckbeards obsessed with the ending and exploitative DLCs, and steampunks with a high tolerance to pedantic busywork.","timestamp_created":1537760306,"timestamp_updated":1537760306,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600020229816436768","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44903397","author":{"steamid":"76561198292272271","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":609,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":609,"last_played":1536181693},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen final para la trilogia y excelente historia","timestamp_created":1537748019,"timestamp_updated":1537748019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44903274","author":{"steamid":"76561198212453324","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":769,"last_played":1558651780},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor jogo!
