This game is where multiplayer survival goes perfectly. It has all the right chemistry to be an extremely fun and engaging game while at the same time keeping you hooked, and thriving on it's endless replayability. It has no deep background story or singleplayer campaign, but its more like one of those games you play for your daily dose of fun and sense of challenge (well, depending how hard the difficulty of your choosing). Left 4 Dead just does not compare, even if you're not exactly fighting \"zombies\".\n\nThe downloadable content doesnt make anyone more powerful than the other, and theres absolutely limitless freedom in it in how you choose to play. Mostly thanks to the community, theres tons of easy to access custom maps, weapons, or even complete overhauls to the game. All you have to do is download it. I love this game so much, and I dont think ill ever get tired of it even after I've finished maxing out the levels of all my perks.\n\nMy ONLY griefs with this game is that they need a little bit more weapon variety. They recently let in a bunch of weapons made by the community, and i can understand balancing issues, but I feel as if theres always room for more. Also, the characters you play as have some pretty strong cockney accents. It makes it a bit hard for me to take some things seriously in the game when someone's speaking in an accent that just sounds plain... humorous.  \n\nImagine a fierce battle with hundreds of blood thirsty mutants charging in towards the last two survivors of a team that started with six. One of them is barely holding onto life, and the other comes to help him, goofily muttering \"I'm tryina heal you, not shag you!\". Sometimes the phrases are so cultured and thick accented you can't understand them. I guess it's a matter of getting used to it after a while, but sometimes they can add for some comic relief in the game and I guess serve to remind you not to take it so seriously. Even in the thick of battle. This game is amazing, and you need to buy it.","timestamp_created":1370498682,"timestamp_updated":1370498682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2267350","author":{"steamid":"76561198004862208","num_games_owned":565,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":19290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16545,"last_played":1576560905},"language":"english","review":"Fun for so many reasons, and I have much more fun with it than left for dead.
