You hop around on platforms in a futuristic setting and throw discs at other players, similar to Tron. This game is rather old, so the graphics aren't the greatest. The sound effects are lacking, and I don't recall any music. The biggest reason that I don't recommend this is because of the lack of servers. There were usually only 3-5 servers while I was playing, and most were empty or had a few bots. It would be nice if there was an offline mode with bots, but like many of the old goldsrc games, there is not. If you really want to try this out, you should definitely wait for a sale or get it in the Counter-Strike 1 Anthology.","timestamp_created":1385486499,"timestamp_updated":1385486499,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502578675746917725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7751570","author":{"steamid":"76561197997619576","num_games_owned":4120,"num_reviews":159,"playtime_forever":162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":162,"last_played":1393924083},"language":"english","review":"It's a cool game with interesting mechanics, but I can never seem to find a decent server. People don't really play this game anymore, unfortunately. And, unfortunately, a multiplayer game needs players for it to be fun. I'm a sucker for Tron-style things, but this game is, sadly, a desolate wasteland in its current state. I probably would have had a blast with this game when it first came out, but I guess I came in too late.\n\nMaybe this review can be considered a recommendation for others to play it, so I can have the actual opportunity to give this game the chance it deserves.\n\nI, personally, am game for a Ricochet 2.

It also packs a punch with its fantastic physics engine with realistic jumping, throwing and cloth effects. Comes with an incredible soundtrack for the ages, every song is absolutely phenominal and they are all must-haves for your MP3 player.\n\nIn summary: this is one of, if not the, best multiplayer games on PC.

Valve has done it again! From the creators of the Half-Life and their amazing expansion Half-Life: Opposing Force, I am proud to say that Valve has set a new standard for the gaming industry.\n\nThe first time I started Ricochet I was mesmerized by the visuals, the dark tone, and the sounds! I felt very immersed in the universe of Ricochet and the backdrop of space is truly amazing.\n\nThe main cast felt very believable, and I like the balance between emotionally driven characters and logically driven characters. I especially liked the side missions J'Chak has! Though some characters I feel got left in the dust, looking at you H'Jird!\n\nThe factions you get to join are truly amazing! From the Galactic Wardens to the Dark Cult of O'Kgha. These are just two of over 12 factions I've encountered so far, each with their own agenda and outlook on the universe.\n\nI love the gameplay mechanics, the discs felt VERY impactful! The controlls are amazing and every turn I did felt sharp and on point, I also didnt feel too fast or too slow. The jumping mechanics are very good, but considering Valves last entry this is expected.\n\nOverall I give this game a 9.2/10, it really has shaken the industry with revolutionary design and gameplay, but lacks character development with some side characters that I wanted to know more about.","timestamp_created":1325174536,"timestamp_updated":1480729233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"469862","author":{"steamid":"76561197970856423","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":37,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1325923200},"language":"english","review":"10/10 GOTYAY","timestamp_created":1325026096,"timestamp_updated":1325026096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.338081002235412598","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"741041","author":{"steamid":"76561197977081885","num_games_owned":654,"num_reviews":369,"playtime_forever":0,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":0},"language":"english","review":"Waxpax forced me to buy it.","timestamp_created":1324775033,"timestamp_updated":1385414999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"288782","author":{"steamid":"76561197967714806","num_games_owned":847,"num_reviews":367,"playtime_forever":1,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1,"last_played":1324454400},"language":"english","review":"I missed this game's heyday sadly.
