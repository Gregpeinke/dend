Bu eklenti Half-Life'taki birtakım soru işaretlerini giderdiği gibi beraberinde bazı yenilikleri de getiriyor. Oyunun hikayesi Half-Life ile aynı zaman diliminde geçiyor, hatta bir bölümde Gordon Freeman'ı da görme şansı (Oyuncu hızlı olduğu takdirde Gordon Freeman'ı öldürebiliyor.) yakalıyoruz. Hikayede Half-Life'ta karşımıza çıkan ve Black Mesa çalışanları ile uzaylıları öldürmekle görevli \"HECU\" (Hazardous Environment Combat Unit) askeri ekibinden Adrian Shephard isimli onbaşıyı kontrol ediyoruz. Oyunun başlangıcında Shephard, ekibi ile helikopterdeyken helikopterin düşmesi ile bayılır. Gözlerini açtığında Shephard kendini Black Mesa'da bulur, durumu ise kendisini kurtaran bilim adamından öğrenir. Shephard'ın aşması gereken tek engel uzaylılar değildir, çünkü HECU'nun durumu kontrol altına alamadığını gözlemleyen hükümet, askerleri Black Mesa'dan geri çeker ve işleri yoluna koymaları için Black Mesa'ya özel eğitimli infazcılar gönderir, bu infazcıların görevi Black Mesa'daki her türlü canlıyı (orada kalan askerler ve bilim adamları da dahil) etkisiz hale getirmektir. Bu noktadan sonra Shephard, yer yer yalnız ilerleyerek yer yer Black Mesa'da karşılaştığı diğer askerlerden/bilim adamlarından yardım alarak oradan kurtulmaya çalışır. Hikayenin sonunda Shephard, Xen gezegeninden gelen oldukça güçlü bir yaratığı alt eder ve sonra karşısında G-Man'i bulur. G-Man Shephard'a Black Mesa'nın bir \"utanç\" olduğunu ve \"şu an kendi kendisi ile ilgilendiğini\" söyler, G-Man bunu söyledikten sonra Black Mesa'yı yok eden patlamanın sesi gelir. Ardından Shephard'ı kastederek \"bazı tanıklar olduğunu\" ve onu korumak konusunda kararsız kaldığını, her ne kadar Shephard gibi bir devlet görevlisinin gizliliğin öneminin farkında olduğunu bilse de \"işverenlerinin güvenen kişiler olmadığını\" söyler. Daha sonra G-Man, Shephard'ı \"kimseye zarar veremeyeceği ve kimsenin de ona zarar veremeyeceği bir yere göndermeye karar verdiklerini\" söyleyip, onu uzayda bir yere hapseder ve hikaye sonlanır. Opposing Force bir eklenti olmasına rağmen Half-Life'taki soru işaretlerine çok güzel bir şekilde açıklık getiriyor, ayrıca Black Mesa faciasına Half-Life'taki düşmanlarımızdan olan HECU ekibinin üyelerinden birinin gözünden de tanıklık etmiş oluyoruz. Ek olarak hikaye sunumunun da Half-Life'a göre biraz daha geliştirilmiş olduğunu düşünüyorum. Mesela bir yerde özel infazcılar kamyonetlerinden silahlarını indirirken birbirlerine \"neden HECU askerlerin becerisizliklerinin cezasını biz çekiyoruz\" tarzında yakındıklarını ve oraya geliş sebeplerini açıkladıklarını görüyoruz. Buna benzer birkaç kısım daha eklentide bulunuyor. Half-Life'ta bunlar yoktu, varsa bile daha azdı diye hatırlıyorum. Hikaye sunumunun kötü yanlarından birisi ise ana karakterinin sesinin ve kişiliğinin yine olmaması. Oynanış olarak da yenilikler yapılmış, yeni düşman ve silah çeşitleri eklenmiş ve sadece 1-2 tane değiller. Eklentiyi oynarken Half-Life'ta görmediğim birçok uzaylı düşman çeşidi ile karşılaştım, ayrıca portal atan bir silah ve ağır makineli tüfek gibi yeni eklenen silahlar da bulunuyor, Half-Life'ın bile düşman ve silah çeşitliliği konusunda oldukça iyi olduğunu göz önünde bulundurursak, daha fazla çeşitlilik eklemek Opposing Force'u çok başarılı kılmış. Bölüm tasarımı olarak eklenti aynı Half-Life gibi çeşitli ve eğlenceli, sürekli aynı atmosfer olmadığı gibi tasarımlar sıkıcı da değil. Grafiksel olarak pek bir gelişme yok, performans olarak Half-Life gibi stabil. Oynadığım süre boyunca herhangi bir hata ile de karşılaşmadım. Half-Life Opposing Force, Half-Life'ı sevenler için biçilmiş kaftan.","timestamp_created":1621808721,"timestamp_updated":1621852781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92490262","author":{"steamid":"76561198415104234","num_games_owned":416,"num_reviews":166,"playtime_forever":418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1621804499},"language":"schinese","review":"防护服都没就敢单挑BOSS你是真的猛男，怪不得敢派你来杀了弗里曼，吓得Gman直接封号处理","timestamp_created":1621804985,"timestamp_updated":1621804985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":14,"weighted_vote_score":"0.667409062385559082","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92489753","author":{"steamid":"76561198149819751","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":107,"playtime_forever":383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1634384061},"language":"english","review":"The Forces Are Opposite","timestamp_created":1621804250,"timestamp_updated":1640799273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92488824","author":{"steamid":"76561198341372254","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1656186654},"language":"english","review":"you can: \n1:oopose the force\n2:cool kill\n","timestamp_created":1621802946,"timestamp_updated":1621802946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92479742","author":{"steamid":"76561198063414730","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1621787392},"language":"turkish","review":"valve harikası yeşil bere","timestamp_created":1621790907,"timestamp_updated":1621790907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92472157","author":{"steamid":"76561198850423598","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":595,"last_played":1621818924},"language":"english","review":"love it","timestamp_created":1621781289,"timestamp_updated":1621781289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92464227","author":{"steamid":"76561198814611847","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":28,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1620853003},"language":"english","review":"Very Good half life tittle from sierra.

If you like Half-Life 1 and want an extended side story, this might be for you. It doesn't really develop the story that much further, but it's another foray into the Half-Life story in the era of Half-Life 1 with very similar mechanics to the original without feeling too derivative. Very similar feel in how the story develops and the types of events (big monster, big firefight, cramped firefight, ducts and getting lost in buildings, linear). If Half-Life is an 8.25 in 2021, this is maybe a 7.25. At least I can say I completed it.","timestamp_created":1621631673,"timestamp_updated":1621631673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92364789","author":{"steamid":"76561198379192809","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1652624162},"language":"turkish","review":"Baya iyi","timestamp_created":1621615497,"timestamp_updated":1621615497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92359647","author":{"steamid":"76561198423376222","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1621734850},"language":"english","review":"more head crab","timestamp_created":1621608825,"timestamp_updated":1621608825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iuDax/kCf72p4AI="}
