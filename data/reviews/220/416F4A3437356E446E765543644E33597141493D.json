А все тому, що наприкінці дев'яностих – на початку двохтисячних вважалося збоченням розбавляти ураганні перестрілки усілякою хрінню. Сюжет, персонажі, драматургія та кінематографічність тоді саме нею і вважалися. [/i]\n\nГерой справжнього шутера мав бути агресивною машиною для анігіляції. Якимось солдатом або просто дуже крутим мужиком. І жодної альтернативної думки! А що сюжет? Так він потрібен у шутерах не більше, ніж у порно. Персонажі? Крутий мужик, його гарна дівчина, крутий головний лиходій і купа похвостней на підсмоктуванні. Найпотрібніші: перший та останній пункти, решту можна відкинути. Ось такими були вони, олдсукльні стрілялки.\n\nАле все змінилося, коли колишні співробітники Microsoft: Гейб \"Габен\" Ньюелл і Майк \"А це хто такий?\" Харрінгтон заснували ігрову студію та випустили гру, яка з ноги відкрила для них двері до вищої ліги. Але про ту гру якось іншим разом, зараз нам важливий факт, що це був перший успішний сюжетноорієнтований шутер... І тепер поруч зі стероїдними самцями Дюком Нюкемом, Серйозним Семом, Бласковицем і Думгаєм (тоді ще гаєм) стояв щупленький ботан з вченим ступенем з теоретичної фізики.\n\nРеліз другої частини Half-Life просто вбив 98,5% усіх шутерів того часу, а 1.5%, що залишилися, загнав дуже глибоко під шконар. Звідки вони стали вилазити та активно розмножуватися лише до 2016-го року. Таким чином, саме очкарика Фрімена треба звинувачувати у смерті Нюкема, наркоманії Сема та гомосексуальної орієнтації Думгая. Про Бласковиця краще промовчу - ви тільки на його доньок гляньте, і все одразу стане зрозуміло. Вони всі просто не мали шансів! Усі нормальні дівчатка тепер хотіли розумних, цікавих та бажано мовчазних.\n\nЛогічне питання: що ж такого було у Half-Life 2, що змогло перевернути уявлення про жанр на цілих 12 років? Проста відповідь: ВСЕ! Згадайте будь-який сучасний шутер і ви побачите у них 80% ідей, що дивляться на вас зеленими очима Гордона. Ідеї ​​акцентування на сюжеті; лінійної структури, коли закінчення одного рівня підводить на початок або є ним для іншого; реалістичної фізики навколишніх об'єктів ... Список можна продовжувати ще довго, але мій огляд і так уже затягнувся.\n\nІ тут виникає найбільша проблема цієї, безумовно, прекрасної гри (34+ премії \"Гра року\" про щось та каже) – актуальність. Справа в тому, що молодим гравцям дійсно складно пояснити, що робить Half-Life 2 настільки геніальним і приголомшливим проектом. Вони просто не знають, якою була ігрова індустрія до його виходу. Вони просто не розуміють і, мабуть, ніколи не зрозуміють. Для них шутери завжди виглядали як CoD, Battlefield, Metro, BioShock тощо.\n\n[b]Чи можу я порадити Half-Life 2 до проходження в 2020 році? Хотілося б, але дуже акуратно, і тільки тим, хто розуміє, з чим доведеться мати справу.[/b]","timestamp_created":1603336157,"timestamp_updated":1650589596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":111,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.882370471954345703","comment_count":16,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77948235","author":{"steamid":"76561199096959632","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":961,"last_played":1626324672},"language":"english","review":"duh","timestamp_created":1603332020,"timestamp_updated":1603332020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77945152","author":{"steamid":"76561198111149184","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":91,"playtime_forever":2130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2129,"last_played":1612712798},"language":"english","review":"I would make a half life 3 joke here but alyx just came out a while ago so i guess that's out of fashion now","timestamp_created":1603325516,"timestamp_updated":1603325516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77941587","author":{"steamid":"76561198001752318","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1888,"last_played":1636883841},"language":"russian","review":"It is a very famous LEGEND!\nWe are still waiting Half Life 3 >:-D","timestamp_created":1603318575,"timestamp_updated":1603318575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77941330","author":{"steamid":"76561199034122636","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":120,"playtime_at_review":1312,"last_played":1660185766},"language":"spanish","review":"lo recomiendo","timestamp_created":1603318173,"timestamp_updated":1603318173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77937677","author":{"steamid":"76561198826508154","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":6707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6327,"last_played":1632967728},"language":"english","review":"very good","timestamp_created":1603312493,"timestamp_updated":1603312493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77935036","author":{"steamid":"76561198136030152","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1540,"last_played":1650155005},"language":"english","review":"take one quiet day to get cozy and play this on your own. you'll love it. its hard to not be a half life fan after playing the series","timestamp_created":1603308703,"timestamp_updated":1603308703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77933529","author":{"steamid":"76561198327844437","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":656,"last_played":1606951094},"language":"turkish","review":"Half-Life 2 daha ne diyim aga","timestamp_created":1603306610,"timestamp_updated":1603306610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77932310","author":{"steamid":"76561198027466369","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1025,"last_played":1629990958},"language":"english","review":"best gaem","timestamp_created":1603304946,"timestamp_updated":1603304946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77931138","author":{"steamid":"76561198144968055","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":1451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1450,"last_played":1619794428},"language":"english","review":"A bit dated.

I'm very new to pc gaming and found this game to be excellent. Engaging, challenging and exciting. Story line is also quite good. That last challenge of the Dark Energy tower was tough and took me multiple tries to get through.

Plot is very well developed, narrative and pacing is all on the spot, I have no complain about it, only praise for the experience that it provides.\nMechanics of the game is not for my taste but certainly on some occasions, it provides great fun and enhances the experience (gravity gun, I'm looking at you). However on some other places, scripting of the game did cause issues in the play time which forced me to reload previous autosaves due to bugs that didn't allow me to continue the progress.\nGraphic part is the weakest part of it, but since this is old game by all standard now, it is reasonable and either way no one wanted to play this game for the superb graphics, but for the awesome story. Although to be honest, game has some very cool visual style, views and setups (both outdoor and indoor) and Citadel looks really amazing.\n\nI would really recommend playing this game, because it provides good experience to players and even for achievement hunters, if you pay attention to guides, you can finish the game and get 100% in one run.","timestamp_created":1603127718,"timestamp_updated":1603128937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77820525","author":{"steamid":"76561199017207746","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":593,"last_played":1620931372},"language":"english","review":"Very fun and good game with great story and charectors","timestamp_created":1603126832,"timestamp_updated":1603126832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77818175","author":{"steamid":"76561198885069789","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1832,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":805,"last_played":1634733701},"language":"swedish","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1603123610,"timestamp_updated":1603123610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77817925","author":{"steamid":"76561198145382707","num_games_owned":352,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2088,"last_played":1620519352},"language":"spanish","review":"⠀                   ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣤⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠿⠿⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣤⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⣾⣿⣿⡿⠛⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⢿⣿⣿⣶⡀ \n⠀⠀⠀⣴⣿⣿⠟⠁⠀⠀⠀⣶⣶⣶⣶⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠻⣿⣿⣦⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⣼⣿⣿⠋⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠛⠛⢻⣿⣿⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⣿⣿⣧⠀⠀\n⠀⢸⣿⣿⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣿⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠸⣿⣿⡇⠀\n⠀⣿⣿⡿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⠀\n⠀⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⣿⣿⡟⢹⣿⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣹⣿⣿⠀\n⠀⣿⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⠏⠀⠀⢻⣿⣿⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⡿⠀\n⠀⢸⣿⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⣿⡿⠃⠀⠀⠀⠈⢿⣿⣷⣤⣤⡆⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⠇⠀\n⠀⠀⢻⣿⣿⣄⠀⠀⠾⠿⠿⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣿⣿⡿⠿⠛⠀⣰⣿⣿⡟⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠻⣿⣿⣧⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⣾⣿⣿⠏⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠻⣿⣿⣷⣤⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⣴⣾⣿⣿⠟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠛⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠋⠁","timestamp_created":1603123303,"timestamp_updated":1658771081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77817399","author":{"steamid":"76561198450173158","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1418,"last_played":1635192327},"language":"czech","review":"Na to, jak je Half Life 2 stará hra, tak i dnes vypadá za mě velmi dobře.

The first game was definitely a huge part of gaming history as well, but it hasn't aged well for most gamers of today (though it is definitely worth giving a play at some point).\n\nOverall, the characters are easy to connect to, the storytelling is complex yet easy to understand, and the gameplay is just fun; and the world they created in this Half-Life universe is so vast and just begs to be explored. It causes you to want to sit down and play every game in the series, just because you want to see more of this world. \n\nEven if you are not a fan of Half-Life, this game is worth playing.","timestamp_created":1603121867,"timestamp_updated":1603121867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77816771","author":{"steamid":"76561198803355251","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":667,"last_played":1638994089},"language":"turkish","review":"Mükemmel oyun, hele Ravenholm'da atmosfer o kadar iyi ki kafana bir headcrap atlıyor koltuktan sıçrıyorsun.
