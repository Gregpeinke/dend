Поколение геймеров, выросших на современных играх вряд ли смогут оценить и понять всю ценность, всё величие и всю святость этой игры. И вопрос не потому, что \"мы - олдскул, а вы - нет\", дело немного в другом, дело в восприятии. Для меня Half-Life - это как первая любовь. Самый первый компьютер, который даже был не моим, а у моего друга; самый первый запуск моей самой первой компьютерной игры; самое первое главное меню (конечно же, абсолютно на английском языке, ведь ещё не было русификаторов) и самый первый клик \"New Game\" в главном меню. И вот этот поезд и я еду в нём. \n\n\"Я могу управлять персонажем! То есть, это действительно я! Могу решить пойти прямо, а могу остаться здесь! Смотрите, я прыгаю у охранника на голове! О, а здесь у нас какая-то пропасть. Всегда мечтал прыгнуть куда-то так, благо это - игра и здесь можно сохраниться и делать всё, что захочу! Я могу подпрыгивать! Могу бежать, куда угодно! А могу даже бежать и подпрыгивать, это должно выглядеть забавно со стороны! Общаться с другими персонажами, они будто живые и отвечают мне!\" - Это - краткий перечень мыслей, которые возикли в первый час игры.\n\nВ те времена не было разнообразия игр, а такие понятия, как \"нелинейный сюжет\", \"классная компьютерная графика\" и \"свобода выбора\" не то, что не поднимались - такое даже никому в голову не приходило! И никто не задавался подобными вопросами, мы просто играли. Играя, я чувствовал себя частью чего-то серьезного, череды важных событий, на которые я, как персонаж и игрок имею непосредственное влияние; история, которую я сам пишу, продвигаясь дальше коридорами. Свой первый Каскадный Резонанс я создал совершенно случайно и даже не хотел толкать вагонетку с кристаллом под этот луч, но когда это произошло - я всерьез перепугался и всем естеством прочувствовал причастность к чему-то страшному. Всю игру я проходил с чувством вины за то, что это именно мои действия повлекли за собой катастрофу, по моей вине здесь появляются монстры и из-за моих действий гибнут люди и я обязан во что бы то ни стало найти выход из сложившейся ситуации. И в отличии от всяких \"Doom\" и \"Quake\", желание спасти собственную шкуру было где-то в нижней части списка приоритетов, здесь чувство вины двигало мною до самого конца именно с целью найти решение проблемы, чтобы другие ученые и охранники перестали гибнуть из-за меня. И дойдя до победного (как тогда казалось) конца и убив самого плохого (как я тогда думал) инопланетянина, я с чистой совестью и спокойной душой выдохнул, вытер пот со лба и осознал, что я - герой, ведь спас столько жизней. \n\nСложно подробнее описать свои чувства в момент моего первого прохождения. Для меня это было более, чем невероятно. Чёрт, да, эта игра была и есть одним из лучших событий в моей жизни.
