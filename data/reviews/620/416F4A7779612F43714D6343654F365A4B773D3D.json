It's time I did. This is not a game. This is a work of art. Valve struck gold in 2007 with the release of The Orange Box, a package which indluded games like Half-Life 2 and the episodes, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Portal was an experiment, and yet was acclaimed as one of the most original games of that year. Developement of a sequel began right away. Usually it's difficult to live up to such an incredible game in a sequel, but Portal 2 showed just how good a sequel can be. An extended story, more characters and character development, and the almighty GLaDOS. The puzzles were increased in quantity, quality, and length. The gameplay was suberb, the story was even better, managing to not take itself seriously in some parts, and still managing to be serious where it needs to be. All in all, 9.9/10. Why 9.9?

Now I feel a little guilty about that. Portal 2 is one of the best video games I have played recently, and it's better than the original in every way, let me tell you why. The game has really good gameplay and level design, though they can be really difficult at times. The story itself was one of the best I've seen in a game recently. The game begins with you waking up in a room and Wheatly tries to help you escape Aperture labs. I will not spoil the ending, but it is worth playing for as it was one of the best I've seen. The dialouge in this game is also top notch, but I'm not going to spoil it. I have not gone into co-op mode at the time of this review, so I can't judge it. The only real complaint I have about the game is that it's too difficult at times. Besides that, Portal 2 is an amazing game.\nMy score: 9.5 out of 10\nI highly recommend getting the game even at it's full price.","timestamp_created":1405835175,"timestamp_updated":1405835175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539748966693878174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11327997","author":{"steamid":"76561198053116289","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1792,"last_played":1416040842},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 is personally better than portal 1 because the story mode is much more fun and it intruducees multiplayer which is really awesome.","timestamp_created":1405832555,"timestamp_updated":1405832555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11327895","author":{"steamid":"76561198006484592","num_games_owned":271,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2407,"last_played":1405749507},"language":"english","review":"You like interesting storylines?

This game is for the brain, not only because of it's brilliant puzzels, it also has a wonderful story to back them up. Then there are so many eastereggs and mysteries to uncover, you will find yourself searching for them in any place you think there might be something. Throughout the hole game there is this wonderful and smart humor, sometimes it'll make you laugh right away and sometimes you don't even realise the joke until you take some time to think about it. All of this together would've already made this game into one of my favourite games of all time, but what made it into one of my MOST favourite games of all time is it's ending. There are so many good stories out there (in games, in books, in movies), but most of them can't get the ending right, but in Portal 2 you get an ending one can enjoy, you will feel very enthusiastic and at the same time very sad, I was moved to tears.\nPortal 2 is one game I won't ever forget and I'll always remember it as one of the greatest games of all time.","timestamp_created":1405826341,"timestamp_updated":1405826341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472262173891067505","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11325160","author":{"steamid":"76561198056374234","num_games_owned":469,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":587,"last_played":1644959940},"language":"english","review":"Puzzles and humor.
