a reader without context, it might seem a bit odd that I would not recommend a well known title like Valve's original \"Portal\". Widely regarded as a breakout title for the developer and a close second behind their landmark \"Half-Life\" series, \"Portal\" made a number of Game of the Year lists and was a welcome addition to the famous Orange Box. The story and concept of this title are well-known and I will not dwell on them too deeply here, but suffice it to say that \"Portal\" was a big cultural moment in gaming once, and was the must-have title in any platform or puzzle collection. This Steam title is only slightly changed from the original release (I'll explain a little later) so a player should have the same experience with \"Portal\" as they would have had in 2007, right?\n\nWell, no. I'm not offering my opinion in 2007, but rather many years later and a lot has changed. Today, the title is terribly aged and creaky, very short and the story was more enjoyable when it was original. Back in 2007, the original \"Portal\" had a novel concept, interesting puzzles, dark humor and enjoyed a pop culture moment. In part [b]Because Of[/b] the unexpected success of the original, today we enjoy a universe of platformers and puzzle titles including Valve's much-improved sequel \"Portal 2\" which doesn't seem to have aged a day since 2011. There is a certain amount of credit owed to the 2007 original for opening a 'portal' into what platformers could be in the future, but we have to judge it today by its own merits and enjoyment.\n\nSticking with just the original 19 levels for a moment, they are moderately challenging and most players will not need help eventually solving them, although they may need a minute or so to think about the physics of most rooms. Hazards become more regular as Chell continues through the testing center but the game is forgiving of errors and deposits you near the last safe platform most times. The challenge level is enjoyable and, if that's all that matters to you, then the game may still be worth playing through.\n\nThe story is enjoyable in a folksy sort of way - a mad testing robot and a facility where the staff lost control. It's been done before in other places but was intriguing back when it was original. There's plenty of dark humor in the game with faux sympathy from a synthetic intelligence. The choices it forces from the protagonist and the methods by which the core protects itself is meant to be about 70% amusing and 30% threatening which is just the right balance. The game also doesn't ramp up the difficulty near the end to try to increase total game length, and that's welcome. My character actually died a few times in the last few test chambers but not a single time following the escape. But if you've ever played through the game before, then the jokes really aren't as crisp as when they were fresh and all the warnings are already understood. We know that \"The Cake is a Lie\"\n\nThe graphics are normal for 2005-ish and not really inspiring. Starting from the first testing chamber, you've already seen 60% of all the surface area in the game, it just gets copy-pasted for the rest of the facility. The later levels where you see the lattice and girders behind the testing chambers is pretty amusing, as though the developers are saying they know the scientific panels are just duplicated and this was an intentional design choice by Aperture Science to keep the facility looking as uniform as possible throughout. Eventually you navigate into gritty industrial areas] as part of the late game, but these areas are also 2 dimensional texture surfaces and are also not impressive.\n\nThe soundtrack provides only minimal ambiance and doesn't really signify rising or falling action until late in the game. This works okay and it isn't central to either the plot or the gameplay. Your only audible companion in the facility is the peculiar computer and it's unknown plans for you, and this provides some comic relief to break up the monotony of testing. It's not so much that the soundscape is either insufficient or misplaced, but for a game where the speed often feels sluggish, the script is often what barely holds your interest. It's a little amusing, and in those long elevator rides between levels it's all you've got.\n\nThe game is not long, and I consider that a positive attribute. The average player will probably complete \"Portal\" in two hours or possibly less. I did not personally experience any stopping points during the original 19 stages or the last chapter that forced me out of the game to YouTube for an answer, and I don't think most players will need help, but there's no shame if you do. The very last stage with GLaDOS is a little unintuitive, but not a terrible boss fight and is as good an ending as might be expected. The closing scenes are the most memorable and a terrific artistic production.\n\nOne of my single greatest complaints about this particular release of \"Portal\" are the Challenges and Advanced Maps released in this updated edition of the game. These were supposed to add new life and vitality to the game by upping the difficulty and that is exactly what they do - straight up to Masochism. The new levels are simple recycling of earlier testing levels, but floors and other surfaces on the original route can no longer receive portals and now you must use other paths at nearly impossible angles. In several of these maps, you are required to (1) shoot new portals while flying at full speed in the opposite direction or (2) dodge indestructible turrets across open hallways or (3) bounce dangerous currents of energy in uncontrollable directions to strike a precise conduit in a closed room. While the Advanced Maps are 'solvable' mostly, they are not 'enjoyable' and require a lot of both trial-and-error and mortal failure. All of them feel especially lazy and seem to almost require exploits or game-breaking features to progress. I was able to solve the first 5 Advanced Maps eventually by myself and broke after several minutes on the 6th and just looked up a solution. I don't want to offer an opinion of the game just based on the new maps, but they're easily the worst feature of the latest edition and should not have been included in any official release. Maybe a mod, but not the official version.\n\nSteam requires that recommendations be either 'Yes' or 'No', but I feel like this one should be 'Meh'. It's not that \"Portal\" is bad, but it's just that everything is better than \"Portal\" now, like \"Portal 2\" for example. There is a cultural moment for everything and we have all lived through fads such as Flappy Bird, Fidget Spinners, Yu-Gi-Oh, Angry Birds, Gangnam Style, and Pokemon GO. The original \"Portal\" was a product of its time and an interesting cultural landmark.
