És gyönyörűen vonták bele a vallásokat is... jobban mint egy Dan Brown részemről, zseniális az egész.\n\nElizabeth meg... most őszintén, ki szerint csúnya már csak képek alapján is? Akkora bociszem és arc... 20/10 would love and hug her forever. És személyiségileg is eszméletlen mély a karakter, egyszerűen imádnivaló, és még a szinkront nem is említettem... hát fenomenális, na, meg ahogy énekel... :) Tényleg tagadhatatlanul a legjobb.\n\nA történet meg... brutális. Aminek indult az egész (nem nagy spoiler: a lány megmentése hogy eltörlődjenek a főhős szerencsejátékos adósságai) az alapján azt gondolná az ember hogy ez egy faék FPS lesz - hát nem. Én személy szerint nagy bejárható területeket vártam, nem kaptam meg - legalábbis a klasszikus formában, nem lett egy GTA. De ez így van rendjén, nem egy cső CoD lett, jóval több szabadság van annál, nyitott terekkel is... de nem lövöm le, aki játszik (melegen ajánlom!) vele az tudja mire gondolok. De ez igazából mind semmi, olyan szinten forgatódik fel a történetről alkotott képed hogy csak na... de tényleg, ezt át kell élni, szóval most azonnal vedd meg és játszd végig, nem fogod megbánni. :)\n\nA grafika: Unreal Engine 3, szóval ne várj egy Crysis-t vagy Battlefield-et... de a játék olyan szinten gyönyörűen van megcsinálva művészileg és annyira jól kidolgozva, hogy nem is fog érdekelni mert gyönyörű a képvilág, tényleg, mintha egy remek festmény vagy nem tudom mi lenne. Gyönyörű és tökéletes.\n\nA hangok: Korhű, a beszéd persze bonyolultabb a mai lelaposodott és elszlengesedett angolnál, másabbak a szóhasználatok és tele van ritkább és régebbi szavakkal. A soundtrack meg fenomenális... a '80-as évekből vannak átdolgozott számok, mind remekül szól, az egyik jelenetnél meg Elizabeth éneke... meh, gyönyörű, pont.\n\nA korhűséget minden téren eltalálták: tökéletesen mutatja be az akkori gőzgépes-fémes-fás fantasy világot; a rajzok, plakátok mind csodálatosak (gratulálok a grafikusoknak és designereknek, remek munka!), szinte semmibe se lehet belekötni. \n\nAhhoz képest hogy a játék láthatóan erősen át lett formálva és meg lett vágva a régi prezentációkhoz képest (nézzetek belőle régi gameplayeket meg trailereket, a 2010-es és későbbi (nyílván nem 2013-as) build-ek konkrétan tök másak voltak a véglegeshez képest - több lehetőség, másabb jelenetek, etc) marhajó lett - szerintem ez az egyik mintapéldája annak hogy ésszel kell nyírbálni és faragni és akkor jó lesz. Bár lehet hogy az akkori tervek alapján jobb lett volna? Franc tudja... de ez így is tökéletes.\n\nNekem egyetlen problémám volt vele, de az is a végével: kicsit sok mondandót sűrítettek bele, ezen lehet tanácsosabb lett volna nyújtani egy picit, de who cares, ha nem értetted teljesen a végét akkor még egy indok hogy újra végig játszd. :D \n\nVerdikt: Tökéletes. Az előző néhány évben megjelent játékokat mind lepipálja nálam... pedig azért volt Mass Effect is köztük ami a szívemhez nőtt, de ez tényleg túltesz rajtuk, egyszerűen minden imádnivaló.\n\nMit mondhatnék még? Hát, egész éjjel azon kattogtam hogy milyen brutálisan jó volt... akármilyen aspektusra is gondolom vissza előjön az a bizonyos érzés. \n\nÚgy érzem, hogy itt az ideje az előző két Bioshock-ot is megvásárolni, meg az Infinite-hez való Season Pass-t... a Burial az Sea nagyon jónak tűnik, ideje lenne kipróbálni. Bár lehet hogy megvárom azt hogy leárazzák, mert 20 euro kicsit sok nekem érte ha tényleg rövid (bár igaz hogy csak az ep1 jött ki belőle eddig).","timestamp_created":1389011921,"timestamp_updated":1389012184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8590352","author":{"steamid":"76561198080254220","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":998,"last_played":1386362294},"language":"french","review":"Ce jeu est magnifique l'histoire super bien ficellée la difficulté très bonne je conseil de mettre le jeu en difficile directement sauf si vraiment vous être un joueur moyennement bon car un jeu comme bioshock c'est pas tous les ans donc vraiment faut profiter \n\nEn cherchant un peu les succes et en visitant toutes les pièces du jeu ( enfin je crois ) j'ai fini le jeu en 16 h c'est raisonnable sans être une durée de vie monstrueuse mais bon c'estles jeux de maintenant aors que faire :) \n\nJe rajoute que c'est un jeu que je connaissais pas et vraiment un plaisir une belle évasion .","timestamp_created":1389011820,"timestamp_updated":1389011820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8590112","author":{"steamid":"76561198093406454","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1452202476},"language":"russian","review":"отличная\n","timestamp_created":1389010495,"timestamp_updated":1389010495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497702896595001221","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8589484","author":{"steamid":"76561198088303299","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1433201237},"language":"german","review":"sehr sehr geiles spiel und die wolkenstadt sieht sehr gut aus auf dem pc mit hoher auflösung die gegner sind nicht stark fordernd aber die story ist sehr gut herrübergebracht","timestamp_created":1389007183,"timestamp_updated":1389007183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8589442","author":{"steamid":"76561198069683575","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":840,"last_played":1649305353},"language":"brazilian","review":"ótimo jogo, como todos da saga","timestamp_created":1389006898,"timestamp_updated":1389006898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8589392","author":{"steamid":"76561198090827673","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":694,"last_played":1509094077},"language":"english","review":"good story.\ngreat graphic.\nnice gameplay.","timestamp_created":1389006547,"timestamp_updated":1389006547,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8589232","author":{"steamid":"76561198009100394","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":2826,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2820,"last_played":1514658198},"language":"russian","review":"[h1]Динамичный и затягивающий[/h1]\n\nНереально интересный и загадочный сюжет, много экшена, крови, оружия и плазмидов!

I played this game for fifteen hours, and looked for the plot-twist the whole way through, and still didn't see it.

The sounds are good, nice and authentic and you don't really tire of hearing or seeing anything.\n\nVisually it's a great game. But that's all I can see it as.\n\nThe gameplay is really uninspired. This seems to be what I hear the most complaints about and its true, you're given limited choices in what to improve and you have a large array of weapons and abilities but often you're limited to rock, paper, scissor decision making. Did you bring A with you to fight D? No? Then you'll have a more drawn out battle. Death isn't a factor due to the many checkpoints and revives (when a certain NPC is with you) and the skyhook just felt more like a nuisance than a godsend. I barely used in my playthrough.\n\nSpeaking of playthrough, it's a long game, longer than I thought. But in this case it's not a good thing. The game has you back tracking a lot, and if you do the side quests you'll be going through the same areas again and again with respawning enemies. The enemies aren't fun to fight, they quickly begin to be tediuous. Tie in the fact that the only way the game is saved is through checkpoints so you'd better stop playing after a checkpoint or you're going to have to do the whole level again.\n\nSo, gameplay could have stood to have a lot of improvement but it's at least decent. If I had to talk about the companion character it's really shallow as well, the game would have been fine without them and their scritped and proximity events (giving items) get old quickly.\n\nNow, on to the elephant in the room, the story. The first part of the game there really isn't much story, all barebones, in fact throughout the game theres barely anything, if you get collectibles it fills in the gap but at face value they really give you the minimum. There's a name to that style that eludes me but given how the gameplay is they've used what they've been given. For all the \"twists and turns\" that get thrown at you I found the story to be predictable save one bit at the end that really ended up being a dues ex machina by the writer. During the last few hours (the ending is really really really drawn out and it isn't in a good way in my opinion) I struggled to stay interested, mainly trugging through it because I'd be finished soon and could remove the game from my library. It's much how I felt during most of my playthrough, the parts that were entertaining kept me but those are few and far between. There's just too much filler in this game.\n\nIn closing, it's a decent game, good sound and visuals, repetitive and boring combat, and a story that if I had to summarize is really contrived and uninteresting.\n\nIn summary:\nGraphics - Good\nSound - Good\nGameplay - Boring\nStory - Bad and Boring\n\nI can't recommend the game.","timestamp_created":1388953112,"timestamp_updated":1389279743,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8579308","author":{"steamid":"76561198044755597","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1383,"last_played":1530790163},"language":"russian","review":"Без лишних слов.

A task so easy and predictable, you really don't have any need for sky rails or your powers.  You could just as easily pick up solely the carbine rifle and waltz your way through the game.\n-Vigors that often feel repetitive, uninspired, or just down right useless when compared to simply shooting your victim.\n-Half the weapons even in their upgraded form pale in comparison to others, such as the Burstgun. They also did away with changing the weapon models to reflect the upgrade, which was a fun aspect I liked in the previous game.\n-Over priced upgrade stations around every corner, that will eventually make you wonder why you are scavenging every coin to barely afford an upgrade that has such a small overall effect on game play.\n-Very little suspense, mystery, and ambience when compared to the first two games.\n-A sidekick who has the ability to summon objects into existence, yet the imaginative designers chose to only have the same four object types which are placed similarly every fight in the game.\n\n\nThis game really becomes a grind with an astonishing disparity between environment and gameplay.  As you go through the game it further and further boils down to \"pickup things, enter room, clear room of the same reskinned enemies , pickup things, proceed to next room\".  You start with a new an interesting world that some how degrades into the shooting grind of the airships towards the end of the game... a grind that many other games have done better.\n\nThe game is worth playing at a greatly reduced sale price, but I am really confused how people think that it should of won GOTY 2013 or that it is a true spiritual successor to the two previous games.","timestamp_created":1388952094,"timestamp_updated":1388952094,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518053352832794189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8578958","author":{"steamid":"76561198047574414","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1461,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1419841011},"language":"english","review":"Good story, the gameplay could've been better.

Хотя развитие сюжета было несколько натянуто по ходу игры, но концовка не только расставила все по своим местам, но и спасло повествование. Биошок Инфинит - это фактически кино, поданное в виде игры. Ролевого тут только прокачка оружия и умений, но это второстепенное, на ход игры не влияющее принципиально. Выбора по ходу сюжета нет - он полностью линейный. Маленький совет: не тратьте зря времени на обшаривание всех закутков на локациях, идите по сюжетной линии.\nЭтой игре пели много дифирамбов после появления, но лично мое мнение - ее немного переоценили. Видимо, сказался авторитет Кена Левина. Хотя есть вероятность, что мне просто на душу не лег и сюжет, и персонаж Элизабет. В любом случае, это блокбастер, на который не жалко потраченных денег и времени на прохождение.\nПо моему личному рейтингу Биошок Инфинит занял место среди подобных игр (игра-повесть с полностью линейным сюжетом, даже без развилок) выше Фар Край 3, но ниже Томб Рейдер 2013.\n\nP.S.
