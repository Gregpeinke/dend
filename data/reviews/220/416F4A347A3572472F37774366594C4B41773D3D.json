Rise and shine, mr. Freeman, rise and shine...\n\nМоя первая игра. Игра десятилетия. Игра на века! Именно HL2 во многом определил вид современных шутеров/экшенов. Однако нельзя воспринимать эту игру стандартными мерами оценки. Я могу сказать, что это самое удачное сочетание геймплея, игрового мира и сюжета в истории компьютерных игр. Приключения Фримена оставляют огромное место для творчества, но и внутриигровые события породили не одну дискуссию. Описывать HL2 - всё равно что пересказывать сон - удивительный, который можете понять, казалось бы, только вы.

Der Steam Support führt dies auch nachträglich noch durch.[/b][/h1]\n\nDie Geschichte von Half-Life 2 spielt in einer dystopisch anmutenden Zukunftsversion unserer Welt und auch dieses Mal schlüpft der Spieler in die Rolle des stummen Protagonisten Gordon Freeman, dem Held von Black Mesa aus dem ersten Teil der Serie. Neben einigen vertrauten Personen, die man im Verlauf des Spiels trifft, ist natürlich auch wieder die allerwichtigste Waffe mit von der Partie: Gordons Brechstange.\nUnd keine Sekunde zufrüh, den kaum in \"City 17\" angekommen wird er von den Combine gejagt, die sich als neue Herrscher über die Menschen auf dem Planeten etabliert haben.\nUnd das ist erst der Anfang. Die extrem spannende Story erstreckt sich nämlich über bis zu 18 Stunden Spielzeit und lässt selten an Spannung nach. Nur die Missionen im Hovercraft können zum Teil ermüdend sein.\n\nIm Waffenarsenal unseres stummen Brechstangenschwingers befinden sich auch dieses Mal wieder viele verschiedene Waffen wie Schrotflinten, Sturmgewehre und eine Magnum und sogar einige der Waffen aus dem ersten Teil, wie der Raketenwerfer oder die Armbrust, sind mit am Start.\nDie größte Neuerung ist jedoch die Gravity-Gun, die es erlaubt, Gegenstände aus der näheren Umgebung zu Wurgeschossen umzufunktionieren, die man dann auf seine Feinde schießen kann.\n\nIn vielen Leveln gibt es auch kleinere Rätsel, die den Spieler bei der Lösung mit Gesundheit oder Munition belohnen. Einige davon stellen in eindrucksvoller Weise die schönen Physikalischen Eigenschaften der Source-Engine heraus.\nUnd auch nach dem die Story durchgespielt ist, ist noch lange nicht Schluss: Im Internet gibt es haufenweise von Mods für Half-Life 2.\n\nSchade ist jedoch, dass einige der futuristischen Waffen aus dem ersten Teil nicht dabei sind und die Gravity-Gun die einzig wirklich Neue ist.\n\n[h1][b]Fazit[/b][/h1]\n\nAlles in allem ist Half-Life 2 ein sehr gelungenes Spiel und gehört inzwischen zu den Klassikern in den allermeisten Spielesammlungen.\nFür mich persönlich ist es eines der besten Spiele überhaupt.

What I wasn't aware of at the time was that those \"extra games\" would turn out to be my [u]all-time favorite video games on any platform.[/u]\n\n[h1]The Story of Half-Life 2[/h1]\nThe story of Half-Life would be complex to someone who has never experienced the series. The series includes everything from transdimensional beings invading a research facility in New Mexico, to a rising resistance against an alien species who dominated the planet in 7 hours. Half-Life explores all these events from the perspective of one theoretical physicist and MIT graduate Gordon Freeman, wielding his dangerously effective crowbar.\n\n[h1]What Makes Half-Life 2 Different?[/h1]\nWhat makes Half-Life 2 different from other FPS games is its approach to storytelling. Rather than building up its environment and setting, introducing all these new characters, and making you wait through annoyingly long cutscenes, the games just.. starts. I mean, it does have a very quick cutscene at the beginning of the game but it is so short that it isn't a bother. The game throws you into this dystopian setting without explanation or even a clear idea of where you are headed, but somehow you just find yourself going the right direction. This games storytelling is unmatched by any other game I have ever played, the story just unfolds as you play and that right there is what makes games enjoyable, \"playing\" them.\n\nThe game does not interrupt you to explain what is happening, you are not bombarded with information to process, you simply just play it. As you play, small details are explained and over time are subconsciously pieced together and by the end you understand its story without feeling like you had to think too hard about what was going on. Something I find annoying in other FPS games is all the tutorial interruptions, overloading amounts of backstory, and character introductions before you even start the game, I find myself wanting to take a break after the first 20 minutes of most new games that I play. But not Half-Life 2. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nGameplay is pretty standard yet fun, as this game is running on Valve's very own Source engine, used in many other games such as Portal, Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead, and Counter-Strike. I personally would argue that if you've played any of those other games running on the Source engine, then you can expect how gameplay is in Half-Life 2. Though what makes Half-Life 2 unique is its use of physics in the environment, to either progress in the level or as an advantage against enemies, as the Gravity Gun allows you to pick up objects and fire them back at enemies.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nOverall, Half-Life 2 is an artistic masterpiece and to this day still represents what video games can allow the player to experience. Amazing story and characters that'll have you wishing for Half-Life 3...","timestamp_created":1364945468,"timestamp_updated":1620041410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5727","author":{"steamid":"76561197960292098","num_games_owned":291,"num_reviews":97,"playtime_forever":97,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":64,"last_played":1375819243},"language":"english","review":"the one that started it all for valve. the 3d effects are off the notch and has several vehicles for you to simulate driving in with, the alex character is one th e best characters in the game, she is always there with a gun to help. you are gordon","timestamp_created":1364929840,"timestamp_updated":1364929840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4894908","author":{"steamid":"76561198042982701","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":788,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":779,"last_played":1590307912},"language":"english","review":"This game, as well as Halo:CE, revolutionized the FPS.

Since then I haven't played any of the series, but the nostalga was too much so I purchased this game, aa part of a Valve Steam Pack that granted access to it, its expansions, Portal, and Team Fortress. Upon playing the game, I was transported back, in a way, as Half Life 2 is an excellent second outing for this highly-touted series. I really enjoy the gameplay, the monstors are challenging, the guns are awesome, and the puzzle-esk gameplay is exactly as I remembered. The low graphical quality is easy to overlook, because the storyline and game mechanics are so captivating and fun, respectively. I know that I am only one of many who have voiced support of this game, particularly at this late date in its existence, but for the steam price you aren't going to get much more bang for your buck then this game. It, like Boondock Saints and Fight Club, has a cult following, and there's a reason for that. If you don't mind the outdated graphics it is well worth the price.","timestamp_created":1362264966,"timestamp_updated":1362264966,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6191857","author":{"steamid":"76561198060922825","num_games_owned":829,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":688,"last_played":1410195759},"language":"english","review":"Плюсы\n1.Гордон Фримен\n2.Захватывающие бои\n3.Неплохая озвучка\n4.Сити 17 похож на Восточно Европейский город\nМинусы\n1.Мало патрогов\n2.Более реального оружия\nМоя оценка 9.5","timestamp_created":1362225483,"timestamp_updated":1362225483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533644199371337891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6182609","author":{"steamid":"76561198060743601","num_games_owned":988,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":1210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1547845734},"language":"english","review":"ахеренная игра!!!\nпрошел уже 4 раза","timestamp_created":1362139692,"timestamp_updated":1362139692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105773","author":{"steamid":"76561197961964924","num_games_owned":423,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1312959600},"language":"english","review":"How could you not have played this already?
