So this is what the wait for Half Life 3 feels like. \n\nHalf Life 2 Episode Two is the sequel to Episode One and begins straight away. We find ourselves in the outskirts of City 17 as the Citadel has now opened a portal to the Combines home world and it's now up to us to find a way to the rebel base and shut down the portal once and for all.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to previous titles in the Half Life 2 games.  Overall there's not much to say here as it's basically DLC to Half Life 2. \n\nGraphics wise this game looks a tad bit better than Half Life 2 due to the range rendering, which I thought was under used in Half Life 2 Episode One. The portal coming from the citadel can be seen throughout the entire game which looks outstanding.\n\nThere is a reason this is my favorite Half Life title and that's the action sequences. This game is like a great action movie. Action scenes after action scenes after action scenes and it all ends up to one of the biggest cliffhanger endings in history of gaming. I'm not joking it actually pains me not knowing what happens next.\n\nI also love the incredible soundtrack. It's beyond kick ass and is one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time.\n\nIn the end Half Life 2 Episode Two is a thrilling ride and it should be played by everyone. I'm glad I finally joined the bandwagon. Now I can join the Half Life 3 waiting community. \n\nFinal Rating:\n10/10 - A must own and a must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in

Half-Life 2: Episode Two was developed by Valve Corporation and released late 2007.\n\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b] The story picks up, right where Half-Life 2: Episode One left off; Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman are going to be reunited with Eli Vance and Dr. Kleiner to plan the next step in their battle against the Combine forces.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520577049\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] This game returns to the more familiar setting of Half-Life 2, you aren't forced to rely solely on the Gravity gun like in most of Half-Life 2: Episode One. There is a new NPC that you encounter called “Hunters”, these are savage killing machines that are very imposing and at times down right freighting when encountered.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520577103\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b] There are 22 achievements on Half-Life 2: Episode Two. One third of the achievements are unlocked just by playing through the story. The rest are pretty tough and require careful planning, or a very long time running around.\nThe most noteworthy achievements in this game are: Get Some Grub [i](“Squish every antlion grub in Episode Two” – That took forever.)[/i], and Little Rocket Man [i](requiring you to Carry a Garden Gnome from the beginning of the game to nearly the end)[/i] – I have an obsession with garden gnomes because of this achievement, stay away from the precious!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520577080\n\n[b]Price:[/b] Half-Life 2: Episode Two is priced at $7.99, you're better off purchasing [url=http://store.steampowered.com/sub/469/]The Orange Box[/url] for $19.99, where you will gain all the Half-Life 2 games + Portal 1.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] I think Half-Life 2: Episode One, and Half-Life 2: Episode Two, really should have been one amazing game. Separate they're short but sweet. To quickly recap, Story: Excellent. Gameplay: nearly identical to the previous games. Achievements: Getting 100% completed will take longer then Half-Life 2, or Episode One. Price: a bit high, but the orange box is an excellent deal for the whole series.\nI recommend this game to anyone who's played Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode One. You don't want to jump into this game, you will want to play the previous games first.\nThank you for reading my review!\n\n[b]Related reviews[/b]\nHere's the URL to see my review for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/220] Half-Life 2[/url]\nHere's the URL to see my review for [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/380] Half-Life 2: Episode One[/url]\nHere's the URL to see my review for Half-Life 3 ...[i](Pleaseeeeee Gabe Newell, my life will be complete... my Half-Life!)[/i]","timestamp_created":1442877924,"timestamp_updated":1442878005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549065053462982178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18132383","author":{"steamid":"76561198116678774","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1591311857},"language":"german","review":"Die Fortsetzung von anderer Half Life teile auch nicht schlecht nur schade dass die Story bei diesem Teil zu kurz ist hätte erwartet dass es ein bisschen Länger wäre, kurz gesagt runterladen und spielen empfehle es jedem.","timestamp_created":1442846204,"timestamp_updated":1442846204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18131004","author":{"steamid":"76561198111996264","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":257,"last_played":1591198037},"language":"russian","review":"пиздатое продолжение 10/10\n\n\nValve Preview the Half Life 2: Episode 3  please","timestamp_created":1442838874,"timestamp_updated":1442838874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18117188","author":{"steamid":"76561198158787850","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1442755141},"language":"russian","review":"в конце аж вплакнул!\n","timestamp_created":1442755497,"timestamp_updated":1442755497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18113698","author":{"steamid":"76561198060582503","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":1283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1283,"last_played":1490443417},"language":"english","review":"gnome","timestamp_created":1442740166,"timestamp_updated":1607187867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18092910","author":{"steamid":"76561198122823099","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":391,"last_played":1431190618},"language":"portuguese","review":"foda porem estamos ainda ESPERANDO QUE NEM UNS RETARDADO MENTAL PELO 3","timestamp_created":1442630675,"timestamp_updated":1442630675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o6Xf8c8CfraCRQ=="}
