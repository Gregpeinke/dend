There are a lot of great games out there (of which this is definitely one), but they all have their major flaws in either gameplay or story elements. I would be lying if I said this game is like 100% perfect all the time since that's a stupid thing to claim in any game. However, I can say that it's probably the most complete and awesome game I've played in the last five years.\n\nCons:\n\n-- The story can, at times, seem a bit emo and saccharine but it really only comes out like that if you're a cynical dick like me. Also, some characters like the Lutece twins are VERY cliche and kind of annoying. Listening to them talk is like listening to an episode of the Gilmore Girls with the cadence of their speech being like it is.\n-- IMO, most of the vigors are just kind of useless. I found that I didn't even ever want to use many of them.\n-- Again, IMO, the clothing upgrade system isn't very well fleshed out. I rarely ever found myself switching up that much.  This is mostly because a great number (perhaps a majority) of the upgrades are based around using the rails during fights and honestly there aren't a ton of points where I found myself wanting to fight from the rails.\n\nPros:\n\n-- The story is, far and away, better than any game I've played in the past five years. It is completely immersing and the characters are pretty relateable.\n-- The environments are gorgeous and really fun to battle in.\n-- Being able to open up tears during battles is a really cool mechanic.\n-- To that end, Elizabeth (the character you spend most of the game with) is like one of the only escort characters in a video game that is not 100% useless. In fact, I feel like how useful she was helped story-wise as it made me really want to have her back on the few times she was gone.\n-- I prefer buying gun upgrades in this game versus having to find upgrade stations you can only use once (original Bioshock).\n-- The ending. There's nothing I hate more than playing a game for like ten or fifteen hours only to have a simple, fast ending. That sucks and it makes me not want to get invested in the characters or story because who cares. This game, on the other hand, had an unbelievably great ending that was cerebral, emotionally fulfilling and just great.\n-- The in-game cinematics. There aren't really a bunch of cut-scenes or anything, but the way rooms and environments are set up to reveal themselves to you is just plain amazing. Opening the room in the museum talking about how Comstock killed everyone is a perfect example of this.\n\nIn summary, get this game. It really does have everything and is, in my opinion, the best of the series. I really just can't say anything better about this game. Sure there are things that annoyed me, but in the grand scheme of things they are so pitifully minute that I'm embarrassed to care. If you can find this game on sale, get it even if you don't plan on playing it right away. If you can't find it on sale, get it anyway.","timestamp_created":1414812638,"timestamp_updated":1414812638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12717574","author":{"steamid":"76561198069671852","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":659,"last_played":1482707379},"language":"english","review":"Only played 2 hrs of it but thats all I need to recognise this is an amazing game, looks beautiful on any quality, definetily deserves 2013 Game of the Year.

And for lack of any better words, all I can really say in general is that this game is truly a superb action adventure game with a refreshing soty and stellar gameplay.\n\nFirstly, the graphics-they're some of the best I have ever seen, even now which says a lot considering this game is almost two years old and the release of new gen consoles and PC games should open a agte for beautiful games, which they have, but this still looks gorgeous. I have a beast PC so I could run this on Ultra settings and let me tell you, that first glimpse of Columbia and the scene where New York is being destoryed and the city in general, especially the garden sections are a wonder to gaze at, they're that good. The character models are well animated and look good and the architecture is realistically crafted.\n\nThe gameplay is very good, not perfect, though. When I first played on my Xbox 360 a year ago, the aiming controls were fine because it was a controllet, but having to press MMB to aim and the RMB to use Vigors and V to melee and considering the recoil early on is high, it was very awkward to use. But thanks to the PC's marvelous mechanic of remapping controls, I changed them up to how I liked them and it felt very nice to control. Game difficulty is mixed, I played on easy because I had played this game up to the near end twice so I wanted to finish it, and for the most part it was a breeze considering it took only eight hours to beat and I died maybe three or fours times, but sometimes it becomes more frustrating than difficult. An example is near the end when you fight Lady Comstock, you have to essentially do the same boss fight three times, which was fine I just wish it had more variety, but the fight itself was tedious because of the repetetive nature of it. It's the same with the large areas with the Skylines where you have to fight Handymen and guys with Flak cannons, it gets annoying but again, they're not so tough so it can be easily overlooked.\n\nArguably the best thing about this game is the story, it is blockbuster movie quality. At first. all you need to do is catch a girl to \"wipe away the debt\" your character Booker DeWitt has. Simple, eh? Well as you progress you find out this Columbia is an independant city which is run on a very strict religious system, where the leader is worshipped as a prophet and the US founding fathers are, too. It has a lot of racist and conservative moments in it. You get sidetrakced often from your objective which is to take Elizabeth to Paris. You end up travelling to alternate universes where you are aprt of the Vox, then against it, and alot of things end up different than anticipated. Near the end, you need to kill Comstock in order to stop Elizabeth's protector (The songbird) from stopping her leaving for Paris with the false shepard (Booker). This is when the famous bit arises. After you kill comstock and prevent New York's destruction, you find out that in these \"tears\", these alternate universes, all have Booker in them. They all start with a lightouse, and ends with the destruction of a city. You find out you ARE Comstock and therefore Elizabeth or Anna's father. And the only way to prevent the cycle of their being a city and a man is by preventing the transition Booker had into Comstock, which is a baptism Booker has after fighting the battle of the wounded knee. So, Elizabeth's and Anna's from that universe kill Booker, thereofre killing Comstock, stopping Anna or Elizabeth being captured and stopping the city of Columbia being destoryed and stopping the cycle. A creepy element is the fact that there os another game where at the beginning there is a man, a lighthouse and a city that gets destoryed, sound familiar? Yes, Booker is the character from Bioschock in an alternate universe. To be honest, I still don't know fully what the ending means but it stimulates the brain and makes you think, and it is a brilliant twist. I can understand fans dissapointment with the ending, as you could say that technically it was all never happened and was a weird paradox, but I like it. The story it tells regardless of it's background and whether or not it all ends up to being one in a million scenarios, the story it tells is a good action packed one with good characters and amazing environments.\n\nI could write a detailed conclusion, but I feel I have done so already. But I will leave you with some good advice: BUY THIS GAME. You will not regret it, a masterpiece that cost only £7 WITH the first two Bioshock's which I will be playing shortly.","timestamp_created":1414800893,"timestamp_updated":1414800893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12716544","author":{"steamid":"76561198065923013","num_games_owned":350,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":657,"last_played":1468689795},"language":"english","review":"Dear god in heaven this is amazing...

The gameplay experience is shallow but the production values are pleasent enough and the social commentary is reason alone to experience the game. \n\nArbitrary and bland gameplay, mechanically dated, lack of varriation in interactable objects, graphically mediocre in many ways, little to no presence of physics aside from rag-doll on entities and some particles...\n\nI am left wanting a great deal more from the title but at the same time I'm confident this is exactly the game it was supposed to be. Which I have found is to serve as a commentary vehicle on art, science, culture, religion, and despite the appearances of a romanticism of 'Americana' some subtext seems almost anti-american and anti-capitalist. Also it should go without saying the game is topically rife with racism. \n\nThis game is a presentation of concepts and ideas about not just being a videogame or the climate of industry of game development - there is a larger commentary being presented about the state of democracy, corporation, and the acceptance of cosumerism. If anything Bioshock is synonimous with extremism taken to the extreme. Take a concept, ideology, or cultural reference and turn it to full and bend that archtype. Then when you have it set to 11 out of 10, push it further to 14. \n\nThe short falls are in place to break up the fast gameplay instances in a set-dressingly delicious cultural backwash fashion. They're ok instances but not the strong points despite the great efforts gone into them.\n\nLoved by many, despised by some, certainly a title to check out if you enjoy a steady and solid FPS romp that sets out to challenge the concept of 'forced hands', which is themeatic to the Bioshock name in more ways that two. Respect to those who made this project.
