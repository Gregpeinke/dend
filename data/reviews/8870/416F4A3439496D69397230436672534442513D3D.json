Думаю, иной движок никак бы не вписался в концепцию игры. Есть и маленькие недочёты, как отстуствие теней в некоторых местах. Было чувство, что я играю призраком.\nИтог: Сюжет - 10/10; Звук и музыка - 10/10; Графика - 9.5/10; Управление - 8.5/10 = 10/10 баллов.

Don't get me wrong, the story is amazing, and the combat I had a lot of fun with (keeping the two weapon max system in mind), but is it really as perfect as every reviewer would have you believe? Well, kinda. Its not perfect by any stretch of the means. Granted, its really good, but is it 10/10 good. The answer is no. The story deserves it, without a doubt, but the game lets you down with its very linear progression, the two weapon system, and a few of the bosses and heavy hitters are such a pain you could empty the ammo of everything you have, and your salts, and all the weapons you find around you. At that point, it makes the combat not even feel satisfying, especially when after 3 deaths the game toys with you by saying you can lower the difficulty. I truly hate it when games baby you like that. If I wanted to play on a lower difficulty, I would have played on a lower difficulty goddammit! The normal combat is fun and exciting though. With the vigors and skyrails, you have tons of combinations at your fingertips to how to approach your targets. For those who were fans of the extra mechanics of the first two Bioshock games might find Infinite disappointing. After having some time to think about it, I actually miss hacking machines to cause discounts and free money. Now its just, posses things and get some free money. It feels, lacking. Speaking of lacking, along with the two weapon system, we also don't have the extra ammo types from the last two. I never used them much, but its nice to have the option. Some of the enemies take too many shots to kill, so you get to run around looking for more ammo mid fight, which isn't a lot of fun in my opinion. Lastly, there's the story and Elizabeth. Elizabeth actually makes combat more interesting. She can throw you what you need in a fight, and also seems to always find some money the second you're done buying what you need. The best part about her though, is the game isn't an escort mission, and Elizabeth can't die! As for the story, its very engaging, as long as you're paying attention to your surroundings and listening to audio logs (which also make a return) to find out more about this crazy world in the sky. Plus, the story gives you reason to replay the game. If you have heard anything about the ending, or have seen it, you know where I'm going with this. The ending is so much plot wrapped into such a small timeframe, it made my mouth drop when the bigger elements were revealed. It made me want to replay the game just to find out what I missed throughout the game. Overall, the game is incredible. Its not the 10/10 its being given, but it definitely deserves a low 9 or high 8. It is by far a contender for game of the year, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good story from the game, as long as they don't mind the combat.","timestamp_created":1365694203,"timestamp_updated":1385420526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3031477","author":{"steamid":"76561198016224516","num_games_owned":447,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1932,"last_played":1396106147},"language":"english","review":"Never I have ever been drown into the atmosphere of the game as in this game.

The great thing about her is that she does not require protection during combat so she won't hold you back.\n\nThe story is interactive, cutscenes do not play much of a part in it at all, I've only experienced 2 moments in which booker's movements are scripted and they are very short and necessary for the story. The story itself is really intriguing centering around Elizabeth who could be compared to a disney princess you save from a tower guarded by a dragon (yes the dragon is Songbird).\n\nThe world of Columbia is an incredible feat of design, simply awe inspiring to look at when rising through the clouds from the classic lighthouse setting on your first visit. The people of the city are just as interesting, with a tense atmosphere between two ways of life about to spark a civil war the game tackles some dark themes.\n\nThe ending itself is....

This is by far one of the best games I've played in many years.  From the storyline to the gameplay, this is a winner.  It keeps you interested all the way through, and once you finally get 1999 Mode, the action becomes something truly incredible.  If you havn't bought this, or say it hasn't lived up to the hype...play it, or play it again.  Its a masterpiece in gaming, and one owes it to themselves to at least try it, to at least experience the beginning.\n\nEdit: I keep thinking over my original review, and I feel I should kinda make it, you know, a proper review, and give the goods with the bads.  I'm a little bit biased, as I LOVE this game, and would go as far as to say it's one of, if not the best video game that has come out since the golden age of gaming.  Yes, that's a bold statement, but I think I can back it up.\n\nFirst of all, I should state what isn't so good: the combat.  I just got the dlc, and honestly, I hadn't played in a little while, so I was rusty.  Slowly but surely, I started to notice that even though it was fun to play and shoot stuff, it didn't have the impact so many other games like it have.  A lot of people don't like gore, but really, it's here to stay.  Many gorier games have combat that's just plain gut-wrenching, where you literally feel the bullets fly out of your fun.  This game doesn't have that as much, and with the storyline it has got, the combat shouldnt only look viseral, it should sound and feel viseral too.  I can say that's my only complaint, and it isn't much of one either, as it's still fun to play, just not as good as could be hoped. \n\nNow, to what I bypassed in the original review: the attention to detail.  The world of Infinite is a living, breathing society.  It has relatable characters, even in it's villains, (cough cough like Andrew Ryan cough) and an incredible vision of this world.  The future songs reverted to the music of years past.  The scenes of the future, and the confusion of these from the protagonist.  The ruddy landscape, like heaven itself, gleaming down upon you! \n\n This game, in terms of what it sometimes doesn't say, and in terms of how the makers of it worked, is damn near perfect.  I've never just not wanted the game to end, and afterwards, not even want a sequel to it, as it couldn't even compare to it's predecessor.  If you haven't played this game, please...would you kindly pay the money, and pay attention to what isn't said in this masterpiece?  Don't just play the game: with mouse or controller in hand, live it.  That's the only way to appreciate it fully.","timestamp_created":1365563547,"timestamp_updated":1406516995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4959548","author":{"steamid":"76561198043769173","num_games_owned":424,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":5997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6092,"last_played":1600026232},"language":"english","review":"Awesome Story, Awesome gameplay, Awesome graphics, Awesome characters!

Every little detail is important, has a meaningful purpose, and serves to flesh the story out in a manner which will make you shit yourself so hard by the time you reach the end that you will need an entirely new ass afterwards. If you plan on playing this game, and by all means you really fucking should, DON'T let anyone spoil anything for you, and certainly don't spoil anything for yourself either.\n\nSettingwise, any idiot could point out to you that it's 180 degrees from the underwater city in the original game--this time you're in the fucking sky in 1912--but it's also a bit like Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow, in that it's kind of like what people actually living in the year 1912 would have written into their idea of a science fiction story based on how people saw the world at the time. Instead of terminators and spahce mahrenes with laser guns and self-aware computer programs, there are clockwork tin soldiers and World War I-era weapons, and giant electric superconductors taken directly out of Nikola Tesla's theoretical designs; and because it's nineteen-fucking-twelve, everyone has a fabulous gentlemannly beard, top hat, and deep-seated racism against Irish people. But it transcends a simple steampunk label; essentially, it's what would happen if Tesla, Jules Verne and Bertrand Russel combined their century-old powers of kickassery and made a video game about a fictionalized version of the time they lived in, complete with floating cities, quantum metaphysics, and theoretical concepts in epistemology which were contemporary with the great thinkers of that era. Come to think of it, that may be what actually happened.\n\nTL;DR you can make your enemies' heads violently explode by electrocuting them, 10000000000000000000000000000000000/10 GOTY, fucking get it.","timestamp_created":1365549588,"timestamp_updated":1365549588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470341891050338745","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5738794","author":{"steamid":"76561198054847555","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":926,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":777,"last_played":1395948437},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely brilliant game, a must get!

NPCs are stuck on an animation loop with a thousand mile stare and provide zero interactivity. \n\nThere is some eye candy in the visuals department no doubt, but the rest feels like you are window shopping. There's barely even any physics in the game - good luck trying to do something so mundane as knock over a box or have some kind of actual feedback when trying to interact with the world. \n\nIn fact, for a game released in 2013, there are a lot of things that make you feel like the game is from early 3D FPS days: no facial animations on almost all of the character models, no actual weapon recoil (burst fire increases spread where applicable, that's it), weaponry that differs only with regard to how fast they fire, ultra-linear gameplay when trying to appear open-world, etc.\n\nThat is about as deep as the \"show\" part of the game goes unfortunately, and the \"tell\" isn't much better.\n\nElizabeth... where oh where to begin on this poorly conceived joke of a 'character'. Let's see, she's supposedly important to the plot, yet completely invisible to, and ignored by the world, friendly or hostile. She doesn't take damage from anything, so she's not any kind of escort. Despite throwing things to you throughout the game she \"finds\" (magically spawns), she's never actually seen picking up anything. In fact, the most you'll ever see her \"do\" is perhaps point at an item, but only when out of combat... and having lingered in an area for a while. And perhaps the worst part is that she is your 'key' to locked doors... you have to wait for her to come over and break locks before you can proceed forward in many areas. It doesn't help matters that she is a walking plot hole device either (as if the story needed any more of those), able to open... well, holes (or tears as the game calls it) to other locales and realities that they try to lead you to believe are parallel... but only when they decide that it makes sense in what they try to pass off as the story.\n\nThe main \"bad guy\" of the story barely even has any time in the actual game. There's a few scripted minutes where Comstock points out what you are up to plotwise, then he disappears for over half the game, shows up again for a few minutes, then disappears till the end of the game where he is killed in a cutscene. \n\nAbout the only good thing I can say about the 'tell' is that the voice work is well done, but that's really about it.\n\nChoices in the game amount to absolutely nothing as well. There is no morality system, but rather an extremely half-assed \"Do not steal or we will try to kill you\" in a couple odd sections which makes no difference one way or the other. Moments where you are stopped and forced to pick something seemingly relevant to the plot are just as pointless due to the fact that not only do they not affect anything afterward, but even if they did, the way the game ends would make it a non-factor anyway.\n\nSo, surely the combat makes up for these many downfalls though right? Not. In. The. Slightest.\n\nThis is another case of a sequel being dumbed down for no discernible reason. There are a LOT of lowest common denominator gameplay mechanics in the combat - regenerating shield (not health thankfully), 2 weapon max carry, standard overly generic weaponry, no special ammo types, and combat that only [u]sometimes[/u] tries to give the illusion of options, but ultimately fails because of not only how arbitrary these choices are, but also because the simplest approach 99 times out of 100 is the most effective one... thanks in no small part to these nonsensical changes. It's as if they were embarrassed of what people liked about the actual Bioshock experience.\n\nOdds are Elizabeth will give you way more than is needed to make any engagement fairly underwhelming as it is anyway. As soon as you drop below a certain % on your health, salts (EVE), or ammo, she'll magically \"find\" some more for you to use, and this happens EVERY battle, no matter if there actually was something there or not (because scavenging would actually mean she has to do something). This coding is so blatant that it is surprising that they didn't just stick a cooldown timer on the HUD somewhere. What's worse, this is the ONLY thing she 'contributes' (term used VERY loosely) to battles, as the rest of the time she is cowering (usually out in the open), despite having god mode and being completely ignored by enemies, or waiting for you to press a button to yell at her to pull something into the battlefield. She literally does nothing on her own which makes the endless praise all the more baffling that people laud upon her for being a good character when you have MUCH better examples from other games, such as Half-life 2's Alyx, Barney, and even the rebel allies, which can put up a good fight and even hold their own in the many situations you are presented with, that came out well over a decade ago! As it stands, Elizabeth has no presence in, or out of combat, she is just 'there' throughout the majority of the game, leaving you to wonder why they even bothered putting such a big focus on her in the design process.\n\nDo you recall the ad where she was about to be hanged by an angry mob and your character swoops in to save her? Yeah that doesn't actually happen in-game... ever... in any shape or form.  It really should've, at least the damsel-in-distress bit it would invoke would justify her existence somewhat.\n\nOne of the very few similarities to Bioshock there actually are come in the form of plasmids... err... sorry I mean \"Vigors\". Unlike Bioshock though, these are much less varied than the preceding games, much less used by enemies (there's maybe half a dozen that actually use what you use out of the thousand or so enemies you'll fight), and they can be severely game breaking in a great many of the fights. \n\nDifficulty is another major issue for those of you who like a challenge. One of the biggest factors for me at least, this game just doesn't feel particularly difficult, like at all. There are a couple exchanges which can get heated here and there, but ultimately it is because you are dealing with an army of enemies rather than having a character that feels mortal, which is only further underlined when you \"die\", since you respawn back into the fight moments later. And no, this cannot be disabled unlike in Bioshock 1 & 2.\n\nBut otherwise, there you have it, what little that remains of Bioshock returns here in a heavily watered down form, with the rest of the gameplay being pulled from lowest common denominator shooters like Call of Duty and the like to make this mash-up of a game that I really regret purchasing. The game tries to be so much at once, much of which it never was in the first place, and fails in every regard.\n\nI don't know what the hell other reviewers were playing, but if you have had the fortune to avoid this clunker, continue to do so.","timestamp_created":1365485576,"timestamp_updated":1631597736,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517006993293762207","comment_count":53,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1940243","author":{"steamid":"76561198000017459","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1364972400},"language":"english","review":"Best game I've played in at least five years.
