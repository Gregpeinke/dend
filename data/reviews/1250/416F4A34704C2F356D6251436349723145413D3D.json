This is the game I recommend to all my friends to have, simply because its often something we can all play. It's not computer intensive and is incredibly fun. I can't say I personally play it often, but it is my go to we can all play this coop game.\n\nThe game is set in Great Britain during a zombie apocalypse. You play in a team fighting off waves of zombies. There is many different types of zombies, all with certain abilities. Players also have classes that give discounts and certain perks. Players can also choose custom skins to use. There are also a variety of weapons ranging from melee weapons to guns to explosives.\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly fun. There is no reticle so shooting is done with iron sites or pure judgement of where the shot will go. You won't need a reticle though, the gameplay works without it. There is also slow motion that occurs every once in awhile when a zombie is killed. It's always amusing. The game also offers varying difficulties and challanges for people of all skill levels.\n\nThis is a coop game, so survival becomes much easier with more people. Stay with the group so you don't get cornered! Strength in numbers! If you do find yourself seperated, try to kite the zombies around. Always be moving, as the zombies will always be homing in on you!\n\nBottom line. This is a fun game, especially with friends. It's also not system intensive so many people can play it without a top end gaming pc. If nothing else It's always good to have one game like that so everyone can play. It's also relativly cheap, and if you can get it on sale it practically costs nothing for its worth.\n\nRandom Tip: You run faster with a knife out.","timestamp_created":1324371401,"timestamp_updated":1395337890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2903721","author":{"steamid":"76561198014353473","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":26176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19725,"last_played":1659065573},"language":"english","review":"Fuck you, Gorefasts.","timestamp_created":1324364449,"timestamp_updated":1324364449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2537142","author":{"steamid":"76561198008958663","num_games_owned":566,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5890,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5619,"last_played":1374515697},"language":"english","review":"This game is absolutely epic.

Жизнь пойдёт своим чередом. И нет смысла даже оставлять какие-то записи, потому что их никогда никто не прочтёт. [/quote]\n\nДоброго времени суток! Присаживайтесь, сегодня у нас каша из топора, огнемета, бензопилы, штурмовых винтовок и остальных даров человечества, что были придуманы для истребления самого человечества. Ложка от каши тяжела, да и за каждую новую следует отслюнявить пару монет, но даже босяку с дырявыми карманами дадут облизать края тарелки от Killing Floor!\n\nПеред вами ураганный шутер от первого лица для кооперативного прохождения локаций. Играть можно и в гордом одиночестве, но при этом обстоятельстве Killing Floor не расцветет, а скорее утомит вас рваным уровнем сложности, так что перед покупкой обзаведитесь друзьями, друзья, с друзьями не так и сложно дружить, просто назовите кого-нибудь другом и скорчите милую мину, а вдруг прокатит?! Друг другу - друг, а без друга друг...ну вы поняли.\n\nВ Killing Floor на наших бравых героев будут нападать волны всевозможной мерзости, согревая руки бесконечным топотом пальцев по мышке. Враги отличаются между собой живучестью, размерами, поведением и силой атаки, да и в целом разработчики отпустили веревочку с воображением, накинув на игроков целую простынь ужасных созданий. Паукообразные мутанты, гнилые мужики с лезвиями вместо рук, жировые бочки, да кого тут только нет, друзья, а вишенкой на торте сотрясают раскаленный воздух впечатляющие боссы. Главных злыдней не так и много, но каждый из них стоит целой армии!\n\nЗа каждое убийство в ваш кошелек капает звонкая монетка, а в перерывах между волнами на накопленные богатства можно обновить личный арсенал, докупить боезапас и обдумать стратегию следующей резни. Баланс игры создан таким образом, что валюты хватает либо притык, либо магазин соблазняет вас наилучшими предложениями, но в вашем кармане не лежит лишний доллар. Благо на выручку могут прибежать товарищи, скинув на побагровевшую землю пару пачек с заветным балансом. С друзьями этот трюк проходит на раз-два, но вы попробуйте выпросить денег у незнакомого человека, что ради богатств рисковал своей жизнью, вооот, а тут уже и социальные холмы за полем всплыли. Если будешь играть хуже некуда, либо подставлять других выживших, либо не будешь участвовать в командных тактиках, то до конца игры пробегаешь с какими-нибудь рогатками, а в сложные минуты никто не прилетит на крыльях помощи.\nKilling Floor - игра про взаимовыручку, тактику и меткую стрельбу, а уже после всего этого можно хлопать в ладоши от бесконечного мяса и взрывов.\n\nАрсенал в Killing Floor удивил бы даже Джона Рэмбо! Если вы можете представить себе какое-нибудь оружие, то скорее всего разработчики тоже о нем подумали, а после этого добавили в игру. И если чего-нибудь экзотического в оригинальной игре нет, то на выручку приходят десятки платных дополнений, содержащие и оружие, и новых персонажей. Если вам и этого мало, то милости просим в Мастерскую, а там хоть из грудей Терминатора стреляйте.\n\n[list]\n[*]Одна из лучших игр для кооператива.\n[*]Богатый арсенал и поддержка со стороны мастерской.\n[*]На скидках игру отдают за гроши.\n[/list]\n\nИгра вышла в далеком 2009 году, но даже сейчас качество картинки не кусает за глаз. Карты довольно слабо освещены, понеже игра делает ставку на жуткую атмосферу, а тьма по традиции скрывает самые плачевные проблемы с графикой.\nЧто же по поводу звука и музыки, то тут все в полном порядке. Каждая тварь издает свой собственный набор бульканья и хрипов, так что вы заранее понимаете какое месиво вас ожидает за следующим поворотом. Визуальные эффекты тоже на приличном\n \nуровне! Выстрелы, взрывы, ошметки тел, эффект замедления времени, испарения, капли! Для своего времени все это выглядело достойно, а если вы желаете уничтожать орды врагов под более приятным соусом для глаз, то смело ищите в магазине сиквел обозреваемой заварушки.\n\nKilling Floor обновляют под особые даты, изменяя внешний облик врагов, добавляют тематические предметы и видоизменяют основные механики. Игре больше 10 лет, но она все еще живет и процветает, что нельзя сказать про ее одногодок.\nВ итоге перед вами действительно достойная игра для кооперативного выживания\\прохождения, которая подарит невероятный опыт каждому игроку.\nЕсли вы любите Left 4 Dead, Serious Sam, PainKiller, то обязательно попробуйте поиграть в Killing Floor. Приятной игры!\n\nХочу поблагодарить всех за отдачу и лайки, берегите нервы и избегайте шлака в магазине.\nЕсли понравился обзор, то приглашаю в свою новую группу:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/39102887-Sad-Jelien/","timestamp_created":1323811069,"timestamp_updated":1612693014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":84,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.866777598857879639","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5584011","author":{"steamid":"76561198052344317","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1428809941},"language":"spanish","review":"Zombies? supervivencia? te gusta left 4 dead? esto tienes que tenerlo","timestamp_created":1323806123,"timestamp_updated":1323806123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4750535","author":{"steamid":"76561198041437449","num_games_owned":356,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":1635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1376,"last_played":1438899730},"language":"portuguese","review":"game muito bom...achei ele mais legal que o Left 4 Dead!","timestamp_created":1323801060,"timestamp_updated":1323801060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1246349","author":{"steamid":"76561197990012301","num_games_owned":324,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":7485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6741,"last_played":1527510283},"language":"english","review":"恩。不错!","timestamp_created":1323788825,"timestamp_updated":1323788825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"133524","author":{"steamid":"76561197962901098","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2656,"last_played":1374688913},"language":"italian","review":"Gioco co-op estremamente divertente!

Other than that, it is an incredible game and anyone who loves killing zombies or zombie-like creatures, this is a game for you.","timestamp_created":1323736819,"timestamp_updated":1323736819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"760292","author":{"steamid":"76561197977612408","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":10462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9263,"last_played":1612954138},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor rocks.","timestamp_created":1323733509,"timestamp_updated":1323733509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"266123","author":{"steamid":"76561197967094768","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5055,"last_played":1406474290},"language":"english","review":"Great game, best played with friends.","timestamp_created":1323731432,"timestamp_updated":1323731432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3599939","author":{"steamid":"76561198025142030","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":5707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4354,"last_played":1432408274},"language":"english","review":"Imagine if Nazi Zombies, Left4Dead, and Dead Rising somehow had a lovechild...\n\nKilling Floor is that child.\n\nIt's absolutely brilliant, with 6-Player Co-Op, customisable options and maps, and a heavy emphasis on teamwork, brilliant and fluid gameplay and stellar graphics to match.\n\nVery well-made, and a ton of fun!\n\nBuy four-copies and send them to your friends!","timestamp_created":1323730060,"timestamp_updated":1323730060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5699887","author":{"steamid":"76561198054323089","num_games_owned":239,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":4554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2120,"last_played":1623119929},"language":"brazilian","review":"É um jogo bacana, com zumbis bacanas, armas bacanas, chefões bacanas, e fases bacanas....Resumindo: bacana","timestamp_created":1323729026,"timestamp_updated":1323729026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2497776","author":{"steamid":"76561198008300813","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":3850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3850,"last_played":1355990400},"language":"english","review":"Left for dead has been... left for dead..","timestamp_created":1323727687,"timestamp_updated":1323727687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5227908","author":{"steamid":"76561198046675358","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":23983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13848,"last_played":1456320252},"language":"english","review":"Cool game for all ages :D","timestamp_created":1323726495,"timestamp_updated":1323726495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2849112","author":{"steamid":"76561198013542854","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9844,"last_played":1492305488},"language":"french","review":"Pas cher, souvent en rabais, avec de l'action et une communauté bien rempli !\n\nSuper jeu de coopération où l'esprit d'équipe et la tactique est de mise dans les niveaux suicidaire et enfer sur terre ! faites-vous une équipe de tireur d'élite, vous allez voir que c'est pas comme ca que ca fonctionne ;)\n\nviolent à souhait... plein d'explosion... de feu... de grosse hache... \n\nque demander de mieu ! des femmes ??
