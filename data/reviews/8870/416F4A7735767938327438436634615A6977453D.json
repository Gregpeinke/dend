But I was so wrong, Bioshock Infinite proves to be one of the most exciting, thought provoking and intense game I have ever played and its one of my favourite games of all time.\n\nAs far as the plot goes, you play as Booker DeWitt, a private investigator who is hired by an unknown group of persons, to bring a girl to them so that he can settle an old gambling debt. Apparently this girl lives in the floating city of Columbia, which is ruled by an authoritative nativist, Zachary Hale Comstock. What follows is the story of memory and consciousness, timelines and paradoxes, constants and variables and one hell of an ending which will blow you away. Its video game story telling at its finest and I really appreciate the writing involved in making this a grand experience.\n\nThe city of Columbia is a marvel to behold. Just like Rapture in the first game, its filled with exquisite details which reflect the culture and environments of its time. Not to mention the game looks stunning and beautiful and I spent most of my time just marvelling at how detailed the world looked. Some of the sections which take place indoors are also great to look at and they are based on real life historical events which always made me feel as if I had been transported back in time.\n\nJust like in the first game you fight the Vox Populi (won't spoil the story on what they are), the security forces of Columbia and some heavy armored opponents like the Handymen and Motorized Patriots. Unlike the first game, now you can only carry 2 weapons with you which makes you choose the best weapon suited for a particular situation. Also, money is scarce in the game and you will have to decide between investing them in weapons or Vigors (game's version of Plasmids). Vigors are powered by Salts (game's version of EVE) and they are a handful to choose from. I liked the combat in this game due to the fact that there is a split decision involved between weapons and Vigors by the use of money, unlike in the first game where money was invested on weapons and ADAM on Plasmids. Your sidekick, Elizabeth is great and you slowly form a bond with her. Not to mention, she helps you a lot in combat during stressful situations.\n\nAt the crux of this game lies the story and how well its told you. The Bioshock games have always been famous for their stories and the concepts they throw at you and this one does not dissapoint. The story is both beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. I would also recommend you to buy the game's DLC \"Burial At Sea- Episode 1 and 2\" which is set in Rapture, which was so cool and nostalgic, as it so beautifully and intelligently ties up the game's story with the events leading up to the first Bioshock. Its the perfect icing on an already delicious cake. I usually am not a fan of game DLC's or extra stuff and mostly commit myself to the main game but after playing it, I thought it was really outstanding and paid a great tribute to fans of the original game and also tied up all loose ends.\n\nPerformance was smooth for me and the game is greatly optimized to run on old as well as modern hardware. I had no hiccups whatsover and ran on a solid 60 FPS.\n\nI believe Bioshock Infinite, will stand the test of time as one of the greatest video games ever made with an amazing story, rich atmosphere and memorable characters which will linger with you long after the game is done with you.\n\nI give it 9 Devil's Kiss out of 10.\n\nBuy it !!!!  (With the Burial At Sea-Episode 1 and 2 Dlc)\n\n","timestamp_created":1510595691,"timestamp_updated":1510595691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629343092441558838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36495819","author":{"steamid":"76561198215457620","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":974,"last_played":1510699986},"language":"english","review":"All in all it was semi-fun, very short, and lacking in enough gun options to make this game boring as hell.
