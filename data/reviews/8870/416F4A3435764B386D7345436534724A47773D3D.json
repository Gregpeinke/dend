O que começa como um \"conto\" de um cara que vai salvar uma \"princesa\" num castelo, acaba se desenrolando em uma história envolvendo viagens dimensionais e conflitos políticos. Assistir de perto o desenvolvimento da Elizabeth é incrível e culmina com o final desse jogo, que é conhecido por ser um MIND BLOWING total. \n\nRecomendo para quem gosta de uma boa

Afinal, é o tipo de produto que ganha fácil, em todos os sentidos, a qualidade de cult. Trilha sonora, gráficos, jogabilidade e enredo, todos os elementos principais de um game concorrem para fazer de Infinite uma experiência inesquecível. A trilha sonora, aliás, vai do folk americano do início do século passado a alguns pilares da música erudita, como Bach, Pachelbel, Chopin e Mozart. O roteiro, como de costume na série, possui seu tom acentuadamente político, com o adicional agora de ter uma crítica social contundente e muito mais sensível: o breve passeio que se faz pela favela de Columbia pode fazer despertar reflexões revolucionários no mais reacionário dos seres humanos. Se comparado ao primeiro jogo, percebe-se claramente o quanto Infinite é mais dinâmico nas batalhas – e talvez para dar maior agilidade ao combate a aquisição e uso de poderes está agora também muito mais ágil e simples. A arte do game é também impecável. Se Rapture era uma cidade fascinante por simbolizar as ruinas sombrias de uma sociedade morta, Columbia sustenta sua beleza na imagem colorida de uma sociedade ainda viva, todavia, agonizante. Em Rapture tínhamos uma distopia social cientificista; em Columbia temos uma distopia também alicerçada na ideia de progresso científico, mas uma ciência mercê da religião: a cidade de Ryan era governada tecnocraticamente, a de Cumstock o é teocraticamente. Para além do excelente roteiro (que em substância é uma hábil brincadeira com teses quânticas de universos paralelos), o melhor de Infinite, o que mais me cativou, marcando profundamente minha experiência de jogo, foi a presença de Elizabeth. A companheira de Booker DeWitt é um desses raros personagens que faz a gente lamentar profundamente por no mundo real haver pouquíssimas pessoas igual: inteligente, sensível, meiga, sagaz e com senso de humor. Apaixonar-se por Infinite é em grande medida apaixonar pela criança que é Elizabeth. E se era intenção dos produtores revolver as emoções do jogador, pode ter certeza que foram bem sucedidos: pela primeira vez na vida um game me fez marejar água nos olhos. E foi justamente ao saber como Elizabeth tinha perdido o mindinho da mão direita. Mindinho este que, por vergonha, inocentemente escondia com um dedal. Por que um dedal? Segundo ela, ironizando, a última moda em Paris. Se, pelo menos por um mero instante, fosse concebível que minha mente pudesse ter todo o poder quântico da mente de Elizabeth, gostaria de poder atravessar a porta de um dos infinitos faróis e me encontrar com ela em algum outro mundo possível. Quem sabe em Paris!","timestamp_created":1380158639,"timestamp_updated":1380158639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6135585","author":{"steamid":"76561198059754353","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":671,"last_played":1446325148},"language":"english","review":"The.
