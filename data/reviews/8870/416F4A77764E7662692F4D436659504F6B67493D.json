Great ideas all coming together, the powers, the world, the villian, the story. This Bioshock however improved in areas, The world looked amazing, bright is what they were going after and they got it. The powers/gameplay improved different actions and more guns, easy to use and good diversity. I really enjoyed the addition of the companion but in hard mode she is still helping you out giving you salts, money and aid (a double edged sword there, so no complaints). The story and villain however, did not improve, the first game, had a bit of a psychology thrill with philosophical questions. This game didn't, The motivations, of the villain doesn't make sense and after finishing the game, finding out the answers to the most important questions of the game, still doesn't make sense, what debt and others still are unanswered (now i am fine with not answering every question, but if you give backstory and start to answer questions which aren't necessary and i believe i have have the right to know the answers so some other minor but still major plot questions)? I loved playing this game, great mechanics but the story lacklustre. The best games, have stories which even though all the decisions you as the player make are already written you can't change that, make you feel like you are making those decisions. Making you an active participant in the game. This game however punishes that. If you came for good gameplay, i would recommend, if you came for a rich story and good(satisfying) ending i would say play a different game.","timestamp_created":1593906646,"timestamp_updated":1593906646,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72053411","author":{"steamid":"76561198158038823","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":961,"last_played":1585286696},"language":"english","review":"This game is amazing. A true storytelling masterpiece mixed in with solid and truly fun gameplay. I put off playing this game for years after my cousin and uncle recommended it to me, and now I realize that that was years wasted without experiencing this beauty. I think this game legitimately made my life better.\n\nFrom a writing perspective, this game hits all the marks. Well developed characters, an organic plot, and an interesting setting. You feel like you're a part of the story instead of just being told it. From a gameplay perspective, similar results as the game excels there as well. The controls are a bit wonky, but a couple remaps and you feel completely in control with a variety of ways to approach each situation. The game also appeals to countless playstyles. And my experience, well, I still think about it even months after it happened.\n\nNever played a Bioshock game. I finally take the plunge. I experience Columbia. I tear through the story. I roll credits after 3 days of plowing through this game, only taking breaks for basic life interactions and to walk out into the living room where the unfortunate people I live with gape in confusion as I pace around with my hands on my head in a total trance, not fully having left the world that I submerged myself in. No, I was not prepared for the onslaught of things that a video game would do to me or make me feel.

Maybe it's the switch from console to pc or maybe it's just the fact that I've played newer more fluid game since but that was a little disapointing. It's also not worth playing the game on hard since it turns most specials into bullet sponges and they will just deplete your ammo and salt.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nThis game, like the rest of the Bioshock Franchise, is a masterpiece in storytelling. The buildup is pretty slow but it gets wild toward the end in expected and unexpected ways. If, like me, you managed to go this long without getting the end spoiled, go in blind and enjoy the ride.
