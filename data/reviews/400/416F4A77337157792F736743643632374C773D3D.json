But I’m glad I waited, I would not have been able to see the brilliant art  the game presents in a unique fashion. Portal uses a concept that's a bit hard to wrap your head around without actually seeing it in action. The only \"weapon\" you're given is a portal gun that can shoot a portal entrance with the right mouse button and a portal exit with the left mouse button. Once both portals have been placed, you can walk through the entrance and find yourself at the exit.

La difficoltà di risoluzione dei quesiti posti al giocatore va gradualmente aumentando man mano che si avanza nel gioco, fornendo un livello di sfida bilanciato e soddisfacente.\nLa trama, seppur piuttosto lineare, è resa interessante e coinvolgente da vari fattori. L'uso di uno humour caratteristico, fondato molto sull'interazione tra IA e giocatore, è sicuramente uno dei punti cardine che accompagnano la narrazione, ma anche il leggero alone di mistero e l'assurdità dell'universo distopico presentato al giocatore, contribuiscono a fargli ricercare la completezza della campagna in single player per assaporare la conclusione delle vicende della protagonista. La presenza di un buon numero di sfide aggiuntive sopperisce in parte alla scarsa longevità generale, forse l'unico difetto rilevante di questo prodotto targato Valve.\nIn conclusione, Portal è sicuramente un puzzle-game che merita una prova, quantomeno per l'originalità proposta.\n\nVoto: 8.5","timestamp_created":1413121350,"timestamp_updated":1486055317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530201315879821777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12457901","author":{"steamid":"76561198088836313","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":395,"last_played":1499203331},"language":"english","review":"It's pretty fun, with the portal shooting and all.\nIt's a bit short though.","timestamp_created":1413082092,"timestamp_updated":1413082092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12455654","author":{"steamid":"76561198076334358","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":400,"last_played":1419750446},"language":"english","review":"A puzzle game with an engaging story.
