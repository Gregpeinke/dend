На момент выхода поражала графоном и анимацией оружия да что там говорить я до сих пор не видел такой анимации оружия не в одном шутане это можно увидеть в slow motion который присутствует в игре когда вы наносите критический урон по голове мутантов. Множество карт (фанаты до сих пор делают), неплохой такой арсенал (в начале было маловато на мой взгляда, сейчас окей) , классовая система: Снайпер, Командос, Огнеметчик, Инженер, Спец по взрывчатке, Берсеркер, Медик. Все классы можно прокачивать тем самым повышая эффективность своего оружия и скидку на его покупку (максимальный уровень 6). Множество ДЛС (то что я не очень одобряю) которые на данный момент стоят копейки если хотите еще больше стволов и персонажей то берите. Игра хорошая особенно играя с друзьями на самых сложных уровнях сложности чувствуется тим плей. Вообщем 9 из 10.

As I'm writing this I've put 129 hours into Killing Floor because it's just brilliant - the replayability is just endless: there's around 20 core maps to choose from, on which you can play as 7 different perks (that each take a long time to get the max level), all the while there's a good 40/50 weapons to use. Better yet, every Summer, Halloween and Christmas they release an update reskinning the zeds, adding new maps and achievements (on top of the 200+ there already is). If you see it at 75%, which it always is during those 3 holidays, then I'd definitely suggest buying it.","timestamp_created":1384356750,"timestamp_updated":1384356750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7645287","author":{"steamid":"76561198071380042","num_games_owned":582,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":13615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13549,"last_played":1607825194},"language":"english","review":"First ever game I played on steam and this is a classic.

At first it seems like just another Zombie Shooter, but it's so much more, believe me. Cute little touches like a Slow-Motion effect when someone achieves a killing streak to help you chain makes you feel like such a badass, the levels are tight enough to make you feel constricted and claustrophobic, yet open enough that you are never truly penned in and you have total freedom of movement, creating a deliciously open experience. Gunplay is crisp and responsive, and each weapon handles differently, such that if you were to replace all the weapon models with boxes, I could tell you which one is which just by firing it, and watching how my character handles it, from the Beretta's crisp, manageable kick, to the themonuclear blast that is the Handcannon's recoil.\n\nIf you enjoy Counter Strike, Left 4 Dead, Quake, Doom, Team Fortress 2, hell, if you enjoy any shooter, you will love this. It is well worth the money.","timestamp_created":1383961660,"timestamp_updated":1383961660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7605299","author":{"steamid":"76561197969950224","num_games_owned":844,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":4243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2976,"last_played":1449631037},"language":"english","review":"Great multiplayer co-op fun.","timestamp_created":1383955473,"timestamp_updated":1383955473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7604873","author":{"steamid":"76561198107785878","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":5964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2,"last_played":1529026673},"language":"english","review":"Massa D+","timestamp_created":1383951767,"timestamp_updated":1383951767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7599208","author":{"steamid":"76561198052446729","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":470,"last_played":1434319846},"language":"english","review":"Отлично убивает время","timestamp_created":1383901801,"timestamp_updated":1383901801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7598991","author":{"steamid":"76561198092121287","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":20694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20694,"last_played":1597820411},"language":"english","review":"I think I got this in 2013, back when people still played it.

Хотя с виду это обычный тупой шутан, в котором нужно тупо отсреливать зомби. Но нет, не тупой. Играть в это очень даже весело. В игре есть несколько классов со своими особенностями: Комнандос - злой дядька с автоматом, который еще и видит сатлкеров(невижимые монстры местного разлива), подрывник, о котором говорить ничего не надо, снайпер, медик, который может играть в роли \"Танка\", техник, который может заваривать двери, поджигатель, который поливает всех огнем налево и направо и берсеркер - ходячий танк с оружием ближнего боя. У каждого класса, в добавок, куча фишек, таких как лечебные гранаты медика и т.д. Разнообразны и монстры. Аж целых 10 видов. Когда-то мне говорили, что эта игра лучше Left 4 Dead'а, но нет, это не так. Left 4 Dead показывает себя, как игра сюжетом, но его там почти нет, Killing Floor же показывает себя, как игра без сюжета, но: \"Да, я игра без сюжета, но зато в меня весело играть\". К этому добавлю обилие пушек в KF и L4D. В KF их хоть лопатами греби, что нельзя сказать о L4D. Добавим сюда обилие монстров в этих играх: 10 видов против 8. К тому же, в L4D, \"особые\" зараженные появляются с некоторыми промежутками, когда в KF на тебя прут все виды, не сразу, конечно же. В общем, Killing Floor - довольно годный кооперативный зомби шутер, хоть в нем полно DLC, с оружием и скинами, так что, если хотите быть на коне - готовьте ваш кошелек.

Lots of weapons, alot of action and many zombies to kill. It has multiple classes that change the way you play the game. You can play solo but playing with friends is much more fun, because it's more of a.. how should I say it.. clusterfuck? It is very intense so you will always have fun. Oh and it is cheap.\nSo basically, fun and cheap game you can always open up and gather friends for it when you're bored from the other games you have.","timestamp_created":1383652815,"timestamp_updated":1383652815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537572264671325684","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7573984","author":{"steamid":"76561198086475127","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":26313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17920,"last_played":1430730455},"language":"thai","review":"Good game for me","timestamp_created":1383647112,"timestamp_updated":1383647112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7572958","author":{"steamid":"76561198039683133","num_games_owned":1175,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":480,"last_played":1447554930},"language":"english","review":"A great multiplayer horror fps, this game has crazy amounts of actions.
