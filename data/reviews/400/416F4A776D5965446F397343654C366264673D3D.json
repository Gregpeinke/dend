While it's relatively short, and definitely is lacking in content, the adventure of Chell is well worth your time and money.\n\nThe story (no major spoilers):\nYou wake up in an empty box with a radio playing, and nothing much else. You here a robotic voice that guides you out, and then you begin your adventure.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is by far, the most unique gameplay I've seen in a long time. It's similar to Half-Life 2, but with portals. You have to play it to believe it.\n\nVerdict:\nConsidering Portal turns 10 years old this year, I can surely say it is one of the best games of the last decade, and set the new standard of single player games. While it is short and isn't the most inavative game out there, it holds a special spot in my, and plenty other gamers, heart.\n\nPortal gets a solid 8/10.\n-KerryDeVille","timestamp_created":1492388968,"timestamp_updated":1492388968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31189242","author":{"steamid":"76561198277127918","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":160,"last_played":1483300358},"language":"english","review":"Finished in 2 hours lol","timestamp_created":1492386791,"timestamp_updated":1492386791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31188771","author":{"steamid":"76561198255926039","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":339,"last_played":1594589279},"language":"english","review":"possibly the best game ive played to date (alongside portal 2). really enjoyed the story and puzzles.\nits a great game with unique puzzles and physics with a concept that was one of a kind.\n\nhighly recommend the portal series to anyone.\n\n[spoiler] the cake is a lie\t[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1492384768,"timestamp_updated":1492384768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31186316","author":{"steamid":"76561198203561016","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":145,"last_played":1458922079},"language":"english","review":"This game is great because it is so unique.

It combines the brilliance of the portal gun and the source engine to provide satisfying puzzles to solve. \n\n-[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nThe story of portal is fairly simple with a lot of undertones and lore for the player to interpret. You start off in a test chamber and filled with the duty to run the experiment. As it turns out, [spoiler] the cake is a lie [/spoiler] While the base story is very simple it serves the purpose to motivate the player enough to get to the end. However if you look into the lore it provides a much deeper context to the game. Small tidbit, the portal universe actually takes place in the same universe as half life and there's a rivalry going on between aperture labs and black mesa. Another point towards the story is the subtle story telling through the game art and walls. Kinda like Metroid and Legend of Zelda : Breath of the wild. \n\n-[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nThe gameplay is where this game really shines through like a hidden gem. It makes use of the brilliantly made portal gun to solve puzzles on the next level. You can use it for various situations like using momentum to launch yourself higher or transport other objects like a companion cube. You really have to play it to know it but overall the gameplay serves its purpose well for this type of game.\n\n-[h1] Presentation [/h1]\nI'm not much of a graphics guys so i'll keep this segment short. The graphics in this game are well done. And by 2007 standards this game makes great use of the source engine. It's not Crysis but it does look good and runs really well.\n\n-[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nWhile I feel this game is slightly over-hyped it really does a great job immersing you into the world of portal and has really great level design akin to a Nintendo game.

Es gibt genau ein blaues und ein orangenes Portal, das mit einer Handfeuerwaffe an irgendeine geeignete weisse Wand geklatscht werden kann. Dieses Portal-Paar ist wie ein Fenster ode eine Tür, so dass man insbesondere ansonsten unerreichbare Gegenden erreichen kann.\n\nAls ich Portal das erste Mal spielte, hatte ich keine Ahnung von dem Spielprinzip und war entsprechend verwirrt, was eigentlich Sache ist. Hat man es aber mal verstanden, ergeben sich oft überaus verblüffende Möglichkeiten, scheinbar unüberwindliche Hürden und Aufgaben zu meistern.\n\nTeilweise ist Portal ein klassisches levelbasiertes Logikrätsel. Man betritt einen Raum und man muss irgendwie zu dem meist sichtbaren Ausgang gelangen. Nach jedem Raum lädt Portal den nächsten Raum/Level und speichert auch gleich den Fortschritt ab.\n\nAbgespeichert wird aber auch beim Erreichen bestimmter unsichtbarer Checkpoints. Das ist unglaublich gut gemacht. \"Stirbt\" man mal, wird man nicht allzuweit zurückgeworfen. Man könnte aber auch individuell speichern (was aber eben kaum nötig ist).\n\nDas \"Sterben\" zu vermeiden ist auch nicht wirklich die Schwierigkeit beim Spiel, sondern die zielführenden Aktionen zum Durchqueren des Raumes zu finden.\n\nDa gibt es Knöpfe zu drücken, Kuben zu bewegen, Wächter zu beseitigen, Hindernisparcours zu durchqueren, etc.\n\nInsgesamt fand ich die Rätsel nicht allzuschwer. Ich kam ohne fremde Hilfe meist zügig durch.\n\nPortal ist aber kein reines Logikrätsel! Unvergesslich und gut ist die dabei erzählte Geschichte. Offenbar ist Chell ein Versuchskaninchen in einem menschenverachtenden Versuchslabor. Eine scheinheilig nette Stimme des Computers GLaDOS belabert uns fast permanent. Dabei verrät sie uns wohl mehr als sie wollen könnte, wahrscheinlich, weil sie uns (Menschen, speziel Chill) unterschätzt.\n\nHat man das eigentliche Spiel durch, gibt es auch noch Bonuslevel, die deutlich schwierigere Rätsel bieten.\n\nPro & Contra:\n+ Gute aber lösbare Rätsel\n+ Gute Grafik und Steuerung\n+ Amüsante Geschichte\n+ Vernünftige Kontrollpunkte zum Wiedereinstieg\n\n- (fällt mir nichts ein)\n\nWertung: 10/10\n\nDas Spiel ist, insbesondere im Doppelpack mit Portal 2, ein Highlight des Rätselspiels.","timestamp_created":1491886443,"timestamp_updated":1492586448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.426068335771560669","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31071938","author":{"steamid":"76561198151591539","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":1321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":413,"playtime_at_review":553,"last_played":1660421363},"language":"english","review":"Top tier puzzle game","timestamp_created":1491882874,"timestamp_updated":1531953217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31070501","author":{"steamid":"76561198356736304","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":169,"last_played":1656286520},"language":"english","review":"This game is awesome with its puzzles and story.","timestamp_created":1491874279,"timestamp_updated":1491874279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31070296","author":{"steamid":"76561198091140653","num_games_owned":892,"num_reviews":94,"playtime_forever":255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":186,"last_played":1586466743},"language":"english","review":"Very fun!
