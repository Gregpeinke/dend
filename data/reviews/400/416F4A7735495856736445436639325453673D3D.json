My first experience in the \"Portal\" universe was playing co-op in \"Portal 2\", which I finished, and enjoyed, albeit more for the satisfaction of finishing such a complicated game than for the story.\n\nI did enjoy the game, although it is quite difficult. The story left me with a lot of questions. GLADoS' voice acting was beautiful, the game looks quite polished, and I like it a lot more than what I've experienced thus far in \"Portal 2\"'s solo campaign, although I do enjoy that game, too.\n\nI also had the luck to completely miss hearing (within my recollection) any version of \"Still Alive\" before finishing the game, so when the credits rolled, I was quite pleasantly surprised to hear it for the first time. I adore the song, so that was a treat. Probably the first time I've sat through the entire credits of a video game. Considering how much fanart and memes of the cake references, \"It's a lie!\", GLADoS, Chell, the companion cube, and stuff from \"Portal 2\" I've come across, that's surprising.\n\nAll in all a nice puzzle game. If you haven't played either of these, wait for the sales. They go on sale pretty much every time there is a sale, and they're often sold together pretty inexpensively.","timestamp_created":1449198508,"timestamp_updated":1449198508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520833313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19469724","author":{"steamid":"76561198187831799","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1454290212},"language":"spanish","review":"Definitivamente una obra de arte en los videojuegos, recuerdo que estaba esceptico con este juego, pero lo empeze y me empezo a parecer cada vez mas profunda la trama, definitivamente un must play.\n20/10","timestamp_created":1449195992,"timestamp_updated":1449195992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19469390","author":{"steamid":"76561198059242856","num_games_owned":735,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4510,"last_played":1605509117},"language":"english","review":"Truth in advertising:  I'm a geezer (pushing 70) so I'm not much of a keyboard jockey.  I played WoW for most of 6 years, mostly with my son who dragged me into it, and I really enjoyed it, and sucked a lot less after 6 years than I did at the start.  But about 2 years ago I hung up my sword as far as WoW is concerned.  I started playing Portal about 3 years ago, and can't say enough good things about it.  For me, it's pretty much the perfect game.  The pace is perfect from my point of view, because the pace is whatever I choose at any given time.  The puzzles start out nice and easy, and work their way up through the difficulty levels in a way that's just about right.  Some made me feel like I was all that, others made me feel totally unworthy.\n\nI really enjoyed the physics, and the plotting, and the ability to just stare at the situation and mentally process it and get to the point where you say to yourself \"Self, I think that is gonna work!\"  Sometimes it does, sometimes it's close, sometimes not so much.  You don't really die, so if you have a serious fail, you just get to take another shot at it without going back 7 levels to a previous checkpoint or something as irritating as that.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Portal is its sense of humor....easily one of the funniest games I've ever played.  I'm not going to get into characters and the whole \"what is a portal\" thing and all that.  Those things are pretty well illustrated and explained in the trailers and game info.  All is can say in closing is that I seriously doubt if you'll want your money or your time back!  It's one of the few games I've played multiple times, just because I enjoy it so much.
