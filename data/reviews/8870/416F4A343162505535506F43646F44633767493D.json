possui uma das melhores e mais complexas histórias dos games, o jogo além de uma boa narrativa possui uma gameplay muito boa já que você pode usar tudo que o cenário lhe proporcina e além disso você possui a ajuda da Elizabeth com seus poderes de abrir fendas, e você tem também a opção de usar as habilidades especiais que servem para diversas coisas durante o modo história mas que também são muito uteis durante o combate. Bioshock Infinite faz parte de uma trilogia excelente e recomendo que você jogue todos os jogos, pois, o infinte finaliza a história da trilogia de forma triunfal explicando como funciona o universo do jogo e seus acontecimentos, o jogo é mais do que recomendado para sua biblioteca Steam.","timestamp_created":1627049691,"timestamp_updated":1627049809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96238807","author":{"steamid":"76561198140526218","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":447,"last_played":1608475412},"language":"schinese","review":"超棒的剧情，超美的画面，NICE!!!","timestamp_created":1627048870,"timestamp_updated":1627048870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96236911","author":{"steamid":"76561198217974721","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":659,"last_played":1627052088},"language":"schinese","review":"完美的诠释了什么叫第九艺术","timestamp_created":1627046183,"timestamp_updated":1627046183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96236827","author":{"steamid":"76561198119016681","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":157,"playtime_forever":1578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1220,"last_played":1642534468},"language":"english","review":"Would die to relieve this game","timestamp_created":1627046038,"timestamp_updated":1627046038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96234456","author":{"steamid":"76561198362814018","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1099,"last_played":1629517170},"language":"schinese","review":"有这个女主，让我去炸地球我都愿意orz虽然结局小悲伤","timestamp_created":1627042438,"timestamp_updated":1627042438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96233333","author":{"steamid":"76561198979759571","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1641850420},"language":"brazilian","review":"Não dá pra acreditar que esse jogo é de 2013.

Playing as Booker DeWitt, go to a floating city in the clouds and extract a girl to the world below. Bioshock Infinite excels in almost everything it does. With its stunning visuals, character designs (that are reminiscent of Dishonored), and environments, Bioshock Infinite is simply a marvel to look at and adds to the enjoyment of seeing what comes next in this adventure. The gameplay is fantastic. Combat is satisfying to the senses with its variety of weapons and special powers to spice up your combat encounters. Infinite really draws you in with its story. First it draws you with the majesty of the city itself, exposes its true American fascist core, then expertly establishes a connection with Elizabeth that is the hallmark of the game itself. By its end, you will want more stories surrounding the setting and characters themselves.","timestamp_created":1626923293,"timestamp_updated":1626923293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96164935","author":{"steamid":"76561198019864651","num_games_owned":1877,"num_reviews":232,"playtime_forever":939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":939,"last_played":1522819381},"language":"english","review":"It's a great game but could have been much more.
