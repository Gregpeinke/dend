Se você não sabe o que é rpg e fps sai daqui agr e vai procurar isso wikipédia.\nPara ganhar um gosto de rpg eles acrescentaram uma coisa chamada \"Perk\" que em português podemos traduzir como \"Skills\" que em portugues de novo podemos traduzir como habilidades em fazer alguma merda e que depois você melhora.\n\nPerks\n\nAgora, além de ser um cara que usa arma e atira em primeira pessoa, você pode ser um cara que usa arma e atira em primeira pessoa e com algum trabalho na vida. Digamos que agora você vai matar zumbis pelados e vai ter uma profissão, são 7 profissões pra seguir: médico, psicopata que ataca de perto, commando, que eu não entendo como seria isso em português, suporte que eu também não sei direito o que ele seria em português, demolidor, piromaníaco e o carinha que eu gosto de chamar de sniper mas que não usa nenhuma sniper.\n\nMédico\n\nO médico meu parceiro... É o cara que sai correndo de um lado pro o outro salvando todo mundo pq todo mundo é idiota e gay e deixa os zumbis agarrarem eles. Então resta pro médico chegar metendo a agulha no amiguinho, lógico que devo avisar que o médico pode meter duas vezes mais usando sua arma e conforme ele dá uns leveis UPs ele pode meter mais rápido e gostoso . No fim das contas ele mete em todo mundo geral pega aids inclusive os zumbis pelados\n\nCommando\n\nCommando.... Não existe amigo ou inimigo para ele, e sim ALVOS. Quem joga de commando é um protótipo de Rambo, ou seja, mete bala, entende? não sei porque em inglês tem dois M's mas deixa quieto porque eu não \"speaki inglish\" é o cara que carrega a metralhadora de um lado pro outro, o cara que bota o dedo no gatilho a cada 0,5 segundos, o cara que não sabe se é amigo ou inimigo mas já meteu 100 balas na cara, enfim, o cara q mata mais que você é o commando.\n\nBeserk\n\nBeserk... nada mais que aquele cara que se acha O BOMBADO e sai correndo pra bater nos bixos... No caso com uma faquinha, katana, sword ou serra elétrica ou sei lá o que ele tem... Mas que ele sai correndo atras do bixos ele sai! Diria que ele é o cara mais macho da parada, porque ele não pode ser segurado por nenhum dos zumbis pelados que vivem tentando te agarrar.\n\nSupport\n\nÉ o cara do suporte... quando está tudo cheio de bixo (ou não) ele chega com a shotgun metendo pra lá e pra cá (que povo que gosta de meter)... Lógico que bem devagar porque afinal, todo mundo sabe que essa arma dele é meio lerdinha pra botar bala, mas quando bota, bota em vários! Quando tiver na merda é ele quem vai lá pra não fazer tanta diferença assim...\n\nDemolitions\n\nVocê quis dizer:\nSuicida?Salvador?  Quem? O cara que embora muitas vezes mate todos os bixos custuma mais ainda se explodir com explosivos \nÉ bem simples esse garoto louco... ele é foda, mata os bichos mais fodas da parada, mas na hora de matar sempre acaba por se matar... O jogo é tao previsível perfeito que ele faz com que as granadas e minas que você use possam matar você mesmo, MAS NAO AOS SEUS AMIGOS as vezes nem mata os zumbis, mas ok\n\nFirebug\n\nSabe seu irmão menor?

It has a great fan community and is still evolving nevertheless KF2 is already been announced.\n\nThe main difference to L4D is the concept not to fight some hordes, but just a certain amount of 9 different special infected (ZEDs) each of the 10 waves on the same map. Then comes the Boss called the patriarch which is incredible stronger and send some of his children for support. Your character is improvable by long time playing measured in 7 different perks. So you will achieve mastery in many different ways after a while.\n\nThat doesn't mean your personal player skills are not needed. Instead you must begin to analyze the ZED mechanics in higher difficulties and how the perks work perfectly together. \nThere are 2 ways: Camping or Kiting to beat the maps. Camping means holdout in a tight place and withstand all over the waves the ZEDs. Kiting means running in circles on a route and takeout on ZED after another. Kiting is more time intense but could be also more fun.\n\nThe kill animations are absolutely great (at least in the uncut version). Heads are exploding, can be decapitivated. Burning them bodies with flamethrower (firebug) let them coal. Demolitian has pipebombs and blow up everything that comes to close. On the other side some Zeds have a rage mode where they don't stop chasing you until they killed you.\nIt's totally challenging and depends on the whole team skills if you survive or not.\n\nThere's a high amount of 280 Achievements atm. Still raising at each seasonal event. You have to await these events to unlock them all. Each map has 4 map achievements from \"normal\" to \"hell on earth\", KFO - interesting objective maps, some kill achievements and special gimmicks, unlockable new character and Tripwire cross game supporting achievement policy. All fun.\n\nOne little negative is the complex server browser in MP which confuses in the first moment. But after a while you will get used to it.\n\nDon't miss this great game that isn't still boring after 1k hours playtime. (helping some friends with achievements). I recommend you to buy somekind of complete pack in order to get a whole bunch of the most important DLC guns and skins included. It just cost you a little more. I know, some people swear L4D2 is even better and more atmospheric.

I met some awesome people, but on every (non-passworded) server there was always a background of people who had no idea what they were doing and were not willing to learn. On top of that were quite a few straight up trolls who from what I've seen have unfortunately moved onto KF2 already.\n\nLastly, there was the blatantly P2W weapon releases. They basically flushed the balance down the toilet for money. That made me think twice about buying KF2, because if it goes the same way then I'll probably take to ringing Tripwire head office every day demanding my money back.\n\nThis was a diamond in the rough that Tripwire polished to near perfection and then whored out for pennies. Upsetting, but fun while it lasted.","timestamp_created":1431177552,"timestamp_updated":1431177552,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516973793506622314","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15755142","author":{"steamid":"76561198121627041","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":99,"last_played":1447772983},"language":"russian","review":"Оxуенная мясорубка","timestamp_created":1431175848,"timestamp_updated":1431175848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15754214","author":{"steamid":"76561198118054738","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1632248159},"language":"english","review":"Better than CS:GO","timestamp_created":1431171584,"timestamp_updated":1466775351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15752861","author":{"steamid":"76561198152613629","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1598961659},"language":"russian","review":"игра очень прикольная советую","timestamp_created":1431165064,"timestamp_updated":1431165064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15751858","author":{"steamid":"76561198100684846","num_games_owned":432,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":28880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27272,"last_played":1505513756},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bacana pra quem curte fps co-op ;)\n\n\n@edit: passa o tempo e o jogo continua dando gosto de jogar ^^","timestamp_created":1431159576,"timestamp_updated":1482984356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15750328","author":{"steamid":"76561198044212950","num_games_owned":445,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":750,"last_played":1446521960},"language":"english","review":"I got my butt groped by a crawler.\n10/10 would throw dosh at it in fear again.","timestamp_created":1431149330,"timestamp_updated":1431149330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.45267486572265625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15749980","author":{"steamid":"76561198106340269","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":7296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1541877242},"language":"english","review":"really awesome","timestamp_created":1431146946,"timestamp_updated":1650273142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15747162","author":{"steamid":"76561198152133766","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":10216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6652,"last_played":1578092358},"language":"brazilian","review":"JOGO FODA...................... pronto","timestamp_created":1431127707,"timestamp_updated":1431127707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15746134","author":{"steamid":"76561198050451361","num_games_owned":933,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1086,"last_played":1507310853},"language":"russian","review":"В этой игре интереснее именно в кооперативе.

floor1，中文名杀戮空间1，作为一款上了年纪的合作生存动作游戏，即使是放在现在仍然有独特的吸引力。\n游戏性：游戏的玩法很简单粗暴，属于典型的易上手难精通。每关会有一定数量的怪物出现，杀完怪物拿钱，每波之间可以更换职业和花钱购买更强的武器，然后去打下一波怪物直到击败最终BOSS。游戏有不同的难度设置，低级别怪物数量生命值和AI都很低，高难度下怪物除了数量和生命值增加，攻击性也会增强，比如低难度下怪物被爆头一般直接死亡，而高难度下会继续攻击玩家一段时间才死亡。游戏一共6个职业，每个职业有各自的升级要求，由于数值压制的原因一般不建议低级挑战高难度，由于游戏的多数地图空间很狭窄而玩家的火力上限有限，很多职业在高难度下单刷难度极高，即使是被低级怪包围也会迅速被灭，所以通常需要组队。游戏最多支持6人，可以通过MOD增加，组队系统的特点是，怪物的伤害生命值和数量会随着玩家数量的增加而增加，所以并不是多一把枪就多一份战斗力，如果玩家数量增多而技术不过关的话，会大大增加翻车率，因为一个人倒下怪物的其他数值是不会变的，如果一个人落单了被解决了，其他玩家的战斗压力会大幅度增加，即使是老司机，一不留被包围被团灭也是家常便饭，所以叫上一群好朋友组队开语音玩是体验这个游戏的最佳方式。\n画面:作为一款相对来说年龄较大的游戏了。就画面细节来说，看惯了近几年游戏建模的人可能不入眼，但是画面的表现力绝对不亚于现在任何一款恐怖合作生存游戏，相比于2代来说，1代的官方地图更暗，而且部分地图空间非常狭窄，比如沼泽，生化实验室，不仅给玩家增添压抑感，也给游戏增加不少难度。2代里每关打完的引路气流是蓝色，更有科技感，而1代的引路气流是血红色，由于资金原因，1代的人物动作没有经过捕捉看起来更僵硬，而就是这些看似的缺点，却造就了独特的心理体验，僵硬的动作，充斥着血红色和阴暗的画面，幽暗狭窄的空间，四面八方的人形怪物，无时无刻不让玩家感受到一种诡异而恐怖的氛围，所以说2代是科幻游戏，而1代更像恐怖游戏。顺便提一下，由于画面的原因游戏的配置要求现在看来是非常低了，基本上所有的学生本都能跑。\n音乐/打击感:背景音乐是个亮点，背景音乐的风格会随着进程而变化，前期只有一把刀和手枪可以用来攻击各种缺装备，但是怪物数量也开始增多，BGM是恐怖和压抑，中期武器开始增强，敌人种类稍微增多，BGM风格是危机四伏，后期各种准备达到最强而各种强力敌人也出现，BGM也变得狂野和暴力。在贴切的BGM中生存和杀戮，带给玩家异常精彩的游戏体验。音效来说，游戏里怪物被射中头部和其他部位会有不同的音效，1代被爆头像是切水果，2代更像砸核桃。\n如果你的电脑配置不是十分理想又想体验和朋友一起战斗的乐趣，那么这款游戏绝对是你的最佳选择。\n","timestamp_created":1431062000,"timestamp_updated":1543132209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637718796730041504","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15735053","author":{"steamid":"76561198096728258","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":435,"last_played":1585238036},"language":"spanish","review":".","timestamp_created":1431053639,"timestamp_updated":1431053639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15730838","author":{"steamid":"76561198036369781","num_games_owned":286,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3472,"last_played":1486319083},"language":"russian","review":"Эта
