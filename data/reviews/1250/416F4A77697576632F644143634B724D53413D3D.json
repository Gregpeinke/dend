After completing 10 waves of zombies you then have completed a \"floor\" then you restart from round one on the next \"floor\". There is no infinite rounds so you can't play until you finally die not even on single player. The game is also insanely easy, I only died once and that was the first game I ever played after that I played several more games never died. It is so easy you probably just sit with some team mates and let them kill of the zombies and you could go eat lunch. I thought this game would be good because I seen a lot of reviews where people praised the game and one guy had like 5k hours. If I had to sit here and play this game for 5000 hours my head would explode. It's not worth the money nor the time, Save your money and buy a better zombie

& addictive // Recommended for those looking for quick tempo & gratuitous carnage[/h1]\n\n+ Leveling system is basic but well-implemented, as are the class perks\n+ There is a frequently implemented slow-motion ability which, when triggered by a player, affects everyone; rather than proving a nuisance, it surprisingly adds to the experience & makes for some very cinematic moments (also does well you give one a few quick breathers in-between the action)\n+ Soundtrack is heavy & loud; perfect for the pace of the game, & serves to get the player's blood pumping\n+ Very helpful & generous community; this is most often demonstrated by the culture of money dropping & weapon sharing that is extremely prevalient (almost uniformly) among the player base\n+ Voiced quips are comical & entertaining\n+ Intensely satisfying gunplay & general combat; weapons, even melee, feel as though they have weight\n+ Vast arsenal of weaponry to choose from\n+ Steam workshop integration; very mod-friendly, which serves to increase replayability with a little bit of effort\n+ Impressive enemy mob variation, each with its own, unique characteristics\n\n- The amount of in-game advertising, either for DLC or products completely divorced from the title, is very distracting\n- Declining population; at the time of this review, there were a number of servers available, & several of them were full up, so it certainly isn't a dead game, but it was noticeably less active than when I first picked up the game a year or so ago\n- Poor movement animations & sub-par textures; presentation is a

Yeah, it's buggy. There are still a number of issues and the chances these are going to get fixed are slim to none.\n\nHowever, modders may be capable of fixing some of the more glaring issues. (I've taken a stab at fixing the Nvidia Linux appearance. I've no easy way of standardizing it, but it's functional.)\n\nBesides that, the game is fairly boring on its own and playing solo. It's more or less the same constant grind. Leveling up is also really slow.\n\nWith that said, though, if you happen to find a crew of at least two or three people who'll play with you regularly, the game is infinitely more fun. The extra players do increase the difficulty, but that's not necessarily makes it more fun. It's connecting and fighting through rounds with friends that make the game interesting. Also, if your friends you play with are fairly good at playing, you can all play around with the game a bit. Some of these can result in some rather crazy and unexpected results. If they had fixed some of the bugs, I'm sure it would at least more astheticly pleasing, but the main point is... it functions and is definitely solid enough to enjoy playing.","timestamp_created":1447376519,"timestamp_updated":1447376519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19038969","author":{"steamid":"76561198255318838","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2029,"last_played":1454350162},"language":"danish","review":"Elsker det ikke bare er et spil hvor man er lvl max på ingen tid !
