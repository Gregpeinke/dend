It really does a lot with a little, and that's one of the biggest advantages to this game. It innovates with so little. \n \nHalf-Life put first person shooters in the limelight. Sure, this game is by no means the first of its kind. There were plenty of FPS games before, and there will be plenty that come after. But few will reach to the standards of quality set by this game. This game came out in 1998, and it just goes to show how prophetic this game is that it still holds up a decade plus later. Few games could even dream of being relevant a few years later, with how fast things are moving now. \n \nAny run of the mill FPS game can rattle off the industry standard arsenal; the bad guys, the bombs, the grenade throwing shotgun blasting yehaw games that we've all played a thousand times by this point. It takes serious effort to innovate. Do anything new and exciting. By this point, we've seen so much of the same. You know what would really be super? To look at a game made in a time when these rules were still being written. You didn't need fancy particle effects, slowdown bullet time, or any of the gratuitous garbage you would see in any dime a dozen unity project. \n \nHalf-Life is a simple game about escaping Black Mesa. That's it. You play as a dude with a crowbar and a suit of armor. It's just so hard to express how engrossing this game is, especially after a few hours of gameplay. Its easy to forget that you're essentially walking down hallways, jumping across rooms with one entrance and one exit, and fighting the same enemies. Its just, the game executes everything to well that none of it's limitations matter. Barney is every security guard? Doesn't matter. Don't know where to go? Doesn't matter. The graphics aren't that impressive anymore? Doesn't matter. You can honestly forgive a lot solely on how amazingly smooth the gameplay is. It's rock solid except for the spare few times I got stuck in a wall or crashed the game. For a game this large, that's an achievement. \n \nThis game is nowhere near perfect. Not even close. I think an argument can be made that the silent protagonist trite can be traced all the way back to the grand daddy himself. I think my only other major complaint is that the game starts to drag it's feet in maybe the last hour of gameplay. Right up to the final boss. The muddy textures don't do the game a lot of favors when they're stretched and repeated. Nor does the level design at that point. It's a bit of slow down in what otherwise is an amazing experience. \n \nThis is a classic. I'm glad to have played it. Not only that, but I recommend anyone who is mildly interested in FPS games to try it out. It's the great grand dad of them all. It just does so much perfectly.\n","timestamp_created":1494124003,"timestamp_updated":1494124003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31593291","author":{"steamid":"76561198275636970","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1970,"last_played":1544482550},"language":"english","review":"For it's time, Half-Life was revolutionary.

It can be difficult at times, and the AI makes some questionable choices, but it's not very problematic. \n\nIn other words...\n\nWield the crowbar.

The story is simple, but understandable. The gameplay is fast and frantic, and sometimes even requires a good amount of stealth. All of the weapons you get in this game can range from standard military weapons, to mega powered super guns that shoot lasers. \n\nThis game balances out horror and action perfectly, with some pretty cool lighting effects, and excellent sound design. No minimap, no x-ray vision, no loud blaring music (most of the time). This game is as brutal as it gets, and I wouldn't be surprised if first time players find easy mode very difficult. This game will find ways to kill you in the same way Dark Souls does many years later. If you think you're safe, think again. Instant death traps riddle this entire game. And expect a heavy amount of violence and gore. You can shatter enemies to bits with explosive weaponry, and watch as their skull drops right in front of you.\n\nWithout objective markers and minimaps, the in-game characters tell you what the next objective is. That's it. No flashing arrow or anything. Just you vs. the game. \n\nA few nitpicks. There are sometimes when you're required to do platforming in this game, and it get's really nerve racking due to the fact that FPS aren't designed for platforming. There's also a few parts in which the game expects you to traverse 5 inch terrain with one false click leading to an untimely death, and the ladder physics in this game aren't the greatest. \n\nThis game is rather rare, as in it takes moment to moment action very seriously. This game is not for the faint of heart.\n\nOverall: 9/10\nDespite the nitpicks I have with this game, this is still a playable masterpiece.

Es Half-life uno de los mejores juegos de acción en primera persona que han existido. A finales de los 90 y principios del milenio era como el chocolate: Todo el mundo lo amaba y todo el mundo queria jugarlo. Pero bueno, trataré de responder a las dos custiones que lo rodean cuyas respuestas las conocen cualquiera que lo haya jugado en su época o sea simplemente uno de sus fans ¿ Por qué es este juego tan importante? ¿Y por qué marcó el inicio de una era?\n\nPues bien, lejos de parecerse a la mayoría de shooters de la época, Half-life nos dió un contexto para ir pegando tiros por ahí, nos dió un rumbo, un objetivo que no fuera sólo acabar con los enemigos de turno. Me explico: Quake por ejemplo era únicamente un conjunto de misiones o escenarios que tenían que ser recorridos a través de las matanzas que montábamos porque ahí es dónde residía su gracia, pero en Half-life esto cambia y logra distinguirse gracias a su narrativa en tiempo real que nos permitía  estar mirando a las musarañas si así lo deseábamos. Además, su diseño de niveles supuso también un hito en lo que a sensación de inmersión nos referimos gracias a la variedad de sus escenarios, la interacción con el mundo, su inteligencia artificial y su modalidad de juego que ofrecía una acción combinada de shooter, puzzles, un par de secciones de plataformas y algunos momentos pausados de calma.\n\nPoco más puedo decir de este juego que no se haya dicho ya anteriormente. Half-life es junto con juegos como Zelda, system shock o las aventuras gráficas uno de los primeros en querer contar una historia con sentido, que se sostenga sobre su argumento (No por ello es la mejor trama del mundo, pero se entiente). Es por eso que Half-life es uno de los padres del videojuego moderno y por lo que se lo considera un referente a la hora de querer desarrollar una historia en el medio interactivo del videojuego.\n\nPD: Sé que esta obra da para un análisis bastante más extendido pero como ya he dicho antes es un juego del que mucho se ha hablado ya y por eso he nombrado sus puntos mas importantes. En fin, supongo que basta para hacerse a la idea de por qué todos deseamos con ansias su glorioso regreso con su tercera entrega...","timestamp_created":1493136724,"timestamp_updated":1495196412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31355949","author":{"steamid":"76561198067856323","num_games_owned":497,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":1694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1213,"last_played":1593345430},"language":"english","review":"Honestly, everything about this game's excellent presentation, incredibly fluid shooting and impeccable semi-optional narrative has already been discussed to death.
