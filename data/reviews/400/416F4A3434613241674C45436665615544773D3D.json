Portal was originally included as an experimental side game in The Orange Box, alongside Team Fortress 2 and Half-Life 2 Episodes 1 and 2, but wound up shining just as brightly for being a solid game that used it's concepts to the fullest.\n\nPortal is a First-Person Puzzle game where you utilize a device that can create direct links between two surfaces.  There are other mechanics as well, and the game tests your ability to use these \"portals\" to solve puzzles.\n\nWhat strikes me the most about this game and it's sequel is how much attention went into level design.  The developer commentary details that the playtesting process was quite rigorous to ensure the game was still challenging, while not becoming frustrating, which is a very delicate balance to achieve.\n\nThe sound effects are satisfying, and the ambient music does a good job of providing a sense of eerieness and sterility to the environments.  I don't think I have to mention Still Alive by Jonathan Coulton, but I will anyway.  Ellen McLain does a wonderful job in the role of the facility's AI supervisor GLaDOS as well as certain obstacles you encounter.\n\nPortal is a game that holds up remarkably well.  While I'd say the sequel has more value (endless user created levels will do that for ya), this game is a very tight, cohesive experience that I feel should be a staple in anyone's Steam Library.","timestamp_created":1313373576,"timestamp_updated":1583972666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2102697","author":{"steamid":"76561198002353307","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":84,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1414940099},"language":"english","review":"I think I am in love.","timestamp_created":1313357677,"timestamp_updated":1385416474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1424156","author":{"steamid":"76561197993137304","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2776,"last_played":1626808270},"language":"english","review":"This is da shit","timestamp_created":1313179428,"timestamp_updated":1313179428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1218028","author":{"steamid":"76561197989446733","num_games_owned":9736,"num_reviews":117,"playtime_forever":1306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1306,"last_played":1326182400},"language":"english","review":"Clever.

This game contains some of the sickest twisted humour I've ever heard in a videogame, and I would reccommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games... with a sick storyline mixed in behind.\n\nThe sequel to Portal was released on 2011 and recieved mixed feedback. I agree with a lot of the negative critisim, because you can't recreate a wonderful formula with a sequel. If something is unique, having two of it destorys that. Play this game.","timestamp_created":1310530257,"timestamp_updated":1310530257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2270881","author":{"steamid":"76561198004924288","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":720,"last_played":1348815600},"language":"english","review":"A rare example of a perfect game.\n","timestamp_created":1310496026,"timestamp_updated":1310496026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3587579","author":{"steamid":"76561198025029492","num_games_owned":567,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1527357248},"language":"english","review":"The Cake may be a lie but the humor isn't, this game is funny, entertaining and challenging, Everyone should experience p0rtal jumping","timestamp_created":1310428435,"timestamp_updated":1310428435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3578582","author":{"steamid":"76561198024968093","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1073,"last_played":1333350000},"language":"english","review":"A deep, enriching, and facinating take on the puzzle genre.
