Textures, animations et éclairages semblent certes quelque peu grossiers, mais comme dans Red Orchestra, l'architecture des cartes sert excellemment bien le gameplay. Que l'on se retrouve coincé dans les couloirs obscurs d'un laboratoire ou que l'on soit forcé de courir à travers champs dans une nuit d'encre, on se plonge tout de même facilement dans le bain.\nJouabilité 16 /20\n\nFidèle à leurs bonnes vieilles habitudes, les petits gars de TripWire nous livrent un soft exigeant, qui ne se révèle d'ailleurs pleinement que lorsqu'on augmente la difficulté. Nettement plus technique que les premières séquences de bourrinisme primaire le laissent penser, Killing Floor impose avec intelligence la notion d'entraide et de coordination entre les joueurs. Les âmes chagrines lui reprocheront peut-être son manque de variété, mais pour peu que l'on ait le courage d'insister, on profitera en fait d'une expérience immensément gratifiante.\nDurée de vie 14 /20\n\nIl semble toujours délicat de noter ce critère lorsqu'il est question d'un jeu online. La longévité de Killing Floor dépendra donc principalement de vous et de la communauté dans son ensemble. Reste que son système de compétences persistantes pousse clairement les joueurs à insister. Plus on joue, plus on devient bon, et plus on en veut.\nBande son 13 /20\n\nDu rock assez quelconque se déclenche en même temps que les différentes vagues. On en aura vite marre. Pour le reste, Killing Floor associe des bruitages corrects à des répliques british sympatoches, qui tendent malheureusement à se répéter rapidement.\n\nenfin je conseile pour le prix d investir dans le volet 2 .","timestamp_created":1427828114,"timestamp_updated":1430071457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15143071","author":{"steamid":"76561198100338188","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1026,"last_played":1490520325},"language":"schinese","review":"打击感爽快！！！GOOD Geme","timestamp_created":1427820700,"timestamp_updated":1427820700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15142858","author":{"steamid":"76561198107975830","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":11412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1601739015},"language":"czech","review":"Výborná hra , doporučuji všem už se těšim na Killing Floor 2","timestamp_created":1427819779,"timestamp_updated":1427819779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15140361","author":{"steamid":"76561198037505832","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":26203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24362,"last_played":1516574552},"language":"english","review":"Very underrated game that is actually pretty good.

At first it was an hour a day, then 3, then 8 hours; I'm now at 12 hour days. When I wasn't playing the game I was thinking about it. Thinking about new tactic's, strategies, why I wasn't currently playing it. Thinking about how detailed the limited graphical game was, where everything everywhere had extreme details in the artwork. Newspapers actually had written articles; the random paintings/posters hanging on the walls in the maps were more detailed than the Paintings/posters in my apartment. The intense Gore, the screams of the Zeds, me screaming when a Flesh Pound is two feet away from me before I notice... The insanity that I go through when I play this amazingly designed game. When you have a full squad in your multiplayer co-op the fight gets even more extreme. With the already heavy difficulty that the game offers the Zeds numbers jump. Almost giving you the feeling that the algorithm changes per a teammate; the zeds begin to think differently, attack you with different strats. \n\nThe reason why I don't recommend this game is not because I find the game boring or poorly done in any way, in fact it's quite the opposite. The game is so intense and extreme in the levels of awesomeness that I've become addicted. I stopped talking to friends and family members, all that matters is that I'm able to defend my squad when it needs be. I've treied to stop, I've gone down on the hours of gaming, but the withdrawl is aching.","timestamp_created":1427780211,"timestamp_updated":1427842533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15134747","author":{"steamid":"76561198157193379","num_games_owned":413,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1494390533},"language":"english","review":"This game is like Left 4 Dead on steroids.

Honorable mention has been made of Soldier of Fortune limb damage, with added damage effects like holes and visible/exposed bones.  Yet the formula appears to be the same and that is just a lot of win.  The game has been downed as The Poor Man's Left For Dead, but this game, though you have outposts to reach, is nothing like L4D.  The formula is simple: Survive.  Get through the numbered undead and prep before the next 'Wave'.  Sounds easy, but no one game is ever the same.  Though there is team playand even a med class, everyone has a duty to shoot as many undead faces as possible as fast as possible, including the medic.  Though some people are so good they can carry bads, you can never really protect anyone when the **** hits the fan in the later waves.  The game is supremely difficult in higher difficulties, but the satisfaction of a hard win in KF will rival any co-op experience out there.  You have many memorable enemies and some that are so cheap they will become punch lines in your gaming life, recognizable immediately by fellow KF friends.  The ability to work/level ANY class simply by using their weapon system means you can be a level cap Sharpshooter simply by getting headshots in each game, same as just throwing a grenade will boost your specs as a Demolitionist.

It was originally released as an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod in 2005\n\nGameplay:\nKilling Floor is a first person shooter, allowing each player to move through a 3D environment. Gameplay consists of two game types, in which the player fights waves of zombie-like specimens, with each wave becoming successively more difficult, until it concludes with a battle against a \"boss\" specimen, called the Patriarch. Players earn in-game money for each kill, as well as for surviving to the end of a wave. In the time between each waves, players can visit a trader to buy and sell ammo, armor, and additional weapons, such as katanas, pipe bombs, flamethrowers, shotguns, and so forth; the Trader's location on the level varies at the end of each wave, discouraging players from camping in one location. Weapons may also be found randomly across the level. Players are encouraged to work together; they can trade items and drop money, healing is more effective on other players than on oneself, and the team can strategically weld doors shut to provide a temporary barrier from the oncoming horde while funneling the other creatures to specific areas.\n\nPlayers select one of seven perks at the start of a match and between rounds. The perk, similar to the idea of a character class, provides bonuses towards certain weapon types, armor, movement, and other factors. Players can level up each perk to increase the benefits it offers. For example, the \"Sharpshooter\" perk, which provides accuracy benefits when using scoped rifles, can be raised in level by completing a number of headshots with specific weapons. The player does not need to play with that perk to raise its level; for example, the Field Medic perk requires the player to heal a number of points to level up, but this can also be done while playing any of the other perks.\n\nPlayers that die during a wave will drop their current weapon and re-enter the game at the start of the next wave, as long as at least one squad member survives. If the entire squad is wiped out, they will have to restart the game from the first round.\n\nEach game can be configured to alter the length and difficulty of the various waves. The number of creatures in the enemy waves are based on the number of players in the game, increasing in numbers if more players join the game in progress. All but the weakest enemies have some special attack that can inflict significant damage on a player. A feature called \"zed time\" awards particularly gory kills, such as headshots, with slow-motion, even in multiplayer mode.\n\nPlot:\nThe game takes place in London, England. Horzine Biotech, a biotechnology company, is contracted to conduct experiments of a military nature involving mass cloning and genetic manipulation. Something goes horribly wrong during the process of the experimentations, and human subjects begin to exhibit grotesque mutations and disfigurement. They become increasingly hostile, and eventually overrun the internal security forces of the corporation.\n\nHours later, the first waves of the specimens break out onto the surface, disrupting a peace protest outside the well-known military contractor. Despite the best efforts of local police, the civilians are quickly overwhelmed and consumed by the seemingly endless supply of clones now streaming from the gaping maw of Horzine Biotech's headquarter. Having escaped their sterile prison, the creatures began to fan out to neighboring areas, devouring the helpless citizens of London while the Metropolitan Police bravely but fruitlessly attempt to stem the tide of mutated flesh now spreading across their city.\n\nDesperate to contain the outbreak from reaching overseas as planned by the now mutated and cybernetic-enhanced scientist Dr. Kevin Clamely (which is now the Patriarch), the British government quickly begins to organize ragtag teams of surviving British Army soldiers and Special Branch police officers to fight back against the hordes of mutated \"specimens\" now running amok throughout the capital and its outskirts. The player takes the role of a member of one of these teams as they partake in a variety of missions in and around the city of London.\n\nMy favorite and one of the best coop based multiplayer game ever! Make sure that you play with friends, fun is guaranteed!.

A complete round is played on a single map divided with multiple waves with the number of zeds growing as you successfully complete one. After each round you are given a chance to go to the trade and stock up your ammo or buy new guns.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\n[+] What's more to say? WASD and mouse is the best controls for any first person shooter game.\n[+] Hotkeys for additional actions such as dropping money or a gun for the purposes of giving them to your allies.\n[+] You can set your own set of hotkeys if you're more used to unorthodox controls.\n\n[h1]Atmosphere[/h1]\n[+] The game is dark. You'd see people hanged themselves and some stabbed on various maps.\n[+] 'End of the world' feel on the environment.\n[+] There will always be a time in a round wherein you'll panic because of the zeds coming out of nowhere and suddenly near you.\n[+] What else could make you shit your pants than a zombie holding a fucking chainsaw, zombie that can turn invisible and heal himself for injuries, a small crawler that's so hard to see in dark areas and would suddenly jump to you? This game have it all.\n\n[h1]Sounds[/h1]\n[+] Soundtrack that will give you chills.\n[+] Characters actually talks. Most people would get bored from hearing just random noises and background music.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n[+] Despite the requirement being so low-end that it could run almost on any kind of laptop/desktop and being so old. The game still has a very good graphics and even on lowest video settings at that.\n[+] The zeds are well-made. They give an eerie feeling than most creatures from other games that's supposed to be a horror.\n\n[h1]Gameplay & Balance[/h1]\n[+] The game is challenging and not something you could just play-through casually. The game has different set of difficulties from 'Beginner' to 'Hell on Earth' and the length can be set from 'Short' to 'Long'.\n[+] The number of zeds scales with how many players are playing on that wave.\n[+] The maps are designed so that there wont be many safe spots and zombies could literally appear in front of you, to your left/right, and even behind you.\n[+] The Patriarch, the boss that appears after you successfully finish the last wave. It is really challenging and requires more than just rapid tapping your mouse. He could turn invisible to heal himself and hes hard to beat regardless of the distance since he could attack with both melee and range.\n[-] It becomes repetitive afterwhile. You just kill, kill, and kill. There's a mission mode wherein you are to complete a set of given objectives but even that won't make up for the repetitiveness of the game. However, don't mistake this statement as to the game not having any replay value. The game has HUGE replay value it's just that it gets repetitive to some after awhile. \n[-] The game's mapping is too simple. Some small structures like the barrels cant be jumped on.\n\n[h1]Contents[/h1]\n[+] Perks! there are six perks to choose from and each have their own level which you need to work on separately. Different perks provides different bonuses and a different role to take on the party.\n[+] Different kinds of zombies. Each with different strength and weaknesses.\n[+] Decent amount of guns classified on their corresponding perk. (More guns when you get the DLCs)\n[+] Huge selection of characters. There are some that would require you to complete achievements or buy a certain game in order to use them. They provide no boost in your stats just merely appearance. (More chars when you get the DLCs)\n[+] A lot of maps you could play from and it's wide enough to contain big amount of players and zeds. There are also some spots that were designed to give you a strategic advantage over the mindless zeds.\n[+] You could get more content from the community members since Killing Floor has its own Steam Workshop.\n\n[h1]DLCs[/h1]\nI want to give a thumbs up for the game developers for making a DLC that would actually increase the game content and provides more fun and eye-candy unlike the DLCs nowadays wherein the game wouldn't be fun unless you get them.

Not a must buy, it deserves a place somewhere in your heart.","timestamp_created":1427582302,"timestamp_updated":1427582302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15099387","author":{"steamid":"76561198042350362","num_games_owned":301,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1348902000},"language":"turkish","review":"...","timestamp_created":1427581389,"timestamp_updated":1427581389,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498243570327758789","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15098423","author":{"steamid":"76561198060839062","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":869,"last_played":1561626990},"language":"schinese","review":"棒棒棒！！！ 期待2","timestamp_created":1427577111,"timestamp_updated":1427577111,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523971140384674072","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15098352","author":{"steamid":"76561198159356316","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":124,"last_played":1446755708},"language":"russian","review":"бяка","timestamp_created":1427576777,"timestamp_updated":1427576777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15098251","author":{"steamid":"76561198061700411","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1043,"last_played":1429179745},"language":"english","review":"I love zombie games, so this is definitely not going to be left out.\nCan't wait for Killing Floor 2 though!

Then standalone version was released in 2005 and has had continued success through it's frequent updates and Downloadable content releases. \n\nThe game is labeled as \"Co-Op Survival Horror\", and while that may at first sound like an oxymoron, don't dismiss the claim. \nYou and up to 5 other teammates fight through multiple waves of different brands of mutated specimens, all looking to eat you alive. Each kill on a mutant rewards you with a certain amount of money and surviving the round nets you an extra bonus. Why do you need this money? To buy the bigger guns, of course. This game gets progressively more difficult with each successive waves, with later waves introducing super-strong 'mini-boss' like characters. \n\nOnce you reach the final wave, you must face \"The Patriarch.\" he will face you and your teammates alone at first, occasionally bringing in some smaller weaker mutants to distract you. \n\n\"But that means it's 6 versus 1? How hard could that possibly be??\"\n Very.\n\nBecause here is what The Patriarch has in his arsenal: \n\n--Invisibility cloak\n--Super Speed\n--Super Strength\n--Syringes of a strange formula that allows him to regenerate health. \n--Chain gun \n--Rocket Launcher arm\n\nYes, that last one says \"Rocket Launcher arm.\" \n\nIf you can bring down the Patriarch, you will win the round and move on to the next location, rinse and repeat. The variety of weapons, along with the perk system and user created content support really add to the game's replayability value, and with the second installment coming out in the near future, this one is great to pick up to familiarize yourself with the world.","timestamp_created":1427575925,"timestamp_updated":1427575925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15098057","author":{"steamid":"76561198058506717","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":6219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5226,"last_played":1586039503},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игрушка где можно по мочить зомборей и по нафтыкать боссу","timestamp_created":1427575564,"timestamp_updated":1427575564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15097286","author":{"steamid":"76561198056744152","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1064,"last_played":1545583427},"language":"italian","review":"still don't get how the floor should kill me\n 10/10 would burn down waves of zeds again","timestamp_created":1427572309,"timestamp_updated":1427572309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15096296","author":{"steamid":"76561197990815916","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9743,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":628,"last_played":1569035023},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom, recomendo concerteza!!!","timestamp_created":1427568631,"timestamp_updated":1427568631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15095975","author":{"steamid":"76561198125565032","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":124,"last_played":1479087424},"language":"english","review":"gud","timestamp_created":1427567383,"timestamp_updated":1427567383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15095822","author":{"steamid":"76561198100324636","num_games_owned":448,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":287,"last_played":1590397170},"language":"russian","review":"Вообщем: ЗБС игра советую всем!!!","timestamp_created":1427566830,"timestamp_updated":1427566830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15093402","author":{"steamid":"76561198031509708","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2990,"last_played":1429482591},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the best multiplayer shooters I have ever played.
