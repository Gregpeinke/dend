The game pits you as Adrian Shepard on the side of the HCEU, the tough enemies from the original Half Life. New gameplay is given such as ropes along with an excellent and varied collection of new weapons. These weapons are as cool as the ones found in Half Life and do their purpose well. New characters are also in the game such as people in the Army who fight on your side and new enemies that can deal more damage. The Black Ops are still your tough enemies but the aliens are now bigger and scarier, dealing more damage up close and from far. The music is an interesting choice, ranging from typical electronic sounds to even jazz in some big fights. The smooth jazz is odd but puts a contrast to certain parts. The ambient sounds are also good for some levels. The game does have harder fights and enemies (left me at low HP near the end), but the world to traverse is smaller, with some puzzles to solve.","timestamp_created":1313796156,"timestamp_updated":1313796156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"741040","author":{"steamid":"76561197977081885","num_games_owned":654,"num_reviews":369,"playtime_forever":0,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":0},"language":"english","review":"IMMA OPPOSE U IN THE NUTS","timestamp_created":1313713934,"timestamp_updated":1385415420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2558189","author":{"steamid":"76561198009288156","num_games_owned":550,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":0,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":0},"language":"french","review":"Le meilleur épisode du 1.

Yet the gameplay stays the same through all of Opposing Force, it's just the minor improvements that make it worth even better than Blue Shift. \n\nPlaying as Shepard, and being on the bad side of the story-line really put me into a different perspective of how Freeman came to be today. Playing through this once-in-a-lifetime videogame was definetly worthwhile and encouraging, because you get a better sense (and practice) at all the mechanics. That made all of Half-Life ever so great and compelling to tackle upon. \n\nNevertheless the experience was \"one Hell of a Fun Ride\", Trust me, playing as Shepard when you've beaten every single other games before Half-Life 2 really gets a person in-tune with the story-line.\n\n9.33/10\n\nGL & HF...","timestamp_created":1304384446,"timestamp_updated":1304384446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3447806","author":{"steamid":"76561198022908403","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2148,"last_played":1421739706},"language":"brazilian","review":"Uma verdadeira \"expansão\" para a experiência do clássico Half-Life.
