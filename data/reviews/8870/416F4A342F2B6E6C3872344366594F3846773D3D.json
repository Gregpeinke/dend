Bioshock infinite has a decent atmosphere and a lot of work was put in the environment. However, the genius of Bioshock 1 makes this game not as amazing as I originally thought. Bioshock 1 had the creepy atmosphere and the overall experience was better- I had an attachment to certain characters in the game. In Bioshock Infinite, Booker and Elizabeth are the only noteworthy characters...well besides Comstock. The story is not as relatable for some reason-not convincing? \n\nTLDR;\n\nPro: \n-Nice scenery\n-Cool AI companion\n-Stuff to explore\n\nCon:\n-Story not up to par to the first Bioshock game\n-The game combat has not gotten better but arguably worse in some respects (Dishonored combat/ stealth system is superior)\n\nOVERALL: 3.5/5 Stars (To compare : I would give the first Bioshock  a 4.5/5)\n\n\nInitial Impression (Right after the Game):\n\nAmazing Story and Atmosphere.

The story is unnecessarily convoluted and gave me feels in an intrusive way that left me feeling violated. Some areas must be backtracked through 2 or even 3 times. Level design is lazy and makes the game feel cheap and arcade-like. Overall the game is far too easy, and the difficulty is increased late-game by throwing more enemies at you with more health - the definition of artificial difficulty. Maybe it's just me, but I don't enjoy listening to Elizabeth whining about her life while I backtrack to the next fight. Numerous unskippable interactive cutscenes do not belong in video games, and they absolutely destroy the pacing.

The only downside is that it's not as open as I would have wished for.\nThere is side missions, and stuff to look for and extra places to visit, but the game\nitself is pretty linear, so there is unfortunatly not much to explore of the city itself.\nThe side-missions, I do have a problem with. Most of them includes\nbacktracking, but the fustraiting part is that you don't really get a clear\nindicator of where you have to go, or where the side-mission is, there's\nno waypointer, or map location, you have to backtrack and blindly look for it.\n\nThe graphics in this game is good. It's very pretty in it's own style, Dx11 effects,\nit bears the Bioshock style, but it COULD, have maybe been a tad better on some\nareas, but still, the graphics are good.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, it has alot of action, and experimenting with all the different\n\"powers\" you find through out the game, few weapon choises, well,\ntechnically there are a fine number of weapons, but many of them are\n\"super\" versions of each other.\nThe skyrails brings with it some fun tactical advantages you can use during\nbattles, and combining it with weapons and your \"powers\", it's a fast phased\nfun gameplay.\n\nThe only complaint, is that when you die, you respawn, with\nhalf health and with the same ammo you had when you died, so if you died with\nno ammo, you'll respawn with little health and no ammo (or almost no ammo),\nbut the enemies you failed to kill before you died, will regain some health,\nso if you died because you ran out of ammo,\nyou will respawn close to where you died, with little\nhealth and no ammo, while the enemy has regained some health. So this brings\nup some fustraiting situations which at times might seem like a paradox and\nimpossible to progress through.\n\nThe story of Infinite...

I dropped everything to play this game because I was so into it. You acquire a companion in this game in the NPC, Elizabeth, whose face is beautifully rendered to tell stories that words simply can't. She feels very much like she is a part of this world and is a living, breathing character rather than an AI. Her implementation as a partner was extremely well done. The only possible negatives I can mention are the fact that, unlike the previous games, you can only carry 2 guns at a time which limits your combat choices and there are the occasional oddities like NPCs disappearing or the inability to interact with them, instead just listening in on conversations. These issues, though, are miniscule and should not deter anyone in the game. The PC port is very well done this time which is terrific.

It has to get on the track, wait for the train to gain speed, and stare it down, until the inevitable, either the train wrecks the game, or the game wrecks the train. BioShock Infinite is one of the few games that destroys the train, leaving nothing behind except lumps of metal and coal. 'What makes this game so great?' you ask, while I can't put it in good enough words to meet the praise that BioShock Infinite deserves, I will do my best. We will go through the list just like other games. Originality, story, and game play. Now for me the game is original in it's setting, it's in a amazing world, not too many games have done floating city (I don't think) and from what I can tell, this game did it right. While I never have beaten BioShock, I always got the feeling of being confined, trapped, and above all, alone (splicers don't count), this was an amazing combination for a city dystopia underwater. So what about when you're in the air, a place where you're the most free? Well, you need the exact opposite, you need to feel free, and you should feel like you're not alone (although this one might not be needed, I feel like it should be done), that you have people that you can count on. The later is done with the meeting of Elizabeth, your companion on the adventure ahead, she's more or less always with you, filling the gap that would be there if you were a one man death machine (don't worry, you still are), granted, she does nothing in combat (almost) but none the less, you have someone, she'll be there when you accidentally blow up that oil drum next to you, or when you thought that you could kill everyone with that pistol you've had since the beginning of the game, point is, she'll be there every time you die. Now for the freedom, many might disagree with me, but I say that Infinite did a good job on this, I'll discuss the story more later, but in the end you're on a one way road, but never have I felt that road be, ironically enough, open (As well as closed, if you play the game you'll know what I mean). I'll tie up combat mechanics and originality right here, sky hooks, and sky lines are an incredibly small and simple thing, but it does an incredible job on letting you move freely in the battle field. You're given so many small options that you don't really think they're a big deal, but in reality, they're one of the most important things. Do I get on a rail, and head for a vantage point to snipe my enemies? Or do i use the rail as a means to attack, or do you use your amazing vigors to set your enemies on fire while they're eaten alive by a murder? Or hey, why not do all three? The use of skylines and sky hooks allows you to even attack flying blimps that move around freely on the map, you jump onto them and you remember \"Hey! I'm thousands of feet high above the ground, let me throw you into the air, and shoot you off your boat!\". Or maybe I was the only cruel one? *Cough*. Anyways, the game did a good job on making me feel like I had choices, when in fact, I was going down the \"same\" road as everyone else. Which I think, did wonders for the final parts of the story. *I felt free, until the ending anyways* \n\"Yeah screw originality, how about story?\" The story is great, I likeed seeing the progression of Elizabeth and Booker throughout the story, but other than that I won't get into it because it's something that you've gotta experience yourself, but I will say this. The beginning of the game you feel free, unbound, the city is a utopia for you to blow things up in, but.. let's just say that you'll start to see the real colors of the city when you get into it. Red.\n\"Okay... what's the game play like?\" It's solid.\n\"... That's it?\" Do you need more than that? I liked it, I didn't feel like the weapons were as unique as BioShock's, but it's solid.\nWell anyways, I like the game, I recommend it, buy it, play it, love it, salivate it. \"What was that last one?\" JUST PLAY THE DAMN GAME BOOKER!\n10/10","timestamp_created":1370071183,"timestamp_updated":1370071183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2878199","author":{"steamid":"76561198013968967","num_games_owned":559,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1113,"last_played":1404116355},"language":"portuguese","review":"GotY 2013 do meu coração!

The series has been compared to the \"Gears of War\" franchise, but I think Irrational has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. \n\nAll in all, a great, great game; a personal favorite.\n","timestamp_created":1370048493,"timestamp_updated":1370048493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1803138","author":{"steamid":"76561197998202182","num_games_owned":305,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":1663,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1356,"last_played":1390102188},"language":"english","review":"It is INFINITE!","timestamp_created":1370041042,"timestamp_updated":1385407952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478723406791687012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1736809","author":{"steamid":"76561197997189766","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4015,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1622,"last_played":1542599996},"language":"english","review":"Excellent story and all around great game.","timestamp_created":1370035735,"timestamp_updated":1370035735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2831535","author":{"steamid":"76561198013276815","num_games_owned":527,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1083,"last_played":1441659025},"language":"english","review":"Good Game!!!","timestamp_created":1370021793,"timestamp_updated":1370021793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5071399","author":{"steamid":"76561198044756115","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1007,"last_played":1432758083},"language":"english","review":"Incredible story, voice-acting, and an immersive world are what this game has to offer.

The setting begs for an expanded open world but the game itself is disappointingly small in scope. Story is decent, at the time it came out it was widely praised. It  hasn't aged as well as the original Bioshock because of it's linear design and increased focus on gunplay instead of expanding the roleplaying and open world elements of Bioshock.
