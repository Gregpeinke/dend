The floating city of Columbia is an inverted plunge from Rapture and expands on the already heartbreaking story to make it even more...heartbreaking. When a game makes you want to cry after a huge metal parrot dies, you know there's some ingenious writing and imagery involved. Play this game and enjoy the experience, its so beautiful, stark and honest that its hard to explain how good it is. Just experience it. It's the only game I've ever played that upon finishing it, I closed it and played it from the beginning again straight away.","timestamp_created":1442853670,"timestamp_updated":1442853670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18133284","author":{"steamid":"76561198068897760","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":1417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":830,"last_played":1586942786},"language":"english","review":"Probably the most unique type of FPS I have played.

To be quite honest, I didn't liked that so much, especially because you never know what you're going to find ahead of you unless you've already played the game, so basically there're times when you need to basically rely on your luck or in your powers to supply this lack of anything.

In this respect it fell far short of its designers' reputation and abilities.\n\nA note on timing: I played this game in April 2015, two years after it was first released. I put it down for five months and returned to it in Sept. 2015 to see if the passage of time had given me any new insights. It has not, and Bioshock Infinite counts as one of the few games I've uninstalled from Steam.\n\n1. Weapon selection is limited. Or more specifically, you're limited to carrying around two weapons at any one time. This is still okay with the standard mooks, but the boss fights can be frustrating if you brought the wrong tools for the job.\n\n2. If mook fights are too easy (which I found they are), boss fights are too hard. It's sort of all right, because the game gives you a respawn auto option. This sort of compensates for the obligatory deaths from damage while you're still figuring out the level geometry. The Ghost boss battle was so hard it exhausted my cash (and thus my number of permitted respawns) resulting in a relatively rare Game Over. I never regained the momentum or interest to get past this boss.\n\n3. Level design merely appears to be open. In actuality, once you look beyond the open-air backdrops, the actual walkable areas are still linear. There's some gymnastic potential with some of the boss battles, but as I mentioned above, I found I was dying too often to really enjoy exploring them.\n\n4. The scope of philosophical inquiry in this game seemed much more subdued than SS2 or the BS1/2 games. Instead of thought-provoking questions about collectivism vs. individuality, Irrational Games gave us some alt-history, some speculative fiction, and a passing look at religious zealotry and a vague mystery of the holy uterus. This is probably unavoidable with the change in focus of the game - there are very few non-combat challenges in the game when you're not shooting or hurting something.\n\n5. After programming in hard-coded fanservice cleavage that literally follows you around the entire game, it struck me as a bit disingenuous of Irrational to scold its fans for making Rule 34 artwork. They were sort of asking for it.\n\nNot a terrible game, but not as inspiring as its predecessors. I'm not sure why. Irrational used to make great games.","timestamp_created":1442622031,"timestamp_updated":1442622031,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.436875790357589722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18090320","author":{"steamid":"76561197989810912","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1247,"last_played":1443935811},"language":"russian","review":"[h1] Если вы играли в предыдущие части, определенно берите, Bioshock Unfinite откроет вам новую историю, и даже напомнит о первых частях.

The first BioShock, an absolute masterpiece in gaming history, lead to extremely high expectations for Infinite following its announcement. While playing the first game isn't at all required understand Infinite's story, it is highly recommended to, just to see how far the series has come. With the story of BioShock being one of the most memorable experiences in recent gaming, Infinite had quite the challenge.\n\nThe year is 1912. You play as Booker DeWitt, Pinkerton, Wounded Knee veteran and now private investigator. You are told to \"Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt.\" Your goal is to rescue Elizabeth, a mysterious girl who has been imprisoned in the flying city of Columbia since childhood. And what a city it is. A city in the sky, Columbia is perhaps one of the most beautifully designed locations in gaming history. Boasting bright colours and an amazing art design, Columbia has the feeling of a living, breathing city. Unlike Rapture where society had already fallen, Columbia's citizens are living the dream. But under this facade, Columbia's dark ideology is exposed as the story progresses. It would be a disservice for me to spoil it in this review, it simply must be witnessed in the game.\n\nElizabeth is one of the games most prominent features, and for a very good reason. BioShock Infinite is the first game in the BioShock series where you are given a travelling companion. It is a very stark contrast to the solitary experiences of the previous two games, Rapture, city under the ocean and alone, Columbia, city in the sky, accompanied by Elizabeth. Elizabeth is one of the most memorable characters in a video game I have ever experienced. \"Alive,\" would be how I would describe her. Voiced by the excellent Courtnee Draper, Elizabeth feels like a genuine human being, not just a bunch of pixels with a voice. You just can't help but care for her. The dynamic and relationship between you and Elizabeth is one Infinite's most strongest features, a game that pulls you in and feel for a person. All of the voice cast give stellar performances, and is one of the games strongest features alongside its story. Again, BioShock Infinite's story must be experienced, not read in a review.\n\nLike the previous BioShock games, much of Infinite's atmosphere and backstory is added to by the numerous voxaphones found throughout the game. All of these contribute to the games overall story arch and characters, and help to develop a sense of how the city of Columbia operates, and the lives of its citizens. The voxaphones are essential to learning many characters backstories and motives, so be sure to listen to them all.\n\nThe gameplay is often one of Infinite's most criticized aspects. Like the previous BioShock's, Infinite is a first person shooter with some light RPG and exploration elements intertwined. While the gameplay never feels \"bad\" in a sense, it is certainly not as polished as you would expect for a game of this caliber. The BioShock series never had exceptionally great gameplay, it was passable, but first and foremost was always the story and the atmosphere. While personally the gameplay never felt like it detracted from the amazing experience Infinite was for me, there are occasional times where there is a certain ludonarrative dissonance. Overall the shooting mechanics and gameplay are passable, not the worlds greatest shooter, but certainly not the worst.\n\nGarry Schyman returns again to compose Infinite's score, after scoring both BioShock and BioShock 2, and what a soundtrack it is. The score is quite diverse and hits all the right elements, the chaotic combat throughout Columbia, the joyful dance scene at Battleship Bay, Elizabeth's theme song and of course the emotional scenes throughout the game. The licensed music is also fantastically selected, \"God Only Knows\" and \"Can the Circle be Unbroken\" both subtly hinting at the games themes. \n\nWorthy to note are the 3 significant pieces of DLC. Clash in the Clouds is an arena spectacle, with many challenges to offer as you battle through numerous waves of enemies. You are able to unlock concept art, production videos and character models as you further progress depending on your performance. It is the weakest piece of DLC in the season pass and is entirely skippable, unless you enjoyed Infinite's combat. Burial at Sea Episode One and Two are the complete opposite. Returning to Rapture before its fall on the 31st of December 1958, you play once again as Booker with Elizabeth returning beside you. You once again must find a girl, this time Sally as the impending fall of Rapture awaits. Combined, both these DLC's take around 8-10 hours total to complete, quite a significant length. While Infinite didn't require the first BioShock game to be understood, Burial at Sea certainly does so make sure to play the first BioShock game before playing Burial at Sea.\n\nBioShock Infinite is an absolute masterpiece and will almost certainly be remembered throughout gaming history as one of the greatest stories ever told in a game. The story, the characters, the voice acting, the music, the art design, the sound design, all of it is masterfully put together by Irrational Games' in what was their last game as a studio. Infinite is not just a game, it is an experience that must be played.","timestamp_created":1442409115,"timestamp_updated":1442468383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52446979284286499","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18056082","author":{"steamid":"76561198189176697","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":834,"last_played":1527274335},"language":"turkish","review":"DİKKAT! ilk oyunu oynamadan buna başlamayın mala bağlarsınız.Bu oyun hikye oyunu fps istiyosanız gidin CS:GO alıp ta ta ta yapın veya oynanışada gelmeyin hikaye için gelin arkadaş hikaye!Almayanlar alsın bunu dyan duymayana aldırsın böylece grafik görsün herkes","timestamp_created":1442405263,"timestamp_updated":1442405263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18055832","author":{"steamid":"76561198071375013","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1493501814},"language":"german","review":"BioShock Infinite ist der dritte teil der Bioshock reihe. \n\nZuerst fange ich mit den Technischen daten mal an, Die Grafik hat sich sehr Positiv verändert zu Teil 1&2. Es gibt im Infinite sehr krasse Location´s wo man einfach mal kurtz still steht und die umgebung betrachtet oder einfach ein Screenshot zu machen. Es ist gut optimirt das ich \"Keine laggs\" hatte. Die Musik o. Melodie im hintergrund passt ebenfalls supper ins Spiel sodass wen mal action angesagt ist das es sich anpasst.\n\nWas ich sehr Positiv finde ist das das Spiel prinzip immer noch dasselbe ist wie zuvor bei Teil 1&2. D.h es ist sogesehen ein Openworld wo man den gebit sichert ( Gegner töten ) und danach kann man sich schön in ruhe erkundigen was man findet und wen man zum nächsten kapitel möchte wird man noch sicherheits halber gefragt sind sie sich sicher etc. da man ja immer noch etwas übersehen könnte. Es gibt ein paar kleine veränderungen obs Positiv oder Negativ ist muss jeder für sich entscheiden. Es gibt kleidungsstücke die man finden kan und sich überziehen kan damit man gewisse Boni´s hat wie. z.B Kritsche treffer, Leben o. Salz regeneriert sich mit der zeit uvm. was ich sehr Positiv finde da man sein Carakter etwas Indivituel bestatten kann. Dann gibt es noch ( Ich nenn es Flaschen ) in 3 Farben Rot,Gelb und Blau die kann man genau wie die Kleidungsstücke überall finden und wen man mal eins gefunden ist kann man sich entscheiden ob man etwas mehr Leben,Salz oder Schild möchte. Was ich etwas \"Doof\" finde ist dass man keine Medikit´s oder Salze deponieren kann sprich ein paar mitnehmen, wobei ich sagen muss dass es nicht unbeding nötig war da die \"bunten Flaschen\" es wieder wett machen. Diesesmal spielt die Kampange wo anders als wie im Teil 1&2 Culambia nennt sich die Statt und sie ist im [spoiler] Himmel [/spoiler]. \n\nIm großen und ganzen war ich \"Sehr\" Positiv überascht dass der 3te teil so gut ist. aufjedenfall ein MUSS! für alle BioShock fan´s. Die DLC`s kann ich euch auch sehr empfehlen da es nochmal eine Kampange/Geschichte gibt alerdings spielt man es nicht mit Booker sondern eine andere Person lasst euch überaschen, Dann gibt es noch diverse Missions/Überlebungs kamp. \n\nEmpfehle ich dieses Spiel? \"Natürlich\" kauft es euch und ihr wird nicht entäuscht werden. am besten wäre es wenn ihr bei einem Bündel zuschnappt.

I was starting to get sick of Rapture and am glad this game has a different setting.\n\nThe game gives the illusion of a vast expansive sky city, it does not have the stuffy claustrophobic feel of the underwater city Rapture. In Columbia you just want to soar and swoop at every chance you can. Though it does make my stomach churn at times using a sky rail is almost like riding a roller coaster.\n\nElizabeth is an interesting character though at first she reminded me a lot of a Disney princess, the way she moves, expressions in an over exagerated disney princess way, she's almost a rip off of Belle from Beauty and the Beast in how she looks, she has same hairstyle, big over large eyes.\n\nYou have a variety of ways to kill enemies you can ask elizabeth to open a tear so you can have more cover, a hook for swinging off, medical kits, guns, turrets, though that is limited as you can only have 1 tear open and active at a time.\n\nBut the game is not without frustration.\n\nYou can only carry 2 guns at a time which is very limiting, though you can swap 1 gun you are carrying for a gun that's on the ground, you can never carry more than 2 at a time.\n\nVigors are often the most fun and versatile ways to kill which are the replacement for plasmids but are much more limited in their use as you can't carry salts on you, you seem to run out of salts way too quickly though  (salts are the blue energy metre simular to eve) to replenish salts you have to find some sort of drink or a bottle of salts. Usually there are salts nearby or Elizabeth will find and toss you some.\n\nYou can't carry first aid kits either but you have a energy shield which is better, you don't lose health unless your shield is fully depleted and if that happens you can just hide till it replenishes.\n\nBut even so I found the battles more fast paced and enjoyable than the previous Bioshocks.\n\nI dislike most  that there is only auto save and you can't save your game when you want. I wanted to stop playing but it said my last auto save was 10 minutes ago, so had to keep playing for 10 more minutes to get the next checkpoint. It makes it so I have to replay again if I just want to quit playing. The most annoying thing about the game. I had to leave the game running when I wanted a break as my last checkpoint save was half an hour ago, auto saves should be at least every 10 minutes.\n\nThere is no hacking, I miss that.\nThe only thing that is a tiny bit like it is that Elizabeth can pick locks for you, but there is no mini game associated with it.\n\nTo sumarise it overall the game is better in some ways than the other Bioshocks but also worse in other aspects.\n\nThe story overall is rather freaky, tragic and messes with your head, I did a lot of reading about it to understand the story fully. But I better not say anything else as I don't want to spoil it for those who have not played and completed the game.\n\nMostly though it feels enjoyable, fun, scary in some ways and exciting. Though unlike others I would not got so far as to say it's one of the best games I've played. Almost would rate it an 8, but there is too many negatives that the game should not have, it does not deserve more than 7/10.","timestamp_created":1442369109,"timestamp_updated":1442369174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593706846237182617","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18048884","author":{"steamid":"76561198125325921","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1168,"last_played":1576117374},"language":"english","review":"I've only played Biochock Infinite, and, apart from the story becoming slightly confusing simply by it's nature, I understood everything perfecty well.

That God awful game called Bioshock 2 does not count.) The thing that caught my attention immediately was the atmosphere and look of Infinite. It was an alien to the series, not just because it wasn't under water anymore but with the colors, the atmosphere and THE COLORS. The city of Rapture had a feeling of isolation and despair to its world. It had the colors of a dying rainbow, dont get me wrong I loved that about it. I thought that was a key feature for the series, but I was wrong. Columbia was a \"happier\" place to be in. It was bright, colorful and the old American feel to it was outstanding as well. Columbia was just a better world to roam around than Rapture. Because it has that open feel to it that the tubes of Rapture failed to  give, thus I found myself covering every inch of the world. A big factor I noticed in Infinite Vigors (Plasmids in the old Bioshock) was not an actual highlight to the story. There is no build up to it you just literally pick it up and drink it. That was an odd thing for me. Enough about the world time for the characters.\n\n\nBioshock Infinte produced a handful of memorable character compared to the first one. Your character Booker Dewitt actually talks often so it just gives him more character than just another generic piece of meat that you control. He is \nfurther highlighted by his sidekick whom I think is the star of the game. Elizabeth the girl nextdoor type or rather the girl next to a cage(I laughed at my joke more than I should.). She's smart and has a lovely feel. It's an odd feeling to see someone so happy in a game that you actually feel happy for them. Play the game and you'll know what I mean. Sadly her character development was altered faster than expected maybe it was because of the things that happening in the story. I hoped for more dialogue between Dewitt and Elizabeth because it was charming and funny how they spoke to each other. The Lutece siblings were terrific. They added a depth to the pool of characters in the game. Maybe because they were british? \n\nA game is only as good as its gameplay and Infinite's gameplay is what won me over. The added sky line feature was a major touch to it. It just adds that momentum feel to it, rather than just running around, it different I can tell you that. The Vigors available in the game worked perfectly together and was fun to think of new combos that would destroy your enemies. Weapons were abundant but I just used 3-4. There is no more hacking in the game which for was a good thing. I was never really a fan of that. Now you just have to find lockpicks for Elizabeth to use. Oh and Elizabeth is an amazing sidekick. she is actually useful. The game is now a \"loot fest\" as you can pick up a lot of things for your health, vigor and ammo. You dont have health kits anymore you need to pick up a lot of things to regenerate your health(Which I like). The enemies are'nt that memorable because they're just normal people so you'll probably miss the good old splicers. \nIt's still a solid FPS game. \n\nMy finaly Verdict is that Bioshock is a soild 9/10 game. Now I say 8 because the story is an odd one. Not that I dont get it I played the game twice just to see that I actually got it being that Im an idiot. Sadly it feels that it tried so hard to shove the story down your throat. The last 25 minutes of the game is where all of it actually makes sense rather than just spread the story through out the game so that player would slowly \"decode\" it and form their own theories as they are playing the game so that the plot twist would have been a bigger shocker. Saddly it was not as good as the first Bioshock. It had way to much sub-plots that makes you lose sight of the main story. A shame really, if only the plots intertwined as good as I hoped them to be. non the less its a good game I recommend you buying it. Just wait for sales though I noticed that this game is almost free when it goes on sale so keep that in mind. or just buy the trilogy the down side is you'll get Bioshock 2. \n\n(Sorry for some of my grammar this is my first review and English is not my mother tounge.)","timestamp_created":1442304585,"timestamp_updated":1442304585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546056210994720459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18040304","author":{"steamid":"76561198094527951","num_games_owned":239,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":604,"last_played":1442296202},"language":"russian","review":"Это Щедевр!!!\nСамая Лучшая Концовка всей истории игроиндустрии","timestamp_created":1442300700,"timestamp_updated":1442300700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18037565","author":{"steamid":"76561198081517756","num_games_owned":497,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":6071,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3908,"last_played":1480265646},"language":"english","review":"This is a personal favorite of mine and, possibly, the game that I enjoyed the most during 2013.

The opening sequence felt very familiar: There's the lighthouse, there's the minimalist 'hook' to get you into the game, but looking around at the waves, listening to the 3d sound, and listening to the banter of my 'ferrymen' just dragged me into the screen.   Climbing up the stairs to the lighthouse, there was  sense of inevitability about what was to happen.  I have to admit the Close Encounters reference made me chuckle, though.   Upon 'arriving', I have to admit, my jaw dropped.   The surround-sound rendition of the wind, with the city floating away in the distance was just mesmerizing.   It's a wee shame that my graphics card (although pretty nice) wasn't quite up to the FSAA/AF at full res, so I had to exit out and start over at a lower res (1600x900).    After this little atmosphere-breaker, I was back in the game, and wandering beautiful 1920s streets, passing people having little conversations, listening to the birds, seeing the sights.  I did feel a little bit hemmed-in: I got a nasty feeling that the game was going to be very linear!\n\nThe opening sequence unfolded, and I got a good taste for all the possibilities that Columbia held for me.  It was a lovely intro to the game, and served to set all the pieces on the board without being too obvious.  I enjoyed the little balloon parade, but I was still left with a vague unease about the scale of things... Balloons to hold people should have been bigger!   But, of course the true nature of Columbia's little not-falling-trick wasn't to be revealed till later.  Once again, I plodded along, enjoying the scenery and the funfair, which again introduced another interesting aspect of the game, and the one where I began to see the parallels with Bioshock 1.\n\nI was beginning to wonder what the hell the people in Columbia did?  I watched a parade for a special day, but there were probably a dozen people, despite the huge buildings.  where was everyone else?   And why were they so damned careless with their money? I'd only been playing 20 minutes and already made about 100 quid.  If I walked the streets of Newcastle and searched every bin for a month, I probably wouldn't get a single pound coin!  In fact, my disbelief grew as I became richer and richer by simply rattling binlids.  \n\nBy the time the game started proper, I was already able to buy my first upgrade, and had the movement system sorted out.   The game played gorgeously.  The plot was twistier than a twisty turny thing, and as the game progressed, the subtle degredation in the scenery was luscious.  I have to admit, Elizabeth was the most multidimensional NPC I've seen in a game in a long long time, if ever.    Finally someone who could look after themselves, and actually HELPED!   When she started flipping me coins, and pointing out things I'd missed, I realised that she was a very valuable asset.  Pinned down in a firefight, she was tossing me ammo, guns, health, and keeping me well stocked. \n\nAs the game progressed, I started putting the pieces together, but it wasn't until that final, confusing, bizarre ending that things really clicked into place.   And what an ending!   I have to admit that drawing all the lines out on paper, the game gets itself into one helluva pickle.   The ending breaks the \"rules\" of \"reliving your past\".   Plus, the trips in time seem to break the parallel worlds rules the game sets out.. But meh, persnicketty nitpicking aside, I finished the game in awe.  \n\nThe guys who wrote this, did the level design, and the character AI/movement/facials are true masters.   I look forward to another Bioshock, but I hope that it'll be a little less linear than the first three. The ability to visit other places, and do things in a different order would be nice.   \n\nHowever, since they've done underwater, and in the clouds, that leaves only one place left: Space.  And that's where System Shock started it all off, so the only thing left is to make System Shock 3 :)","timestamp_created":1442169163,"timestamp_updated":1442169163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18019421","author":{"steamid":"76561198007261333","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":671,"last_played":1441788337},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I've ever played. Great story, nice graphics and thrilling gameplay.\nA bit more of a FPS than the previous Bioshocks and more action based.\n\nA must buy!","timestamp_created":1442166744,"timestamp_updated":1442166744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvMT1488CfcXeRA=="}
