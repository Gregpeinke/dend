For the people who don't know, Half-Life was the first game that Valve has ever released. The game started the success of Valve that resulted in many game classics and Steam (on which you are now reading this review). \n\nHalf-Life itself is a first person shooter. The big difference between Half-Life and other first person shooters is that instead of just shooting, it also has exploration parts through puzzles and platforming. What I really liked is that nothing in the game takes the control away from the player. You go through the entire game and choose what to do by yourself at any given moment. The game doesn't have cutscenes and the story is experienced through gameplay and dialogue. But you can also just walk past all the characters in the story and just continue. I really appreciated this, because if you die you don't have to listen to what you already know. That makes following the story optional, even though there is only a little bit of story given which is basically just: You work at a research lab and everything went wrong. Try to escape. Many parts of the story are mysteries  you just have to figure out by yourself throughout the game. I only got annoyed once due to a scientist explaining what was already shown to me through gameplay. \n\nThe first experience of playing Half-Life felt a little bit boring. The loading for areas was really annoying, and I thought the game didn't look all that well. After a while though I got into it, and I didn't stop. Thanks to this game, I have a new insane record of non-stop playing without leaving my chair for 13.2 hours, until I completed the game. I guess that also has to do with the fact that it was my first day of my vacation, and hadn't played a game for a long while.\nWhat makes the game so much fun is that you feel so free because nothing is told and you have to figure everything out by yourself through gameplay, which is really satisfying. I never really got stuck for a long while, because everything you find in a room has a reason to be there. \n\nThe shooting is also fun and gets even more fun over time. The only problem I had, which might just be a personal issue, is that I think the weapons were not very well balanced. For instance, I wish the shotgun did more damage to make it an instant-kill up close. What I also liked is that in the game there are enough exploration parts and different roads to take, which resulted in me knowing  I haven't seen everything yet.\n\nAfter I finished Half-Life I found out that Valve has updated this original version of Half-Life with better textures, sound and other stuff so that explains why it is easier to look at the old things after a while and be amazed by what Half-Life really is.  \n\nIn conclusion, I can say that I still recommend playing this updated version of the original Half-Life. What makes Half-Life special is the variety of shooting, puzzle solving and platforming and the lack of hand holding throughout the story and the entire game itself. Playing through Half-Life can make you think about whether we took more steps backwards than forwards with the games nowadays. \n\nP.S.\nI will be going through the whole Half-Life series. \nHere I will put links to my other Half-Life game reviews:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/50/]Half-Life: Opposing Force[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/130/]Half-Life: Blue Shift[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/220/]Half-Life 2[/url]\n\nInteresting to share:\nThe add-on Half-Life: decay ( originally for the ps2 ) is now playable as a Half-Life mod. \nDownloadable here at: [url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-decay/downloads/half-life-decay]moddb[/url] I played it and I have to say it is pretty descent in co-op.","timestamp_created":1468274820,"timestamp_updated":1470397759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.763539016246795654","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24262288","author":{"steamid":"76561198055329858","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1711,"last_played":1470961463},"language":"english","review":"A game so nice I played it thrice.\n\nλ/10","timestamp_created":1468273020,"timestamp_updated":1511822121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549444139003753662","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24262215","author":{"steamid":"76561198120523705","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1199,"last_played":1503180305},"language":"english","review":"Great graphics","timestamp_created":1468272769,"timestamp_updated":1468272769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24259351","author":{"steamid":"76561198285731185","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1467631544},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра!

The price is right, the game is entertaining, and the series of more recent games (Half-Life 2) it leads into are incredible, historicaly, gameplay-wise, and story-wise. Worth your money; you'll enjoy it. \n\nIn a little more detail: I played Half-Life first, around 2 years ago and I've since logged about a hundred hours in the game. I've played through it 9 or 10 times. I had been needing something new to play after finishing Portal 2 and Half-Life was on sale. I asked a friend if I should play it and he said no - that it was boring, but the price was so good I bought it and tried it anyways, and I was immediately hooked. I've since bought the game for several friends, and it's the first title I bring up to anyone asking for a game reccomendation. \n\nHalf-Life is an old game. I'm not going to pretend that I would be thrilled with this game if it had come out yesterday. If I bought this game in 2016, let's face it, I'd want a refund. The graphics are extremely dated, the movement is a little tough to get used to, and the AI is seriously lacking. Gabe Newell would be getting an angry email. \n\nIn 1998, when it was released however, Half-Life was a revolutionary game, with unique and new methods of story telling, exciting new mechanics, and realistic AI. The ability to jump was still a relatively cool new development in the gaming world, and the ability to crouch-jump was very new. Half-Life has a large variety of interesting weapons, and the enemies move and interact with the player in advanced ways for a 90's game. Enemies will follow you, take cover, switch between different types of attacks, call in other enemies, and more. The puzzles in Half-Life are what 90's gamers would have wanted. While jumping puzzles nowadays are lazy and annoying, they were popular in the 90's in the FPS genre, because being able to jump at all was still somwehat of a novelty. The chapter \"On A Rail\" is my LEAST favourite chapter, and annoys the hell out of me, but like the Ravenholm chapter in Half-Life 2, it would have been an exciting way for gamers to test out a fun new game mechanic. The story is told entirely through Gordon's eyes, which creates a level of immersion that had never been seen before in the FPS genre, and that still holds up today. Even despite dated graphics, I still found myself deeply engrossed in the game's world. Half-Life was one of the (if not the) first FPS game to be highly story-oriented. Prior to Half-Life, the FPS genre was not usually chosen for story telling. Valve took the FPS genre to the next level by creating a game that is dynamic in BOTH gameplay, and story. My apologies if that paragraph was a little messy; I have a lot of thoughts. \n\nNow I hear you, it's not 1998 anymore, so whether or not Half-Life was a good game THEN is only part of the story. Half-Life can be a revolutionary game-changing (no pun intended) game and still suck to play today, and the reviews section is supposed to give you some idea of whether or not you actually want to spend money on this game and play it. \n\nHalf-Life is worth a play, 18 years after it's release, in 2016, and it's worth paying your ten dollars to get to do that, in my humble opinion. People dont play games out of context. When I bought and played Half-Life the first time, I bought it to enjoy a classic game. If you expect to play a game with the same graphics quality as Portal 2 then you'll be dissapointed. If you expect to play Half-Life as it is (an 18 year old story-rich FPS) you will be blown away. Half-Life shattered my expectations for what an 18 year old game could be. Don't pretend the game is something it's not. \n\nIf you're alright with playing an old game, Half-Life will not dissapoint. While some aspects of the game are dated, the core principles (weaponry, characters, story, and gameplay) stand up to time beautifully and the parts that do not (some puzzles, designs of some rooms and levels) do not take away from the over-all experience, and are still fun. \n\nHalf-Life is fun, stands the test of time where it needs to, bears a great deal of gaming-history, and is the opening installment of one of the most (in my opinion) great game series of all time. For anyone who actually read this far: remember when there were rumours that Half-Life 3 would be released in February 2015? That was funny.","timestamp_created":1467784681,"timestamp_updated":1467784694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514893651008605957","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24121186","author":{"steamid":"76561198152522109","num_games_owned":770,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":768,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":583,"last_played":1524727063},"language":"english","review":"I swimmed through a sewer that probably had garbage and dirty water\nShawshank Redemption Simulator 10/10","timestamp_created":1467760344,"timestamp_updated":1467760344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24120437","author":{"steamid":"76561198050434540","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":578,"last_played":1449155707},"language":"english","review":"One of the classics.

The last parts before Xen have you doing these mini mazes to turn on reactors and it wears down your patience.\n\nThe first half is really enjoyable though, watching everything go to sh*t as you unleash the alien hordes on the Black Mesa research facility, and then later having to also fight through the army/marines sent to kill all of you scientists for some reason.

Nonostante i già citati difetti è comunque dotato di un gameplay godibilissimo (anche se non vario quanto il suo successore), di una storia che per quanto risulti a tratti confusionaria e solo apparentemente semplice risulta comunque affascinante e con un sacco di ottimi spunti. L'ho completato in circa 9 ore, la longevità si attira intorno a questa cifra ma può variare a seconda del tempo che dedicherete all'esplorazione degli ambienti (comunque non chissà quanto gremiti di bonus o oggetti d'interesse, anzi) e ai minuti che perderete a causa dei vari game-over. A questo proposito, per chiudere la recensione, approfondisco la difficoltà: ho giocato Half-Life interamente a difficoltà \"normale\" ma ho sempre avuto addosso una costante tensione. I nemici, per quanto deboli se presi singolarmente, sono letali in gruppo e in più di un'occasione si dimostrano estremamente intelligenti. Inoltre, molto più che confrontarsi con i vari nemici, è spesso abbastanza difficile comprendere con chiarezza dove dirigersi per passare alla prossima fase in un dato capitolo (più di una volta, mio malgrado, ho dovuto fare affidamento su guide online, tanto ero frustrato). Questo e altri piccoli difetti (che comunque andranno valutati soggettivamente, qualcuno potrebbe avanzare tranquillamente senza aiuti laddove io ho \"fallito\", ad esempio) sommati fra loro non intaccano comunque la qualità di questo gioiellino che prima ancora di essere una rivoluzione in ambito videoludico si tratta, senza troppi giri di parole, di un ottimo gioco.","timestamp_created":1467731515,"timestamp_updated":1467731515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24110487","author":{"steamid":"76561198128799894","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":23657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12102,"last_played":1589426225},"language":"english","review":"crowbar guy vs the world","timestamp_created":1467728927,"timestamp_updated":1653166190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24109784","author":{"steamid":"76561198118191293","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":126,"last_played":1541870402},"language":"german","review":"Half Life: Ein klassiker, erschien vor 18 Jahren und ich besitze es seit ca 2 Jahren und kam nie dazu es zu spielen.
