Half-Life is one of my favourite games of all time. It's an excellent fps that does a fantastic job taking the player into it's world with a great selection of weapons, monsters and an overall outstanding atmosphere. It has aged quite ungracefully interms of graphics as the game was released way back in 1998 but the ai, music, atmosphere and gameplay still hold up very well. If you want to experience a fun, scary and action packed fps play this game! If I had any problems with it (not even things I find to be too much of a problem as I am a fanboy of this game) it would be that it may not always be clear to new players what exactly they should be doing in the story or overall goal. Alot of the more in depth stuff you will only find by searching up wikis about the story. It doesn't bother me but I can imagine it being confusing to newer players. It's told in a much more subtle fashion than some players might expect.\n\nThis game also has a huge libary of mods and addons. Games like conterstrike, day of defeat, team fortress and others wouldn't exist today if it wasn't for this game. Developers are still creating mods for this 18 year old game which I find amazing. \n\nBTW if you're gonna play this game, play it in the dark alone. Half-Life is more of an experience than a game you play with your friends although it does have multiplayer in the form of deathmatch (and other mods such as sven coop) I find the best way of playing it and enjoying it a first time is to play alone.\n\nlol this game is 20 years old now...","timestamp_created":1475034225,"timestamp_updated":1542855364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25731603","author":{"steamid":"76561198121651355","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":953,"last_played":1473627331},"language":"english","review":"This is the exception to my run of bad luck with other valve titles.

The game has been showered with such praise and acclaim since it's inception, even in the modern day. While many people would be ready to just write it off as people looking at it through 'nostalgia goggles', it's really important to go back and look at what makes it such a masterpiece.\n\nHalf-Life begins in a way that no other shooter at the time had done. Instead of leading off with a mission briefing before throwing you into a room full of demons, or showing you a cutscene to serve as exposition, the game immediately puts you in the shoes of Dr. Gordon Freeman on his fated tram ride as he is late to work. Your control of Freeman is, well, free, and you're free to move about the tram and examine the surroundings of your tram. You, the player, help Freeman get into his HEV Suit, greet his colleagues, and push a specimen of crystal into a large machine which promptly wrecks the facility of Black Mesa. Gordon, with your aid, sets out on an epic quest to escape his workplace, fighting off freakish aliens and later on soldiers who are sent in to perform a cover-up operation. Only in one instance is direct control ever taken away from you and even then you see the event unfold through Freeman's eyes. Story isn't told to you via exposition, but rather by carefully placed scripted events and NPC's you can encounter who inform you of where to go next.\n\nHalf-Life's story, or rather the way it tells it's story still manages to be as immersive as it was when I first played it, way back in 2009. Gordon isn't some lunkheaded badass space marine who rips and tears the guts of his enemies but rather a normal person who just happens to be donning a powerful suit of experimental armor that prevents him from the same type of swift deaths that his co-workers are so subjected to. Black Mesa isn't a laid out level filled with awkward enemy traps that forces you to run around looking for arbitrary keycards to progress but rather a research facility that feels real and legitimate to go through, and it's still one of the most believable enviroments in a shooter today. The way the enemies interact with their environment makes them feel like actual living beings.\n\nOf course, all of this wouldn't be anywhere near as good if the gameplay wasn't there as well. Thankfully, the combat in Half-Life is as visceral as other FPS games of it's time, featuring a wide array of weapons with meaty sound effects. Gordon's first weapon is his Iconic crowbar, which you wont be using so much as a weapon later on and more of as a 'hand' so to speak, it'll be the weapon you use to smash apart the environment to see what is and what isn't breakable, or to smash open a crate to gain supplies. Your ranged arsenal is very diverse, featuring basic weapons like a Submachine Gun, a Shotgun, and a Revolver to the Tau cannon, something akin to a wind up rail gun from quake, to a tranqulizer dart crossbow that you'll primarily be using to fight off underwater and aerial threats.\n\nThe weapons themselves are great but what makes them so fun to use is the fact that the enemies are just as diverse and require different strategies to take down. Something like a headcrab should be killed with the crowbar or the glock so as to not waste ammo, but faster, stronger moving targets like the HECU marines will be more easily dispatched with weapons like the MP5 or the Spas-12. You'll even come accross a giant hulking alien which is imperveous to all types of damage except for explosions. The sound designs on all the enemies is spot on, with the HECU sounding suitably intimidating over the radio comms, or the eerie roars of the Gargantua. \n\nThis already solid gameplay is also helped by various other factors, like level design. I already mentioned that Black Mesa feels like a real place, and so the Level Design is often in close quarters, with enemies often hiding around corners and enemies like the HECU marines will take advantage of the various routes they can take to flank you, just as you are able to do the same. The game also features in my opinion one of the best VGM soundtracks out there, with songs like \"Diabolical Adrenaline Guitar\", \"Nuclear Mission Jam\", and the Credits theme standing out as some of my favorites in particular. When the soundtrack wants you to feel like a badass, it will, and when it wants to be atmospheric, it will. Valve's sound team was absolutely on point here, as the game and it's various sound effects, quotes and music all feel spot on.\n\nHalf-Life isn't without a few flaws here and there though.  The game slows down towards the middle, with two chapters On a Rail and Residue Processing feeling a little tedious to play through, and with the final levels of Xen outside of the final boss being incredibly annoying and un-fun to play through. It seems like there was some pact between FPS devs of the time to make the final levels of their games to be as stupid as possible, but even then I really don't think these are enough to truly hurt the game. Half-Life is remembered so fondly not just because of itself as a game, but also the way it revolutionized the Genre. So many other FPS games tried to follow in it's wake, and it still remains one of the most influential FPS games of all time.\n\nHalf-Life is without a doubt one of my personal favorite games of all time, as well in my opinion being worthy of being called one of the best games of all time. Half-Life is a game that combines an unbroken narrative with kick-ass gameplay, strong and realistic level design with a rockin' soundtrack to create one of the most celebrated games ever created. I didn't even touch upon the huge collection of high-quality free mods available for the game, but they absolutely exist. They Hunger, Afraid of Monsters and Poke646 stand out as some of my favorite mods for any game. Half-Life is absolutely worth your time and money, and you owe it to yourself to play it if you consider yourself a video game enthusiast.","timestamp_created":1475005923,"timestamp_updated":1475005923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25727768","author":{"steamid":"76561198080818915","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":677,"last_played":1658578461},"language":"russian","review":"Раньше, когда игровая индустрия только развивалась, люди пытались сделать что-то хорошее, шикарное; делали все только для развитие индустрии, не из-за корыстных побуждений; каждая игра создавалась с душой, не просто было их делать, это большой труд.

Whereas Doom is no doubt the classic staple of the First-Person Shooter genre (see my in-depth review), this is in may ways a vastly superior experience in terms of rich, engaging, and seemless storytelling.  Both games follow a similar plot: Our protagonist is an agent of a Goverment-funded research facility doing things they should not be doing; something goes awry; all Hell breaks loose; fighting to survive we get transported to a different dimension; beat the big baddie; and save the universe.. for now... \n\nHowever, Doom is a collection of loosely interrelated levels ultimately culminating in a story arc showcasing our doomed (haha, get it?!) space marine's descent into the bowels of Hell, highlighted by expository text at the end of each episode, Half-Life is a fluid and constant narrative one experiences through the eyes of the protagonist - generally free of immersion-breaking cut scenes - no #@%&ing QTE's here! - sequences requiring the player to react play out in real time.  There's no level-end screens, but rather chapter titles appearing on screen as you progress through the different areas, letting the player know they are on the right track.  All part of the cohesive storytelling that keeps the player engaged right to the end.\n\nThe gameplay can be challenging, and at times, unforgiving.  The difficulty curve ramps up nicely as the player aqcuire better weapons, but ammunition can be sarce at times, which adds a good balance to the game. The visuals and voice acting are decent given the times, but the script is solid. \n\n All in all: Great game. 2/3 ;)","timestamp_created":1474951196,"timestamp_updated":1474951251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25706396","author":{"steamid":"76561198210431817","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":973,"last_played":1516930881},"language":"english","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this epic game that has withstood the test time.","timestamp_created":1474876086,"timestamp_updated":1474876086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25705952","author":{"steamid":"76561198037347067","num_games_owned":387,"num_reviews":205,"playtime_forever":3860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2527,"last_played":1649768080},"language":"english","review":"[b]Intro[/b]\nI don't like using the words 'overrated' and 'underrated', but I'm going to be hypocritical here and call this game, by FAR, the MOST OVERRATED game I've EVER played.

What story? Oh, you mean how there's occassional dialogue given by NPC's (that is, if it doesn't cut short for no reason) every once in a while? Come on, there's hardly a story other than an experiment went wrong, aliens invaded, then marines were sent to kill everyone involved with the project. Now, escape! Riveting stuff..\n-+Gordon Freeman is mute and has very backstory. Not sure how a boring scientist can take on hundreds of highly trained marines either, as well as massive aliens.\n+-Multiplayer is average\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n-Short game\n-Movement SUCKS. It feels like I'm roller skating and jump crouching as well as the air control movement feels off\n-A good few weapons are straight up useless\n-Some enemy types, especially towards the end, are REALLY not fun to fight\n-Game is often praised for its atmosphere, but to me it's like a cheesy B-movie. All atmosphere is lost when dialogue is always cut short and when I see a scientist jump through a window, running away from zombies only to greet me and say \"Greetings!\" over enthusiastically.\n-Field of view is awfully small and there's no slider\n-The 5 minute long tram ride is a slow, dull showcase of uninteresting environments and has zero interactivity, and neither does the 10 minute intro after\n-Hitboxes suck\n-Has really bad screen tearing, no matter the frame rate\n-Audio quality is poor\n-Horrible animations\n-No reason to play this again with no other game modes, a dead multiplayer community and no bots and a short campaign\n\n[b]The Horrible:[/b]\n--Level design is shoddy and often not a lot of fun to explore. It also makes no sense. Who puts meat grinders in a scientific research facility?\n--The Hard difficulty isn't fun since it just turns enemies into bullet sponges. Two direct shotgun blasts and a grenade should kill a bullsquid, as should two direct shotgun blasts to a marine's torso...\n--Game looks laughably bad, even in comparison to other poorer looking titles of the year\n--Game goes from too easy to too hard in the last few chapters. One of the worst difficulty spikes I've ever felt.\n--Gunplay is unsatisfying (besides headshots) and weapons feel dull. It's not awful, just very much below average.\n--Buggy beyond belief. I cannot think of a single other game that I can manage to glitch out irrepairably within the first 10 seconds of gameplay...

The game excels at both combat and ambiance.

The combat is also excellent, though the controls are a little loose by today’s standards. The game even does platforming and puzzling well. Overall, the game is a must-own for any FPS fan, and even one for those not as FPS-inclined.","timestamp_created":1474858303,"timestamp_updated":1474858303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25702843","author":{"steamid":"76561198088823168","num_games_owned":447,"num_reviews":224,"playtime_forever":1141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":475,"last_played":1561606928},"language":"english","review":"A scientist goes in search for workman's comp after an accident at work.","timestamp_created":1474850491,"timestamp_updated":1474850491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25702312","author":{"steamid":"76561198121776607","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":749,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":749,"last_played":1474846989},"language":"english","review":"beat the game already and this game is gold since 1998!  :)","timestamp_created":1474847296,"timestamp_updated":1474847296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25702163","author":{"steamid":"76561198125311038","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":5358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1657288562},"language":"brazilian","review":"[h1]O melhor jogo da minha vida[/h1]\nMeu pai me apresentou esse jogo quando eu era pequeno... Eu ganhei um CD original do jogo, a \"edição especial\", WON, que vinha com o incrível Team Fortress Classic. Tinha um menu badass, todo animado, lindo e nostálgico.\n\nMe perdia jogando Mods e partidas contra bots... Era simplesmente fantástico! Eu tinha que zerar pelo menos uma vez na semana pra completar a cota a outra metade da vida.\n\nO jogo é bem antigo, mas sem dúvidas continua sendo um clássico que qualquer amante de FPS em geral precisa jogar.\n\nEu não vou nem dar meus pontos negativos ou positivos, mas sim abordar cada coisa no geral.\n\n[h1]História do jogo[/h1]\nBasicamente: Tu é o Gordon Freeman, o f0daum mestre com qualquer arma. Você chega atrasado ao seu trabalho, algo de grande importância aconteceria nesse dia, e Gordon não podia perder tempo.\n\nVocê sai do trem, conversa com os personagens, pega seu H.E.V. e vai até o local de destino. Durante o percurso, Gordon percebe os perigos com a execução do teste nesse dia. Vários equipamentos danificados, máquinas sendo puxadas além do limite, a teoria de uma ressonância em cascata estava preocupando cada vez mais seus colegas de trabalho.\n\nComo um bom profissional, Gordon entra na câmara de testes, e aguarda as instruções. Durante o teste, os cientistas avisam sobre a sobrecarga dos equipamentos, e notam uma certa discrepância acontecendo com os equipamentos, mas decidem continuar.\n\nUm carrinho com um estranho cristal é entregue, e é dado a instrução para que empurre-o até os lasers do equipamento de testes. E não podia acontecer algo diferente... Uma tempestade de portais acontece ao redor de Black Mesa, e estranhas e agressivas criaturas começam a aparecer em todo os lugares, matando ou controlando qualquer humano encontrado ali.\n\nSeu novo objetivo é descobrir o que está acontecendo, encontrando vários de seus colegas mortos ou extremamente feridos ao seu redor. Confuso e com medo, Gordon continua sua jornada em busca de ajuda, e, consequentemente, de respostas, e dos culpados por isso tudo. \n\n[h1]O quão divertido é[/h1]\nO bom desse jogo é que você SEMPRE está no controle, sua sobrevivência depende apenas de você. Bom ou Mal? É sua escolha. Matar todos ou aproveitar de suas habilidades para continuar, é você quem decide. Matar ou morrer...\n\nMeu bom jovem, quando você conseguir a escopeta, sua vida estará completa. Pura matança frenética, com aquela trilha sonora tocando ao fundo, explosões pra tudo quanto é lado. O chato mesmo é ter que esperar o longo percurso de trem atéééé chegar ao objetivo atual.\n\nPossui vários ambientes diferentes: Laboratórios, túneis, tremzin subterrâneo, desertos, mundos alienígenas.\n\nVárias armas, desde o arsenal básico como pistolas, escopetas e metralhadoras, até os fantásticos gauss, crossbow, hornet, mas a melhor arma de todas: Snarks. Mortais, bonitinhos e perigosos, essas tralhas vão comer teu rabo.\n\nNamoral... Pular em um tanque e ficar dançando pra lá e pra cá, bugar as torres, pular em cima dos soldados com o crowbar, ficar só no bhop e passar varado pelos monstros, escalar tripmines, surfar em montanhas, desarmar minas, explodir helicópteros... Aliste-se na junta mais próxima, não perca tempo, soldado!\n\n[h1]Os incríveis Mods[/h1]\nEsse jogo tem muito mod, muito mod bom... Namoral, vá ao site MODDB por exemplo e pesquise mods como: Brutal Half-Life, POV, Sandpit, Sweet HL1... Mods incríveis, cada um com sua peculiaridade, e principalmente, divertidíssimos!!!\n\nSem dúvidas, a comunidade é que está mantendo o jogo vivo até hoje. Jogos como o Sven-Coop e Black Mesa estão fazendo um ótimo trabalho nesse quesito. Sério, pesquise por esses dois no Steam, não vai se arrepender...\n\n[i][b]Hora da mendigagem:[/b] Eu tenho alguns guias sobre mods.

E publicou a sua versão de como seria um possível episódio 3.

Ну давайте поговорим о Half-Life. Я не знаю с чего начать, так что сначала пусть будет немного истории.\n\nГлавное достоинство игры - второй переворот[1] представления о играх у простого народа, если такие игры как Quake или Rise of Triad заложили PC как игровую платформу[2] в лице офисного планктона, то такие игры как Blood или Unreal шептали нам о скорой революции видеоигр; ей стала Half-Life, и в итоге утвердила PC как игровую платформу. По сути своей, идея Half-Life лежала в сильном погружении в мир игры посредством хорошей подачи сюжета, которая и стала единственным новаторством как в своем жанре, так и в видеоиграх в принципе. Играя в Half-Life вы чувствуете весь дух рассыпающегося на глазах лабораторного комплекса, чувствуете на себе весь ужас происходящего и будете хотеть выбраться на поверхность, чувствуете мрак, что потихоньку затмевает всякие ценности и принципы. Игра в роде Half-Life могла возникнуть и раньше, тот же самый Quake вышел очередной забавой для офисного планктона, однако на его же модифицированной версии движка был создан Half-Life. ID Software - дети с невероятной технологией, более того - лидером - Кармаком, не признающим игры как некое слияние искусств, отчего Valve смогли их опередить и весьма удачно. Хотя, ранние презентации Half-Life на E3 показывали Half-Life почти в том же самом свете, что и Quake II, но в любом случае, с лучшим дизайном и атмосферой чем у ее конкурентов.\n\nСюжет повествует о физике-теоретике Гордоне Фримане, который работает в научном исследовательском комплексе Черная Меза. Ученые совершают открытие: им удается попасть в промежуточный между остальными мирами мир \"Зэн\", полный как диких животных, так и разумных существ, которые испытывают явное недовольство ко вторжению в их мир землян. Итог открытия: бурные исследования; в процессе одного из них мы и должны участвовать.\n\nСогласитесь, что тут сюжет явно не для оправдания действий игрока, как во всех шутерах до Half-Life, тут он держит вас в напряжении всю игру наряду с другими аспектами вроде атмосферы.\n\nТеперь разговор пойдет о самой игре. Пожалуй, без сомнений главной особенностью игры является подача сюжета. Здесь он подается не в виде текста между уровнями, не в виде катсцен[3], не в виде видеороликов, не в виде гайда на официальном сайте или в руководстве к игре, а прямо по ходу игры. Игрок не теряет контроль над главным героем[4]; все продвижения по сюжету происходят прямо у него на глазах: тут он запускает ракету, тут он получает от ученого сообщение, что надо двигать в сектор Лямбда, чтобы было ништяково, и т.п.;\n\nВторая же главная особенность игры заключается в неповторимом дизайне: какой бы вы уровень не взяли, он сделан шикарно: даже в самом начале игры вам демонстрируют результат пары бессонных ночей, не говоря уже о пограничном мире, вундервафлях и всей лаборатории в целом. А раз речь зашла о вундервафлях, то непременно нужно упомянуть арсенал главного героя, а он весьма калоритный: помимо стандартного набора из холодного оружия, пистолета, автомата, дробовика, ракетницы, гранат, есть уникальные образцы: тау-пушка, что разогревая уран бьет с такой отдачей, что можно отлететь со скоростью, чуть ли не соника; снарки, или в простонародье жуки: противные красные клопы с зубами из Зэна, которых можно кидать во врагов и наблюдать дивный пир; ну и конечно же всеми любимый глюонный дестабилизатор, то бишь пылесос, превращающий всех и вся в котлеты. Не секрет, что стрелять в Half-Life одно удовольствие. Противники же и вовсе радуют глаз: на потолках обосновываются барнаклы (желудки с длинным втягивающим языком); по всем коридорам прыгают хэдкрабы, превращающие людей в зомби; подоспевшие к зачистке монстров и персонала военные; двуногие быки-осьминоги; плотоядные пиявки; всем полюбившиеся вортигонты, исполняющие роль разведчиков или типа того; те же самые снарки не менее доставляют своим видом и повадками.\n\nГеймплей состоит в отстреливании групп противников и продвижении по разрушающемуся комплексу в надежде спастись; простенько и со вкусом. Чем это сопровождается, я вроде бы уже сказал: прекрасный дизайн, подача сюжета, все это здорово гармонирует между собой, держа игрока в напряжении всю игру.\n\nПримечания:\n\n1. Первый переворот случился в 1985 году, после выхода Super Mario Bros. Игра ушла от аркады в сторону игр на прохождение. Таким образом, при слове \"Игра\" среднестатистический человек представил бы себе стандартный для нас сейчас платформер вместо \"игры на рекорд\" -  аркады.\n\n2. Игровой платформой считали Sega Saturn, Panasonic 3DO, Nintendo 64 и прочие игровые консоли, в серьез PC вряд ли можно было бы взять, по крайней мере до 1996-1998 годов.\n\n3. Всего одна катсцена за всю игру, и то продолжительностью в 35 секунд.\n\n4. За исключением единственной за всю игру катсцены в 35 секунд.\n\nТакже:\n\nВ PS2 версии были улучшены в несколько раз текстуры, с выходом Steam эти модели включили в PC версию, но лишь в Steam версии игры И ИХ можно отключить по желанию.\n\nБыл отменен порт на Sega Dreamcast.\n\nЕсть неофициальный порт на Android.\n\nЕсть мультиплеер в виде дезметча.\n\nПодводя итоги скажу, что Half-Life заслуженно находится как в числе любимых игр множества людей, так и в числе лучших игр за всю историю. История про ученого, спасающего мир - это то, что мы называем классикой, и то, во что поиграем с удовольствием даже спустя столько лет.\n\n[spoiler]Ну вот, хотел написать кратенький обзор, а написал целую статью.

The game can be made without any outstanding solutions, but definitely the soul, a sense of proportion and attention to detail. The plot in general, stereotypical, although with original solutions. For me, Half-Life's strengths has always been the character design, attention to detail, the ability to create a general atmosphere with the help of small things. Level design is also good, although when we first met a few surprised, for example, the vast empty space of some sectors of the underground base. But it's the little things that at the general high quality of forgivable and does not even notice. Very remembered the behavior and interaction of different characters: left alone, scientists and security guards exchanged between a phrases, extraterrestrial beings talking in their own language, alien animals going about their business. Such trifles looked originally and increased presence. In my opinion, a good deal of popularity brought Half-Life that the developers have given into the hands of the players the tools and source code of the game (until the source of all .dll and .exe), which gave rise to a great variety of modifications, some of which are not inferior to the most Half- Life.

You've clearly heard of it, and you've heard its praise. It's all true. Everything that is said to be so great and revolutionary is indeed exactly as it is made out to be. If you would consider yourself a collector of artifacts that shaped the industry, you need Half-Life. But, it is not exclusive to these people. The only things that haven't aged well are the graphics, but perhaps you can find nostalgia through walking in its grim, pixelated maps of the 90s. Any regular gamer can play it, if they seek to know why it is so highly praised.\n\nI'll try not to spoil too much, but perhaps you already know how it ends if you've played sequels as well. It makes itself known that it is its own self, it has its own identification with all the elements that build it, and it is damn proud of itself. To name an important one: the atmosphere. The atmosphere is that of a haunting dread creeping up your spine and over your shoulders. The game shows you early on that it gives no mercy to whoever it pleases, and many won't seem to have a happy ending. This could have gone quite wrong, and felt like you were being dragged along to your doom, but it doesn't. Instead, it feels like a struggle, because although you may be strained by the persistent obstacles, both living and inanimate, each new chapter you pass and each round of enemies you eliminate makes you feel great, and often like a hero. Yet, if one were to describe the overall experience in just a few words: brutal, bleak, and badass. And one more thing to mention of the atmosphere is that there seems to be a thin blanket of horror covering it. Enemies of disgusting caricatures will jump at you from the dark corners and hidden spaces, or you will not be their victim, but instead a spectator to them mauling an innocent ally, where you can do nothing to help. Often, its not the enemies that are so eerie, but the silence itself. I caught myself with a piqued interest and a bit of relief each time I met a new group of scientists, or, creatures that wouldn't actually kill me. You may feel lonely and jumpy as you walk through the complex maps, until something is trying to kill you yet again. Maybe this wouldn't appeal to many, but to me it does, and the game does a fantastic job at being itself, as I mentioned earlier. \n\nThe atmosphere helps tremendously to build the story, and a great story it is. It's the classic trope of aliens invading earth, but its the humans' fault this time. It could have been a very simple and cliched one, but once you begin to dive further into game, it becomes special in its own way, with special characters and backstories, strange and ambiguous anomalies that taunt you. That's about as much as I can say without spoiling anything, I feel. It's another aspect that makes Half-Life what it is.\n\nAnother element are the combat mechanics, because it's clearly a shooter. Guns pack a serious punch and crack at enemies (although it only feels this way, because you never truly feel overpowered), and the feeling of shotgunning a vortigaunt in the face, or pummeling a headcrab mid-air with your trusty crowbar is so satisfying. Enemies also fight back with variety. Some are slow tanks, others are glass cannons, others white mages, and others are independent enough that they will attack both you and your enemies.\n\nI think I've mentioned a bit of every important point that makes the game so great. I just have one small tip left for newcomers: don't be afraid to consult a guide, because the maps are wide, with many levels and hallways that you will need to traverse, where you can get lost quite easily if you aren't used to these types of maps.","timestamp_created":1474227795,"timestamp_updated":1639587604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502607285976409912","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25571246","author":{"steamid":"76561198255171911","num_games_owned":708,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1444,"last_played":1489131216},"language":"english","review":"Just play it.

I'll spare you the read because we've all heard about what makes Half-life so great before, the fluid combination of gameplay that still manages to carry along a half decent narrative, the iconic design of the environments and enemies, being able to play as a character who isn't some tanked up super soldier, but a guy who's about to have a shit day at work. Like I said, this game came from a time when Valve didn't have money spewing at them from Dota, TF2 hat skins and steam sales. But it's a game that did what it did so well that, without it, Valve would probably just be some group of no name developers. It isn't perfect, the voice acting is cheesy, the characters feel like robots, their are a few weapons that are kind of useless (mainly the snarks and satchel charges), the graphics look like origami, but it has this distinct charm and simplicity to it that just has no substitute. It takes me back to a much simpler time when Valve wasn't the machine that powered the commercial games industry.","timestamp_created":1474011111,"timestamp_updated":1474011222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490071266889572144","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25521801","author":{"steamid":"76561198009961172","num_games_owned":552,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":82,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35,"last_played":1536178887},"language":"english","review":"OOOOH YEAH BABY IT'S HALF LIFE.

In fact, you can kill your allies if you want to, or kill the aliens if you prefer as well as the military that hunts you down. The game is such an emotional rollercoaster. When you get up into the outside world, the sun brightens your eyes and dopamine fills your heart, but then you have to go back down again with no choice but to face your fears, getting lost in Black Mesa.\n\nYou don't need to play this game. In fact, you can perfectly play Half Life 2 without playing this game without revealing anything of importance. But if you get the chance to, please do. The base, vanilla game and its extensions are fabulous already, but imagine if it was even better. Yes. There are countless mods, all filled with fun and action, that will put you for 10s of 100s of hours even, having fun with this wonder of a community-reawoken game.\n\nI highly recommend it. Now you don't have to buy it. How could I force you? But I say, you are missing out if you don't buy it, but it is ultimately your choice.","timestamp_created":1473505431,"timestamp_updated":1473505431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25440239","author":{"steamid":"76561198179603743","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5314,"last_played":1543895730},"language":"english","review":"This is the game of all games!
