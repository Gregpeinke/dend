Oyunu daha önce sadece arkadaşlarla online olarak oynamıştım yani hikayeli bölümle alakalı çok fazla bilgim yoktu. Bölümleri geçerken zorlansam bile destek almadan bitirmeye çalıştım, iyi ki öyle yaptım çünkü oyunun tadı bence böyle çıkıyor.

agency in Half-Life, an idea that extends to area navigation as platforming and puzzles can utilize most of the available environment. That exploration can be strained at times due to limitations or harsh punishments for small mistakes, but allowing liberal use of the save system dampens such issues and the gun play between moments of navigation packs in plenty of enjoyable weapons and varied enemy types. The first-person shooting never stagnates during the story, and while the hectic multiplayer isn’t too appealing, the single player manages to curate plenty of distinct and engaging moments that mostly offset the rougher elements.","timestamp_created":1651180415,"timestamp_updated":1651180415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gbWBuYADeKmltQM="}
