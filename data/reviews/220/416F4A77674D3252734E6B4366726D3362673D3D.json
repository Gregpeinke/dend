The graphics for the time in 2004 are very nice, and you can even have anisotropic filtering, or anti-aliasing to make the game look the best. Even with my AMD A8-6410 Quad Core at 2 gigahertz, and my AMD Radeon R5 Integrated Graphics Card, with 8 GB of RAM, ran at 60+ frames per second, and the lowest was 21, just because of changing maps when you meet the guy in the underground railroad who says \"Good God!\". All in all, this is not only a great game with surprises, it's also one of the best computer games made, period, even counting the first person action. Honestly, the king of all video games in 2004.

Or did he? Half-Life 2 starts you off facing the infamous G-Man, the mysterious blue-suited character from the first game. At the end of Half-Life, the G-Man offered you a choice: work for him or die. Since there would be no sequel if you chose the latter, Half-Life 2 assumes you chose the former, and you start the game in a train entering City 17 for your introduction into this new world.\n\nCity 17 is a run-down urban center that's the equivalent of the Warsaw ghettos during World War II, but instead of Jews being rounded up to live in City 17, it's all the remnants of a defeated humanity. Half-Life 2 takes place an untold number of years after the Black Mesa incident, but it's clear that much has changed. A mysterious enemy known as the Combine has conquered the planet and installed a human puppet government to carry out its rule. Black-clad security forces patrol the streets, while propaganda blares endlessly from omnipresent video screens. If there's one thing that Valve does extremely well, it's capture a sense of atmosphere--this vision of a dystopian police state is chillingly effective. But you won't spend a lot of time soaking in the scene before you're thrust into the struggle to defeat the Combine and free humanity.\n\nAs soon as the shooting begins you'll join an essentially nonstop battle that will last the remainder of the game. Like the original Half-Life, Half-Life 2 is presented as a nearly seamless experience--you play entirely from Gordon Freeman's perspective, there are no cutscenes or perspective changes to take you out of the moment, and are there no narrative jumps that skip ahead in time. (At least, there are none from your perspective.) There also aren't very many long loading times to interrupt the flow of the game, as all the levels are discreetly broken into sections, and when you transition from one section to another, there's only a slight pause for the new section to load (at least, on a high-end PC). Put it all together and the game's single-player campaign, which will probably take you between 15 and 20 hours to complete, comes off as a very long day in the extraordinary life of Gordon Freeman.","timestamp_created":1483501276,"timestamp_updated":1645758732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28995617","author":{"steamid":"76561198041516853","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":106,"playtime_forever":1566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1566,"last_played":1457275597},"language":"english","review":"this game is so bad.... its a wripoff off better gams like counter strike but with gay aliens that try to suck my bals....","timestamp_created":1483500229,"timestamp_updated":1483500229,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.240100860595703125","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28994022","author":{"steamid":"76561198140955622","num_games_owned":436,"num_reviews":101,"playtime_forever":949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":127,"last_played":1590111204},"language":"spanish","review":"exelente","timestamp_created":1483495162,"timestamp_updated":1483495162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28993374","author":{"steamid":"76561198134566992","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":449,"last_played":1593052824},"language":"english","review":"broken game","timestamp_created":1483493190,"timestamp_updated":1483493190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28992274","author":{"steamid":"76561198025132961","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2005,"last_played":1635195506},"language":"brazilian","review":"Absolutamente o melhor FPS que eu joguei até hoje.

Fantastic story, Amazing graphics especially for its time, and a good length for gameplay. I got about 12-13 hours before I beat this game. Half life 2 is a great sequel to the first one and picks up right where the first game left off. The plot is gold and i would recommend this game to anyone who loves a good story and FPS! at times it has good horror elements along with action and emotional sequences. It amazes me that even games of today cant nail a flawlless story like the Half Life trilogy. No cutscenes and over the top moments like you would see in a call of duty game or something. This game just like the first will show you how great a game can be without all those things and will keep you immersed since you are always looking throught the eyes of Gordon Freeman.

Something as basic as righting a barrel that's been knocked over is hilareously frustrating sometimes; In sections where you have a squad of soldiers under your command, they can easily get in the way and block doorways; And, the ending can feel very abrupt, especially if you don't intend to play the follow-up Episode One.","timestamp_created":1483389490,"timestamp_updated":1484402348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28955116","author":{"steamid":"76561198250588800","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1125,"last_played":1485657731},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um excelente jogo.

I haven't played HL2 through completely in years. I was doing a 16 hour stream on Twitch, and decided one of the best ways to get through those hours was by playing HL2 again. And to add to the relevance of playing this game now, there is a new VR game out that I have yet to check out called Half-Life: Alyx. It's basically Half-Life, in VR. Boy does that sound fun.\n\nBefore I get into the actual review, this game has aged AMAZINGLY well. I was blown away by the fact that I can still look at this game and think, \"wow, look at these graphics\". I can't resist but appreciate what this game is and what it was for it's time. There was NOTHING like Half-Life 2. It blown gamers away when it was released thanks to an incredible physics engine (that some games don't even have today) and graphics that would make their computers turn into a microwave. \n\nBefore we begin, I would look to emphasize the fact that this review is indeed my [url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/opinion] opinion [/url] and that my [url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/opinion] opinion [/url] may be different from your [url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/opinion] opinion [/url]. So with that out of the way.....\n\nLet's start\n\n[h1] HALF-LIFE 2 [/h1]\n\n[b] PRESENTATION 9.5/10 [/b]\n\n Half-Life 2 is an absolutely incredibly designed game. Very similar characteristics to Half-Life 1, it's a long single-player game that manages to mix puzzles with intense action that keeps your eyes and ears alert. There is a huge level variety and a mix of different puzzles that can take 20 minutes or 30 seconds to solve depending on the players IQ. Some of the puzzles are very intelligent and most of the time, will incorporate it's own physics engine that some players don't even think about until they finally do it. The players goes, \"ooohhh\", and learns a new mechanic of the game. This is what HL2 so revolutionary. And just like it's prequel, the levels are all different. Each level does not look last the last. This keeps players on the game for hours at a time, and will get them excited when they get on after leaving off of a new level.\n\nThe only thing I would have liked, was some small indicator of what you had to do when it came to finding exits or solving puzzles. Sometimes I would sit for ages wondering where the hell I'm supposed to go, just for something scripted to happen and make me go, \"are you serious?\". Sometimes things are hidden in plain site, but are obviously there so they can be hidden in plain site. Despite those factors, there is not much bad to say about the presentation of this game. It's amazing.\n\n[b] SOUND 8.5/10 [/b]\n\n This game sounds great. The voice actors are awesome and emotional and the guns sound good and of course, there is a variety of gun sounds where EACH GUN SOUND IS NOT LIKE THE LAST. The ambiance is cool as well, and can make some scenes creepy. There is a lot of detailed sounds in environments like wind, birds, and movement. There is a variety of material sounds. Metals don't sound the same as household items. There are cool sounds when ripping electronics from their cords, and of course they are all different. I can't forget to mention the cool music during fights and chapter openings and some of the easter-egg sounds the game adds as well.\n\nIt's not perfect, though. Some sounds are ported directly from HL1, which can be a good thing and a bad thing for several reasons. Although the gun sounds are high quality, I wouldn't call them necessarily realistic. Sometimes, I get annoyed by the gun sounds. The RPG sounds weird, and it doesn't feel like I'm shooting an RPG at times. I recognized one song that was from HL1 during [i] Highway 17 [/i]. It makes me question how many more songs I didn't catch that were from HL1. With considering these factor, it's an overall good sounding game. It's high quality and amazing voice actors are the only reason why I didn't give it just an 8 and went with an 8.5. \n\n[b] GAMEPLAY 6.5/10 [/b]\n\n A lot of people are going to hate me for this, and that's cool. I want to be the first person to say that the gameplay of this game is extremely overrated. Although it's very innovative and cool, it can be very tedious at times. \n\nThe actual gameplay is pretty basic. To solve puzzles, you climb things, move things, push things, pull things, etc. and then wait for something to open up so you can move on. The combat is basic. You shoot guys, they shoot you, and they die quickly, you don't. Sometimes you will be slouching in your chair walking around waiting for something exciting to happen. Some of the levels are just way too long, and they will become uninteresting and repetitive. Sure, adding vehicles makes it cool and will add a sense of uniqueness to a level, but they grow old pretty quickly. \n\nThe puzzles can remove tension from levels. The biggest example of this is from [i] We Don't Go To Ravenholm.. [/i]. What a terrible way to ruin the scary suspense I felt from that level. I remember years ago how scary that chapter was, but then you have to look around and turn things on to move forward, and it just gets tedious. I'm NOT saying puzzles are a bad thing, but they need to know their time and place, and only 30 seconds into a scary environment, is not a good time, nor place. The gameplay of HL2 isn't a train wreck, but there are some minor problems that I wish were gone that would make it sooooo much better.\n\n[b] GRAPHICS 10/10 [/b]\n\n This game is with no-doubt in my mind the best looking game of all time, considering it's release date. This game was so good looking, that if you didn't have top-of-the-line specs on your PC at the time, then you weren't going past medium settings. The lighting is this game is BEAUTIFUL. Even today, I still look at this game sometimes and I am just amazed with how it still looks. The characters all have visible muscles in their bodies, especially in their face. The water looks gorgeous. The special effects are extremely detailed and make levels look beautiful. Each part of this game is highly detailed, all with hidden parts that provide valuable supplies that rewards players who go and search for them. The environment is very realistic and suits the setting of the game perfectly. From the bottom of its feet, all the way to the tippity-top of it's hair, this is the best looking game out there. \n\nI can't think of a single negative thing to say about the graphics. HL2 couldn't have looked better for it's time. \n\n[b] LASTING APPEAL 10/10 [/b]\n\n There is a reason why people still talk about this game. I can guarantee you, if you just played HL2 for the first time, it would definitely not be the last time you play it. This game is still so awesome, I cannot resist but come back to it every few years. I sometimes feel emotional over the nostalgia this game will provide when I play through it. I can actually feel a personal connection between me and the characters. Just me?.... ok....\n\n[h1] 8.8/10 [/h1]\n\nWould recommend to any gamer!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1483383801,"timestamp_updated":1591482916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28952069","author":{"steamid":"76561198212684480","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":327,"last_played":1498778731},"language":"english","review":"This game is a solid fps with a great soundtrack; but, i  would not say its the greats games of all time but i would recommend it if your looking for a solid fps.","timestamp_created":1483383642,"timestamp_updated":1483383642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28951149","author":{"steamid":"76561198177989081","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":362,"last_played":1484744618},"language":"russian","review":"Очень хороший сюжет","timestamp_created":1483381954,"timestamp_updated":1483381954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28949858","author":{"steamid":"76561198202255416","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":956,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":675,"last_played":1596240811},"language":"english","review":"Best game","timestamp_created":1483379654,"timestamp_updated":1483379654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28949406","author":{"steamid":"76561198558773306","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1611521705},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever made.","timestamp_created":1483378944,"timestamp_updated":1483378944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgM2RsNkCfrm3bg=="}
