Hands down above all the absolute best friggin' FPS game of 2013! Sorry, anyone who thinks otherwise, I respect your opinions, but right now I just really have to say that I really, REALLY enjoyed this game's anticipated experience it had to offer, thouroughly. The game play over all was spectacular, I know it's taken me this freaking long to even write a simple journal of a review of the masterpiece of a game it was, but at least it's being done. \n\nIt just was the best damn thing I had ever done in my life, yes it was life changing video game, and I regret nothing about the game, I am soooooo damn glad that I forced my sister to buy it for me the day it came out. In order to remember it's magnificence of a gamer success, MY GOD! Yes, I cried like a bitch at the end, there were no doubts that I was mind-raped at the game's finale! It was so complex, and mind boggling that i started to get a bad nosebleed. I loved all the characters, and how they were portrayed, the voice acting, the art work, the character development, everything about the game, hell even the damn time, and history backing up every little damn detail, made the game that much exponentially better! Minds were profoundly blown, it was literally unlike anything i had seen before, Just listen to Saliva's \"Ladies and Gentlemen\" and the entire damn song pretty much explains the entire feeling of the game. I wish I had honestly went to the bathroom before the ending of the game because it scared the crap outta me, (just an exaggeration mind you). I HIGHLY recommend playing this game and actually really play this game and put the time to notice every detail of it, you will not regret it. Bricks will be shat, minds will be blown, and hearts will be melted. The DLCs for this wondrous game are a blast of excitement, and thrilling trigger-happy game play! That one is called (CITC) \"Clash In The Clouds\", featuring tons of new challenges, achievements, more action packed gaming. CITC was alright but I honestly feel it was just another bait for those achievement whores out there, but I did however like being a curator for all the unlockables it was hard work, but totally worth it in the end. The second  DLC \"Burial At Sea\" both episode 1 and 2 was spectacular. It had its holes I feel here and there and didn't make much sense to me at first and I feel went over my head in the beginning but I just decided to roll with it till the end, and by the time that was all paid in full I understood fully what it all meant. (that is after replaying it a couple times). Without further ado, enjoy the game, it's gonna be a hell of a ride! I highly reccomend it! Not just cause I'm a BioShock fan but because it was a good play.","timestamp_created":1465535604,"timestamp_updated":1465535604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580518066883087158","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23477226","author":{"steamid":"76561198026314334","num_games_owned":454,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":715,"last_played":1437768895},"language":"english","review":"Not my favorite of BioSchocks but still a pretty fun game!","timestamp_created":1465521356,"timestamp_updated":1465521356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23474232","author":{"steamid":"76561198205756788","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":954,"last_played":1488635417},"language":"russian","review":"Cool","timestamp_created":1465505612,"timestamp_updated":1465505612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23473688","author":{"steamid":"76561198084147885","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":536,"last_played":1464796721},"language":"english","review":"Superb story.","timestamp_created":1465503390,"timestamp_updated":1465503390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23466963","author":{"steamid":"76561198021204849","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1446658152},"language":"english","review":"One of the best stories so far I've ever met in games. Columbia is ridiculously beautiful and you can see a new kind of art in every possible locations as the game goes from light colours to dark ones as the story goes.

Действие игры происходит в 1912 году в вымышленном летающем городе Колумбия. Главного героя зовут Букер ДеВитт. Он частный детектив и прибыл в Колумбию, чтобы найти девушку по имени Элизабет. Позже, они вместе окажутся в центре войны между рабочими и городскими властями. У Элизабет есть сверхспособность: создавать \"разрывы\" между параллельными мирами и благодаря этому, они многое узнают про этот город, а также про свое прошлое.\nСаундтрек здесь прекрасный, чего только стоит музыка которая играет в меню! Большую часть игры нам придется расправляться со злодеями, в сопровождении очаровательной и очень красивой Элизабет. В игре прекрасная атмосфера. Локации разнообразны, декорации на протяжении всего прохождения будут постоянно изменяться, хочется просто бродить по городу, слушая диалоги прохожих и любоваться красотой, ведь перестрелки иногда надоедают. Подведем итоги: BioShock Infinite игра, с хорошим сюжетом, подбором персонажей, прекрасным саундтреком, отлично проработанными локациями. Рекомендую эту игру к прохождению, потому что каждый уважающий себя геймер обязан сыграть в BioShock Infinite!Думаю за 2013 год это лучшая игра,и если в 2016 или 2017 году выйдет новая часть то она будет в много раз лучше...","timestamp_created":1465334244,"timestamp_updated":1465334244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603871166706085205","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23438834","author":{"steamid":"76561198207088172","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1018,"last_played":1624800142},"language":"russian","review":"игра прям шикос! думала что фигня полная а нет, 2 недели рубал в неё!","timestamp_created":1465321661,"timestamp_updated":1465321661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23434941","author":{"steamid":"76561198213826964","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":4848,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3370,"last_played":1455422855},"language":"english","review":"The story is very gripping.

Если в восторге не было религии и все полагались на науку, то здесь все веруют в Пророка, что ведет их. Играем мы за Букера Девитта, чье путешествие начинается так же - с маяка. Только мы отправимся не вниз, а вверх. За долги мы взяли за поручение найти девчонку... и это будет самое необычное дело частного детектива...\n\nНовая глава в истории Bioshock во многом отошла от своего предшественника и в ней стало всего меньше: меньше плазмидов (хоть теперь у них и есть по два режима); на место кучи пасивок пришла одежда (теперь можно носить всего 4); пушек хоть и стало с виду, но по сути мы имеем по две вариации одной пушки. Дали щит. Крюк, которым можно скользить по рельсам. И! Добавили одну механику, которая просто преобразила игровой процесс - Элизабет. Эта девушка будет вашим несменным напарником всюду следующей за вами. Убить ее нельзя, и она не атакует, но от нее есть бесценная помощь в бою: она умеет открывать порталы в другие миры. Вас обстреливают со всех сторон? В этом месте Элизабет может поставить преграду. А вот тут будут аптечки. А там патроны. Места конечно фиксированы, но это свежая идея в шутерах. При всем этом она очень живо реагирует на окружение, сразу видно героя делали с любовью.\n\nМногие и называют Бесконечность плохим шутером и отличной игрой. Не знаю насчет геймлейной составляющей, но должен согласится что на первом месте тут сюжет и проработка мира. Левин снова создал чертовски интересный и проработанный мир, который кординально отличается от Восторга (хотя и есть кое какие совпадения, но это не случайно). Сюжет закручен так лихо, что не отпускает до самого конца, хотя, как и в случае с первой игрой вам с самого начала дают подсказки на развязку (это особенно видно при повторном прохождении). Концовка одна из лучших, что была в играх.\n\nМногие до сих пор спорят игры это исскуство или нет? Что ж Кен Левин снова доказал, что игра рассказывать отличную историю как книга, но при этом лично пережить всю ее историю. Жалко, что это скорей его последний проект во вселеной, т.к. он уволился и создал другую компанию, но может это и к лучшему... \n\nТак же хочу посоветовать установить русскую фанатскую озвучку. Группа людей на голом энтузиазме смогли сделать перевод лучше, чем официальные переводчики. Перерисованы на русский язык куча текстур зданий, переведены и озвучены голосовые записки, исправлены недочёты в переводе официальных переводчиков (видимо переводили с английской версии, а не просто озвучивали нашу), а озвучка наверно считается одной из лучших что были в играх.

Not in any way. [DLC review at bottom].\n\nStory: You're Booker DeWitt, you're actually talking and you even have a face. Your mission is to save a mysterious girl to settle a debt. Over the course of the game you will overthrow evil dictators, defeat hordes of enemies and traverse a lot of terrain. All very familiar. The story is very engaging in my opinion. And not even that cliched all the time.\n\nSetting: Instead of being in an underwater city, you're now miles above the ground in a floating city. The dreary, watery surroundings of Rapture make way for the colourful and overly bright vistas of Columbia, at least initially. Shit's going to hit the fan later on as it always does.\n\nCombat: Combat is very fluid, it's faster than in BS 1 and esp. BS 2 in which you were a hulking Big Daddy with no real sprint. You've got a very useful melee attack and there's a variety of medium to long range weapons available. The biggest downside here is that you can only ever carry 2 of those at the same time, which makes a lot of the weapons rather dull reworks of existing weapons (pistol, revolver, machine gun, repeater, burst gun...etc.). Headshots are still the way to go. This time around you also get a recharging shield which makes it easier to take a few risks in dispatching your enemies. However, the combat in itself is a bit dull, which is mainly due to the CoD-style weapons. There's nothing really eye catching here, pistols, machine guns, shot guns, sniper rilfes and grenade/rocket launchers...could have used a few more outlandish weaponry. The biggest and coolest part are the battles with skylines involved. You can use those to quickly traverse the terrain, like in a roller coaster. Enemies will use them as well. They spice things up quite a bit. Boring on the other hand are the huge \"handymans\" you have to fight from time to time. They are just massive bullet sponges, which takes us to:\n\nEnemies: Enemies usually behave relatively smart and the variety is \"ok\". Again, nothing too outlandish save for the Handymans (big Ape-like creatures, the Iron Patriots, big metal robots with miniguns and Songbird, a named NPC). Could have used a bit more.\n\nUpgrades: You can upgrade shield, health and \"mana\", called \"Salt\" in this game instead of EVE. Also no more Adam. The only currency now are coins, which you can at least carry an indefinite amount of now! You can also purchase different weapon upgrades like more damage, bigger magazine or faster reload times. Again, pretty bland all in all. Upgrades could have made the weapons more interesting. Also you can get as many as you like if you have the cash. The upgrade shops are literally everywhere. \"vigors\" replace plasmids, but work in the same way, only that you can (again) only ever equip 2 at a time, but at least you can quick select which 2 at all times. There are 8 in total. These can be upgraded to have additional effects, which is quite neat, but requires A LOT of money.\n\nElizabeth: Your mysterious companion, whom you first have to rescue, then chase and rerescue multiple times will often \"find\" items for you. That could be money, ammo, health or salt (the latter 3 only in combat, the first only when not in combat). This is handy, but a bit obnoxious at times. She can also open \"tears\" to other dimensions, either for story reasons just like that to give you access to automated gun turrets, new weapons or health, etc. She's invincible, so at least you don't have to worry about her dying. But she's a pain in the arse anyway. Strictly in a story sense though.\n\nApart from that there is no more map or objects tab. You have to navigate by constantly pressing \"n\" to display a short arrow. Also, no more ADAM, as already mentioned, so no Big Daddys, no Little Sisters and no bloody harvesting of angels. The game is very straightforward, but you CAN explore quite a bit and find stuff. There are locked doors and such, which you can only open with lock picks, which you will find throughout the game, or with special keys or other items. They usually contain money and/or character upgrades. Med pack and mana healing are gone though. You can only pick up items but not use them to regain something.\n\nAll in all a pretty good FPS, not too challenging on the medium difficulty, but ok, maybe 7/10?\n\nDLC:\n\nClash in the Clouds: \nArena shooter. Didn't play it. Doesn't interest me, but works in conjunction with another DLC.\n\nBurial at Sea Ep 1:\nBack in Rapture. Yay. Still playing as Booker with Elizabeth as side kick. Not much difference from base game in terms of gameplay, but you can now hold all weapons again. Be prepared: The DLC is MUCH rougher than the base game on the same difficulty level. Directly continues the story from Infinite, so a must have.\n\nBurial at Sea Ep 2:\nCompletely revamps the gameplay and turns Infinite into a stealth game. You play as Elizabeth and you get new unique weapons and plasmids to stun or avoid enemies. You're supposed to sneak up on enemies and take them out. Directly continues the story from BaS Ep 1. Must have again.\n\nOverall playtime on medium with lots of exploring should take you around 15 to 20 hours for the base game and the 2 story DLCs (which take up around 2 hours for Episode 1 and 4 hours for episode 2). The narrative is well worth it. They've put so much effort into Elizabeth and the world as a whole...for an FPS that is insanely well done.","timestamp_created":1465241961,"timestamp_updated":1465343750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515560805797576904","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23423705","author":{"steamid":"76561198138006383","num_games_owned":1261,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":705,"last_played":1519352635},"language":"english","review":"This game is the third installment in the series of Bioshock games, and this one is much more refined. fleshed out, and organzied than previous installments in my personal opinion.

For the most part, this turned out to be right. Still, I enjoyed it far more than the original. This is in part due to Infinite being the best kind of sequel; one in which it takes the original and expands upon it, fixing its mistakes all while keeping things familiar to the first game. \nIn it, you play as Booker DeWitt, sent to rescue a girl from the sky city of Columbia. While in the original you play in the cramped, dark, and already ruined city of Rapture, Columbia offers a far more open and lively setting, one which I think works much better for the combat in the game. While the wide open spaces in Bioshock Infinite where combat takes place could have easily led to a lot of running around the area, the game wisely implements the skyhook, a method of quickly moving around the arena. The skyhook not only helps with the combat by keeping it interesting and exciting, it also allows for transportation around the city rather seamless. In terms of the combat itself, it plays similarly to Bioshock, except that Booker is only able to carry two weapons at a time, something that I found to be a nice inclusion as it forces the player to think more about which weapons to use at a certain time. Adam is also back, except this time its called vigor for some reason. While Vigors were useful, I found myself only using one or two types of vigors throughout the game. \nAnother interesting new addition is the AI partner Elizabeth who follows Booker around, throwing him health and ammo as he needs it. Luckily, Elizabeth is unable to take damage, making her more useful than a nuisance. \nIn terms of characters, I found most of them quite interesting, each with their own strengths and flaws, as well as interesting backstories, some found in audiotapes, but much of which won't be revealed until very late in the game.\nThe overall story is quite compelling; one of the best i've ever seen, but it has its slow moments. Some parts seem a bit pointless, where the player will be forced to complete some random task just to open a door, for example. This is similar to the original Bioshock, but where it differs is in Infinite, on some occasions while what your doing may seem pointless, it will instead be used to lead into and progress the plot in some way, instead of simply being used as a way to extend the games length, as was the case in the original. However, where the story really shines is the ending. Without spoiling anything, its an ending that really stuck with me and made me go back to eariler parts just to see how it all came together. It was certainly a better ending than the original Bioshock at least. \nThe DLC for the game is also quite good. It does an excelent job of connecting this game and the original together, and contains things fans of the original will like. \nOverall, one of the better games i've played. While it does have one or two flaws, they're largely overshadowed by everything great about it. If you haven't played the original game, it probably isn't necessary to play before this, as the stories are largely seperated. However, if you plan on playing the DLC, it will spoil major elements of the original. Overall, a truly excellent game, one which I would highly reccomend.","timestamp_created":1465184879,"timestamp_updated":1465184879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50205761194229126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23409521","author":{"steamid":"76561198149113091","num_games_owned":880,"num_reviews":92,"playtime_forever":1766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":960,"last_played":1557084859},"language":"brazilian","review":"MindFuck 100/10\n\nZerei 2 vezes e criei 2 teorias diferentes, ambas acabaram sendo derrubadas pelas DLC Burial at Sea. \nJogo muito bom om ótimos gráficos, história e jogabilidade. \n\nSe quiser entender a história de verdade, vai precisar jogar as DLCs tbm, além de conseguir TODOS as voxfones e fitas de audios...vai por mim, vale a pena!","timestamp_created":1465166913,"timestamp_updated":1465166913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518670320510864258","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23407524","author":{"steamid":"76561198082490078","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1728,"last_played":1506789475},"language":"english","review":"After playing BioShock Infinite on 4K max settings with my dual Fury X's I have to say that the graphics were impressive and all the shadowing, shaders, textures and glare including reflectants being pretty accurate.

In fact, shortly after this game was made Irrational games were forced to shut down their doors. However, all things considered, Bioshock Infinite was a fantastic conclusion to one of my favorite franchises of all time. The visuals are very bright and creative and take place in an \"idealized 1930's America\" floating in the sky called by Colombia. The world is incredibly immersive, giving time to show you how this world's racial predjudices are getting out of hand and lets you take some time to see the suburbs and the slums of Colombia. The story in this game is brilliant. I would even argue its the best video game storyline i've ever seen, being a thought provoking look at quantum mechanics and life as it is. You play as Booker Dewitt, a man sent to retrieve a girl from Colombia to wipe away his gambling debt and ends up falling into more than he can handle. He's also subjected to a religous zealot who runs colombia who is the main driving force against Booker throughout the story. As for the gameplay itself, it's rather standard and lackluster. You have basic guns which can only be found or obtained by defeating enemies and for some odd reason your character can only use two at a time. There are vigors, which act as this games plasmids, allowing you to throw enemies in the air, light them on fire, electricute them, etc. Dual wielding vigors and guns feels fantastic. It feels like one misuse of the vigors can cost you everything, which is great in a game like this. The game has you fight several enemies at all times in enclosed arena's. This can start to feel very repetitive very fast and is by far the lowest point of the game. All in all, this game can be summed up as a decent shooter with fun characters , an amazing story and an incredibly satisfying ending. Buy this game.

This game is brilliant.  I'm not a big FPS guy, but a good story can draw me in, and this game has that in spades.  BioShock Infinite offers a look at an alternate early 20th-century world where religion and patriotism have merged in an extreme way to form a really fascinating culture that's not afraid to challenge you, and it does so very well.  Not entirely sure how much sense the ending makes, but it is still awesome and worth playing the game to see, along with everything else about the story.","timestamp_created":1464967199,"timestamp_updated":1464967199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23361640","author":{"steamid":"76561198044534017","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":824,"last_played":1487982236},"language":"english","review":"I can't get over how much I loved this game, it's tons of fun from start to finish.
