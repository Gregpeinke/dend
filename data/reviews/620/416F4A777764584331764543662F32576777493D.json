This game is portal 1 on steroids, it's much longer, it has so many more mechanics, it has co op (which I'm excited to try but none of my friends have this game) and community made levels. I think this game is a lot better despite being more flawed than portal 1. First of all the fact you can't pick up chairs anymore is a bit weird, there are a few other physics objects from portal 1 that are now baked in, which I consider a flaw not a huge flaw in fact a very small flaw. Second of all some areas get a bit tedious, not huge either because it really is a bit and any boredom usually resolves itself pretty quick with a new challenge or voice line.\nNow for the good things\n1. The graphics, for a 9 year old game the graphics are still spectacular and looks like something that could have been released today. 2. The environments in this game are perfect, lighting is used really well and the locations and scope of everything are awe inspiring 3. sound design in this game is spectacular, all the little things, like the music that plays when you use a gel and the main songs fit the environments super well, nothing in this game feels out of place (Also 'Want you gone' is amazing) 4. the gameplay is like portal 1s awesome mechanics x10. So many more factors for puzzles and the varied environments make for new puzzle conditions. 5. The humor in this game is great, the characters feel dynamic and make for very funny scenes, Glados is just as good as she was in portal 1, wheatly is just a very good character and his scenes with glados are always funny, Cave Johnson is just a very over the top and funny character, he is hard to describe and do him justice, he's just great.\n\nI could go on for ages about what makes this game great but I don't have the time or patience. The price has lowered enough in 9 years that anyone can buy it and the fact that this still feels modern means the price is even better. If you're looking for you're next game to play, this should be considered.","timestamp_created":1587793531,"timestamp_updated":1587793531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67975677","author":{"steamid":"76561198111447332","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":126,"playtime_forever":537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":537,"last_played":1587792213},"language":"russian","review":"Безусловно, после успеха первой части должен был выйти Portal 2. Из главных отличительных особенностей этой игры от первой является более глубинно прописанная сюжетная линия, в которой даже есть несколько плот твсистов. Сама же игра стала длиннее,  но от этого ближе к концу игра стала надоедать из-за однообразия так же добавили новые механики, которые существенно поменяли геимплей. Задания же в комнатах стали стали намного сложнее, вот только как я узнал позже с первого раза проходил сложные комнаты и долго тупил в простых. ( С кем не бывает). Как по мне сюжет в Portal 2 стал на голову выше, но от этого потерялась некая ламповость.\n\nОценка: покупайте эту игру, если вы хикка, ведь только тут вы сможете завести 7 друзей кубов из 10.\n\nP.S

Отдельного респекта заслуживают фразы в этой игре. Персонажи говорят много очень смешных шуток которые поймут от таких дебилов как я до нормальных людей. В игре неплохая русская озвучка, но иногда в диалоги попадают ненужные фразы или звуки, это конечно минус, но встречается редко и сильно не мешает. В первой мы почти всю игру решаем головоломки, а только под конец только появляется слабенький экшончик и это было довольно скучно, но в второй части игры учли эту проблему и игра была интересная от начала до конца. Графика тут для 2011 года хорошая, главное что глаза не режет. \n\n\nИтог: Так брат или не брать эту игру спросите вы? Конечно брать!

The combination of first-person shooter and puzzle creates a unique experience which will keep you thinking and amazed throughout the entire time you play. You play as a girl who enters a familiar testing chamber, but as you keep completing the puzzles, you begin to discover that something went horribly wrong here. Although the storyline is a little bit underdeveloped and does not compare to the first, what makes the game feel like an upgraded experience is the smooth handling of the controls and the small learning curve; understanding the mechanics is quite quick. The voice acting for Wheatly and GLaDOS is very fitting; the voices being robotic enough to make it sound genuine, but also integrate a good amount of sass in their language to make them sound human. The co-op chambers of this game are quite well designed, as there are many chambers of different difficulty that make working with your friends really fun. The chamber creator’s interface is bright and easy to navigate through, and is very user-friendly and easy to get into quickly. The soundtrack, however, is garbage. The song at the end that is supposed to reward you for your work sounds like an endless slaughtering of wolves, and just listening to the ambience of the testing chamber while playing is not the most pleasing. For a game that is only 10 dollars, the game is a great way to relax and play with friends, with playtime going far beyond 40 hours.\n","timestamp_created":1587747407,"timestamp_updated":1587747407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67942367","author":{"steamid":"76561199001622485","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":626,"last_played":1646628012},"language":"russian","review":"...","timestamp_created":1587746090,"timestamp_updated":1587746090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwdXC1vECf/2WgwI="}
