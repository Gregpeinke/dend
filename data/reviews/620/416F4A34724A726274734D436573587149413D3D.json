Valve know how to make an interesting game and by the beard of Zeus, if you don't like GLaDoS then be gone!\n\nOverall, incredible game if you like fast paced and puzzle games. The storyline is very good as well, although you need to have played the first Portal game to understand a lot of it. If you have played it, and are finished this one, I suggest looking for all the hidden bits like the hatch doors, etc. Some fun hidden things there for all you Valve gamers.","timestamp_created":1389111593,"timestamp_updated":1389111593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8606810","author":{"steamid":"76561197996647467","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7323,"last_played":1617235511},"language":"english","review":"I've played this several times, beginning to end, I love it.\nIt's a classical puzzle game with some story mixed in it.","timestamp_created":1389110285,"timestamp_updated":1511729992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rJrbtsMCesXqIA=="}
