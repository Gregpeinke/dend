Game这个公司总喜欢发行一些复古的作品吧，除了《无主之地》以外，《黑手党》，《生化奇兵》系列，都是以20世纪10~50年代（可能）左右的美国为背景制作的，何为10~50年代？老爷车，爵士乐，留声机以及唱片机，都是那个年代出现的，然后就是最重大的两次世界大战，这是一个世界文明刚开始走向现代化的时代，是《猫和老鼠》与《超人》刚刚问世的时代，也是充满战乱与黑暗的年代，战争之前，摇滚乐还没诞生，二战之后，爵士乐变成了摇滚乐，老爷车变成了方块化的肌肉车。隔壁《辐射》刚好也是这个背景，只不过是变成了废土，《黑手党》是一个真实的20世纪美国，《生化奇兵》就是一个魔幻化的《黑手党》，黑色幽默，恐怖故事，全都在这个虚构而又复古的天空城市，目测天空城哥伦比亚的科技除去魔幻部分的话，属于一战水平，飞行器是飞艇，服装还遗留着18世纪欧洲文艺复兴时代到美国刚刚独立的殖民风格，这是一个神奇的时代，这种复古的年代感，虽然社会很黑暗，但是就是非常有味，相当于20实际的人做了一场梦，飞到了空中，也相当于你来到了《猫和老鼠》汤米去到的天堂世界，所以，这个哥伦比亚远没有表面看上去那么简单，可不是什么单纯的风景，背后蕴含的东西太多了\n    相比于明亮的哥伦比亚，海底的销魂城实际上比它更发达，哥伦比亚还停留在殖民地时期的那种欧式建筑，而销魂城则像是纽约和芝加哥的综合体沉进了海底，穿着西装的恶棍，汤姆逊冲锋枪，这里就是一个充满黑帮与犯罪的科幻版黑手党黑帮之城，只不过是海底世界没有车子而已，哥伦比亚再高也都是低矮的欧式建筑，而这里到处都充满了美国式的高楼大厦，即便是海底也难以遮盖它的高耸入云的压迫感，建筑内采用了大玻璃与Art Deco的装饰风格，这是一种20世纪的一种新型装饰艺术风格，今天看着很复古，但在当时相当于前卫简约的潮流设计，如今在现实中你依旧能看到，在纽约的帝国大厦，依稀可见的大玻璃美式热狗餐厅，一直还在保留着，这些都是现实中存在的原型，包括《辐射》在内，废土世界中的美国其实就是20世纪的一种科幻延申而已，绝非纯粹的架空幻想，要是你有机会去旅游的话，你都能在现实中找到这些设计元素的影子，更何况，现实中的欧美地区，依旧能看得到老爷车开上公路","timestamp_created":1544003539,"timestamp_updated":1601596363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47303152","author":{"steamid":"76561198355460279","num_games_owned":1116,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":343,"last_played":1549641001},"language":"schinese","review":"玩了以后有点想恋爱了。。。。","timestamp_created":1543988222,"timestamp_updated":1543988222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477815687656402588","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47302293","author":{"steamid":"76561198799259213","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":101,"last_played":1522550937},"language":"english","review":"I

Quel chance quand on voit les autres posts.\n\nLe bon :\n- Le scénario moins beau que dans les précédents. Mais les voyages dans le temps et mondes parallèles améliorent toujours un scénario.\n- Niveau gamelay c'est du FPS, plusieurs armes, plusieurs pouvoirs. Des changemnets par rapport à l'époque et une sorte de grappin pour renouveler un peu le gameplay.\n- La musique joue avec l'époque comme l'ambiance sonore avec l'environnement. C'est très bien rendu et les voix françaises sont excellente. C'est immersif à souhait. Pareil que le premier, rien à dire .\n- Les \"dlc burried at sea\" qui sont pour moi plus important à avoir que le jeu lui même. Retour à Rapture, on en apprend beaucoup sur les trois jeux, beaucoup de réponses données.\n\nLe mauvais :\n- Le jeu d'acteur parfois ennuyeux, on ne ressent pas forcément la détresse du héros.\n- Un manque d'énigmes.

Considero que es el Bioshock mejor llevado a cabo en cuanto a narrativa, y que en mi humilde opinion, se posa como juego de culto en la historia del gaming junto con el resto de la trilogía...\n\nEl único punto negativo que le puedo encontrar es con respecto a las batallas contra enemigos pequeños: en algunas ocasiones estas se vuelven frustrantes y repetitivas (sobre todo jugando en la dificultad maxima) puesto a que siempre se trata de hordas interminables que llegan una tras otra y al final siempre las super unidades... bastante tedioso... pero no le quita mérito al juego puesto que, toda la saga padece de esta mecánica...\n\nPara concluír mi reseña me encantaría acentuar la banda sonora del juego, que además de ser hermosa, es adaptiva y el jugador la crea, dandole un nivel de inmersion dificil de igualar...

There's a lot of freedom in how you approach combat, whether it be with guns, vigors, melee, or a mix of the three, by the mid-point of the game you essentially have all the tools at your disposal. I didn't really use vigors that much, and I didn't feel punished for that. Gameplay is first-person run and gun, like other Bioshock games. It's simplistic and repetitive, but that comes without any weird contrived gameplay shit. I like the railway system used for quick movement used throughout the game, it's a neat concept.\n   Environment-wise it's a pretty game, each environment is distinct and pretty, a blending of traditional with idyllic americana art and architechure. You really get a feel for the underlying uglyness of the society underneath all the bright paint. The music is sometimes great, sometimes forgettable. My favorite track was when you first enter Columbia.\n   The story doesn't go for too long, it's a fun way to spend several hours.

Levine does not fundementally understand the multiverse theory, but fortunately for him, neither do the majority of the game's audience, judging by the glowing reviews on Steam. Without any spoilers, the ending just does not work, I'm sorry but that's not how the multiverse theory works. Reading a wikipedia article for 10mins then stringing together a sleuth of nonsense science mumbo-jumbo phrases to obscure the explanation just further shows how weak the core theory that the story is built upon is.\n\nOn the other hand, the gameplay itself is fine and I will admit that while the writing of the main plot is abhorently terrible, the character dialogue is still very polished and the voice acting is top-notch, giving you a sense of attachment to characters by the time the credits roll. \n\nThe DLCs Burial at Sea Episodes 1 & 2 are a mixed bag, adding some sorely needed mechanics such as being able to carry more than 2 weapons at a time but also severely limiting the amount of ammo you can carry to try and make it \"challenging\", which feels a lot like taking one step forward but also one step back. \n\nEpisode 2 has a greater focus on stealth, and with it comes some questionable changes to weapon handling and damage to encourage stealth play with some blatantly copied design from games like Dishonored, which is ironic considering that Dishonored with initially inspired by Bioshock 1 in the first place. And yet, the stealth sections are still handled better in games like Dishonored as Episode 2 will sending infinitely spawning enemies at you after you've knocked out all the guards for no good reason other than to, I dunno, be in keeping with the Bioshock \"Infinite\" title.\n\nThe story of the DLC aims to bridge the gap between Bioshock Infinite and Bioshock 1, providing explanations for some things but also opening up more plotholes than Elizabeth can open up tears during a gunfight, without explaning much of the holes left over from the base game.\n\nIf you're just looking for a fun shooter with colourful graphics and art design with well voice-acted characters and are not looking for a well curated and tightly written story (because this you will not find), then is game is for you! \n\nBut oh wait, you probably are planning to play this game for the story right? Oh well, keep on moving then, nothing to see here...\n\n6 interdimentional plotholes out of 10","timestamp_created":1543416866,"timestamp_updated":1543416866,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491421252489089966","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47165605","author":{"steamid":"76561198123283097","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1147,"last_played":1540257094},"language":"brazilian","review":"Se jogar com a mente aberta para entender toda a filosofia por trás do jogo, vai perceber o quanto ele é brilhante!","timestamp_created":1543412331,"timestamp_updated":1543412331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47164773","author":{"steamid":"76561198172177863","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":674,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":674,"last_played":1499516873},"language":"koreana","review":"잼","timestamp_created":1543409163,"timestamp_updated":1543409163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47164323","author":{"steamid":"76561198804584640","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":477,"last_played":1543406647},"language":"brazilian","review":"Mto bom","timestamp_created":1543407284,"timestamp_updated":1543407284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47163609","author":{"steamid":"76561198410544213","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1026,"last_played":1599228822},"language":"schinese","review":"伊丽莎白让我明白了电子游戏被称为第九艺术的原因，这不应该是游戏而是艺术","timestamp_created":1543404026,"timestamp_updated":1543404026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47162210","author":{"steamid":"76561198154716429","num_games_owned":616,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1562432203},"language":"schinese","review":"实在不好意思，我的语文水平不足以告诉你这款游戏有精彩。\n\n政治，哲学，物理，神学，历史。\n\n涉及这五大领域，且都挖的很深。\n\n极佳的游戏性，极佳的创意。\n\n值得剖析的剧情和设定。\n\n此乃真神作，心中无二。","timestamp_created":1543397272,"timestamp_updated":1543397272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47162085","author":{"steamid":"76561198060255898","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":78,"playtime_forever":513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1536440870},"language":"thai","review":"นี้เป็นความคิดเห็นส่วนตัว\n เป็นเกม action FPS ที่มีระบบ combat ที่แย่มาก+ถ้าคุณไม่ได้ชอบ เกมFPS แนว oldschool ด้วยแล้ว คุณจะยึ่งไม่ชอบเกมนี้เลย AI ที่ ธรรมดามาก ระบบ combatที่ไม่มีอะไรให้หน้าจดจำ (พวก Pure gun fight จะโครดไม่ชอบเลย) Gun Fight ที่ไม่สนุก แต่พอรวมๆกับ การใช้ เวตก็ทำให้การต่อสู้ดีขึ่นมาหน่อย \n\nถ้าหัวใจของAction+FPS  คือการทำให้ ทุกๆcombat สนุก ตื่นเต้น เร้าใจ ตัวเกมนี้ ล้มเหลวอย่างมาก \nอาจจะเป็นเพราะว่า ระบบ combat ที่ตกยุก \n\nหากใครซื่อเกมนี้ เพราะ Action ก็ลืมไปได้เลย","timestamp_created":1543396672,"timestamp_updated":1543396672,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495646834373474121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoIjnrOcCda70swE="}
