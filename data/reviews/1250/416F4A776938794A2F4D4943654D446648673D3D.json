Wave based combat against zombies is not a new idea and has been seen many times, but no other game masters the idea as well as Killing Floor. Maps are plentiful and expertly created and the actual zombies (or zeds as they are called in the game) are varied, disturbing, and dangerous. Dozens of weapons help with play value, and thats before solid dlc. Whats more surprising than anything however, is the games impressive ability to hold a community after all this time, and continue to support the game with content.
