Elizabeth ist meiner Meinung nach einer der besten Charaktere der Videospielgeschichte.\nSie ist sowohl eine Hilfe im Kampf, indem sie den Spieler mit Munition und Heilung versorgt als auch eine tolle Begleitung beim Erkunden, da sie immer wieder Dialoge anfängt und so die Welt richtig einbezieht. Außerdem kann sie durch ihre Fähigkeit die Map zum Vorteil des Spielers verändern.\nWen die Entwicklung interessiert: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSDDE3ICLhA\n\n1. Man wird ohne große Erklärung in die Welt geworfen und verfolgt die Mission \"Das Mädchen zurückholen\". Die Story wird nach und nach entfalten, um dann mit einem maximalen Mindfuck und einem offenen Ende zu schließen. Die Spekulation hier fand ich sehr interessant: \nhttps://www.ign.com/wikis/bioshock-infinite/The_Ending_-_An_Explanation\n\n2. Anfangs Wechsel zwischen gemütlichem Erkunden und Action; Man findet schnell in die Welt hinein\n\n3. Vergleich zu den Vorgängern: \nDas Gunplay funktioniert gleich wie schon in den Vorgängern, wird aber durch neue Bewegungsmöglichkeiten und Plasmide nicht langweilig.\nMan kann nur 2 Waffen tragen, jede hat 4 Upgrades, die man mit Geld kaufen kann. (E gedrückt halten, öffnet das Waffenmenü, wie mir Burial at sea nun begebracht hat)\nBei den Vigors (=Plasmide) gibt es jeweils 2 Upgrades, hier kann man stets alle ausrüsten (Q gedrückt halten!).\nDie Tonika sind hier in Form von Ausrüstungsgegenständen wieder dabei, hier ist die Anzahl auf 4 beschränkt.\nAuch gibt es für die einzelnen Abschnitte Charaktere, die eine Verbindung zur Hauptfigur aufbauen, so wie es schon in Teil 1+2 der Fall war, wodurch die Welt wirklich Bedeutung erhält. Sei es ein alter Freund aus Militärzeiten, die Rebellen der Vox Populi oder der allgegenwärtige Prophet mit seinen Schergen.\nAuch die bioshocktypischen Audiologs sind zurück, damit die Story mehr Tiefe erhält.\nZuletzt hat mich Songbird mit seiner Beziehung zu Elizabeth stark an die Big Daddy/Little Sister Verbindung erinnert.\n\n4. Die Musik im Spiel ist sehr gut gewählt und trägt zur Atmosphäre der Abschnitte bei.\nAußerdem lohnt es sich die Credits zu schauen, da dort der fantastischen Song, dem man im Spiel nur kurz angeteast finden kann, komplett drinnen ist.\n\nAbschließend kann ich das Spiel bzw. die ganze Collection allen Leuten empfehlen, die minimal etwas mit Shootern anfangen können und viel Wert auf eine tolle Story legen.

However they did remove the weapon wheel to where you can only carry two guns but miraculously pick up an enemy's gun and it will have all the upgrades you bought for the previous one.  They do bring back the weapon wheel in the Burial at sea, which is for another review.  How does Bioshock Infinite hold up compared to Bioshock?  I must say again it's great!  Though I am quite tired of the plot twist and turns it does make you think and I will admit after beating this game I would like to question just how it all worked.  The ending doesn't leave any loose ends and it just feels good to finish it.
