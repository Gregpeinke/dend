Really, it's a lot of fun and shouldn't be missed out either (if you have someone to play with). It was also one of the first games on Steam with Splitscreen support. Although it's made only for two players only, I'm pretty sure that it also would be funny with three or four people locally, when everyone's trying to figure a puzzle out together and the gamepads get handed around.\n\nLastly, there's the Workshop integration, and boy oh boy, are there a lot of puzzles. There are very complex ones with custom terrain and more simpler ones, created with the later released simpler editor, and there's an endless supply of new ones. I acctually recommend trying the simpler editor out yourself, just to see how hard it is to come up with puzzles.\n\nAnyways, this is a game that everyone should play, even if it's not your genre. Because this is one of those defining games others will draw inspirations from and have to be measured by for years to come.","timestamp_created":1415223738,"timestamp_updated":1446527787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622785210609436035","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12807688","author":{"steamid":"76561198093934524","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":6900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5580,"last_played":1652408697},"language":"english","review":"Amazing.

Valve definately knew what they were doing when they put this together. The story behind Aperture is intriguing, it makes you want to find out more about Cave Johnson and Caroline. It is not boring in the slightest either, sure some puzzles may test your skills to a point of searching for a walkthrough, and it is so easy to lose your way whilst exploring outside the test chambers. But once you realise what you are supposed to do you get a sense of pride when you finaly solve the puzzles, and the dialogue from Cave, GLaDOS and Wheatley is great. Talented voice actors reading a large amount of humorous lines, leads to an enjoyable experience to go along with the gameplay.\nPlus messing around with the portal gun is always fun, especially  when you get stuck - why not earn the 'terminal velocity' achievement whilst you work out how you're going to get that energy pellet to the receptacle.\nThe addition of the gels makes the game that much more unique, its great to try and place blue repulsion gel on every surface and bounce around like a bouncy ball.\nThe battle at the end is really not that difficult, slightly more difficult that the one at the end of Portal however the most dificult thing about it is finishing within the time limit.","timestamp_created":1415132091,"timestamp_updated":1496249395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12791028","author":{"steamid":"76561197981200455","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":115,"playtime_forever":2178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":411,"last_played":1579360581},"language":"italian","review":"Capolavoro!

Лично я начал играть в нее, а точнее сначала в первую часть portal, в дань уважения, и просто чтобы больше ознакомится с творениями valve. Решил купить ее после того как прошел halfe life 2 и e[isode one/two.\n - Немного о ее явных достоинствах.\nНу первым плюсом лично для меня было огромное количество пасхалок на Half life. И что не мало важно, что они не абы как сделаны, и вставлены в эту замечательную игру. То есть все они имеют место бысть именно там, где они есть. \nДальше мне очень понравился сюжет. Во первых геймплея в этом сюжете заметно больше чем в первой части. А во вторых сюжет не однообразный и до вязкости пошлый, а действительно интересный. Было очень интересно вместе с главной героиней узнать о том откуда все появилось, кто такая ГЛАДОС и т.д. и т.п. Вообще после первой части во вторую я начинал играть только чтобы пройти ее. Но я ни как не думал что она заинтересует меня как отдельно взятая игра, да еще и с таким увлекательным сюжетом.\nЕще одним не мало важным достоинством этой игры я считаю ее графику. Лично для меня графика в игре имеет оргромное значение. И играть в игры с графикой как в первом half life мне трудно. Конечно я уважаю первый hf, хотя бы потому, что в то время, когда эта игра была создана, аналогов ему не было, но сейчас должен уже другой уровень, и если смотреть, что Portal 2 была сделана в 2011 году, то есть почти 4 года назад, то я считаю что она до сих пор может сравниваться с играми, которые выходят сейчас. Даже если и в графике она проиграет, сюжет у нее на 100% в выигрыше. \n - К минусам в этой игре я бы отнес разве что ту же графику. Потому что хотя она и держится на уровне, но я бы хотел поиграть в нее с графикой как в Ведьмаке. Это было бы еще более незабываемо. В остальном я даже не знаю к чему и придраться, хотя возможно это из-за того что я действительно влюбился в эту игру, и особенно в ее сюжет. \n\nЗ.Ы.: Отдельное спасибо разработчикам за музыкальное сопровождение, за качественный перевод. Вообще огромное спасибо за эту игру.","timestamp_created":1415030102,"timestamp_updated":1415030102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12763332","author":{"steamid":"76561198062122364","num_games_owned":666,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":1050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":712,"last_played":1419706722},"language":"russian","review":"веселая игрушка, сюжет достойный, советую =)","timestamp_created":1415029701,"timestamp_updated":1415029701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12763017","author":{"steamid":"76561198146105483","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":428,"last_played":1419764030},"language":"french","review":"Tres bon jeu.","timestamp_created":1415028504,"timestamp_updated":1415028504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12762747","author":{"steamid":"76561197985990609","num_games_owned":714,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":640,"last_played":1415026989},"language":"english","review":"love ending song\nyou know what i mean  hah!","timestamp_created":1415027142,"timestamp_updated":1415027142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12762074","author":{"steamid":"76561198045252069","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":112,"last_played":1443149475},"language":"english","review":"There is no portal, because as long as you can read this, you can never see the day when HL3 will be released.\n11/10 Gabe made it for sale.","timestamp_created":1415023853,"timestamp_updated":1415023853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12761957","author":{"steamid":"76561198070921586","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1854,"last_played":1409769398},"language":"english","review":"If you liked Portal this is your cure for your withdrawal syndrom.

It's a perfect sequel, expanding upon what made the original fun without sacrificing its identity. The level design is exactly what you'd expect from Valve, the story and dialogue are hilarous, and there's a level creator for the PC version. The game is much longer than the original, but is still pretty short. The story is now much more involved. Instead of being a slightly generic \"Oh no, the robot was evil the whole time!\" story, it introduces some new characters and gives you a peek at some of Aperture Science's history. The game takes place in more \"behind the scenes\" areas than the first, considering that the actual test chambers are only about half of its levels. Overall, I'd give this game the highest rating I could give it, although you really have to play it. Seriously, if you haven't played this game I don't know what you're doing with your life.

Even balance of gameplay and storyline.  Music sends chills down the spine.  The PTI (Perpetual Testing Initiative) allows you and the community to endlessly create new maps and puzzles.  Extremely memorable game, worth every penny.  ***Your life is not quite complete until you play it.***\n\n(as you can see from my current 141 (Edit: 394!) hours on record, it is extremely good -- most of this has been spent making community puzzles)  The PTI is really intuitive and makes puzzle making easy.  Oh, and so are the gameplay mechanics themselves.  \n\nThe beginning sequence is really exciting without having you do anything, as the game mechanics come in later.  No annoying cut-scenes, except for the one found at the very end (which isn't annoying, it's awesome).  \n\nAnd the things GLaDOS and Wheatley say are skillfully humorous.","timestamp_created":1414885081,"timestamp_updated":1424927013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500480294227600098","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12733706","author":{"steamid":"76561198154132282","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1276,"last_played":1414191932},"language":"spanish","review":"Exelente juego donde tienes que resolver puzzles usando sistema de shooters","timestamp_created":1414883847,"timestamp_updated":1414883847,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12732985","author":{"steamid":"76561198042592347","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":529,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1425162991},"language":"english","review":"This is like what would happen if the Division of 0, Gabe Newell, the Spy, and a robot had a baby.","timestamp_created":1414881073,"timestamp_updated":1414881073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12732784","author":{"steamid":"76561198013282334","num_games_owned":312,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":1678,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1281,"last_played":1562802967},"language":"english","review":"A puzzle masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1414880348,"timestamp_updated":1573319052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12732709","author":{"steamid":"76561198113190608","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1170,"last_played":1448728632},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 in a shell nut\n\nPortals, British robot, multiplayer, stereotypical robot voices, gel, combustible lemons and potatoes!\n\nIn other words, there is nothing like Portal 2 except Portal 1 (to an extent)\n\nI r8 8/8, its gr8.","timestamp_created":1414880071,"timestamp_updated":1414880071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526627242565155029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12732327","author":{"steamid":"76561198062560907","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1621142333},"language":"english","review":"Pitch Perfect 2 is a very confusing movie.
