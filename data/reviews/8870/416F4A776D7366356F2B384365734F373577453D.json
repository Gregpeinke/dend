Bioshock infinite conseguiu me impressionar tanto quanto o primeiro jogo da saga, contendo, além de um gráfico bonito e mecânica mais fluida, uma história muito bem contada e que o fará coçar as \"caraminholas\" de sua cabeça até o último segundo de campanha.\n\nDe pontos positivos temos vários:\n\n-gráficos lindos e estonteantes, com detalhes bem feitos com o céu e as nuvens. Também temos inimigos mais detalhados tanto em rostos quanto vestimentas. O detalhe no micro não é perfeito, mas nota-se um capricho bem mais nítido do que os games anteriores. \n\n-mecânicas novas, como usar o gancho para se movimentar e atacar. As mecânicas com a Elizabeth também são boas, ela não é uma completa inútil como a Ashley de resident evil 4, ela ajuda a abrir portais, oferece suprimentos em momentos de aperto ( munição, kits médicos e poções de plasmids). Também teremos itens para equipar no corpo do personagem ( cabeça, torso, calças e botas) que dão status únicos muito bons. A exploração foi ampliada levemente, com vários lugares para acessar e adquirir itens melhores. A exploração em TODOS os jogos da saga é algo decisivo na dificuldade do game, então explore bastante os lugares.\n\n-história muito boa, com reviravoltas que vão fazer sua cabeça explodir de tanto pensar. Enquanto nos primeiros games temos uma cidade submersa, onde a religião é algo basicamente proibido e a ciência prevalecia, em Bioshock infinite temos o contrário: uma cidade voadora, onde o principal líder é um fanático religioso, racista, preconceituoso, etc. Realmente me impressionou bastante o game neste aspecto. Conseguiu ter uma história tão boa que é difícil dizer qual o mais elaborado, porque ambos são bons.\n\n-Poderes novos: realmente muitos dos poderes permaneceram, apenas com uma \"skin\" nova, mas também temos alguns novos poderes ( plasmids)  que vão dar uma nova cara ao game. As aparências cosméticas dos poderes também ficaram bem mais caprichadas, dando vontade de testar sempre para ver o efeito que causam.\n\nRedução de bugs: em toda minha jogatina, ocorreu apenas UM bug, que foi do ícone do dinheiro ficar travado na tela, e demorar pra sumir. Fora isso, o game quase não tem bugs e notou-se um capricho MUITO grande em relação á correção dos mesmos. Fiquei bem feliz de jogar a campanha inteira sem travar ou dar engasgadas.\n\nAgora os pontos negativos:\n\n-Dificuldade: ao contrário do que muitos podem pensar, bioshock infinite é, DISPARADO, o mais fácil da saga, onde você causa um dano absurdo nos inimigos e recebe muito pouco dano. Sem falar que temos agora um escudo que se regenera com o tempo, facilitando horrores na hora do combate. O game te dá tantos recursos ( munição, kit médico e plasmids) que você se sente um rambo da vida, metralhando, escopetando, pistolando, bazucando e sniperando. Realmente facilitou muito em relação aos anteriores. ( joguei a trilogia toda no normal) \n\n- Redução de mecânicas clássicas: Realmente uma coisa que me deixou bem irritado foi a retirada de duas coisas: dos slots de perks e dos hacks.  nos primeiros games da saga o hack de máquinas era basicamente essencial para facilitar a gameplay, pois fazia você economizar dinheiro, munição e tempo. Agora o único hack que você tem é um PLASMID, que você joga basicamente em quase todo inimigo ( humano ou máquina) que temporariamente ele será seu aliado... na verdade não reduziram o hack, removeram do game na cara dura mesmo. Os perks são basicamente inexistentes, sendo substituídos pelas roupas, onde você equipa alguma peça de roupa com algum park ou status diferenciado. Eu achei bem ridículo, mas paciência.\n\nResumo: o jogo é muito bom sim,é um bom bioshock e serve como um bom investimento para quem busca um complemento importante para o universo dos games. Se você quer algo desafiador, jogue no hard, porque no normal é bem fácil. Eu joguei todos os games no normal e achei este aqui o mais fácil.","timestamp_created":1577469870,"timestamp_updated":1577469870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60688898","author":{"steamid":"76561198023936344","num_games_owned":1093,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2984,"last_played":1431800294},"language":"english","review":"Ken Levine the finest!","timestamp_created":1577469812,"timestamp_updated":1577469812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60687955","author":{"steamid":"76561198296019156","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":514,"last_played":1577643521},"language":"english","review":" good innit","timestamp_created":1577468972,"timestamp_updated":1577468972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60685998","author":{"steamid":"76561198822255264","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":451,"playtime_forever":130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1593010817},"language":"russian","review":"Обалденная игра мне очень понравилась и я решил купить не пожалел.","timestamp_created":1577467202,"timestamp_updated":1644085447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60685067","author":{"steamid":"76561198073652303","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":837,"last_played":1481429041},"language":"brazilian","review":"BOOKER, CATCH!

Follow the game's story to its eventual end and you'll probably leave satisfied. Also Bioshock series is renowned for their unique artstyle and gameplay. The story of this game is also superb, which has enough hooks and thrills to get you playing till the end. Even the 2 splendid DLCs have richer story compared to other standalone games. \nAlso, here, as of now, I feel I've said too much. Truly, the real sensible review of this game is to instruct the reader to close this window, order the game and play it. It is simply that good. I would love to tell about the flying city of Columbia and the connection among Booker and Elizabeth, however to do so would risk ruining things. This is a game that lives and dies on its story and to uncover anything else of that to anybody who hasn't yet experienced it would be unforgivable.","timestamp_created":1577459268,"timestamp_updated":1650182665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmsf5o+8CesO75wE="}
