I enjoyed a lot of the games story and how it all played out. I have a good portion of problems with the game but most of them just boil down to GoldSrc ageing poorly. There's a mod called Half-Life: Restored that basically restores cut content from the base game.\n\nA couple things I have problems with is the AI, combat, and level design. The enemy AI is amazing. I love how well done the soldiers are. The Spec Ops can go suck my nuts though, those guys are annoying to kill. The team AI is the problem I have. They annoy the shit outta me. For example, lets say one of the guards are getting attacked, they just stand there and shoot at it. They don't even take cover just stand there right in the line of fire! Idiots! The combat gets really annoying at times. Freeman reloads way to slowly, like, sure Freeman, take your sweet time reloading that shotgun while you're being pelted with machine gun rounds! Taking cover doesn't always work and after mid game, just move around more. The level design gets really annoying late game. You get the long jump way too late in game. Xen is really linear and promotes no exploration at all. The last problem I have with the game is how vague the story is. I still don't understand what the hell a Resonance Cascade is. And whats up with G-Man? I know he's some inter-galactic being that can travel space and time and he's always watching the player (even in Opposing Force, Blue Shift and Decay), but he never really does anything except adjust his tie and talk to you at the end of the game. \n\nOver all, I give Half-Life a 7.2 out of 10. It's a really good game and I recommend you check it out. I had a lot of fun playing Half-Life and I hope you do too!","timestamp_created":1626441924,"timestamp_updated":1626441924,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95842398","author":{"steamid":"76561199077512014","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1628982024},"language":"english","review":"one of the best valve games","timestamp_created":1626441781,"timestamp_updated":1626441781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95838571","author":{"steamid":"76561198978329087","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":3713,"playtime_last_two_weeks":342,"playtime_at_review":1759,"last_played":1660456378},"language":"tchinese","review":"\"喂，等會來找我，我請你喝啤酒\"\n\n\n                                              -警衛","timestamp_created":1626436778,"timestamp_updated":1626436778,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95838017","author":{"steamid":"76561199062640835","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":758,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":758,"last_played":1625486987},"language":"english","review":"This game is a great way to refuel on some nostalgia.

life brought many things to the table in 1998 but there are many issues that shine through. The graphics are dated but that is okay, what is not okay is how many enemies blend into the background resulting in you missing constantly, it doesn't help that the crosshair is difficult to see at times. There were also moments were I shot a headcrab that was directly under my shotguns crosshair and I apparently missed. \n\nOutside of combat there was a lot of moments where I got lost and unsure of what to do.

The way the narrative is told is great as well, instead on cutscenes it's told seamlessly and the camera never leaves the players perspective.

I'm going to first go into what I liked about the game and then break down what I didn't. As a side note I played and beat it on the hardest difficulty so some of what I say may not apply for lower difficulties.\n\n-Starting strong, I really enjoyed how; for most of the challenges the game throws at you, there are multiple ways of dealing with them, whether they are intended or not. The freedom to choose how to deal with the situation allows you to be creative in your approach, which allows for a more enjoyable time all around. And if you're good at manipulating the game's physics engine it just opens more ways to play. \n-I also love how since the game is old and not very refined, a lot of unexpected things can happen involving entities. In my play-through I saw quite a few headcrabs clip a box I was pushing while lunging and just get catapulted, and it was amazing whenever they did.\n-And lastly I enjoyed how I was allowed to murder all the scientists I wanted without worrying about the game really stopping me (most of the time). I had my friend watching me play since he loves the game and his reaction every-time I drew my crowbar when a scientist was talking was great.\n\nI really struggled thinking of what I liked about the game but I wanted to at least include something so it didn't seem like I was just hating the game. I really came into it wanting to know why it was so well regarded. Now let's get on to the negatives.\n\n-Most of the guns in the game are just bad, having either pitiful damage or horrible fire rate (Sometimes both) or ungodly spread. Reload speed is also a big problem I had, I believe it takes like 4-6 secondes to reload the crossbow and the shotgun reloads a single slug per second I think. It might be more like .7 but that's still pretty bad.\n-Most enemy has their on bullshit that tends to just be annoying. Human enemies love spamming grenades, Vortigaunts like to hide in dark places and fire their hard hitting blasts at you that does 35-ish damage while you're trying too deal with another enemy and they'll just sometimes spawn in right behind you, the grunts have a homing weapon that fires slow so the tracking is really good and they always come is groups, bullsquids will just spit at you from across the map, and so on.\n-As soon as you are spotted by the enemy they all know where you are and the human enemies have hit-scan weapons almost guaranteeing you'll take damage.\n-The story is told through random npcs that you may just run by without realizing they were talking in the first place.\n-Dialogue is delivered super flat paired with bad audio.\n -The bosses are barely bosses. Until you get to Xen they are literally just, lead boss from area A to area B and hit button. That's if you even decide to fight them because you can just run past most of the time.\n-The movement is really floaty which is why you can abuse it so much, but for a casual player who isn't abusing it, it's just annoying and sometimes you'll just walk right off the ledge.\n-For half the game you're inside a boring foundation that get's old real quick.\n-And finally, the range on explosions are deceptively big, pair that with the human enemies spamming grenades it becomes a bad time.\n\nI'm not saying don't ever play this game, I'm just saying I think people get to hung up on the nostalgia and claim it's better than it is. I'd have to give it like a 4.5/10 as an actual game.","timestamp_created":1626289692,"timestamp_updated":1626289692,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466631621122360229","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95739937","author":{"steamid":"76561199070894815","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":559,"last_played":1658940057},"language":"spanish","review":"TA BUENO :)","timestamp_created":1626288150,"timestamp_updated":1626288150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95738896","author":{"steamid":"76561199067204285","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1658072178},"language":"german","review":"the game wont close HELP","timestamp_created":1626286729,"timestamp_updated":1626286729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95738163","author":{"steamid":"76561198857560552","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":574,"last_played":1626083877},"language":"english","review":"Masterpiece ahead of it's time","timestamp_created":1626285834,"timestamp_updated":1626285834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95736822","author":{"steamid":"76561199130522073","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1765,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1658444262},"language":"english","review":"hal fife","timestamp_created":1626284220,"timestamp_updated":1626284220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95735547","author":{"steamid":"76561198875004087","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":254,"last_played":1656189163},"language":"english","review":"This game is great, I have no clue how some people just can't enjoy it (look at negative reviews section). It may be an old game and the graphics might be bad or the physics is annoying, but it is waaaaay more fun than Half-Life2 in my opinion, here you are trying to escape the lab, in Half-Life2 you are just going back and forth doing random stuff (well not really but it feels like that). Now if you really are bored of half life because of \"It lacking gameplay (or anything really)\" then just use mods, my favourite mod is brutal half life, makes the game waaaay more fun than it already was. So that's my review, Half-Life is great!","timestamp_created":1626282670,"timestamp_updated":1626282670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95734286","author":{"steamid":"76561198251362342","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":108,"playtime_forever":632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1658512858},"language":"english","review":"Although i hate the current state of Valve; they totally revolutionised gaming more than once in the past so i really kind of still like them.\nAbout the game, it is still playable today and is a great example of how gaming is not just made up of great graphics and sound samples. The humor in this game is top notch and most of what some people call bugs/glitches are left in the game just to make it more fun.
