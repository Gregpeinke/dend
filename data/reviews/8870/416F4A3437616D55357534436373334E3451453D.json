Conviene fare questo gioco dopo aver giocato gli altri due? Questa è una recensione no-spoiler, ma la risposta curiosamente è \"no\". Si può giocare a Infinite anche senza aver fatto gli altri due BioShock. Tuttavia è d'obbligo farli prima di affrontare le due parti di Burial at Sea.\nChi ricorda i primi due capitoli, l'inizio di Infinite dà una certa sensazione di spaesamento.\nDagli ambienti claustrofobici del primo e a quelli più ampi ma ancora \"sigillati\" del secondo, si passa ad un'ambientazione completamente ribaltata, con una Columbia che fluttua nel cielo dando quella sensazione di \"spazi sconfinati\" mai vista nei precedenti capitoli.\nPoi, poco a poco, percorrendo le zone, si inizia a riconoscere il marchio di fabbrica che ha contraddistinto BioShock fin dal primo capitolo: nel bene e nel male.\nColumbine è l'esatto opposto di Rapture: lo è negli spazi aperti, nella gente che ci vive, nei colori, nei nemici. Ma le meccaniche di gioco sono sempre le stesse: un continuo cercare cercare e cercare oggetti ovunque, senza sosta, alla spasmodica ricerca di monete e consumabili, esplorando ampie zone anche slegate dal percorso principale e che puntualmente tornerai a rivisitare più tardi. E lo stesso con i pessimi automatismi del gioco, ovvero si libera un'area dai nemici, si entra in un'altra zona/porta/strada concludendo uno step di una missione, si torna indietro e bummm: nuovi nemici nella stessa zona precedente. Sempre.\nI difetti finiscono qui.\nI combattimenti con armi e plasmid rimangono anch'essi simili ai precedenti capitoli. I nemici hanno una IA piuttosto elementare: spesso si incastrano negli angoli, corrono poco o scoordinati, si dimenticano quasi subito di noi se ci nascondiamo e hanno in generale comportamenti più da allucinati che da gente normale. Però combatterli con le \"forze della natura\" e con una discreta varietà d'armi è divertente e regala grandi soddisfazioni.\nLe ambientazioni sono meravigliose, i personaggi buoni e cattivi sono caratterizzati alla grande, i dettagli sia scenografici che di sceneggiatura sono ammirevoli.\nLa trama generale è incredibilmente complessa, riuscire a starci dietro è complicato e l'effetto è amplificato se si sceglie la lingua inglese sottotitolata. Tuttavia il doppiaggio inglese è sublime, gli effetti sonori veramente d'impatto e le musiche accompagnano i combattimenti donando la giusta dose d'ansia.\nI due DLC da una parte chiudono la trama della trilogia, dall'altra riescono ad essere ancor più un ritorno alle origini con ambientazioni claustrofobiche e vecchi personaggi e nemici mai dimenticati.\nIn sintesi parliamo di un gioco veramente superlativo, non perfetto ma carismatico a non finire. Si passa troppo tempo a cercare, cercare e cercare, con l'ansia di non avere abbastanza \"lockpick\" per aprire le serrature, di non avere abbastanza bonus per sconfiggere i nemici, di ritrovarsi in aree precedentemente ripulite con un fastidioso \"respawn\" dei nemici.\nMa che capolavoro scenico, che trama coinvolgente, che personaggi fantastici!\nConsigliatissimo, anche a tanti anni di distanza dalla sua uscita.","timestamp_created":1575586320,"timestamp_updated":1575586320,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59309504","author":{"steamid":"76561198023233186","num_games_owned":1523,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1576165082},"language":"english","review":"interesting story by far.

I kept insisting to myself that I liked the game but that I am just terrible at finishing games. I am terrible at finishing games but I do not, in fact, like this game. My third and final attempt to play through bioshock infinite came right after a replay of the other two bioshock games. I love bioshock 1 and 2 for their wonderful atmosphere, dense levels that are a joy to explore, and very importantly, very little downtime. \nThis brings me to bioshock infinite. The game has larger, less dense and interesting levels, levels that require the addition of sprinting into the game. The atmosphere is less strong. But most unforgivably, the game has constant downtime. Now, by downtime, I mean moments in the game where absolutely nothing interesting is happening. No exploration, no combat, instead you are just walking through a mostly empty level or even worse, listening to Elizabeth drone on and on about uninteresting things.\nThis brings me to the combat. In bioshock 1 and 2, the choice to engage in combat was one of the most important things you would face. In these games, resources were very limited, so when you encounter something like a big daddy, you have to consider if you have enough ammo and health to do so, and if spending those resources to kill it will be worth the adam that they provide.\nBioshock infinite has absolutely none of these elements. Instead you are positively showered with ammo and healing items, thrown to you every 2 seconds by Elizabeth. There is very little in the way of choosing your battles.\nNext is the story. Bioshock 1 and 2 told you the story via radio communication with your allies and you enemies. This is genius game design because it allows the story to be told to you without grinding the gameplay to a painful halt. Bioshock infinite decides to can this element and instead slows the game down to a crawl to force feed you the story.
