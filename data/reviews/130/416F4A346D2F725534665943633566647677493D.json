to Opposing Force, Blue Shift is probably the weaker expansion to HL1.

There isn't anything inherently wrong with the fact that it's short; if it were better designed, I would probably look at it more positively. However, along with its tiny runtime, I thought the level design was weaker than in Opposing Force. Blue Shift is also a bit on the easy side and I felt drowned with ammo and medkits compared to HL1 and OF. The end comes rather abruptly and, while I didn't have a bad time, I felt a little unsatisfied.\n\nAll that being said, I would still give Blue Shift a tentative recommendation if you enjoyed HL1.

Барри делает только то, что велят ему другие сотрудники, и в основном занимается тем, что восстанавливает функционирование различной техники, что в этом, что в пограничном мире. Даже арсенал состоит исключительно из человеческого оружия, никакого экспериментального или инопланетного. Да, есть секрет с жуками, но он почти в самом конце и его легко пропустить.\n\nВроде и неплохо, но в то же время нет удовлетворённости от прохождения.\n\nP.S. Удивительно, но в игре нет субтитров.
