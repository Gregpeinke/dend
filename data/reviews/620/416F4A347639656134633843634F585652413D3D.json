2 no es un juego para todo el mundo, esta mas bien centrado para jente que le guste el tema de jugar con tranquilidad, tomandose su tiempo para pensar que van a hacer a continuacion para resolver los puzzles. Empezare dando mi opinion entorno a las diferentes partes del juego:\n\n-Graficamente: Los graficoes del juego estan muy muy bien, ha enbegecido de una forma formidable y, su rendimiento es ejemplar, Source ya es un motor muy viejo pero ha demostrado que puede competir contra los motores mas nuevos. Valve si ha demostrado algo es que sabe como hacer motores graficos, que en este area ya no tengo nada mas que añadir.\n\n-Jugabilidad: La jugabilidad de Portal y Prtal 2 es muy muy caracteristico, ya que tienes que usar la pistola de portales y los recursos del entorno para completar los puzzles. El modo multijugador es algo nuevo para Portal pero le sienta muy bien, es muy entretenido y da muchisimas horas de juego, junto con los mapas creados por la comunidad (que lo comentare a continuacion)\n\n-Mods: Si hay algo que caracterice a Valve es el como permite a la comunidad crear y distribuir sus modificaciones para los juegos de Valve de forma gratuita, algo de lo que todos los consumidores de modificaciones les estamos muy agradecidos, pero con Portal 2 no solo permiten a los Moders profesionales crear sus mods, si no que tambien han creado una herramienta dentro del propio juego que permite a cualquier persona con algo de imaginacion crear sus propios mapas y distribuirlos medianto el workshop de forma gratuita, lo malo de la herramienta es que es muy basica, y yo, por ejemplo, he creado un par de mapas, y lo malo es que solo los puedes hacer con unas medidas especificas maximas y no te dan tantas herramientas para crear como si fueses un moder profesional (cosa que no lo soy).\n\n-Historia: La historia de Portal, al principio, no parece nada del otro mundo, hasta que juegas a todos los Half-Life, entonces te das cuenta de la magnitud de la historia que, desde mi punto de vista, es magnifica.\n\nEn conclusion, Portal 2 junto con Portal son obras maestras, y eso que tubo muchas criticas Portal 2 cuando salio, pero yo le doy un 9-9,5/10, muy muy muy recomendable.","timestamp_created":1442525341,"timestamp_updated":1485714774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18075257","author":{"steamid":"76561198112778130","num_games_owned":463,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":735,"last_played":1655842151},"language":"english","review":"I REALLY RECOMMEND IT!","timestamp_created":1442520145,"timestamp_updated":1442520145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18074941","author":{"steamid":"76561198043377526","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1716,"last_played":1527349649},"language":"english","review":"Best game I have ever played :3","timestamp_created":1442518671,"timestamp_updated":1442518671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18074707","author":{"steamid":"76561198165525511","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2017,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1610120572},"language":"english","review":"Great game.\n\nJust don't play with a friend, they're evil and you know it...","timestamp_created":1442517632,"timestamp_updated":1482494550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18072604","author":{"steamid":"76561197987625231","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":438,"last_played":1453817411},"language":"english","review":"I quote Oli Welsh, \"Portal is perfect.

Sin embargo, la riqueza y variedad de los escenarios es mucho mayor, además de que éstos son dinámicos y cambian en gran medida conforme avanzamos en el juego.\n\nAdemás de los clásicos elementos que pudimos encontrarnos en Portal (botones, torretas, cajas, etc.), deberemos hacer uso de nuevos mecanismos, como puentes de luz, rayos transportadores o láseres. Dichos mecanismos añaden variedad, pero no incrementan la dificultad de manera notable. De hecho, no sé si es debido a que ya estaba acostumbrado a la forma de resolver los puzzles en la primera parte, pero la mayoría de los obstáculos de Portal 2 me han resultado sencillos, y en general he podido avanzar sin quedarme atascado prácticamente nunca. El juego se puede completar sin problemas en menos de 10 horas.\n\nPor último, el juego incorpora un modo multijugador cooperativo, como he comentado anteriormente.

It had put its remarkable signature when it was first released and even now, after 9 years, Portal 2 can be easily identified as a \"masterpiece\" with puzzles, narrative, its original soundtrack, gameplay, and so much more. \n\n[b] Story [/b]\nThe story once again takes place in our lovely Aperture Science facility where it is now rotten, seemingly abandoned, due to the shut down of GLaDOS. Wheatley, [spoiler] which is the Aperture Science core of being a moron, [/spoiler] wakes the player and starts a journey to escape the facility once and for all. Yet, things are going to get a lot troublesome as the facility wakes up once again [spoiler] alongside GLaDOS herself [/spoiler].\n\nThe narrative in Portal 2 is simply amazing. The \"host leads the player\" aspect is still kept by numerous NPCs in the game and all the dialogues are so original that it still feels fresh as if it wasn't done in the original Portal already. You feel the immense pressure, joy, relaxation, rush, and tense moments as the NPCs join you till the various parts of the level.\n\n[b] Soundtrack [/b]\nSimply amazing, if not a masterpiece.  Is it possible to craft a track piece that suits all the different themes in a single game? Portal 2 clearly shows that it indeed is.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\nWe are once again assisted by our one and only Portal device. The test chambers' designs are unique and will test your ability to evaluate multiple things from multiple perspectives at once. Alongside our iconic Portal 2 device, we have a new feature that adds a new color to the game which is the gel system. Honestly, with all the narrative, OST, and new levels it is impossible to claim the gameplay as \"dull\" or the \"same\".\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nPortal 2 was born as a masterpiece and is still as masterpiece. If you hadn't played Portal 2, you are  [u] clearly missing A LOT. [/u] With many twists, levels that require various new methods, well-written character development, story, and a finale, Portal 2 will always have a special spot amongst other games.","timestamp_created":1442240667,"timestamp_updated":1593453645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18030743","author":{"steamid":"76561198089093671","num_games_owned":596,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":671,"last_played":1442172772},"language":"brazilian","review":"Eu Simplesmente AMO este game !","timestamp_created":1442240076,"timestamp_updated":1442240076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18030402","author":{"steamid":"76561198079563685","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":838,"last_played":1454476636},"language":"english","review":"Very relaxing and humorous.

Но жанр этот в чистом виде не был популярен до тех пор, пока одни талантливые студенты из Института технологий DigiPen, что в Редмонде, не взяли и не сделали Narbacular Drop. Это дело заприметили парни из Valve и вместе с разработчиками Нарбакулара сваяли Portal. Это был прорыв в жанре. Однако, несмотря на все прелести первого Portal, он так и оставался экспериментом, а не действительно полноценной игрой. Пока Вентили не сообразили Portal 2.\n\nВторая часть портальной эпопеи, вышедшая в 2011-м году, моментально стала культовой. Valve в который уже раз умудрились собрать выдающуюся игру. Справедливости ради стоит отметить, что жанр головоломок от первого лица занят исключительно инди-разработчиками, у которых нет ни достаточно людей, ни бюджета. Однако даже если бы у кого и было всё это, он бы вряд ли переплюнул Portal 2.\n\nИбо эта игра является комплексом, вобравшим в себя множество деталей и заставившим их всех работать ради одной цели – очаровать игрока. Сюжет Portal 2 строится вокруг уже знакомых героинь – Челл и GLaDOS. Однако если в первой части всё развитие персонажей было завязано исключительно на колкостях ГЛэДОС, то здесь не только эта парочка, но и даже сбоившие турели стали продуманными персонажами с разветвлёнными характерами. Сценаристы провели большую работу, дабы мы, игроки, убедились, что перед нами вполне себе живые существа. Актёры тоже выложились на полную. Причём, что приятно, и английские, и наши. Так что если у вас кровоточили уши от кошмарной русскоязычной ГЛэДОС в первой части, то можете расслабиться: во второй наша ГЛэДОС ничем не хуже Эллен МакЛейн.\n\nНо на одном сюжете игра не держится: Portal 2 не был бы им, если б тут не было портальной пушки, которая не претерпела изменений, но зато стала отличным помощником не только при решении головоломок от ГЛэДОС. Стандартные камеры значительно изменились. Появилось много новых элементов, которые отлично разнообразят игровой процесс (где моя пневмотруба?!). Среди них как очевидные, вроде лазеров и кубов, отражающих их свет, так и абсолютно новые, хотя и тоже взятые из другой студенческой игры. Гели. Их три штуки, и каждый из них является отличным дополнением к вашей пушке. Чаще всего они находятся там, где их поместили по сюжету конструкторы испытательных камер. Но бывают случаи, когда их можно найти как будто случайно – это ощущение неизвестности изрядно добавляет интереса к прохождению. Не всё же время быть лабораторной мышкой?\n\nИтак, игровой процесс остался почти неизменным, чего не скажешь про камеры испытаний. Действие игры развернётся ещё и за кулисами. То, что там творится, совершенно не похоже на стерильные камеры, построенные ГЛэДОС. Путешествие за занавес, скорее всего, придётся вам куда больше по душе, потому что оно вызовет в вас дух исследователя. И портальная пушка в таком случае станет не просто инструментом в руках, наподобие молотка, которым надо гвоздь забить, а хорошим другом, могущим выручить в трудную минуту.\n\nВместе со всем этим одну цель преследует и музыка с художественным стилем. В отличие от первой части, музыка во второй перешла из амбиентов в ярко выраженную электронику. И, так как почти все персонажи – роботы, то и музыка стала очень к месту. Кстати говоря, её можно скачать бесплатно как с официального сайта, так и напрямую через Steam. Визуальный стиль несколько изменился: теперь в игре преобладает не белый и жёлто-коричневый цвета, а светло-синий. Таким образом, стиль игры несколько прохладнее оригинала, что очень неплохо играет на руку атмосфере. Это, конечно, не ужастик (ведь рейтинг не больше 10+), но иногда холодок по спине пробегает, и это круто!\n\nОднако это всё лирика. Конечно же, самым главным достоинством является то, что Valve развили оригинальную идею и грамотно подали в виде полноценной игры, а не пусть и прекрасного, но всё же эксперимента. Portal 2 стала законодателем моды в жанре головоломок от первого лица. И найти сейчас игру, в которой не было бы кубического окружения или кнопок для грузового куба, почти невозможно. Короче говоря, игра действительно хороша как в жанре, так и сама по себе. Portal 2 рекомендуется не только всем уже имеющим опыт в играх людям, но и тем, кто хочет приобщиться к интерактивному искусству впервые. Portal 2 является самой подходящей для этого кандидатурой.","timestamp_created":1442149182,"timestamp_updated":1442149182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539363503456115723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18014669","author":{"steamid":"76561198133081944","num_games_owned":2497,"num_reviews":131,"playtime_forever":413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":412,"last_played":1471853311},"language":"english","review":"indeed","timestamp_created":1442147082,"timestamp_updated":1442147082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18011585","author":{"steamid":"76561198153405881","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2019,"last_played":1637881861},"language":"french","review":"Tres bon","timestamp_created":1442132566,"timestamp_updated":1442132566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18010330","author":{"steamid":"76561198055461246","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":9504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":10,"playtime_at_review":6418,"last_played":1659828128},"language":"french","review":"ce jeu est un des meilleur car on peut y passer plus de 20 heures même en l'ayant fini 5-6 fois, il est toujours aussi bien !","timestamp_created":1442125100,"timestamp_updated":1572202035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18010163","author":{"steamid":"76561198031646846","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":328,"last_played":1480787619},"language":"english","review":"Standing Ovation here.

Right. There aren't any. \nIf you have even a passing interest in Valve software (and since you are reading this on Steam you almost certainly do) there is no excuse not to buy and play this through to the end. Containing a solid 6-10 hour single-player campaign that, while centering on robots, has enough humanity to create a narrative not dissimilar in themes or quality to the likes of Wall-E, and a co-op campaign with a weaker story but mind-bogglingly difficult puzzles that require true teamwork, Portal 2 has no shortage of content. And that's without even mentioning the perpetual testing initiative which literally offers infinite content and a stellar level creator. And, while I won't be specific so as to avoid spoilers, this game's finale is on a scale of epic not unseen in the likes of Halo (PC Master Racers, please don't kill me) or Battlefront, and this is a puzzle game we're talking about here. A puzzle game with an epic, explosive climax and a sci-fi story so immersive you forget it's just a game? Only Valve. Not to discredit Half-Life 2, which is undoubtledy amazing, but in my mind no Valve game has ever been better than Portal 2. That is, until Half-Life 3...\n\nBuy this game. Now. And if you already own it, buy a copy for someone who doesn't, and play it with them. Everyone NEEDS to play this game. I've seen Candy Crushers and CoD fans alike fall in love with this game.
