Auch die Grafik kann sich für das Jahr 2004 durchaus sehen lassen. DIe Gestik und Mimik der Charaktere sind einfach grandios und kann sogar mit einem aktuellen Spiel wie zum Beispiel GTA V konkurrieren. \nMit diesem Spiel hat Valve den anderen FPS-Entwicklern gezeigt wie man einen richtigen FPS entwickelt.

This game is great in almost every way. With a suspenseful and action-packed   story, and plenty of weapons to slaughter some zombies or combine! When this was released back in 2004, most people sh!t their pants. Now about the zombies, this is the most strange, gross, and creative way of making a zombie ive ever seen! Just incredible! How did they think of such a type of zombie like that?! This is one of the best games I have ever played, and it has almost no flaws, the puzzles are great, graphics were amazing for its time, and the action and gameplay is incredible, and all for only $9.99! Half Life 2, buy it now, as I give it a  5/5","timestamp_created":1388519656,"timestamp_updated":1388519656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpJGOpcMCcu2kIA=="}
