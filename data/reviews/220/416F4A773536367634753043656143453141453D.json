But it was still a fun game. The story has lots of fun and joy too offer. It has some great puzzles, even after playing through it a full 3 times the puzzles can still make me confused. The enemies are great, though a bit easy they are way better than the old HECU marines (At least combine use grenades as a last ditch effort, Instead of non stop bumbardments like the HECU do.) And the achievements are a fun challenge to get, I should know. I ran through the game once back when I first got it, Then I re did it so I could Remember the story. And a third time to achieve all of the achievements. I totally recommend this game, don't just throw away your $9.99 just to get garrys mod content. Actually play the game and see how you feel about it, and if you're an achievement hunter. . . Have fun finding all 45 lambda caches.

Marco el destino de un género.\n\nEl juego ofrece todo lo que se puede pedir a un shooter: buen sistema de disparo, buena jugabilidad y una historia que hace que progresar en el juego tenga un interés para saber como avanza la historia.\n\nPara su época tenía cosas muy novedosas, como la pistola antigravedad que hoy en día no te impactarán tanto. La historia es interesante aunque no me ha hecho empatizar con los personajes como otros títulos. El principal punto negativo es que la historia queda inconclusa ya que Valve decidió no sacar el episodio 3 (o half life 3 en su defecto) que culminaba este juego.\n\nJuego entretenido aunque que no esté concluido es una burla a los millones de fans de esta saga. Buen juego, sin embargo, me esperaba más en algunos apartados y en la historia.

If you have no mini map or at least a mission tracking list you just dont know what to do next and need search for the way forward.

Some decade-old antique, maybe. Instead, I got one of the most thrilling and fun gameplay experiences in my life! The fantastic mechanics, level design, story, and characters all work together like a well-oiled machine.\n\nEach weapon is unique and satisfying to use, with movement and combat straight-forward and yet allowing room for exploration and puzzle-solving.

Since then, the game has built a massive reputation and has been called \"The Best Game of All Time\" on more than one occassion. Today, this is an even vaster overstatement than it was at the time. However, it is clear why the game left such an impression on so many people.\n\nThe \"physics\" part is fairly rudimentary. The experience really boils down to plugging cables and using gravity puzzles to further your advance. But you know what? I had fun plugging those cables and using stupid wooden planks to cross a gap. to have an impact on your environment in this way still _IS_ a fun experience. And despite its dated graphics this makes you believe that the environment is more than just a static arrangement of carefully placed assets.\n\nThese puzzles are all blatantly obvious and have equally obvious solutions. But along with a strong game opening, where you escape from the Combine forces in a hectic and well scripted chase, this makes you buy into the world so much more. Half Life 2 is an overall fun video game experience.\n\nBut it's far from perfect. Compared to HL1 your arsenal isn't nearly as rich and the gunplay itself is really primitive. And this is fine if you understand the type of game you are playing: You play a theoretical physicist. Sure, you mow down dozens of Combine soldiers as if you were John Rambo himself but the most interesting aspects of the game demand you to use your brain instead of brawn.\n\nThe zombie infested Ravenholm isn't scary. It's fun! Instead of popping zombie heads with your good ol' shotty you slash them in half with frigging Buzz-saws propelled by your Gravity-Gun. Got a group of zombies? Ignite some gas and light 'em up! That's way more metal AND satisfying.\n\nReally, this game needs to be approached with the notion of a sandbox game. Seriously, there is fairly little challange in the game and health and ammo is dropped in utter abundance. If you play this game like a Space Marine, you are in for a disappointment. Imagine yourself the hero scientist that is Gordon Freeman and enjoy the game for what it is. The game shines best when you require your brain instead of brawn\n\nThe game has serious issues, even more so from a modern perspective. The gunplay is boring, weapons like the rocket launcher feel weak, enemy design is mostly lacking, the story is nothing that the game can brag about. And the only logical explanation why Gordon doesn't speak is that he is mute. It's kind-of hilarious.\n\nBut if you want any of the above, I'd suggest you play a more classic FPS of the time like Doom 3 or Quake 4 (heck, even the audio logs of D3 felt more engaging at some point). Again: This ain't no game for Spess Mahreens.\n\n\n\"Do I recommend this game?\"\nI guess, yeah. The game is fairly cheap now and I'm sure you won't find a game with a similar experience. The game tries to be fairly realistic and pulls it off in many areas, even from today's point of view. It's a cool window into the exciting days of early 2000's when technology was finally at a point to become semi-close at deliver a believable world.\n\nIt still features the innocence of classic 90s gaming with a more ambitious take on what developers can do with more powerful tech. They clearly had a creative vision of gaming that never came to be. Just for that, it is worth investigating :)\n\nRemark: I played \"Half Life 2: Update\" which features some graphical enhancements.","timestamp_created":1571518705,"timestamp_updated":1571518705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55675304","author":{"steamid":"76561198400555016","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1026,"last_played":1631549408},"language":"spanish","review":"Definió

It is definitely one of the best games I have ever played.\nFirst, the graphics have aged really well. It is clear at first glance that this is an older game, but the art direction is great and the level of detail for a 2004 game is simply stunning.\nThen, the gameplay. Gunplay feels great and responsive. The variety of guns is good and the weapons all feel unique. My only minor complaint is that it is not entirely clear to a new player how the RPG works. I thought you just aimed at a target and it would track that target, but it actually aims the rocket where you point at the entire time the rocket is active.\nAnd that leads me to my next point. The way the game teaches you its mechanics is marvelous. Whether it's learning about how the crowbar can destroy wooden planks or getting a hang of the gravity gun, the tutorials are organically integrated into the gameplay and don't feel \"game-y\" at all.\nThe music and sound design is great as well. Whenever there is music, it is fitting and really amplifies the current mood. Whether it's a fast-paced track for fighting a dropship or entering the citadel you've been seeing your entire playthrough for the first time, the music is atmospheric and catchy.\nOverall, if you like single-player games just a tiny bit, you should give this game a try. You will have about 10 hours of quality gameplay and likely some more by having fun with Source's cheats!\nThank you for reading my review!","timestamp_created":1571082117,"timestamp_updated":1571082117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55604939","author":{"steamid":"76561198174835337","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":81,"playtime_forever":61,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61,"last_played":1536768982},"language":"english","review":"Quit gaming 8 months ago.

No accurate lip syncing and the in-game models being kinda poor with minimal lighting and almost no details like the brightness of light changing after you got out of a dark area, the way you perceive light in real life copied in a video game, People in 2004 lost their sh*t over the changes half life 2 made, it's also interesting to see how much power we, the player, are given with the gravity gun, yes you can move objects and chuck them at people for an insta-kill yet it never felt too overpowered, the depth of the lore is amazing to the point where no matter how many NPCs tell you or show you, you'll never get all the lore in one playthrough. The source engine and half life 2 it'self might be heavily outdated in modern standards it's still amazing how the game still is fun and still looks good in this day and age, just not \"beautiful\" as it used to be, things that are now minor details in games started off here.","timestamp_created":1570986988,"timestamp_updated":1570986988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55588798","author":{"steamid":"76561198975712294","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1573388357},"language":"russian","review":"12/10 ИГРА ГОДА!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1570985605,"timestamp_updated":1570985605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486618012189865112","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55587668","author":{"steamid":"76561198827393479","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":1600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1507,"last_played":1644771250},"language":"turkish","review":"Çook iyidi.
