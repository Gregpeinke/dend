The game is short and sweet and doesn't over stay its welcome like Portal 1. Some may find that disapointing, but with the added feature of co-op, there will still be many hours worth gameplay to be had with a friend. And with inevitable updates in the future, one can only see that this game will truly age well. \n \nPros: Everything! \n \nCons: Nothing!","timestamp_created":1303361695,"timestamp_updated":1303361695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2719826","author":{"steamid":"76561198011602989","num_games_owned":666,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":1892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1812,"last_played":1368687600},"language":"english","review":"Another great game from Valve, maybe the best up to date.
