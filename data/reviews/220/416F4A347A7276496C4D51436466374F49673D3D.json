Having only played a little bit of Half-Life 1 on PS2 (which really doesn't do justice to the PC version), I decided I'd give Half-Life 2 a try, and see what all the fuss was about. The gameplay is simple but smooth. The Gravity Gun is a great unique edge, setting the game apart from typical shooters. There are no gaping flaws. On top of this, I was immediately blown away by the dystopian setting, and brilliantly executed Orwellian atmosphere. The story of Half-Life is incredibly executed, and City 17 echoes the oppression of a Soviet dictatorship. The settings range from Vertigo style \"fugitive-on-the-run\" rooftop setpieces to dark, terrifying villages, overrun with monsters, to vehicular chase sequences on land and sea. This may evoke a worry of suffering the GTA syndrome, of having many features, but not being very good at any of them. The shooting is what it needs to be, and is on at least the same level as Halo. It is slick, and has a good feel to it. The story is one of the best gaming has told. It had me invested the whole way through. I don't want to say too much out of fear of spoiling it. Of course the opening \"rooftop-runner\" setpiece isn't a patch on Mirror's Edge, but that game was built around parkour, and so is an unfair comparison. The horror based level won't be as frightening as Amnesia or Penumbra, but if you aren't scared by it, you must lack a soul. The vehicles don't handle as well as in Forza or GT, but this ain't a racing game! And in relation to the chases they are utilised in, it is every bit as thrilling as being chased by cops through Liberty City/Los Santos. It surely beats an modern-military turret section by several, several, several, several miles.\n\nAnother incredible feat is that Half-Life isn't laid out in distinct levels. Chapter titles may flash on the screen, and you can choose a particular point in the game where to start from. But never do you leave Gordon Freeman's perspective. You are put in the shoes of a protagonist on what feels like an Odyssean epic, and it gives the game a liberatingly open feel. It may be seen as linear, as in the end, the aim is to get from Point A to Point B (as was almost the literal plot for Half-Life 1), but it's more a case of being given a vast map, and that map is your playground, to execute your objectives on your own terms. It. Is. Wonderful.\n\nOverall, Half-Life 2 is nothing short of phenomenal. It is ten years old, but it blows every modern shooter out of the water. It even graphically holds up. You don't need to be a fan of action games or Sci-Fi. If you love games, you owe it to yourself to play Half-Life 2 (and check out it's predecessor).","timestamp_created":1392596173,"timestamp_updated":1392596173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9147386","author":{"steamid":"76561198071778510","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":2551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2205,"last_played":1430046041},"language":"czech","review":"Písal sa rok 1998 a svetlo sveta uzrela hra Half-Life 2.

It starts out with Gordon Freeman arriving at work in Black Mesa. He is a theoretical physicist tasked with delivering a crystal specimen into a test chamber. When the whole experiment goes to hell, he has to fight through it to survive. To avoid spoiling the story, I'll skip way ahead to the events of HL2. There, the Combine, a transuniversal alien race, has surgically altered many humans to suppress the survivors on their behalf in an effort to take over Earth. The Combine has drained a significant portion of the oceans, as well as sucking the Earth dry of its resources. The level design will often reflect that, such as in Ravenholm, where the once-living residents of the town are now shambling corpses hostile to living humans, and gruesome sights are commonplace. Then there's the coast, where the dock is now on the beach because the shore has receded quite far back due to aforementioned draining of the oceans. Due to Gordon Freeman's actions, however, he sparks a revolution to overthrow Combine rule and take back Earth.\n\nWhat's often overlooked is his silence. The whole reason that Gordon Freeman never speaks is because it would ruin it for a lot of people. His character is never known for talking, and even Gabe Newell himself acknowledges that Gordon Freeman should not talk.  You can interpret it in many ways, but I like to think of it as being a \"silent badass\"\n\nAs for the flaws I mentioned earlier, I do admit that the game feels slightly empty given the fact that there are less weapons this time around. But you have to remember that the developers did consider adding some of HL1's weapons back in, but they had reasons for throwing these ideas out. Finally, the description of the game does oversell it, but it's a fantastic game nonetheless. You rarely see a game bringing these ideas to the table, let alone executing them in such an expert manner. The only reason I can see someone would be disappointed with this game is because many games today emulate the Half-Life series, and by now Half-Life's themes seem so commonplace. Nevertheless, this game is still so, so unique and can be instantly distinguished at a mere glance from most other games in existence. That is just a further testament to its long-standing originality, professional design, and overall excellence.\n\ntl;dr - Amazing game, especially for its time, even with its minor flaws. 9.9/10","timestamp_created":1392423054,"timestamp_updated":1392423054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9110443","author":{"steamid":"76561198090152732","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1403631871},"language":"english","review":"Quite challenging even on the easy settings","timestamp_created":1392419805,"timestamp_updated":1392419805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9110071","author":{"steamid":"76561198094597965","num_games_owned":879,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":833,"last_played":1472403597},"language":"english","review":"Do I have to say anything?

La jugabilidad es muy superior a muchos de los FPS actuales, en parte por la fantástica \"pistola antigravedad\". El juego además siempre proporciona varias maneras creativas de acabar con tus oponentes. \nLa inmersión es espectacular, debido a la cantidad de detalles que VALVe añadió (en los escenarios, la banda sonora, etc.). El ambiente opresivo de Ciudad 17 es sin duda una de las cosas mejor logradas en toda la historia de los videojuegos. \nLas armas están equilibradas y la calidad gráfica continua siendo extrañamente buena, aunque se notan los años en comparación con los juegos actuales. \nCada parte está estructurada majestuosamente. Conforme vas avanzando vas adquiriendo armas nuevas, lo que abre más posibilidades a la hora de neutralizar a los enemigos. Las partes de vehículos, aunque a veces largas, siempre intercalan tiroteos en los que has de bajarte y caminar. la cohesión de los hechos es magnífica.\nLa historia está contada de una manera espectacular, muy creíble (de hecho, la mayor parte la has de deducir tú, gracias a pequeños comentarios de los diferentes personajes o a la narrativa visual que el juego ofrece en algunos momentos).\nAunque a veces se puede volver un poco lineal (sobre todo en las partes de vehículos) es un juego impresionante.

The open worlds allow for you to pissfart around, and spawn stuff through the console. A tremendous game, even for those just for looksies.

Игра всё так же интригует, погружает вас в динамичный процесс, заставляет всё так же сильно сопереживать героям и всему прочему происходящему. Она так же умело удивляет вас и позволяет насладиться своей красотой. Графическая составляющая всё ещё держит позиции. А о физической составляющей я думаю не стоит и упоминать. Экшен, головоломки и Большая история, которая началась намного раньше и которая имеет продолжение, но к сожалению пока не имеет конца. Но этого не стоит пугаться.
