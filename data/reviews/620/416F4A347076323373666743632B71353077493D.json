I’d played it several times before, but never with the context of having played the first game. I had my reservations, already understanding that the sequel employs some…louder, stylistic choices.  Would Portal 2 be the same uproariously funny, exciting adventure buoyed by creative and stimulating puzzles?\n\tWhen the story begins, it becomes almost immediately apparent that something went wrong in Aperture. After a brief narrated stint, you wake to your resting space in disarray, only for the scene to come crashing around you soon after. Then you enter familiar test chambers from the first game, only now they’re wrought with disorder. The familiar chambers are dirtier, with uneven surfaces, making for a great contrast to the clean and pristine state which characterized these very same chambers for players of the first game. Furthermore, it feels like something is missing. It’s GLaDOS, of course; you start Portal 2 without her, and it makes her return all the more powerful. This brief absence is used to great effect, especially as a way to establish the state of Aperture Labs in the time since her defeat. There’s a peculiar loneliness and aimlessness captured at those points where you’re left to traipse Aperture without anyone directly addressing you. At times, the only voice accompanying your progress is pre-recorded, making for a curious atmosphere that aptly highlights the emptiness of Aperture.\n\tEventually, you’ll find yourself in new corners of the vast Aperture, and get a deeper look into its history. I find this to be the highlight of the story, as you get to see how Aperture’s frustrating past, and the ethics and business sense within. Portal 2’s structure is much akin to the first game’s, just stretched out and recontextualized. That’s not too say Portal 2 is drawn out, and in fact I feel it may have benefitted from just a few more hours spent at its best.\n\tYou’ll meet some new faces along the way, key among them Wheatley, a quirky and not-all-too-brilliant core whose banter accompanies you for much of the adventure. Wheatley is, on the whole, a fun addition, with his rash decision-making contrasting GLaDOS’ precise nature. Unfortunately, Whealtey can get grating, perhaps epitomizing more than anything else Portal 2’s occasional divulgence into over-the-top slapstick which just doesn’t completely mesh with the tone of the rest of the game.\n\tOn the whole, the story makes for a satisfying continuation of Portal’s foundation. See, Portal was so self-contained and complete that adding on was a risky venture, but I feel the writers found a good solution, though I understand some may feel this game dives too deep into the background of Aperture and GLaDOS, leaving too little to the imagination. Obscurity was a strength of the first Portal, and Portal 2 does do away with some of that mystique, and your mileage may vary with the reveals. I think they’re mostly strong, although certain character turns can feel rushed or undercooked.\n\tThe shift to a more cinematic approach does mean Portal 2’s story loses quite a bit of the first game’s subtlety. Its jokes are also more direct and frequent, but I don’t think they land as consistently. Perhaps it’s because I initially played this game on Xbox 360, but I also feel the more cinematic style feels comparably more “at home” on a TV.\n\tAs far as gameplay goes, Portal 2 manages to expand on the original’s foundation admirably. It’s not much of a refinement per se, but only because Portal left little to touch up – such was its tight and focused design – but there are still some subtle quality-of-life changes. As an example, the game now makes a greater effort to course-correct certain scenarios. When you jump to fall into a portal on the floor, the game will line you up to fall directly in if you’re close enough. Similarly, creating a fall loop is no longer subject to slight tweaks in your placement with every loop, so you’ll never find yourself falling out of the loop unintentionally.\n\tYou’ll spend less time on single-portal puzzles at the start of the game. These still may feel trite to experienced Portal players, but the puzzles are tightened up to ensure you can move quickly through them. I do feel you perhaps spend a bit too much time in the familiar puzzle chamber space, whereas I feel Portal 2 has an immediately stronger sense of identity and confidence when you leave that space, following a pivotal turning point in the story. I feel the experience would have been better served allocating more time to that portion of the game while trimming the more traditional Aperture chambers in the game’s earlier chapters.\n\tNew mechanics abound, even if it takes some time for them to appear. The gels are stellar additions, and really serve to show how each new mechanic allows new interplay with existing ones. Co-op chambers are well-considered too, really exploring a wealth of puzzle ideas not possible with only one player and one portal gun. The final boss is a smashing improvement over the first game, with creative use of various mechanics and a thrillingly surprising conclusion.\n\tScripted action sequences are much more frequent here. They’re usually fairly basic to navigate; any time a real puzzle shows itself, you’re likely under no pressure to finish it in a certain amount of time. This can make them feel a bit toothless on repeat playthroughs, as the urgency isn’t there.\n\tCo-op allows the game to really stretch its mechanics even further. These aren’t just single player puzzles with a companion, but fully realized solutions requiring an extra set of hands (and portals). Solving the chambers is more involved, but more satisfying in turn. However, it can be a bit deflating when your partner devises the answer all by themselves. The humor is on-point here, but the story is downplayed. The story itself is disappointingly straightforward, and veers into complete slapstick in the end scenes; it feels like the game has lost almost all narrative edge in favor of pure comedy. I always looked forward to the final puzzle of a set in co-op, as they place you outside the regular chamber space for an even more involved puzzle. The final set of chambers is the stronger of the bunch, a true culmination for the campaign. The DLC is also rather fun and challenging. Clever pinging tools enable stronger communication with your partner. Co-op definitely isn’t just slapped on to capitalize on the multiplayer trend of the time. I do wish the campaign had a more substantive story, even if I understand the risks of a story-heavy multiplayer experience. Nonetheless, the actual puzzle-solving is stellar stuff.\n\tThe environmental design is once again brilliant, with the deterioration and system failures highlighting the decay of the facility. You get to see the lab break down and rebuild itself before your very eyes, and it’s a sight to see. After GLaDOS awakens, the chambers start to clean themselves up, and the cameras begin to watch you again.  Contrast is effectively utilized here, as you’ll see Aperture through the years and under the guiding hand of very different personalities.\n\tThe strong presentation enables several sequences – including the punchy opening – which convey the scale of Aperture and its ruination. Physics are put to great effect when sizable structures crash into one another. It’s a great spectacle. There are also plenty of opportunities to gaze upon Aperture’s immensity, with structures stretching in vast space, as far as the field-of-view will permit. The only downside to the visuals is that, as with some other Valve-developed Source games, the lighting setup can drown darker areas in pitch black without manually applying a tone mapping occlusion fix in the video configuration files.\n\tThe soundtrack is strong, with numerous electronic pieces which set the mood nicely. Different puzzle and interactive elements have their own musical cues when in effect, conveying","timestamp_created":1616644206,"timestamp_updated":1616697157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89038797","author":{"steamid":"76561198153841336","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":920,"last_played":1616615883},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game, engulfing and charming storyline, and amazingly designed puzzles!

В целом, игра полностью стоит своих денег, особенно если покупать со скидкой, вообще шик.","timestamp_created":1616600071,"timestamp_updated":1616600071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89008751","author":{"steamid":"76561198966885991","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1651357705},"language":"english","review":"hole gun","timestamp_created":1616599803,"timestamp_updated":1616599803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89008345","author":{"steamid":"76561198262030204","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":7825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5378,"last_played":1658979486},"language":"english","review":"Salles de test intéressantes, comme l'histoire.","timestamp_created":1616599377,"timestamp_updated":1616599377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89007676","author":{"steamid":"76561199091405710","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1639673986},"language":"turkish","review":"arası sikim","timestamp_created":1616598629,"timestamp_updated":1616598629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89007617","author":{"steamid":"76561198043010525","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1111,"last_played":1652725328},"language":"swedish","review":"NIIIIICCCEEEE","timestamp_created":1616598566,"timestamp_updated":1616598566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89007011","author":{"steamid":"76561197960935498","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":80700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":80700,"last_played":1605631857},"language":"russian","review":"По сравнению с первой частью игра прибавила в сюжете. И если в Portal осторосюжетные события начинали происходить ближе к концу игры, то во второй части, всё начинается практически с самого начала. Действия игры происходят после многих лет событий первой части. Главная героиня по имени Чел просыпается после анабиоза и обнаруживает заброшенную лабораторию разрушенной. Пытаясь выбраться из комплекса, в чём ей помогает некий Уитли (модуль персональности ), Чел натыкается на GlaDOS. После чего, снова приходится проходить старые добрые тестовые камеры, используя портальную пушку. Сюжетно игра имеет несколько неожиданных событий, что в свою очередь вызывает ещё больший интерес в игре. К примеру, в середине игры мы попадем в старую часть лаборатории, где можно узнать предысторию развития комплекса и изучения порталов. Удивила так же неожиданная концовка.\n\n-Жанр головоломок от первого лица зародился примерно тогда, когда вышла первая Half-Life, которая, в общем-то и была в каком-то смысле головоломкой. Но жанр этот в чистом виде не был популярен до тех пор, пока одни талантливые студенты из Института технологий DigiPen, что в Редмонде, не взяли и не сделали Narbacular Drop. Это дело заприметили парни из Valve и вместе с разработчиками Нарбакулара сваяли Portal. Это был прорыв в жанре. Однако, несмотря на все прелести первого Portal, он так и оставался экспериментом, а не действительно полноценной игрой. Пока Вентили не сообразили Portal 2.\n\nПлюсы:\n1. сюжет\n2. атмосфера\n3. музыка\n4. персонажи\n5. графика\n6. кооператив \n\nМинусы:\n1. Игра не так интересна, что бы сидеть ее и проходить, когда скучно,можно поиграть\n2. Бывает совершенно скучно\n3. Может помотать нервы\n\nНачало обзора взято с  нескольких сайтов ( не помню к сожалению)
