I admired every aspect of this game. For example, I love how this game allowed you to  learn so much about the characters through the audio diaries that are provided with exploration. \n\nThe gameplay was not a drastic improvement over the past Bioshock games, but it was still very fun. I did like how they incorporated new aspects into the game such as the skylines. There were many weapons to choose from and a decent variety of customization. I was also very glad that my ally was not completely useless for once, as Elizabeth helped me a lot throughout the whole game (handing ammo and money for example). \n\nMy favorite part of this game was the storyline, which in my opinion is one of the best I've seen in a video game (despite a few plot holes). The character development was great, I really felt the growing relationship between Booker and Elizabeth as the game progressed. \n\nBe sure to buy the Burial At Sea DLC if you buy this game too, it is well worth it and definitely more of a challenge to complete compared to the original game.","timestamp_created":1434914938,"timestamp_updated":1435015433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16592024","author":{"steamid":"76561198101873601","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2046,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1722,"last_played":1566770655},"language":"french","review":"Irrational games nous offre encore un bijou . une histoire au dénoument a faire mal au crane .\n\nà adopter sans hesiter !","timestamp_created":1434913592,"timestamp_updated":1434913592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16591625","author":{"steamid":"76561198218499348","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4652,"last_played":1515014340},"language":"english","review":"Just finished the game.

An apparent utopia in the clouds, like something from the mind of Jules Verne and then later, George Orwell. It's a world that in the first act of the game we get revealed to us, piece by unsettling piece. This is where the game is at its strongest; a passive exploratory wander along cobbled streets as buildings rise and fall beside you, bathed in glorious sunshine. Each turn in your path reveals another fascinating vista; a floating carnival, a barbershop quartet on a levitating barge, or the magnificent Battleship Bay. Whilst somewhat open to explore, the narrative carefully ushers you, quite happily, onwards along a defined path through the city. As you descend into the heart of its industrial core, its dystiopian underpinnings mount ominously before you.\n\nInfinite’s city inspires such fascination, that it comes as a huge disappointment to find you will end up disconnecting from the experience behind a barrage of muzzle flash. Infinite, from relatively early on shows its true colors as a FPS romp akin to Wolfenstein, or indeed previous entries in the series; with abundant health packs, and other pickups, set-piece battlegrounds with spawning cover, and corridor action. It’s not that Infinite does this poorly, in fact the combat flows beautifully, weapons have punch, and the exploding heads of enemies prompt a satisfying orchestra hit! The problem is it just get’s old really fast. There is no mission variety, there’s no real interaction with this incredible city, and as you get deeper into the story, and sun descends into brooding darkness, the environment narrows and feels a little too functional as visceral combat devise. \n\nAt this point, the narrative is the only thing keeping everything tied together, but even that grows stale as we are lead through plot twist, after plot twist. It’s natural crescendo is reached early in the third act, and from there, the player simply guns their way into a final set of nauseating twists that seem to make even Comstock’s beard whiten with frustration. \n\nThe Last of Us is a good example of how a linear narrative can be done right; take an interesting backdrop and use a good narrative and mission variety to allow the player to not only walk through the world, but feel part of it. I even wanted to take it further; I wanted to talk to the inhabitants of the city, hell I wanted to be one; trade and explore, maybe start a shop. I think I wanted a different game, and to 2K and Irrational’s credit, they helped me dream big through such an inventive world. But then to shackle my experience to a restrictive and repetitive FPS game feels overwhelmingly disappointing. I wish the game itself was as ambitious as Comstock’s floating city.","timestamp_created":1434896194,"timestamp_updated":1434896194,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.446894943714141846","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16584219","author":{"steamid":"76561198168683744","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1536334331},"language":"spanish","review":"me busta","timestamp_created":1434896087,"timestamp_updated":1434896087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16583673","author":{"steamid":"76561198134317579","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1771,"last_played":1641749591},"language":"english","review":"This game is extremely fun if you are into first person shooters.

Infinite is a great improvement to the previous BioShock games. Though the main game does not transpire in the well-known city known as Rapture, Columbia, the sky city, is almost as good. Spanning a long story and many secrets to find, this game is going to be something to play for a while. If you just rush through the story, then the game may take you 15 hours. That is at least doubled if you try to find all the collectibles in the game. The actual shooting is very smooth. This is also a good game for a controller on PC, alongside the other BioShock games. If you do want to play in Rapture,  however, there is the DLC to buy and then you can explore the underwater city. I have not bought it, so I do not know how awesome it is. The story in the game is also very great. I will not explain it, however, because that may spoil the experience. Just remember this quote, though: \"Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt.\"\n\nThe only con to this game is the somewhat repetitive gameplay. Shoot people. Progress. Shoot more people. Progress. Shoot even more people. Progress.\n\nSCORE: 96/100\n\nCONCLUSION\nStory-lovers and FPS-lovers should all try this game out, as it packs the best of both worlds.","timestamp_created":1434823542,"timestamp_updated":1434823542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16558879","author":{"steamid":"76561198126833772","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":505,"last_played":1640520152},"language":"russian","review":"Bioshock Infinite - это\nАтмосферный шутер от первого лица с глубоким сюжетом.
