I like to be able to imagine I am the character in a game, in the scenario created, and escape into that world for a while. Half Life 2 failed for me, and Portal made the same errors. In this case: the game begins with you waking up. And you seem to have had radical surgery, with metal bolted onto your bones. Don't you think you would examine that? Check your legs? Is it bolted or strapped on? Could it be removed and you restored to a normal body, or are you permanently disfigured? Does it hurt to walk on it? To fall 50 feet and land on it? The game doesn't answer any of this, meaning I was immediately removed from the character. Either she had information that hadn't been shared with the player (making it difficult to _be_ her in the game), or she somehow doesn't notice or comment upon the fact that she may have been mutilated in her sleep (again, making it impossible to empathise with the character). This could have easily been rectified by a few seconds of close-up, maybe a wince; perhaps later a comment on it, or a sign about the surgery.

The levels and puzzles are designed with solutions in mind but you can always find your own way.  I feel like achievements were invented for games like this.  I've played through the game a few times just because it's fun to think about how to do the puzzles.\n\nThere isn't really much in terms of story, but the writing is clever and entertaining.  There is a story of sorts to unlock as the game progresses but I wouldn't call it story driven.  More like progressive puzzles.  I feel like everyone who enjoys games should play this to see what things first person games can offer other than big guns and action on rails.\n\nThe best part of the game is the ability to extend it through the workshop.
