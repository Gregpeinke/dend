Даже в то время эта игра мне казалась средняком. А сейчас так вообще отвращение было при прохождении. Оружие в игре выглядит ужасно, ощущения и отдачи от них нет никакой. Про звуки тут отдельная тема, ибо настолько отвратительные звуки оружия еще найти надо. Больше всего меня раздражал дизайн уровней в игре. Пол игры ты бегаешь по всяким канализация, будто ты черепашка-ниндзя в своём доме. Следующую часть тупо катаешься, опять же по канализациям. Казалось бы, что так будет всю игру. Но нет, ревенхольм хоть как-то разбавляет дизайн уровней, ибо этот город-призрак выполнен довольно добротно. После чего снова ужасные локации, которые даже описывать не буду.","timestamp_created":1588926083,"timestamp_updated":1588926083,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.3562297523021698","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68776437","author":{"steamid":"76561198960629089","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":3845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1328,"last_played":1627530660},"language":"english","review":"its good\n","timestamp_created":1588923021,"timestamp_updated":1623423017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68771332","author":{"steamid":"76561198420751163","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1391,"last_played":1588915456},"language":"koreana","review":"스토리 겜","timestamp_created":1588913283,"timestamp_updated":1588913283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68770905","author":{"steamid":"76561198311344854","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3568,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2987,"last_played":1589031073},"language":"english","review":"this game is amazing","timestamp_created":1588912414,"timestamp_updated":1588912414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68769065","author":{"steamid":"76561198008737205","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":961,"last_played":1589757766},"language":"spanish","review":"el mejor juego de la historia! y trama","timestamp_created":1588908878,"timestamp_updated":1588908878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68768653","author":{"steamid":"76561198014158345","num_games_owned":928,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":2669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2393,"last_played":1602703835},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1588908200,"timestamp_updated":1588908200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68767974","author":{"steamid":"76561198927915473","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":658,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1610852815},"language":"english","review":"OMG ITS THE G MAN SHOOT HIM BEFORE HE WALKS BEHIND THE WALL PART 2","timestamp_created":1588907043,"timestamp_updated":1588907043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68766089","author":{"steamid":"76561198182638969","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1044,"last_played":1588992344},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo de excelente qualidade.

It had to live up to a monumental amount of hype generated by the first game and released in a year stacked full of great shooters like Doom 3 and most importantly Halo 2. Yet, despite all the pressure weighing down upon Valve they managed to create a game that exceeded peoples expectations. For a 16 year old game Half-Life 2 looks phenomenal, it came out during the 6th console generation and managed to have the graphical fidelity of a Xbox 360 or PS3 game. The textures, lighting, character models, facial animations and physics were all top notch when Half-Life 2 released. The core gunplay of Half-Life 2 is ironically its weakest element, even in comparison to the original game the gunplay of Half-Life 2 is worse. For one Half-Life 2 has less enemies and less weapons than the first game and the slower movement speed turns it into a cover shooter where you and the enemy take pod shots at each other from long range. Halo 2 came out the same year as Half-Life 2 and had unquestionably better gunplay. So why was Half-Life 2 considered a masterpiece in 2004 if it had worse gunplay than the original and other shooters on the market? The answer is variety, not in core gunplay but in gamerplay. Half-Life 2 is constantly changing up the formula and you won't find yourself doing the same thing twice. In one chapter you'll be driving an airboat through the canal only to find yourself in an abandoned mining town filled with zombies till you reach the beach and traverse it with a buggy. I have never seen another game pull of so many different styles of gameplay and make them all fun within a single continuous experience. Half-Life 2 is truly unique and it tells the heartfelt story of humanity rising upon against their conquerors to regain their freedom from a brutal dictatorship. The world feels real and lived in thanks to the believable characters that Valve created with so much love and care. Everyone involved with this game deserves a pat on the back for being so dedicated to their work that they would sacrifice their health and lives to make this work of art. The one thing that Valve does amazing well is make their worlds feel like a potential reality and in the case of Half-Life, it's a reality where you truly care about the struggles of the people who live in it. That is why Half-Life 2 was a masterpiece in 2004 and still is today.","timestamp_created":1588888966,"timestamp_updated":1588888966,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68755391","author":{"steamid":"76561198119608534","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1585770571},"language":"english","review":"So it's been (idk like 20 years lol) since you were put into stasis by the Gman.

Игре уже 10 лет, однако при этом она до сих пор держит высокую планку качества.\n\nИгра является продолжением первой части. Спустя несколько лет, G-man вовращает Гордона из стазиса, решив его использовать в своих целях. За время отсутствия Фримена, прошли довольно глобальные изменения в мире. Планета была захвачена могущественной инопланетной организацией, именуемой Советом Альянса. Большиство людей, стали жертвами и рабами захватчиков, однако были и те кто пытался сопротивлятся. Небольшие отряды повстанцев, не теряли надежду спастись и вернуть Землю обратно. Роль главного повстанца сыграет бывшый сотрудник научного комлекса Black Mesa.\n\nПервое, что на тот момент бросалось в глаза, это новый движок Source. Помимо прекрасной графики, крутой анимации, движок имел отличную техническую составляющую. Большая качественная работа была проведена с физикой. Все предметы, оружие, техника, повинуются физике, с учётом их массы, трения и силы тяжести. На этой основе сделано немало различных простеньких головоломок.\n\nТем не менее игра является классическим представителем жанра шутер от первого лица. Так же игра сохранила все классические традиции первой части. К примеру за действиями игры, мы наблюдаем исключительно из глаз главного героя, без каких то видео-вставок или разрыве во времени. Так же Гордон Фримен молчит на протяжении всей игры. Ну и конечно загадка серии номер один, таинственый человек в костюме с кейсом.\n\nПо части геймплея, игра нам предлагает куда больше разноообразия нежели первый HL. И если в первом, место действия в основном проходило на територрии научного комплекса в пустыне, где большую часть времени, игрок проводил в стенах лаборатории, то во второй части, разнообразие локаций на порядок выше. Захваченый, полуразрушенный город восточной европы, побережье, мрачный атмосферный городок Рейвенхольм, тюрьма, огромная Цитадель. Все эти места помимо всего прочего, красиво воссозданы, а в некоторых прекрасно передана атмосфера(Рейвенхольм).\n\nЕсли в первой части основными противника были инопланетные существа, в перемешку с солдатами, посланными на зачистку лаборатории, то во второй таковыми являются солдаты Альянса. Сражениям с зомби и другими существами уделено куда меньше времени. Тем не менее игра постоянно держит в напряжении, а качественно поданый геймплей и продуманный сюжет мотивируют играть не прерываясь, до самого конца.\n\nКроме основной геймплейной составляющей игры, а именно перестрелки с врагами и убийство мутантов, игра так же предлагает нам и другие развлечения. Часто встречаются не сложные, однако вполне продуманые логические задачки, нам дадут возможность покататся на багги по побережью и на воздушной подушке по каналам города.\n\nВ игре не много оружия, однако представленных экземпляров вполне хватает, для того чтобы устроить настоящий беспредел на улицах Сити 17. Хотя модели оружия другие, однако типы и виды остались такими же. Ломик, пистолет, дробовик, атомат, арбалет, базука и гранаты. Однако, ещё было добавлено устройство под названием Грави-пушка, которая полностью заменяет все функции ломика. Теперь один из символов Half-Life, стал самым бесполезным предметом в инвентаре Гордона.\n\nНесмотря на то, что большую часть игры прийдется ходить в одиночестве, и сражаться с врагами собственными силами, во второй части у нас будут союзники. Это некоторые повстанцы, Аликс и её Пёс, и даже Муравьиные львы. Сам же AI был намного лучше проработан. Как враги так и союзники вели себя вполне адекватно. Редко когда замечал баги или какие то проблемы с этим.\n\nОтличная игра, прекрасное продолжение серии, красивая графика, реалистичная физика, хорошо продуманный сюжет и яркие персонажи.\n\nОценка: 10/10","timestamp_created":1588771834,"timestamp_updated":1643198886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwicmL9fECf7z8hQI="}
