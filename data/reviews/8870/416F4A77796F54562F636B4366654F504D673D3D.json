That's not to say everyone will love it. I think almost everyone can gain something from playing this game. It is first and foremost an excellent shooter game. I'm no legend in FPS games, in fact I pretty much suck. I played it at default difficulty and the game provided a consistent challenge, but never felt impossible. The learning curve might be a tiny bit steep for players new to Bioshock or FPSs. However the game does an excellent job of introducing you to these gameplay elements, without drawing you out of the environment. And oh, what an environment it is.\n\nThe game is about a year and 6 months old now, and the version I played during Turkey Weekend 2014 was remarkably stable. There were maybe two or three minor visual bugs, and one instance where I had to reload a checkpoint to continue. That's literally it for errors, everything else was flawlessly executed. Graphically, a quad-core processor and budget video card will let you set the quality to max visuals. I recommend this, because it's an important part of playing the game. Really, do play this game on PC, at max settings. You do yourself a disservice otherwise.\n\nTo say it is art is to damn it with faint praise.\n\nBioshock Infinite is beautiful. It's like a painting in motion; a world of wonder brought to life in vivid color and ethereal light. The city of Columbia is brimming with breathtaking imagery, particularly during the first half of the game. Shafts of soft light fall on pools of water that ripple in realistic fashion; water that casts reflections on nearby surfaces. Anyone who has been to an indoor pool knows this visual phenomena. There are moments where I had to stop and just admire how gorgeous everything was. In that respect it's unlike any game I've ever played.\n\nThese sumtuous visuals are complemented with excellent sound engineering and a terrific music score. The careful listener will much enjoy some clever musical arrangements. Everything is voice-acted, and that too has been done with care. The voice actors for the protagonist, Booker DeWitt, and his companion Elizabeth, are excellent. Troy Baker, Booker's voice actor, did a particularly fine job of fitting his voice to the era. There is frequent dialogue between Booker and Elizabeth; these conversations provide a level of intimacy that is all too frequently absent from games with a narrative.\n\nIn short I can't recommend this game enough. It's like a book you can immerse yourself in. Provides a solid 15-20 hours of play. It's actually worth $50, but if you can get it on sale, do. This review can't do it justice. You have to experience it.","timestamp_created":1417426639,"timestamp_updated":1417426639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545012712478637695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13177491","author":{"steamid":"76561198068208235","num_games_owned":503,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1193,"last_played":1441825685},"language":"english","review":"biocock infinite","timestamp_created":1417420971,"timestamp_updated":1608140718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13176542","author":{"steamid":"76561198078750988","num_games_owned":985,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":21808,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1279,"last_played":1497681378},"language":"english","review":"I cannot simply explain how awesome this game is.

Primero la jugabilidad:\n\nArregla muchos fallos del Bioshock original: el poder tener un arma por un lado y los vigorizantes por otro, quitar el sistema de pirateo... pero hay otras muchas cosas que se han quitado: llevar las 8 armas en vez de 2, sustituir armas originales (arpón, lanzador químico etc.) por armas clásicas (que tengan un toque antiguo no es cambiar las armas), aunque diré que los plásmidos, o vigorizantes, me gustan más en este juego: muy originales. Pero lo que me fastidia es el cambio de sigilo y terror a acción plana: el juego está plagado de acción innecesaria: hordas ridículas de enemigos (¡porque merecen morir como auténticos soldados!), lluvia de misiles, enemigos por todos lados... cierto que este juego con sigilo no pinta nada, pero en el original el sigilo me permitía poder explorarlo todo con más tranquilidad (que eso es lo que te invita a hacer el juego) pero si tengo 5000 enemigos disparándome, pues lo siento, pero no puedo parame en los detallitos.\n\nY ahora la trama (¡sin spoilers!): sinceramente, merece un aplauso: después de siempre ver triples A de historias vacías, de personajes huecos y que se preocupaba más por que matara a x personaje antes de que me preocupara algo por la historia, esta saga le ha dado una patada a esa teoría: o te enteras algo de la historia o no avanzas. Y, por si fuera poco, narrativa visual, voxáfonos y detalllitos que te informan sin decir nada de pequeñas partes de la historia, o te pueden hasta decir mucho más. Y jooooder, esta historia SÍ merece la pena (no como COD AW, porque tengas a Kevin Spacey no tienes una buena historia) ¿Lo malo? El final. Si el final del original trastocaba, éste te deja muerto; y a no ser que o juegues 5 ó 6 veces más al juego o mires una explicación del final te vas a quedar con el culo torcido. Parece que lo hayan hecho más para marear que no para otra cosa.\n\nResumen: mejora cosas del anterior, pero falla en otras. Aunque nada es perfecto. Este juego merece mucho la pena, y es el claro ejemplo que los videojugos pueden ser más que \"matar marcianitos\" y llegan a contarnos historias increíbles.","timestamp_created":1417396208,"timestamp_updated":1417396208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13173378","author":{"steamid":"76561198082565023","num_games_owned":426,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1332,"last_played":1420820829},"language":"english","review":"Another smart game.

One of the best if not THE best plots in any game ever, amazingly fun gameplay, beatiful sights, and a story that really makes you think. A MUST BUY!\"\n\nIt really took me 3 years to re-write this review. I must have had some free time in there somewhere. I know I did. Ah well. I don't feel like reviewing this game now. Another time.\n\n3 years and 6 months later I indeed have the time. Disregard what I said above in terms of the best plot and gameplay and stuff, I was young and stupid. I'm just not deleting it because I kinda like seeing what young me thought of games. This game doesn't suck and isn't a masterpiece. It's a good game. It gets a bit reptitive in terms of gameplay, and there's no real variation from mission type, every mission is just get from point A to point B. That's probably the most dissapointing thing about this game, because if you read the developers notes on what this game was originally intended to be, it was an open world almost RPG? It was kind of weird and wouldn't have really fit into a genre, they were hoping for it to define it. But alas, the budget shook its mean old head no, and this is what we got. And again what we got isn't bad, the voice acting is great (Troy Baker being superb as always), the graphics are great, the powers are interesting enough; though not the quality of the powers in a kind of similar game Dishonored or Dishonored 2. The plot has a shit ton of plot holes. If you take a couple minutes to actually analyze the end of the game, it makes no sense. There are also a couple things along the way that when you go back and replay it and think about it, it makes no sense for it to be this way aside from forshadowing. The idea was better then the execution. I will give it credit for making a game about killing crazy racists that doesn't feel one sided in it's view (I mean you're obviously killing the racist slave owners but the game itself presents it as a situation and doesn't really take sides), and it also does it without being pretentious. With a game like this that talks a lot about what really defines racism, and what is the idea of God and how it fits into our world, it somehow didn't come across as trying too hard or being pretentious like most games. I actually give them a lot of credit for that, as it's difficult to do. There are multiple decisions along the way of the game, but again these were just bits and pieces of the game that never was, the bizzare almost RPG game, so as a result we have like 3 kind of trivial choices throughout the game that in the grand scheme of things don't really matter. I'd say the 2 strongest things this game has going for it is the voice acting, and the setting, which is beautiful. I'm not quite sure why this was a Bioshock game though, as it doesn't deal with Rapture at all. I'm aware of the DLC in this game, of which I'm not fond, but for some reason this is technically the third of the Bioshock series? Why not just make it a stand alone new game? It probably would have sold better as I've heard quite a few people didn't want to get it because they thought the complicated plot tied back to those games, which it sort of did in the DLC, but really didn't have to. Anyway this game is like an 8/10. But as I said, I want to keep the original review I gave this game before I myslelf became a pretenious reviewer.","timestamp_created":1417296438,"timestamp_updated":1502941402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13149589","author":{"steamid":"76561198123614980","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":576,"last_played":1592680603},"language":"russian","review":"Шикарная игра, не пожалел о покупке.","timestamp_created":1417296253,"timestamp_updated":1417296253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13149060","author":{"steamid":"76561198051811003","num_games_owned":271,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":662,"last_played":1417294179},"language":"english","review":"Overrated.\nBoring, confusing story. \nMediocre gameplay.\n\nIt's was a pain to get to the end of the game.\nI am glad that Irrational Games was shut down.","timestamp_created":1417294328,"timestamp_updated":1442837545,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.412205547094345093","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13148994","author":{"steamid":"76561198071202980","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":406,"last_played":1533034218},"language":"japanese","review":"1900年代初めの米国空中都市を舞台にしたFPS\n明るい雰囲気で、空中移動が楽しい\n日本語化がすばらしく、吹替には藤原啓治さんや沢城みゆきさんらが起用されている。\n\n","timestamp_created":1417294113,"timestamp_updated":1417294113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545186042785644531","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13148966","author":{"steamid":"76561198086043667","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":507,"last_played":1640521656},"language":"russian","review":"Она невероятная!","timestamp_created":1417293986,"timestamp_updated":1417293986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13148843","author":{"steamid":"76561197986406741","num_games_owned":3020,"num_reviews":868,"playtime_forever":2406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1411,"last_played":1573270597},"language":"english","review":"The main game is awesome! both in PC port terms (engine, graphics, sound, technical stuff) and in the wonderful story !
