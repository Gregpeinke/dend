I've heard people say that the Gold Source Engine hasn't aged too well but I personally think it has. It somehow looks both basic and complex at the same time, like the Tau Cannon's practical design. Unlike Half Life 2 this game is quite colourful and bright despite the fact that the appocalypse is happening, which makes the game seem very charming to me.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay has a mixture of puzzle solving, story telling and action, none of which get tiring. The physics of pushing boxes may be a bit weird but its not that bad. Speaking of action, the weapons and character design are all off the charts. The enemies from Xen are all very alien looking and amazing, such as the Houndeyes with their sonic shockwave attacks, and the terrifying Tentacle creature that genuinely terrified me on my first playthrough. Xen itself is very impressive and surreal, especially for a 3d game from late 1998.\nThe game doesn't have any NPCs that stick around the main character, Gordon Freeman, and usually they die due to their quite bad AI. The NPCs can also glitch out or scream for no reason, which is quite funny to experience. Some of the voice acting is kind of underwhelming, and the characters can have bizzare conversations such as 'Achoo! Kindly lower your voice'. Also the security guards can accidentally kill you. That's annoying.\n\nThere are many secrets hidden all over the Black Mesa Compound, and many amazing weapons to find, like the alien Hivehand and the Gluon Gun which fires a disintegrating laser. The combat is also very good, and every enemy has a weapon they are weak against for you to experiment with.\n\nWithout a doubt this is one of my favouite video games ever, and for the price of £7.99 or $10.60, I really think you should play it if you haven't before.","timestamp_created":1529680458,"timestamp_updated":1529709233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42932047","author":{"steamid":"76561198382785311","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":8,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1529676872},"language":"schinese","review":"windows10严重闪退","timestamp_created":1529676935,"timestamp_updated":1529676935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":40,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.800698399543762207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42930572","author":{"steamid":"76561198294282925","num_games_owned":361,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":1036,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":782,"last_played":1595392874},"language":"brazilian","review":"Tem nem oq falar...\n\n9999999/10","timestamp_created":1529674145,"timestamp_updated":1529674145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42929868","author":{"steamid":"76561198264082812","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":588,"last_played":1627837607},"language":"turkish","review":"HALF LİFE DÜNYANINI EN İYİ FPS OYUNUDUR.Son","timestamp_created":1529672521,"timestamp_updated":1542997555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42924860","author":{"steamid":"76561198347854055","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1067,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":936,"last_played":1562939010},"language":"turkish","review":"Moqur Oyün Güzel Ama BAzILarı Ne OYNuyÖ öyle yhaa Şu DUvAR DelİCİ FişeQ SİLAH","timestamp_created":1529660757,"timestamp_updated":1529660757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523518621921539307","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42921465","author":{"steamid":"76561198420405675","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1529651384},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра для своего времени","timestamp_created":1529651726,"timestamp_updated":1529651726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42920933","author":{"steamid":"76561198413527891","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":4101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":393,"last_played":1655410029},"language":"english","review":"The best game i ever played !!!

Would recommend if you're looking for an action game that's, for the most part, [i] detached from a storyline and keeps things on the action [/i]. It's from a time where, instead of inserting some cutscene or dialogue sit-through, the game just paces the action by having some moments of downtime. \n\n[b] You progress by shooting, shooting a little less, and then shooting even more (with some puzzles in between). [/b]\n\nThat isn't to say that's all there is, though. There's a fair bit of atmosphere in the background. The soundtrack, while [i] very sparse [/i], opts to place short music cues to establish a mood and leave you in silence thereafter. It may range from framing the eerieness of a just-occurred massacre, to starting off the rush of a firefight, and then to allowing you to bask in the glory of whatever you had just accomplished. I'd see myself reloading a quicksave just to experience one of those moments again.\n\nTo go back to the shooting part, I'll say the game might feel a little aged if you're used to modern gunplay conventions. There's no aiming down sights; it's run out of cover, find the nearest threat, and shoot them dead with whatever weapon you deem appropriate. The only feedback you get is the enemy dropping once they can't soak any more damage. It's a bit of a novel thing, but I liked how it felt.\n\nI think the one thing I'd recommend to whoever chooses to play it would be to [u] not abuse quicksaves too much [/u]. There's this certain [i] primal [/i] feeling you get from surviving from the skin of your teeth. As long as you're not playing on hard difficulty, you can probably survive more endeavors than you think. I wish I gave myself this advice earlier in my playthrough, feel like I would've had more fun with more blood pumping.\n\nThat's all I've got to say on it.

Мне не понятно почему разработчики убрали открытый мир, эту пустошь, где полно опасностей и   всякого разврата. Зайдя в игру я ожидал встретить тех самых кротокрысов, радтараканов, дудней, рейдеров и моих любимчиков под названием \" Братья стали\" на которых я очень много любил смотреть, к тому же потратил ещё очень много салфеточек. СЮЖЕТ мне вообще не понятен, ибо он сложный, очень сложный, возможно это мой косяк, ведь в школе у меня по физике была двойка.
