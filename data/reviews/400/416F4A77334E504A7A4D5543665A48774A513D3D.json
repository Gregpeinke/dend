(kind of important) and you get tested through test chambers solving puzzles that the root has set up, the backround of this robot is revealed in Portal 2, (you should also get that after you finih this) so you can't understand thi enemy. The enemyis names GLAdos and she puts you through test chambers and then at the end, oh by the way, a type of food is mentioned alot in this game. At the end, well that not actually the end.

The atmosphere, the jokes, GLaDOS, it's all really witty, and it brings charm.\n-Funny: Read above point.\n-It has aged very well. Seriously, go try play Half Life one again nowadays. It's like swallowing a 10-year old donut. It hasn't aged well. Portal is like wine, and ageing has done nothing but make it better (thanks CoD with your shitty singlepayer.)\n\nThere are many more good things about the game, but you'll have to go find out for yourself.\n\nCons:\n-The graphics: OK STOP THE GRAPHICS ARE FINE. They aren't groundbreaking, but this game is from an older era. Trust me, if Valve does ever release Source 2, then perhaps a graphical revamp may happen.\n\nAnd now the biggest reason why you may not want to buy this game:\nIT IS RELATIVELY SHORT. It took me two hours to complete the campaign by itself, and I bought the game on special. $2.50 for two hours of Portal fun. Now, admittedly, Source is knwn for being very open-source :3. This does mean more content, Dev commentariesl, and custom maps. However, unless you have a job or are a Valve fanboy, then you may not want to pay full price for a game that is this short in terms of the singleplayer. If I were you, I'd wait till both Portal and Portal 2 are on special and purchase them both at the same time.\n\n\nOf course, don't let me influence your choice of buying the game. Chances are your here because you want this game regardless of what poeple say about it. But, if you are conflicted about buying this game, take my advice: Is it on special? If not, get a job or a source of income.","timestamp_created":1398726890,"timestamp_updated":1398726890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9966301","author":{"steamid":"76561198073018948","num_games_owned":480,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59,"last_played":1422803105},"language":"italian","review":"Gioco fantastico.","timestamp_created":1398726522,"timestamp_updated":1398726522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492105245590209961","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9966241","author":{"steamid":"76561198083326607","num_games_owned":433,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1585434240},"language":"brazilian","review":"Sem duvida um dos melhores jogos de sempre!\nMas lembre-se:\"The Cake is a Lie\"","timestamp_created":1398725975,"timestamp_updated":1398725975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9965106","author":{"steamid":"76561198111470211","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":318,"last_played":1514211617},"language":"russian","review":"вобше игра яркая \n","timestamp_created":1398716076,"timestamp_updated":1398716076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9964750","author":{"steamid":"76561198102752238","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1463950008},"language":"english","review":"Excellent game, lovely story line.

It remains a simple, fun puzzle game comparable to classics while using modern technology for graphical updates not complicated gameplay features.\n\nThe script is hilarious, and the game is simple, fun and visually appealing.

It is a single-player puzzle-based video game developed by Valve and released as part of The Orange Box on October 9, 2007 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360...\"[/i] \n \nThis game is a unique classic and It's hard to find a gamer today who has not heard of it or some of it's references in our culture. It focuses on several key elements which make this game a masterpiece of it's time: \n \n- Short gameplay set in an unknown and intriguing environment that sets perfectly with the story's theme. \n- A unique and fast paced plot filled with humor that gives little to no answers and raises a mountain of questions. \n- It offers advanced and bonus maps as well as achievements that act as a challenge arc that complement the main story's somewhat simple puzzles. \n \nMost prevalent critique of this game is that it's gameplay is too short and the obstacles are too simple. This is true, but in my opinion that is not a bad thing, because after the release of it's sequel this game should not be observed as something separate from it. We should judge games and the content they brings based on the era in which they were developed and the intent of their release. And the original Portal should be considered a 'Tech demo', and something that is intended to be build up on with a sequel.\n\nSomething that should also be mentioned is that this game has Controller Support which means you can play it comfortably with a gamepad. It also includes a Level Editor and welcomes native modifications since it includes a Source SDK. \n \nWith all that being said, I would recommend this game as it is an excellent introduction into the Portal series and you will finally find out why the cake is a damn lie!","timestamp_created":1398585208,"timestamp_updated":1398585503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9948864","author":{"steamid":"76561198122559512","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2521,"last_played":1586679729},"language":"japanese","review":"FPSにパズル要素を取り入れ、革命的なゲーム「Half-Life」を作り上げたあのValveが、「The Orange Box」を発売するに当たって、Source Engineをフル活用して制作したゲームと言う名の実験、「Portal」。シンプルながらもどこかValve特有の不気味な雰囲気を纏ったこの実験の被験者は、あなただ。\nもう１２年前（執筆当時）のゲームとなったが、初プレイした時のワクワク感そのままにレビューさせていただく。\n\n[h1]グラフィック[/h1]\nHalf-Life 2シリーズでは前面に推されていた、明暗や風景のコントラストがリアル感を演出する、HDR（ハイ・ダイナミック・レンジ）は今回はオフにしても楽しめる。しかしながら、当時は最先端だったSource Engineのディテールが経営危機に陥った研究室の姿を如実に表現している。徹底的に無駄を省いた研究室のデザインはどこか現実的で、同時に、怖いほど無機質な見た目だ。\n\n[h1]ゲームプレイ[/h1]\n照射すると2点間をワープできるポータルが出来る「ポータルガン」が今回のお供となる。これを頼りに研究室のデータ収集のためのパズル（テストと呼ばれる）を解いていくのが中心だ。最初は「ポータルを通り抜け、出口の部屋まで行く」「重い立方体を感圧板の上に置くと、エネルギーが働いてドアが開く」といった簡単な物だが、次第にテストは少しずつ難化していく。それでも、流石はVavle、現実の物理法則の、ごくごく基礎的・常識的なこと、そしてポータルをはじめとしたテスト用具の基本事項が分かればパズルは単純明快である。詰んだと思ってもどこかにヒントがあり、しかも何度でもやり直せる、初心者にも親切な設計だ。…体に全く親切じゃない障害物があるのは別として。\n\n[h1]ストーリー[/h1]\nあなたはAperture Scienceという経営が行き詰まった研究所で、前述の「テスト」を受けることになる。被験者としてポータルガンを使ったテストを解き続けるだけなので、ご褒美のケーキは約束されても、ストーリーは無いようだが…\n\n[h1]キャラクター[/h1]\n登場人物（？）は被験者のあなたとテストを催しているAIのGLaDOSしかいないと言っていい。Apertureの研究チームはAI技術において無駄に群を抜いているのか、どこか人間臭く、ロボ臭くもあるGLaDOSは研究室の独特な雰囲気に一役買っている。\n\n[h1]総括[/h1]\nただ単純にSource Engineの可能性を追求する意図で、「実験」として誕生したPortalだったが、被験者たちを独特の雰囲気の虜にすることに成功した。きっとあなたもそんな被験者の一人になるかもしれない。直接の続編でありSource Engineのパワーを最大限に生かしたPortal 2とパックで買うととてもお得なので、ぜひApertureへ足を運んでほしい。ケーキもついてきます（ダイレクトマーケティング）","timestamp_created":1398584667,"timestamp_updated":1567300291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529703021049499512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9948724","author":{"steamid":"76561198086990320","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":526,"last_played":1418215173},"language":"schinese","review":"  三个小时就通关了,不过不错","timestamp_created":1398583478,"timestamp_updated":1398583478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9948480","author":{"steamid":"76561198012740423","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":898,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":551,"last_played":1519787348},"language":"english","review":"Nice game.

Took me about 4 hours for the main storyline.","timestamp_created":1398455929,"timestamp_updated":1398455929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9932233","author":{"steamid":"76561198128208304","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":614,"last_played":1508025360},"language":"english","review":"What can I say about Portal that hasn't been said?
