Вообще я люблю игры про всяких зомби и подобной нечисти, но КФ это другое. До знакомства с этой игрой я знал зомби режим в COD. Итак, тут будет немного помощи новичкам. \nЕсли вы ну, и думаете что сможете затащить то вы ошибаетесь, и наверное даже магазин не найдете. \nПомните, ходите только с свое командой, это сохранит ваши шансы жить, до первой флешки. \nНе подпускайте к себе любых монстров, даже клотов, которые обнимаю вас, а другие пиздят. \n\nВ игре есть 3 типа Зедов  (те самые зомби):\n1)Легкие зеды\nКлот любит вас обнимать\nБерсеркер - бегает с мачете в руке \nКабан - или же жиртрест, рыгает на вас, оглушает, и снимает броню свое рыгачкой. \n2)Средние зеды \nСталкер - женщина с силой кунг-фу и юзает невидимость \nСирена- орет как ебанутая, оглушает всех, и все что есть у подрывника.\nПаук- просто паукобразный человек, или наоборот, ходят толпами. \nХаск - стреляет из своего говно в вас, тем самым поджигая вас. Урон от огня не получает.\n3)Хардкорные,  или вам пиздец\nМясник бегает с бензопилой, и тот кто больше в него стреляет тем самым агрит его.\nФлешка(флещпаунд, отбивальщик, слон) на волне 7 он выходит, и раздает всем пиздюлей. \nНу и босс патриарх. Просто мужик с миниганом, ракетницой, какой то анакондой в груди.\n\nНу и естественно есть перки. \nСнайпер сидит подальше от всех, и его задача и убивать средних и хардкорных Зедов. Также у него бусты на пистолеты.  \nМедик лечит всех, а за это получает море денег  (если конечно команда не жлобов). У него крутая броня, и бегает он быстрее. \nТехник спец по дробовикам, и его задача купить аа12 и убиватьс него флешку и мясника.\nБерсеркер спец в ближнем бою, только главное чтобы этот говнюк не убежал в край карты и не оставил свою команду.

Его задача прикрывать техника, подрывника и снайпера от легких Зедов. \nПоджигатель ослабляет врагов поджигая их. Также он не воспреимчив к огню.\nПодрывник спец по всему что взрываться. Его задача обезпечить подержку своим союзникам, но если какой то из Зедов подошел слишком близко, то на этот случай лучше купить дигл подрывнику. \n\nТакже вы играете не за человека, а за какого-то деревянного буратину, который не может нормально прыгать, и не умеет бегать.\n\nВот весь обзор, и моя оценка игре 9 деревянных буратин из 10","timestamp_created":1413562450,"timestamp_updated":1472284436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494794875383377075","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12526403","author":{"steamid":"76561198015368061","num_games_owned":289,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":12620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11573,"last_played":1480710359},"language":"english","review":"amazing game 9/10 can't wait for kf2 to come out.","timestamp_created":1413561992,"timestamp_updated":1413561992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12526393","author":{"steamid":"76561197983126681","num_games_owned":387,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67,"last_played":1419192668},"language":"spanish","review":"Bastante entretenido.

Les zombies ou créatures ignobles du genre, vous appréciez les tuer ? Vous aimeriez avoir un poste à responsabilité ? Alors achetez Killing Floor avec vos amis et faites face à des hordes de d'ennemis !\n\nKilling Floor c'est quoi ? Un FPS sans scénario basé uniquement sur de la survie ( résister à 4, 7 ou 10 vagues puis défaire le boss ), sur des maps gratuites fournies par le jeu ou même des maps customs. Cependant, ici pas question de faire des massacres sans réfléchir, vous aurez besoin d'une équipe, une VRAIE équipe.\n\nVous pourrez jouer à 6 et il y a 7 classes différentes ( on dira perks, parce que la traduction du jeu 'avantages', c'est pas très joli ). Vous saisissez ? Oui, vous allez devoir vous partager les rôles entre :\n\n- Le médic : joueur essentiel du groupe, il dispose de mitraillettes équipées de fléchettes soignantes longue distance et de grenades libérant un gaz soignant ET mortel pour vos ennemis\n\n- Le Commando : spécialisé en fusil d'assaut et en détection d'ennemis invisibles, c'est le plus qualifié pour tuer les petits 'zeds' ( les ennemis du jeu, faire ensuite la différence entre gros et petits 'zeds ). Il peut également voir les points de vie de ses ennemis.\n\n- Le Support ( logisticien en VF ) : l'exécuteur du groupe, le bourrin armé fusils à pompe et d'un stock de grenades 2 fois plus élevé. Il peut également porter plus d'armes que ses coéquipiers, donc se permettre d'embarquer des armes de médic ou autre\n\n- Le Firebug ( Cramtout / Pyromane en VF ) : son nom veut tout dire, c'est l'enfoiré sournois du coup qui trouvera satisfaction en brûlant le monde. Très pratique contre les petits Zeds, plus léger contre les gros Zeds, à l'image du Commando.\n\n- Le Démo : oui, il faut toujours un spécialiste des explosifs dans les jeux coopératifs. Et le démo, c'est l'homme de la situation, celui qui enverra valser les boyaux, qui fera couler des litres de sang et prendra un malin plaisir à exploser les gros Zeds\n\n- Le Sharpshooter ( Tireur d'élite en VF ) : spécialiste pistolets ( akimbos ou non ) ainsi que des arbalètes et fusils de précision, c'est le plus polyvalent de l'équipe.

game! It's a serious blast killing the undead and mutated with all sorts of neat weapons! Here's a list of the pros and cons I've found:\n\nPros: \n*Game is fast-paced and incredibly satisfying!\n*Gunplay works very smoothly, and has held up well after all this time\n*The sound design is absolutely glorious in this game!\n*Fantastic music tracks\n\nNeutral:\n*It's a better game with friends, but it's still fun with others in short bursts\n*Can get very repetitive if you play without any friends\n*Sometimes the voice chat won't work, but idk if this is an issue with just me\n*Server selection is a lot like Source Engine; Just plain text. I wouldn't say it's a downside, but it's just something to point out.\n\nNegatives:\n*Trader has a set amount of time to upgrade weapons; yet, you need to get to her in that set time (usually a minute), and upgrade your stuff in that limited space of time! This means if you're across a large map, you could potentially miss out on upgrading critical stuff for your class!\n*Classes are fine at first, but then become unbalanced as hell after upgrading your slots (Depending on the difficulty).\n*Classes of higher levels can enter matches of any difficulty, and steal all the kills of the lower level classes, making the game too easy or too hard.\n*Weapons are not balanced well either, as some guns are radically better than others.\n*Connecting to servers with a group is not streamlined!!! Sometimes people in your group cannot connect to servers you can connect to, and you need to go on a 30 minute hunt just to find a server that works! I'm not sure why this is an issue, but I seriously hope it doesn't plauge the 2nd game coming out.\n*The game only has 1 boss that you will fight every... single... time! No variety with this fight; which makes the game feel more tedious than it oughta be!\n*Costumes and DLC are WAYYYYYY too Expensive! They need to tone down the prices on some of these items!\n*Headshots are completely random in this game: Sometimes I can pull off headshots for days, while other times I can never get one, even when I'm standing right in front of him, aiming down the sight, and shooting his face! You'll find you get more headshots by just aiming their general direction and firing from the hip.\n\nNitpicks:\n*Flashlights only work for your original pistol; which means that you have to switch away from your original weapon just to see in dark areas. Doesn't kill the gameplay by any means, but it's certainly annoying.\n*Graphic Settings are sub-par at best; I can't customize quite as much as I'd like for a PC title.\n*There is only one voice actor for all of the different costumes (even the pyro costume; which seems strange to me). Not a huge issue, since I like that voice, but I wish they would have added some variety there.\n*Maps can be a mixed bag; and getting the map you want isn't as seamless as you'd like with a party. Kind of leans into the major issue I had with the servers, but this is a lesser issue in comparison.\n\nOverall:\n*It's a great game with some major plauging issues. You can get over these issues with friends, but sometimes it can get very annoying, very quickly. It's like eating Dark Chocolate; It's super delicious at first, but the more you eat, the more bitter it becomes until you need a break to chew at it again.
