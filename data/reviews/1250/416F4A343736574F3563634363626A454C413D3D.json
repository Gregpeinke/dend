The perks enhance things such as explosive damage, headshot damage multiplier, shotgun damage and many other things.  Each perk of course can be levelled up so that the perk offers more enhancements to the specific playstyle, such as the support specialist is a perk that enhances the stats for shotgun users, the perk levels up from weld points which are gained from welding and unwelding doors and of course the other portion of levelling up the perk is gained from distributing damage with shotguns.  Once perks are levelled up to level 5 and 6 bonuses are added alongside the perk such as starting weapons and possibly armor.\n\nThere are multiple maps to choose form while playing Killing Floor and each game played consists of 10 waves and a final boss wave.  The boss is a zombie called The Patriarch.\nIn this game there are multiple types of zombies instead of just one type which other games tend to stick with, each zombie is a different styled zombie varying in strength and agility.\nOverall this game has a lot of different aspects to it and is a very enjoyable game which has a lot of replay value in it and I recommend it to any survival horror game enthusiast.","timestamp_created":1408122773,"timestamp_updated":1421325699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543859660625457764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11716249","author":{"steamid":"76561198106678573","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1409524929},"language":"english","review":"Killing floor is like the CoD series zombies. but with a slightly nore defined storyline and even objectives in some game modes although you do feel left out with the somewhat limited amount of guns you start out with. the game advertises lots of mini DLC and its all verry tempting. but overall its an amazing game and i wish you guys would buy it!","timestamp_created":1408117988,"timestamp_updated":1408117988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11716017","author":{"steamid":"76561198055010491","num_games_owned":277,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":810,"last_played":1427480505},"language":"english","review":"my first reaction to this game was \"why are we english\"\n\nthis question has not been answered\n\n9 out of 11","timestamp_created":1408116944,"timestamp_updated":1408116944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11714826","author":{"steamid":"76561198127549120","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":53536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1197,"last_played":1536654547},"language":"russian","review":"Интересная игрушка","timestamp_created":1408110734,"timestamp_updated":1408110734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491951674222946167","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11714274","author":{"steamid":"76561198002387608","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3913,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3766,"last_played":1483614333},"language":"polish","review":"niby straszne ale majnkraft troche straszniejszy","timestamp_created":1408107673,"timestamp_updated":1408107673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11713835","author":{"steamid":"76561198141509869","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1430856199},"language":"russian","review":"В эту игру одному очень сучно играть.

With the usual small caveat of \"as long as your team works as a team\".  Killing Floor is a VERY team-centric game, and while there may be people out there who boast they can solo maps while leaving their teams in the dust, that just doesn't fly in the higher difficulty settings, where the game really expects you all to pull together and perform your chosen roles.\n\nThere's no room for \"let's all go as the same class\" a good part of the time.  You WILL encounter monsters that are resistant to the damage your class specializes in, and your limited ammo will end up being chewed up way too fast.  There's no room for \"I'll  just go lone wolf\" most of the time, since the game will [b]happily[/b] spawn groups of monsters on top of anyone who decides to Rambo their way through a stage, ala [i]Left 4 Dead 1/2[/i].  There's no room to not have a medic and/or support in any game with 3 or more people playing, since you'll end up facing waves of critters that will tear 1/4 of your health off of you at a time.\n\nIf you pull together as a team, and watch out for each other, you can roll over most anything.  Hoarding cash is frowned upon, since you can only hold so much, and throwing cash out to put more tools in the hands of your teammates can only help you in the long run.  Watching each other's backs becomes much more effective than simply focusing on your fronts.\n\nOverall, it's a really well put together game, and a must for anyone who enjoys \"let's all cling togther\" type action/survival games.  It's got a pretty decent modding/mapmaking community, too, and that's really helped the game last for as long as it has.","timestamp_created":1407959002,"timestamp_updated":1407959002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11692525","author":{"steamid":"76561198074016044","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3467,"last_played":1489953399},"language":"german","review":"es ist zwar schon etwas älter aber immer noch eins der besten zombie survial spiele die es gibt","timestamp_created":1407957931,"timestamp_updated":1407957931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11692177","author":{"steamid":"76561198065334150","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":832,"last_played":1441303722},"language":"english","review":"Strangley addictive","timestamp_created":1407956102,"timestamp_updated":1407956102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11691773","author":{"steamid":"76561198013648600","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1029,"last_played":1426272132},"language":"dutch","review":"greatl","timestamp_created":1407953774,"timestamp_updated":1407953774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11689447","author":{"steamid":"76561198128071650","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":9464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3292,"last_played":1572178458},"language":"russian","review":"Нормально, играть можно !
