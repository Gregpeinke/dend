Up and Smell the Ashes...\n\nLast time we left Gordon Freeman, the unlikely scientist-hero from the first Half-Life, he was traveling. Yes, just traveling. The mystery was where he was traveling to and why all of the incidents at Black Mesa had happened (not to mention why the game was rife with so many horrific jumping puzzles towards the end). Half-Life 2 begins with Gordon arriving via train with the G-Man teasing his mind with sickly whispers of warning. The last stop of the arriving train is City 17, a bastion of the alien Combine forces, yet another mystery themselves.\n\nFor the rest of the story, you'll have to play the game yourself. I'm absolutely dedicated to getting through this review with your chance at an untarnished gaming experience intact. That means no spoilers. Suffice to say, there are lots of twists to curl your brain along the way, some a bit more predictable than others, but all welcome and interesting.\n\nWhile the writing and plot points will act as fly paper to your attention, the real winner here is the way the story is presented. Through the eyes of Gordon Freeman, you'll experience roughly 17-20 hours of consciousness which tests your senses and captures your mind. The simplicity and style with which this story is presented are perhaps the most graceful maneuvers of the many that Valve has carried out. From the moment you take your first steps off of that train and into the station at City 17, you'll begin to be tutored in the ways of this bizarre eastern European city. Public service announcements, private conversations, and the actions of characters around you, whether part of the Combine or simply waylaid citizens, create a stifling and threatening feeling that City 17 has become some sort of elaborate prison preaching the chance for freedom and opportunity without choice or desire.\n\nWhile I was ultimately left a little bit frustrated by the open-endedness, the journey to get to the end of the story was assuredly interesting and opened up the doors to many more possibilities. It's easy to start speculating about this or that, just don't let it drive you nuts. The deeper you get, the darker and more intriguing it becomes until you get to the end... which you'll have to see for yourself.\n","timestamp_created":1624904827,"timestamp_updated":1645212475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94600037","author":{"steamid":"76561199065879034","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":11,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1660571048},"language":"english","review":"shitty game no recomen d thank((((","timestamp_created":1624903873,"timestamp_updated":1624903873,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94596852","author":{"steamid":"76561199085131083","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":185,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1625931618},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1624900843,"timestamp_updated":1624900843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94596783","author":{"steamid":"76561198146699835","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":463,"last_played":1626920767},"language":"english","review":"yes\n","timestamp_created":1624900762,"timestamp_updated":1624900762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94596552","author":{"steamid":"76561198290233503","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":354,"last_played":1657456391},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego.

MUST PLAY GAME\n\nedit: \nPure silence, it was strange. So I then decided to forcefully close the game using task manager. Restarted the game and it began playing normally in the train sequence just like how I remembered.\n\nAfter playing a few hours, I went to sleep... woke up the next day and went to work where I talked with my friend / co worker about Half life. He talked about a half life 2 beta which was really strange and creepy, containing these weird and eerie sounds. I was interested and downloaded the beta when I got home, I opened it up and saw the menu, seeing how still and static it was with no sound. I hit the training room and entered a facility with kleiner. Eventually playing that level I started hearing these weird sounds and saw Gman apparitions with a weird moving wall.........\n\nAssuming that the game wanted me to progress in that direction, I pressed onwards, forcing Gordon Freeman to pass by shifting walls of metal, their dull hues contrasting the bright red error signs surrounding them. I heard the background noises fade out, until it was just Gordon’s steps against the concrete floor.\n\nSuddenly, the HUD disappeared from my screen, leaving nothing but a long concrete corridor and the sounds of footsteps, slowly getting louder. Entranced by the endless corridor ahead, I pressed onwards. I could hear my crappy PC fan whirring unusually fast. I took my finger off the W key just to turn on the desk fan I kept nearby to cool it off. When I looked back, Gordon was still moving towards a door. I tried to press pause, but nothing happened. Gordon just kept going forwards into the door. It slid open, revealing a pure black room with sonic.exe within. I heard gordon's crying reverberating through my empty bedroom.","timestamp_created":1624890025,"timestamp_updated":1655713645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94584018","author":{"steamid":"76561199024843514","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1638541889},"language":"english","review":"Pretty
