online experience. While Half-Life 2 surpassed the incredible Half-Life singleplayer it's multiplayer did not thanks to the lack of interesting weapons and time itself. No one is playing this. The physics are neat but Half-Life 2 weapons were not the best part of Half-Life 2. They weren't bad or anything but when all your doing is shooting the problems HL2's arsenal had start to show. It never had a lot of support and the maps on offer are quite dull compared to HL1's which is a shame.

It's nothing but spawn campers insta kills and it's hard to move any where without getting INSTA KIILED! I launched the game for the first time thinking it will just be last man standing, but then I saw the title screen and there were rebles and combine, so I thought ok so it's team deathmatch and I joined a server with a decent amout of people in it and the first thing I saw was a player flying straight twords me and one shot me with an smg. I was starting to get confused because the description of the game says \"Play straight deathmatch or try Combine vs. Resistance teamplay.\" But it doesn't say anything about spawn camping or insta killing. So I tried another server and the same thing was happining people camping every where because they knew if they moved any where they would die. So really this game is the devil in disguise, don't get this game unless you want to be that guy.

So yea, nowadays you will have to buy it separately. \n\nCommunity is small but living. Sometimes you will have over five or ten players in each of five servers or so. Sometimes it's just fourteen players filling up single server. It still is enough to have fun with basic stuff. Community has preference of playing either Deathmatch on some low-gravity killbox map or team Deathmatch on Runoff map, which is quite horrible.\n\nSo yes, you got Deathmatch. And you also got Team Deathmatch, which divides players between Combines and Rebels. The only difference is reskin of useless melee weapon.\n\nYou will also can find some people playing cooperative mod (usually invasion style thing) or roleplay ones.\n\nIt comes with few official maps, though most likely you will only get to see Runoff. Which is badly made, giving Combine side a rocket launcher right at the start, while making Rebels have to walk back to get more or less good weapons. It also has a looong dead end, which only has shotgun at the end, as if it's some kind of super weapon.\n\nIt's quite standard deathmatch game from older times. You got arena, you spawn in random spot or so, you have to collect pickups, there is no leveling. You don't usually survive encounters, so don't expect to be able to run away to get some health, it's kinda chaotic.\n\nBeing based on Half-Life 2, it brings physics into gameplay. Mostly it comes to ability to pick any object with gravi-gun and throw it at opponent. Another common tactic is using it to throw grenades that you put onto ground. It's not much of use otherwise, you can't get much of creative uses of gravi-gun in game where amount of kills is what counts. You may try to make ladders somewhere or try to block doorways with objects, but it's weak tactics.\n\nWeapon balance is where HL2: Deathmatch fails. There are two things that win the games: explosions and revolver.\nAny explosion has huge radius and would kill anybody immediately. And rocket launcher has rockets that are homing to the spot that you are pointing it, so players rarely escape whoever has rocket launcher. Those who don't have such weapons can just lob grenade onto floor, grab it with gravi-gun and then throw it as opponent, making sure that it will explode near player. Which requires timing. But still.\nWhen you don't get rocket launcher, you should go for revolver. It's a highly accurate hitscan weapon that requires only two shots to kill players, or even one if it's a headshot. Let's say, a skilled player can dominate both long-range and short-range as long as they know how to aim. After all, you can use Zoom, even though you have to release Zoom button before being able to fire. Nothing much that other players can do against that.\n\nOtherwise, you will use either crossbow or shotgun for short range. Yes, crossbow. Revolver is more effective at long range. So you just insta-kill people at very close range with bolts, as long as you can predict. Otherwise just do double-shot with shotgun. Yes, double-shot, alternative fire. Always do it.\n\nEverything else takes too long to kill and thus is quite useless.\n\nSo, what we got there, is a Deathmatch that feels tucked on the Half-Life 2, keeping weapon balance that was designed for single-player. It's not terribly balanced and fun. But I guess it should be amusing with bunch of friends, to fool around.","timestamp_created":1433242245,"timestamp_updated":1433256884,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16128286","author":{"steamid":"76561198128118805","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1579218260},"language":"finnish","review":"nn","timestamp_created":1433224808,"timestamp_updated":1487859021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16111740","author":{"steamid":"76561198230067296","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":527,"last_played":1433788465},"language":"english","review":"This game has very little people playing on the servers.","timestamp_created":1433140893,"timestamp_updated":1433140893,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16040571","author":{"steamid":"76561198162415341","num_games_owned":438,"num_reviews":147,"playtime_forever":395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1494502456},"language":"russian","review":"Даже тут грёбанные Поляки!!!!!! 10 ПОЛЯКОВ из 10","timestamp_created":1432828704,"timestamp_updated":1432828704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16034756","author":{"steamid":"76561198154612759","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":82,"last_played":1464509288},"language":"spanish","review":"Pues que les puedo decir... \nSi hubiera un boton de \"mas o menos\" lo pondria \nBueno para matar aburrimiento. 7/10\nSi lo recomiendo.","timestamp_created":1432790299,"timestamp_updated":1432790299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15998847","author":{"steamid":"76561198125308201","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":40,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40,"last_played":1432993180},"language":"english","review":"It's just like Half-Life 2 but it's a DM.\n\nIts a really good game!\n\nBUT! \n\nIt's not so popular and if its not popular its not many ppl playing.\n\nIm sure is you update the game many more players want to buy this game!\n\n6/10 Because nearly no players","timestamp_created":1432563905,"timestamp_updated":1432563905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15987128","author":{"steamid":"76561198004720534","num_games_owned":319,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3012,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2837,"last_played":1489255068},"language":"english","review":"Half-Russian 2: Lagmatch","timestamp_created":1432491641,"timestamp_updated":1432491641,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":80,"weighted_vote_score":"0.666046202182769775","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15959912","author":{"steamid":"76561198050395665","num_games_owned":1952,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":532000,"playtime_last_two_weeks":556,"playtime_at_review":398287,"last_played":1660566480},"language":"english","review":"Still a great thriving community after 17 years...
