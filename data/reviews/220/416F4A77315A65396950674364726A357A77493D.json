This game, or really any Valve game for that matter, has been the first step in many people's gaming journeys, or in someway has impacted theirs in some way or another. Although being called Half Life 2, in many ways this game throws away many of the elements from the previous game (for better or worse), and instead of fighting your way through the tight corridors of Black Mesa, you'll be battling against the series new enemy - the Combine - through the many diverse set pieces this game has to offer.\n\nTo keep the spoilers to a minimum, because it should be a crime to do so with people who have not played this game, the story in this game is still unmatched and one of the best out there. Almost every character oozes with personality, charm and seems to have their own story to tell - even nameless NPCs, and enemies to some extent. Everywhere you go you'll find yourself wondering, \"what happened here?\" or something of the sort, and see the effects the Combine's occupation of Earth has caused. And while by the end you may find yourself with more questions than answers, this game does it in a way that you'll still be at least somewhat satisfied - although the ending on its own isn't that great.\n\nAs for gameplay and graphics, this game still does hold up and even surpasses most modern games in some ways - albeit the gunplay could be considered a bit simple nowadays. From the game's amazing physics (that it loves to show off), to the unmatched realistic character movements, unique arsenal of weapons, and more, this game has a lot to offer. Combine that with Half Life 2's way of making its cutscenes as unintrusive as possible, you won't be out of the action for long when the story comes calling.\n\nHowever, there are some not so good things about the game I have found. First being that Valve wasn't afraid to change up and experiment with the gameplay as the game goes on, which can be both good and bad. It can keep the game fresh and exciting, but also can end up with large portions of the game dragging on and not being that enjoyable if you don't like the new mechanic. [spoiler]Prime examples being the vehicle sections, namely the airboat (and its long romance with the Hunter-Chopper), and the turret defense sections - although with some work, and making them shorter, I feel they could be really great.[/spoiler] Second, the Combine Soldier AI either needs a lot of work or Valve needs to redo certain chapters to make it work, because these guys can be really dumb sometimes and compared to the H.E.C.U, you'll start to wonder how they managed to keep the Resistance cells down. Maybe it's all those Shotgun Soldiers they like so much... Alongside that, your allies need some work as well - both for the important and nameless characters, however the former was thankfully addressed in the Episodes, now we can only hope that Half Life 3 squad AI will take cover from sniper shots. Third, while there is some resource management, you don't really find yourself being sparing with your health or ammo like in the first game. It gets better in the higher difficulties, but the supply crate system needs work. \n\n[spoiler]One last thing I wish to talk about before ending this, is about the leaked beta versions of Half Life 2. While I love the retail version of the game and understand that it was all cut for one reason or another, I feel that aspects could have been easily incorporated into the game, or made into a separate DLC or even game (something like a Shepherd VS The Consul prequel). Stuff like the Combine Assassin, Guard, Hydra, OICW, Houndeye, Elite Metro Cop, and Cremator would have made great additions to the game, alongside the even darker themes. Personally, if they were touched up and finished, I could even see the old textures/artstyle making a great addition to the game. But I digress...[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, despite Half Life generally being a very advanced tech demo for Valve, this is a [i]must have[/i] - even if you've played the game before, like most of their games. And once you complete it and its Episodes, you should go check out some of the mods that have or are coming out, like Obsidian Conflict, MINERVA, Dark Interval, or the classic Garry's Mod.","timestamp_created":1615351865,"timestamp_updated":1615351865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88165450","author":{"steamid":"76561198087775436","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":976,"last_played":1616023531},"language":"spanish","review":"classic.

mekaniği her şeyi müthiş,sanat eseri gibi oyun,.Tavsiyem half life 1 veya blackmesa,half life 2,hl2 episode 1 ve hl2 episode 2 sırasıyla oynayın.\n    Hikaye en kısa şekilde anlatırsak;Karakterimiz Teorisyen fizikçi Gordon Freeman,,çalıştığımız kuruluş gizli bir araştırma şirketi olan Black Mesa,görevimiz her gün olduğu gibi kristali anti mass spectrometere götürüp diğer bilim adamlarının bu maddeyi incelemesini sağlamak,ancak kristal diğerlerinin aksine çok saf  ve bu kristalin daha iyi incelenmesi adına güvenlik sistemi kapalı olduğu için,temas anında çok büyük patlama gerçekleşir ve curcuna kopar.Artık Xen boyutu ve Dünya arası portallar açılacaktır.Xen'deki yaratıklar genel anlamda saldırgan,kalabalık ve tehlikeli olduğu için Black Mesa'yı istila ederler katliam yaparlar.ABD ise ört bas etmek için hem şirketteki herkesi öldürmek hem de istilacılardan kurtulmak amacıyla orduyu yollar.Ordu başarısız olur ve daha sonra hayatta kalan olan askerler bizim tarafa geçip ABD'nin özel askerleri Black Ops ekibi ve diğer uzaylılara karşı savaşır.Half life 1'in sonlarına doğru da Xen'deki tehlikeli yaratıklarla ve son karşılaşmada  da portalları lehinde kullanarak Dünya'yı tamamen istila etmek isteyen Nihilath ile savaşırız.Nihilath ölünce G-man bizi oluşan patlamadan kurtarır ve Half life 1 biter.\n    Half life 2'de de ana düşman Combinelar ve onun ordularıdır.Combineler evrende sayısız toplumu ve hayat olan gezegenlerin kaynaklarını sömüren,sömürdüğü toplumlardan da iradesi olmayan büyük ordular kuran üstün ırktır.Nihilath'ın ölmesi ile oluşan portallar Combineların ilgisini Dünya'ya çekmiştir.Dünya'ya ordularını yollayan Combinelar 7 saatte Dünya'daki bütün orduları katletmiştir.Daha sonra anlaşmayla kalan insanları yok etmekten vazgeçmiştir;hayatta kalan insaların bir kısmıyla da iradeli veya iradesiz Dünya'da ordu kurmuştur ve kendi büyük ordularını evreni sömürmek için geri yollamıştır.Biz de Gordon Freeman olarak amacımız direnişçilerle orduya karşı savaşıp,büyük kuleyi yok edip portalı kapatmak ve combinelerin geri gelmesini önlemektir.Oyunun sonlarında kule havaya uçmuştur ancak G-man ve vertiganlar(adı yanlış olabilir,pikaçu gibi elektrik atan ,zaman büken çok zeki varlıklar) bizi ve Alyx'i oradan kurtarmıştır.Half life 2 de burda biter.\nEpisode 1 ve 2 de ise genel olarak kuleden kaçıp kalan orduyla savaşırız.Combinelar kendi yapamadığı ama insanlarıın yapabildiği portal teklonojisine başından beri peşindedirler,ancak kule havaya uçunca Dünya'ya geri dönemezler ve teklonojiyi ele geçiremezler,kalan ordu da Gordon Freeman önderliğinde direnişçiler tarafından katledilir.Üstün ırk direnişçilere yenilmiştir.Episode 1'in sonunda trenle şehirden ayrılırız.Episode 2'nin sonunda da Alyx'in babası bir Combine tarafından öldürülür.\n    \nBir de Black Mesa gibi portallar üzerinde çalışan gizli bir şirket vardır adını hatırlamıyorum ama bu şirketin bir yapısı,batmış geminin içindedir.Ancak içinde ne olduğu bilinmediği için incelenmemiştir.Bu yapı portal açıp Combineların tekrar Dünyayı istila etmesine neden olabilir ve istila tekrar olursa Combinelar kalan insanları da ordusuyla katledip teknolijiyi ele geçirerek bütün evreni sömürecektir.Bu şirket portal oyununda var ve half life 3 gelirse orda da işlenebilir,pek bilmiyorum.\n\nHikaye genel olarak böyle ama ayrıntıları çok çok fazla,bence en iyi hikaye.Kesinlikle oynayın","timestamp_created":1615326249,"timestamp_updated":1615326547,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88153643","author":{"steamid":"76561199058241410","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":337,"last_played":1638735112},"language":"spanish","review":"la

He glances to the rubbish bin beside him, where a soda tin balances precariously on the rim. He raises his electrified baton and knocks the tin onto the ground.\n\n\"Pick up that can,\" he buzzes through his face mask.\n\nI swipe it off the ground.\n\n\"Good. Now put it in the trash.\"\n\nHalf Life 2 isn't really a game about choice. But this is one of the few moments where it offers the player options. I could oblige the officer and throw the can in the bin, to which he will respond by laughing and allowing me to pass. Or I could chuck it at his face, after which he will chase me around the station until he whacks me with his electro-stick.\n\nIt's a fairly innocuous moment in a game which has more memorable scenes than most FPS' combined. And yet for me it stands out because Valve are doing so much with this simple set up. Firstly, it's teaching you the central mechanic that Half Life 2 builds itself around - the ability to pick up and throw objects in the world. Meanwhile, the officer's actions demonstrate to us the arbitrary and draconian enforcement powers of Civil Protection, which exist in stark contrast to the propagandist message of peace and harmony offered by Doctor Breen on the enormous viewing screens dotted around City 17.\n\nFinally, should we choose to resist, this scene offers us a microcosmic glimpse of Freeman's immediate future, where he will break the spine of the Combine's Police Force by throwing much larger objects at them using the preposterously powerful gravity gun. Wooden crates, explosive barrels, the occasional toilet, all will become ammunition in the war against the Combine.\n\nNearly two decades since its release, Gordon Freeman's one-man revolution remains without a doubt in my mind the finest FPS to ever have been crafted. And crafted is very much the operative word here. It exists amongst a miniscule fraction of games which are so carefully put together, which evolve so organically in their environmental design and stay systemically fresh for their duration.\n\nI've played Half Life 2 so many times that most of its scenes are burned into my mind. Not simply its most famous sequences such as the dark horror of Ravenholm, travelling along the coastline in the buggy, and the entire climactic battle toward the Citadel that runs through the chapters \"Anticitizen One\" and \"Follow Freeman\", but also little vignettes easily missed like the locations where the G-Man watches your progress, or the Vortigaunt hidden in the effluent pipe in \"Water Hazard\".\n\nHalf Life 2 has hundreds of moments like this. Indeed, one of the reasons behind its enduring greatness is they way in which Valve hide something new around almost every corner you turn. What elevates Half Life 2 above pretty much every other shooter is how it sews everything so elegantly together.\n\nHalf Life 2 is my standard example of what I like to call organic game design. An organic game is one which dispenses almost entirely with format and repetition, the engine that drives games such as Diablo or World of Warcraft. Organic games have a consistency to them, environments which flow naturally from one scene to the next, and systems that constantly grow and evolve as the game progresses.\n\nHalf Life 2 evokes these ideas in almost every instance. There's only a single break in environmental consistency in the entire game - the moment when Freeman is teleported from the depths of Nova Prospekt prison back to Kleiner's Lab. The rest of the game transitions seamlessly from one place to the next, making City 17 and its surrounding countryside feel like a real place that has evolved according to natural laws and architectural logic.\n\nThe towering icon of this consistency is the Citadel itself, which is visible in the background for the majority of the game. In the first half you're always moving away from it, as Freeman runs across rooftops and skis along canals to evade the forces of the Combine. The final act inverts the situation, seeing you rushing bravely toward it with a small army of rebels rallying under the Lambda sign.\n\nInversion is another of Half Life 2's running themes. Freeman frequently turns the weapons of the Combine onto themselves, whether it's by snatching a grenade from the air with the gravity gun and firing it back into their ranks, or overpowering a gun emplacement and using it to fend off waves of soldiers. This theme isn't incidental either, Valve make several deliberate nods at it during particular chapters. The first is seen in Water Hazard, where an attack chopper harasses you with machinegun fire as you traverse the canals. Then, later in the chapter, a rebel station attaches the same type of gun to your hovercraft, the rebel remarking \"I always like to bring a little irony to a firefight\".\n\nThe other notable example is of course with the Antlions. For two of the game's chapters these giant yellow insects pester you incessantly, particularly in the fantastic \"Sandtraps\" chapter, where the only way to cross the beach without being mauled by these fearsome creatures is to create paths using the flotsam and jetsam washed up by the sea. As you near Nova Prospekt, a furious battle with an Antlion Queen leaves you clutching a set of pheromone glands which control the Antlions behaviour, and instantly the entire colony is at your beck and call. It's an ingenious and deeply satisfying switcheroo.\n\nEven when it isn't being systemically witty, Half Life 2 is almost perfectly paced. It always knows precisely when to introduce a new concept, and lets the player run with them for just the right amount of time. A good example of this is the Striders, the strange half-organic, half mechanical tripods that are the Combine's primary suppressive tool against the population of City 17. You glimpse one over a fence within the first twenty minutes of the game, but don't fight any until inside the last two hours, and the game only lets you topple a few of these mighty adversaries before the end. Similarly, the Gravity Gun is handed to you by Alyx Vance in the fifth chapter, but Valve dial back its physics-grabbing powers just a little until the game's very end, when a disintegration field inside the citadel destroys all your weapons but inadvertently supercharges the Gravity Gun, enabling you to grab and throw people for the first time. Right to the death, Half Life 2 is still introducing new toys for you to experiment with.\n\nThere's so much else that I haven't even begun to discuss. The way it takes the cannon-fodder scientists and security guards from the original game and turns them into a diverse cast of endearing, recognisable characters (\"Now about that beer I owed ya! It's me Gordon, Barney from Black Mesa.\") The way it minimises expository dialogue and instead tells its simple story through environmental cues and little snippets of information. (\"Don't drink the water, they put something in it to make you forget.\")The way it blends drama, action, horror and wry humour without any of its elements feeling out of place (\"I am Father Grigori. You have already met my...congregation!\"). As I said earlier, it isn't so much what Half Life 2 contains as how it brings it all together that makes it so darned enjoyable, and ten years down the line, the profound effect created by how Half Life 2 rolls itself out hasn't diminished one iota.\n\nIt's been a long time since Gordon Freeman last rose and shone, and we're still left wondering when or if the story will be continued, whether Half Life 3 will indeed be confirmed. There have even been suggestions that Half Life 3 is an impossibility, that the time of the FPS has passed and Valve cannot top Freeman's second outing without fundamentally changing the game beyond recognition. And they did...\n\nGiven how astonishingly Half Life 2 managed to improve upon its predecessor, I for one can't wait for Gordon Freeman's time to come again.\"\n\nBy Rick
