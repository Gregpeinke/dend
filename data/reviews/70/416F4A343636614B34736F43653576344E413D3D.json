Ich liebe dieses Spiel und kann es nur weiter empfehlen die gerne solche Spiele mit so einer geilen Grafik mögen. Es hat mit Half-Life 2 eine solch so FETTE Story wo man anfangen kann zu heulen. Mit Half-Life: Blue Shift und Half-Life: Opposing Force ist dies mein aller, aller, aller und aller lieblings Spiel. Diese Grafik in den ersten Half-Life Teil ist für mich so was besonderes, dass ich immer so ein richtig komisches Gefühl bekomme was mich einfach nur Glücklich macht und mir laune gibt es zu spielen. Es ist ziemlich schwer und manchmal zum verzweifeln aber  trotzdem der Hammer. Der Preis ist zwar ziemlich hoch aber für so ein Spiel gebe ich gerne mal etwas mehr aus. Dieses Spiel war die Quelle dafür erst zu zocken. Am aller besten find ich ja den G-man der ein ganz schön verwirtt und ein außer Konzept bringt. Aber im ganzen sollte man sich das Spiel holen. Es wäre kein Fehler und wenn trotzdem jemand dieses Spiel nicht mag, dann hat er ein Problem oder hat kein spaß daran wegen der Grafik oder sooooo. Ich hoffe dieses Spiel wird niemals aussterben und für immer weiter leben. Ich hoffe auch sehr das vlt aber auch nur vieleicht es Half-Life 3 rauskommt. Naja ich würde mich auch damit zufrieden geben wenns nicht so wird aber aufjedenfall bleibt Half-Life mein lieblings Spiel egal was es noch für Ego-shooter rauskommen. Das ist auch der unterschied zwischen Valve und solchen Machern von CoD, Valve weiß was man will und CoD haut nur scheiße raus. Ich glaube es wird niewieder so ein Spiel wie Half-Life geben und wenn wäre es eine sehr große Überraschung für mich und Natürlich wäre ich fröh darüber.

Well, for me, it has to be the visual world that captures the core of our imaginations. And with this little gem called Half-Life, it's no exception that this game continues to boggle the mind and leave people wondering. There is more heart, creativity and scientific ingenuity there is in this one title than there is in most series and is arguably Valve's greatest achievement. (With over 50 game awards, it's a strong justification). Half-Life isn't just one of the greatest FPS games of all time. It's not because Half-Life is one of the best purchases you can ever get on Steam. Half-Life is quite simply, one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nWhen compared to certain FPS games in the past and modern times, which both heavily rely on long-winded cutscenes to glorify the main plotline, Half-Life annihilates this compulsed aspect, by detailing the plotlines that keeps the player still in control of the first-person viewpoint, leaving the cutscenes rolling while you still have full access to the gameplay and character controllability. For clarification, You will see through the eyes of Gordon Freeman at all times.\n\nThe game is a constant puzzle; leaving the player to work at tasks that involve being locked into battle and overall puzzle solving to advance through the many challenges that wait up ahead. Most of the time, the story illuminates the puzzles by the actions to proceed, such as maze scenarios and building boxes to use as staircases. Though Half-Life has short-lived loading screens from time to time after leaving a certain area for a new one, the game has no levels. But, to make up for this traditional concept, the game is split into a number of mind-boggling chapters filled with rich story glory.\n\nTo start off with this game's story, you're none other than Gordon Freeman. A young man who holds a Ph.D in theoretical physics who starts his daily grind back at the Black Mesa Research Facility; a fictional complex that is stranded in a remote desert located in the suburbs of New Mexico. Arriving late for work yet again, you take the tram system around the Black Mesa Research Facility and at this point, objectives that his game has fulfilled such as breath-taking visuals and movie quality animation begins to blossom. The tram sequence at the beginning of the game can only be summed up in one word; Incredible. It's as if the things that come flying at you from every angle and position, almost reminiscent of watching an action-packed movie, along with the credits of the producer's names proudly fading in and out on the corner of the screen.\n\nAs you make your first step in the heavily secured facility, you're constantly reminded that you put on your Hazardous Enviromental suit, or the H.E.V suit for short. While all things are hunky-dory, those things soon turn to the worst very soon. After a failed experiment, involving a collision between a rare intergalactic specimen from another dimension with an Anti-Mass Spectrometer, the Black Mesa facility falls in ruins, meaning you are one of the only key survivors of the infamous ''Black Mesa Incident''. And with this, alien life-forms from the dimension of ''Xen'' are pulled from their dimension into ours and are running amok the ruined facility, along with the Army that storm the place after the gone, haywired facility's emergency call has been echoed. This of course doesn't make things any easier and you soon find yourself battling both the aliens and army.\n\nWhile there isn't exactly much to complain about, I would admit that guiding the chickened-out scientists and professors around the facility can be quite a pain now and again, as well as the alien life-form, Vortigaunt, from which you would have to wait and be patient for them to wreck down wooden doors in front of you, as you are not capable of doing that yourself. (You do start off with a crowbar, right?) As well as I'm probably not the only one who made the same mistake by killing them through a small opening, before they did in fact begin to tear down the doors. But then again, this is where the used scripted intermissions started to show, so that's an added bonus.\n\nFor the long run, I've had fun and joy both reviewing this amazing game and playing this amazing game. If you haven't play Half-Life and you're not familiar with Half-Life, it's still a massive recommendation from me.","timestamp_created":1421601045,"timestamp_updated":1421601045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14051304","author":{"steamid":"76561198096693349","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":875,"last_played":1427726588},"language":"german","review":"Ich liebe Half Life.

Everyone has heared of this fantastic game so i dont need to say anything witty before i write this review cause youre gonna know the outcome before the final sentence. In Half Life we play as Gordan Freeman. A scientist at Black Mesa who is tasked to stop an Alien Invasion before its too late. Half Life is one of the most outsanding games i have played to date and it shows that this game is a classic which will never be forgotten. Half Life is a FPS where you run and gun through enviroments and weirdly enough some platforming segments as well. The game is very fast paced but in some sections you will need to slow down if you dont want to die. The game is incredibly fun to play and without a doubt is one of the best games i have ever played. But there are some issues with this Gold Source version that arent present in the Source remake. The game has many bugs that will probably never get patched. Some of these bugs are game breaking and might force you to use cheats to get through some sections. Overall Half Life is a fantastic game and without a doubt if there are any people who havent played this game by now go get this game and the rest of the series this instant. I give Half Life a 8/10","timestamp_created":1421530098,"timestamp_updated":1421530098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468190371990203857","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14035258","author":{"steamid":"76561198106022740","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1256,"last_played":1604116618},"language":"english","review":"I don't need to say anything buy it its great and you're great if you buy it.","timestamp_created":1421520428,"timestamp_updated":1421520428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14034164","author":{"steamid":"76561198048284547","num_games_owned":559,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":63,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":63,"last_played":1389885507},"language":"russian","review":"Игра не требующая представления.

In opposition to other FPSs that focused on a more heavily arcade-influenced gameplay (secrets, par times, quick action), Half-Life was almost entirely designed around a linear first-person narrative structure, watching the events unfold around them through the eyes of Gordon Freeman. \n\nHalf-Life's blend of story and gameplay is what sells the game. You participate in this fast-paced horror/science-fiction/action journey through an enormous scientific complex and it feels incredibly satisfying to do so. Watching the enviorment go through various shades of Underground Laboratory Bunker gives you a real sense of scale at how Black Mesa is. \n\nThe weapons are a huge component of the game's atmosphere, with different areas giving you different weapons, all of them fun to use in some way. The game takes full advantage of its weapon selection not just from a story perspective but a character perspective as well. Gordon is a young, relatively inexperienced researcher who fights against the expected norms in this scenario by repeatedly fighting his way through Black Mesa backpacking all manner of experimental and unconventional weaponry. Learning how to use all of them makes a playthrough so much more satisfying than if you were to just sprint through with just the first four guns you grab.\n\nThe first Half-Life stands well apart from other expansions, mods, and even its own sequel. Opposing Force and Blue Shift, while satisfactory expansions don't maintain the uniquely original aura of the first game. Black Mesa, despite touting itself as a remake, really only succeeds in presenting a more modern and realistic setting. The rest of the mod is just poorly-playtested gunk. It's just not as fun to play as the original game. Ditching Xen to chase the multiplayer carrot didn't help either. Half-Life 2 just isn't as interesting a game as the first one. It manages to simultaneosly have worse gameplay, story, and artstyle than the first game.\n\n*unintelligble soldier noises*\n\nGordon is punished for his lateness and everyone suffers.\n\nmarvel at the questionable FPS game design choices of yesteryear.\n\nwhensblackmesa (just kidding we already know it's broken as much as it fixed)","timestamp_created":1421293410,"timestamp_updated":1474040032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13990350","author":{"steamid":"76561198154048630","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1567823284},"language":"english","review":"Best game series ever. i would recommend playing this game before any of the new half life games (half life 2) because the graphics compaired to the 2nd half life game are really bad.","timestamp_created":1421290474,"timestamp_updated":1421290474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13990020","author":{"steamid":"76561198006560453","num_games_owned":372,"num_reviews":96,"playtime_forever":870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":870,"last_played":1432217268},"language":"english","review":"[h1]TL:DR?

With that said, although I consider Half-Life as a classical MASTERPIECE and possibly one of the greatest games of all time, I will still list down game mechanics from the past that some people may not enjoy today.\n\nThink of it like this: everyone enjoys flying modern-day commercial jets like the 747, but it doesn't mean however that everyone would like to fly in a DC-3 built in the 1940s despite it being labeled as the 'most significant transport aircraft' in history.\n\n[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]\nHalf-Life is a narrative-driven linear first-person shooter (FPS) action game and is the debut (and signature) title of Valve.  Hailed as one of the greatest games of all time winning dozens of awards on release, Half-Life revolutionized the FPS genre in a way that no other title has done since Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake. This game has since been the industry standard on how to make a perfect FPS game which combines realistic gameplay, fun puzzles mechanics, a narrative-driven single-player experience with fast-paced multiplayer action.\n\nThe game follows the story of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist working for the Black Mesa Research Facility that is involved in Weapons Development, Research on Teleportation Technology and occasional cloning of a Security Guard named Barney Calhoun.  When an experiment with an unknown alien crystal results in a catastrophic accident that opened a portal to an alien dimension named 'Xen', Gordon Freeman, wearing the H.E.V. Suit, must now travel across the entire Black Mesa facility to reach the Lambda Complex where he must enter a portal to Xen and kill the creature that is keeping the portal open for the alien invaders. Fight against Invading alien monsters and, at the same time, US Military operatives who are attempting to stop the invasion but is also trying to silence any surviving 'witnesses' of the Black Mesa incident.\n\n[h1]LEGACY OF HALF-LIFE (PROS):[/h1]\n+ First FPS game to fully incorporate a Narrative-Driven story (as opposed to the industry standard of maze gallery shooters which was the Wolfenstein 3D / Doom mechanic)\n+ Excellent level designs\n+ Realistic combat mechanics (may be not as realistic now in 2015, but 17 years ago it was)\n+ Fun puzzles\n+ Great sound effects\n+ First FPS game to incorporate scripted sequences for its level transitions rather than cut-scenes\n+ Relatively advanced AI (back in 1998), with enemies actively dodging, tactically retreating and often times baiting you into an ambush.\n+ Fun fast-paced multiplayer action that set the foundations for Counter-Strike which started as a mere mod of Half-Life\n+ Mods; although Half-Life is not the first video game to be modded, it is the first to have several such mods become their own full games that still retain their Half-Life heritage\n+ Challenging difficulty modes (but this is a given since most old-school shooters were challenging)\n\n[h1]OLD GAME MECHANICS THAT NEW GENERATION OF GAMERS MAY NOT LIKE (CONS):[/h1]\n- Perpetual sprint with optional walking by pressing “Shift” (as opposed to today's standard which is the reverse)\n- No objective tracker (players may forget what they were doing especially if they haven't played in a while)\n- Melee weapon needs to be equipped rather than bound to a hotkey (though CS:GO players won't have a problem with this)\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n[b][u]MASTERPIECE[/u][/b] is the only word that best describes Half-Life in my opinion.  Although some of its mechanics may not necessarily be applicable in today's (2015) standard, the same can still be considered as part of its charm, much like how most of us still enjoy watching old-school movies and TV shows.\n\n[h1]WORTH IT?:[/h1]\n[b]MUST BUY AND MUST HAVE[/b]. I, however, do recommend you purchase the Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 but if you don't have it, get Half-Life Complete.\n\n[h1]ADDITIONAL INFO (Not necessary for the review):[/h1]\nThe advent of Half-Life was a turning point in gaming history, most notably, the First-person shooter genre.  Before this game, the only FPS standard to be followed was Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake, with the first two being plotless maze shooters and Quake being the first to implement a backstory but still retained the maze-like levels. With Half-Life, developers saw a potential for FPS games to combine intense action and gunplay with effective narrative story-telling through leniar levels (which is heavily abused by some FPS games today) and realistic game mechanics (a title, which most people agree, was held by the Metal Gear Solid franchise, a third-person action game)\n\nLet’s put this in an analogy: Wolfenstein 3D is the Wheel (basically invented the mainstream FPS genre), Doom is the Horse-Drawn Carriage (Doom made FPS games extremely popular, accessible and widespread), Quake is the Steam Engine (Quake bridge the gap between plotless maze shooters and  plot driven FPS games [i]Credit: Steam User RGX12 for pointing this out[/i]) and Half-Life is the Ford Model T Car (Half-Life set the standard for modern day FPS games who's basic and essential features still survives today.)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n[h1]Like my Reviews?

As you are walking through the steel corridors to get down to the test chamber all the other scientists keep saying: \"They are waiting for you Gordon in the test chamber\". After 4 loading screens and alot of waiting on scientists to mock you for being late before letting you progress to the test chamber you at last arrive there to do some testing with crystals from the alien world Xen. \n\nHowever the test goes wrong the very second you push the Xen crystal mounted on a Lawn mower into a beam for testing. This creates the resonance cascade which creates a rift between earth and Xen, allowing Vortigaunts and other alien species to enter earth at will. The Black Mesa security cannot stop the aliens and the army is called in. The army is however not there to help the Black Mesa personnel. They are there to kill everybody invovled with the project.\n\nGordon Freeman must now fight the aliens, fight the soldiers, try to save the scientists that mocked him for being late and with the help of the scientists reach Xen to stop Nihilanth(The Alien mastermind). \n\n\nOverall Half-Life is probably one of those games ive spent the most time playing. Outside of steam that is. Bought it back in 1999 and when steam came along my key was already taken steam said(To verify my key I had to take a photo of my product and its key and send it to valve and back in 2004 that was not an easy thing to do). So I had to play it outside of steam until it ended up on one of those sales. If you have steam and don't have Half-Life then I recomend you buying it as quickly as possible.\n\nHalf-Life is also being remade by a team of dudes. The mod is called Black Mesa.\n\nI give Half-Life 10/10 for being a great game and having great replay value.","timestamp_created":1421170403,"timestamp_updated":1660490279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":79,"votes_funny":20,"weighted_vote_score":"0.845714151859283447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13971744","author":{"steamid":"76561198166423068","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":109,"last_played":1555362522},"language":"spanish","review":"Esta de lujo es como una mierda en graficos pero para lo que sirve mejor que las porquerias de cod y bfasdasdsad","timestamp_created":1421169185,"timestamp_updated":1511487941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13968550","author":{"steamid":"76561198098956168","num_games_owned":921,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1377,"last_played":1421143326},"language":"english","review":"Every PC gamer on the face of the Earth will have heard about Half-Life, Valve’s first product, due to its immense popularity ever since its release in November 1998. Half-Life really is one of those games you have to play before you die. I unfortunately missed out on this classic as a child due to being predominantly a console gamer but have finally gotten around to playing it via Steam and I must say it was a pleasant and enjoyable game to play.\n\nThe player steps in the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist employed at the secret underground teleportation research facility Black Mesa. In the due course of the teams’ research, experimentations and developments, something goes disastrously wrong and creates something called the Resonance Cascade which starts to flood the human world with alien-like creatures from a parallel dimension.\n\nThe game runs on the legacy Goldsrc engine and the gameplay reminded me of the styles I’ve observed in the original Thief games which used a completely different engine (Dark Engine). Initially, my impressions of the controls were that Gordon Freeman moved too fast, but I adapted to the game’s controls and this quickly subsided. The gameplay is a simple, intuitive and generic first person shooter (not generic in terms of Call of Duty) that plays out in a linear fashion. The linear world is by no means a negative aspect of the game because this game is best presented in a linear style due to its story. There are no inter-gameplay cutscenes and the player views the world uninterrupted through the eyes of Gordon Freeman. A arsenal of weapons are at your disposal to combat the feral Marine soldiers and alien creatures in any manner you feel comfortable. The signature crowbar is something best remembered from the series. The game provides a decent challenged on medium difficulty, but doesn’t provide an excruciating experience of pulling your hair out whilst shouting obscene things at your monitor with an evil frown.\n\nWith this game’s age in mind, one aspect of its design is its character models. Whilst, decent a lot of them are recycled and lack in variety. I remember about three typical Black Mesa scientists (an Einstein looking man, a black man, and a middle-aged white man). On the other hand, there is variety in the enemies which are conceptually intriguing ranging from leaping headcrabs similar to the creatures in the Alien films, ceiling dwelling Barnacles that suck you up with their tongues, as well as about a dozen more.\n\nIn a nutshell if you fancy having a blast from the past and either experiencing a classic for the first time or revisiting it, then grab a crowbar and get smashing headcrabs. That is, grab the crowbar in the game... not in real life.","timestamp_created":1421150406,"timestamp_updated":1421150406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13962425","author":{"steamid":"76561198093779272","num_games_owned":5564,"num_reviews":174,"playtime_forever":617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":515,"last_played":1559418317},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра в жанре FPS в которую я играл!

Даже ход игры примитивен - сначала мало оружия и слабые враги, после чуть сильнее и новое оружие, а в конце нас ждет босс, которого тоже придется поддать казни. Кроме нового движка ( который переделан с квейковского, но ладно уже, переделали хорошо и можно назвать новым) и графики - эта игра ничем не отличается от того же Дума с выше упомянутым Квейком.

For those of us who enjoy First-Person Shooter [FPS] games, Half-Life was just as influential to the genre as Doom or Quake (for those of you who have never heard of these titles, Wikipedia is your friend). Classics such as Halo: Combat Evolved and newer titles such as Bioshock: Infinite have been influenced by this game, and older games such as Counter-Strike were mods of Half-Life. In short, the entire FPS genre has been creatively influenced by the atmosphere and style of Half-Life.                          - FYI: Final Score is at the end -\n\n- The Look - \n\nHalf-Life was released by Valve (the parent company of Steam) in 1998 for the PC. As such, the graphics are abysmal by modern standards. If you are a nostalgic gamer such as myself, though, the low graphics can be humorous and even add to the charm of the game at times. There are numerous texture packs available if you cannot handle such old graphics.\n\n- The Story (Mild Spoiler Alert) - \n\nYou're a government agent/scientist who gets involved with some experiments on unknown substances. Through testing these substances, you somehow open a portal and unleash an alien horde into the testing facility. You must then find and fight your way out of the facility. Pretty simple and straightforward-sounding. Half-Life was the first-ever game to tell its story completely through scripted sequences (events triggered by certain programmable requirements) and as such has no cutscenes. This is a very nice element to the game as you retain control of your character throughout the entire game.\n\n- The Sounds - \n\nFor some reason, Valve decided they needed to make everything sound like it was coming from the inside of an echo chamber. There is a lot of reverb on just about every noise if you are not completely outdoors. Again, this is an element where modern technology has progressed as to make this appear foolish and unappealing. Give it some time before you make any judgments, though. The effect enhances the scariness of some situations, in my opinion. If you ever play any of the other Valve games (Portal, Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, etc.), you will discover that a LOT of sounds and music in those games originated from Half-Life.\n\n- The Movement - \n\nYou run. You run a lot. You run really fast. You have the option to walk and the option to sneak, but 98% of the time you will be running. Sometimes, especially for unfamiliar novices to the game, the speed is too much and you end up running into an alien patrol before you realize that you just passed through that hallway. You will eventually get used to it, though. Half-Life was one of the first games (if not the first; I'm not sure) to implement the \"jump-crouch\" concept. If you jump and hold the crouch button, you can actually jump onto higher platforms. Instead of lowering your body, jump-crouching raises your legs and feet, giving you more clearance to vault onto objects.\n\n- The Combat - \n\nIf an enemy sees you, they will throw a grenade. Expect to be spammed if you are spotted. Half-Life is a quick-save/quick-load supportive game; you can choose to disregard this if you want a \"purist\" experience. Enemies in this game are rather easy to defeat in the beginning and get harder as the game progresses, but each new type presents its own unique traits that make it hard to kill. The weapon switching system is confusing to a modern gamer at first; it requires you to scroll (or press hot-key) and then left-click to actually arm that weapon. The left shift button, by default, switches instantaneously back to the previous weapon used, allowing for a much faster switch. Weapons and ammo are decently plentiful if you are conservative enough.\n\n- The Mods and The Legacy - \n\nHalf-Life is the number one most modded game of all time. There are more mods available for this game than any other, followed by Morrowind and Quake. The mods have spawned entire new game series, as in the case of Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Half-Life also holds the trophy for another gaming phenomenon: most-played for speedruns. If you are unfamiliar with a speedrun, the gist is that you attempt to start and finish the game as fast as possible.\n\n- The Downsides - \n\nHalf-Life is an ancient piece of software by today's standards. With the advent of 2015, this game is now 17 years old (nearly old enough to purchase cigarettes!). Its age shows in many things. Several furniture items are completely cubic or square and have no roundness. Cockroaches are diamond-shaped. There are only three different models used for the human enemies and three for the friendly scientists. Each alien type has only one model/skin. The NPCs and enemies can get very repetitive at times, as such. Other than this, there aren't very many bad points to Half-Life. Its continued success and popularity speak for its quality and innovation.\n\n- The Conclusion - \n\nHalf-Life is a classic in many gamers' opinions. I am of the same mindset. I completely recommend this game, despite its age and shortcomings, as a fun experience that will provide a decent challenge.\n\nFinal Score: 10/10","timestamp_created":1420778863,"timestamp_updated":1420778863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588112831115722656","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13904061","author":{"steamid":"76561198076269006","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":914,"last_played":1513815011},"language":"english","review":"Good.
