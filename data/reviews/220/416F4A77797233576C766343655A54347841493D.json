The game holds up brilliantly and improves on Half-Life 1 in all the most important ways. The story raises the stakes and the game is a fun ride all the way through, without anything equivalent to the slog that is Xen at the end of the first game. Gunplay is improved and environmental platforming puzzles are much less annoying than in HL1. The game is a bit easier than HL1 on average, but it has a good difficulty curve, gradually ramping up throughout the game, going from the easy early engagements to big firefights over a sprawling city environment with a good amount of verticality. \n\nOverall, Half-Life 2 is fantastic and I have very few complaints about it. Highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1611500392,"timestamp_updated":1611500392,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85271179","author":{"steamid":"76561199019606049","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1092,"last_played":1635866475},"language":"russian","review":"нет","timestamp_created":1611499656,"timestamp_updated":1611499656,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495412856340408325","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85270442","author":{"steamid":"76561198209737964","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1067,"last_played":1643454465},"language":"french","review":"A classic still relevant today !

Although, I should because this was one of the best experiences I had gaming. Anyway, while playing Gaben's Half-Life 2 FPS game my friend noticed that I was having trouble with climbing the ladders and was making fun of me, and I wont lie I was getting kinda owned at the moment. The thing is that I have never used a mechanic such as this for climbing a ladder in a game. So there I was feeling dumb every time I try to climb a ladder, and sometimes once I get it and i'm going up I have to control it so there was a LOT of trial and error... So this kept occurring during gameplay in combat, in puzzles, in platforming, in any place where there are ladders about. SO after a couple ladders and after a couple failures Ashton pointed it out saying something like \"look its the ladder master.\" \"... . hes done it. your the ladder master:)\" I was like what? \"your ladder master.\" I said is that my name? is that my name now? \"hahaha yeah your xXLadderMasterXx\" (this is when I begin to realize what the xX Xx means)\n\nanyway im bored typing out this story. so thats basically how I will always be reffered to as laddermaster whilst gaming so grab your gaming juice and take a SHwiG gAYmerZ!!!!;))):0:)));)))));););):0;);):);):):);)","timestamp_created":1611456163,"timestamp_updated":1611456163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85240359","author":{"steamid":"76561198206397119","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":665,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1611604541},"language":"english","review":"VERY GOOD GAME\n","timestamp_created":1611455682,"timestamp_updated":1611455682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85238641","author":{"steamid":"76561198271951438","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":610,"last_played":1658194812},"language":"english","review":"good jiggle physics","timestamp_created":1611453037,"timestamp_updated":1611453037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85238049","author":{"steamid":"76561198058537743","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":426,"last_played":1611452101},"language":"turkish","review":"Half life oynamadan ölmeyin","timestamp_created":1611452143,"timestamp_updated":1611452143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85237064","author":{"steamid":"76561199028843708","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":743,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":330,"last_played":1619487329},"language":"english","review":"Crobar","timestamp_created":1611450571,"timestamp_updated":1611450571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85236856","author":{"steamid":"76561198090714368","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":918,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":918,"last_played":1611450102},"language":"spanish","review":"¿Si lo recomiendo jugar?

Думаю, что писать об игре толку нет, ибо в нее играл явно каждый второй человек и знает о сюжете или краем глаза видел прохождения, но все же.\nСюжет.\nИграем мы за ученого Фримана, где в ходе эксперимента, ученые случайно вызвали каскадный резонанс, который вызывает межпространственный разлом с Зеном (пограничный мир, концовка первой части Халфы), откуда прутся монстры, убивающие мирных граждан. \nНапомню, что в первой части, Фриман отправляется в Зейн, где одолевает Нихиланта и его спасает G-man, помещаясь оба в стазис, позже пробуждаются лет через 20 (начало 2 части). \nНемного об таинственном G-man'e, который будет преследовать главного героя на протяжении всей игры, просто смотрите по сторонам чаще. Что в первой части, что во второй о нем информации особой нет, он вроде бы и за нас, а вроде бы и против, просто единственный наблюдатель, а если ты русский, то с тобой бог, короче говоря, G-man - бог.\nВо главе стоит Уоллес Брин, можно сказать, - правитель земли, которому в конце мы дадим жестких издюлей, а позже опять появится \"Бог\", где игра обрывается, не давая игроку даже представления о том, что было дальше.\nКоротко об игре.\nГлавный герой - Гордон Фриман.\nГлавный враг на пределах этой части - Уоллес Брин.\nОсновная задача - борьба с силами Альянса, дабы освободить человечество от его власти.\nВ игре есть огромный выбор оружия, который открывается по мере прохождения.\n13 глав и каждая глава по своему хороша. \nПрисутствуют ачивки, весьма несложно получить и не требуют особых усилий, но лучше получать их сразу, дабы потом не перепроходить миллиард раз в погоне за достижениями, как пришлось это делать мне.\nМного пасхалок, много всего интересного, в общем, игра балдежная,

Mossman到底是帮主角的还是叛徒，以及它在视频中所说的“基地”是什么，本章全篇都没有解释过。如果她知道了Eli Vance死了会怎么样，毕竟第一章最后站在了主角这边也是为了他）（gman在一开始不爽应该是因为本应该死的两人确被Vortigaunt救了，并且在一开始阻隔了gman的信号，但为什么又突然选择让Alyx继续活下去）（gman到底是在那边的，从Eli Vance所说他听到过两句一样的话，那就很有可能在黑山基地就是gman下达让别人说的，为什么要告诉他呢，如果他是想帮助主角为什么还要导致他死亡呢，但是召唤主角过来的本身原因也是为了抵抗联合军，如果像他所说是和别人达成了条件，那么是谁呢，还有个隐藏在背后控制一切的人吗）（至于最后提起的船，根据游戏所诉，可能是在一开始双方争夺研究资金，然后不顾危险出事了，非常有可能他们研究的是同一种技术，它是真的吗，它所研究的技术既然很危险，那也代表可能比黑山基地里的还要厉害，虽然最后安排了主角要摧毁掉，但Alyx明显感觉这就是线索，主角要怎么选择呢）（目前总体剧情就是gman和另外一个人在操作着一切，并且虽然计划出了点问题，但还是一直在正轨上，那么下章的决择就可能会影响真正的结局）（最后的结局并不像是gman指示的，因为gman说过要留下Alyx，但也有可能是话传到要杀人了）（Combine Advisor是本章第一次实体登场的角色，它是什么，为什么要这样做，而且结局最后也展示了不止有一个，它能被杀死吗，在如此强的念力下，章节初展示了Alyx被救活，Alyx是当时死了被救活了还是濒死被救活了，那么Eli Vance可以被救活吗，他是被吸食脑髓或大脑死亡的）（反抗军接下来会怎么做，Eli
