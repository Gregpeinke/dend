You get control of a diverse range of weapons and vehicles, facing countless different enemies, from zombies to trigger happy law enforcers. Set in a dystopian world, the game has huge variation in level design and crushing combine soldeirs with a huge metal crate lifted by a magnetised crane never gets old. One of the best things however, is the awesome physics engine this game has to offer. You can use your gravity gun to move objects around you, often rewarding you with the satisfaction of firing a metal disc to take a zombie's head off.

Usually you can see its age in the bumps in the character models. The blurriness of the texture when you get in really close. The clunkiness of the controls. This game has very little of that.\n\nSince its release, Half-Life 2 marked the beginning of a new era of PC games. Paired with Steam and the Source engine to back it up Valve through a huge wrench into the way games were published. As a gaming platform, up until now was PC the wild west. There was no need for this middle man. People were pissed that they had to install this jenky new game installer and it had to be connected to the internet to authenticate that you actually spent money on the game. No one would ever stand for that, would they? PC gaming was officially dead.\n\nBut now you had the long awaited sequel to one of the best PC games of all time. It had so much to live up to. And it did.  The Source Engine introduced the idea that a player could interact with all 3D objects. They could break things apart and pick up pieces of those things then throw them around. No one had pulled this off so seamlessly and it became a new standard for games going forward. \n\nThe fact that Valve had created a new kind of physics sandbox ment that so much of the games design was based around this principle. In the very beginning the game is walking the player through what everyday life is like in City 17. One of the Overwatch soldiers pushes a can onto the ground and demands you pick it up. If you throw it at the guy he beats you to death. Later you escape by placing a few boxes on top of each other and jumping out a window. This concepts scales throughout the game to the point where you eventually get a Gravity Gun that allows you to toss large objects around like cars, dumpsters and even the thousands of similarly dressed bad guys. \n\nAlso this game has incredible scale for the time it was created. Where the first Half Life took place in the same large complex filled with tiny rooms everywhere. This game has you travelling miles from location to location. \n\nGiven that fact it should hurt the graphical capabilities of the game. However, Sorce was built to be scaled in quality. Valve is constantly updating and improving it even now which just keeps the game looking fresh. Sure, the character models aren’t the best to today’s standards but the thing about source is it still looks almost picturesque standing still. \nLikes/Dislikes:\n\nPacing is this games middle name. At first the classic painfully long intro guides you along and immerses yourself in the world and the characters. You don’t even get your first weapon until at least half hour in. And then its just a fucking crowbar that you must beat someone to death with and steal their gun, like any respectable game would have you do. Each new area lets you play with a new concept. First you are pistoling down guys, then you get a sub-machine gun then you get grenades. Blah Blah Blah. All shooters do this. But HL2 does something different. Next you are driving around in a Boat and are ordered to drive miles back though a death trough to the very place that cause this global shit storm. Then just as you suspect you’d get an even better machine gun, you are handed a gravity gun and sent into a zombie infested ghost town. \n\nNow this is one of my favorite things about this game is suddenly its like you aren’t even playing a FPS anymore. It survival horror with ton of very sharp things around you and traps you get to set off. Using your guns is now very inefficient and really not worth the cost. Meanwhile a stark raving mad priest is guiding you through this section as if it were another game all on its own. Really it just lets you know that there is now a whole new alternative to just blasting away at every badguy.\n\nNow it’s not all good really. At some point the game decides you need back up and puts you in command of other like minded humans. Unfortunately they are just as dumb as the bugs you command earlier in the game. The will constantly get in your way when there are beams of death coming at you. Really your best bet is to send them down every unexplored hallway to disarm traps or pull aggro from anything that is ready to empty their clip into your face. \n\nAlso, really cool physics in their infancy have a price. So many times there are random junk objects in your way and you have to take the time to push them or simply lift it all out of your way. It can get daunting. \n\n\nClosing:\n\nI regard this game as my third favorite of all time. As far a a game concept goes its near perfect. However the characters are sort fall flat to me in an otherwise fucking awesome story. The universe that the game is set in is mostly unmatched only to have been out done with games like Fallout and Deus Ex. Its gruesome and in your face. The human struggle feels real, and heavy. Unrelentingly apocalyptic. It puts you through situations where you’re left thinking “Really, they expect me to do what?” and when you are done you feel like you are changed forever. \n","timestamp_created":1411872307,"timestamp_updated":1411872307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12269778","author":{"steamid":"76561198136782248","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":389,"last_played":1642611108},"language":"russian","review":"великолепная игра всегда хочется ещё и ещё проходить","timestamp_created":1411871377,"timestamp_updated":1411871377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53283393383026123","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12269466","author":{"steamid":"76561198046675266","num_games_owned":1490,"num_reviews":1015,"playtime_forever":501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1561776572},"language":"english","review":"[h1]The sequel to Half-Life (of course), and the very first Single Player Valve game I ever played, and let me tell you, it blew my mind.

I just hate HL2. Whenever i play it, it just makes me bored.\n\nI played it around 2010 for the first time, and just couldn't finish it. In 2013 i bought the whole HL pack from steam, and played the original HL1, and i just adored the game. I played each HL game back-to-back in 2013, and finishing HL2 (or ep 1) was just such a pain.\n\nI played HL2 again before making this review. This time on hardest difficulty, and it evoked the same emotions. \n\nI adore HL1, and this game just feels like a downgrade. They reduced the amount of enemy types you face to pretty much just one, which are basically just humans with guns (basically any other shooter). I guess i just played too much COD back in the day, and just got too bored of it all, hence my preference these days is towards a variety of enemies, each with different behaviours and fighting patterns.\n\nOn top of they pretty much force you to use like 2 guns throughout the whole game. It is either the SMG or the shotgun, and later on SMG stops dealing as much damage as it used to, and you are given the machine gun which basically functions the same. The revolver and the crossbow ammunition is just rarely given, and the gravity gun is pretty much useless, except when the developers want you to use it, and basically prepare a playground for you to use it in. \n\nThere are no special experimental weapons like in HL1. But here is the thing, even if they had them, I wouldn't really use them. The enemies in this game just die too easily, even compared to their \"human with guns\" equivalent in HL1. Using revolvers or crossbows against them just seems like a waste, considering how easily they die from SMGs. That wasn't the case in the original HL1. SMGs were not very accurate, but they had the fire rate. That said, you were bound to get hit, so weapons like revolvers/crossbows made sense to use, which were basically the opposite - slow firerate, high damage and accuracy, but low ammo, hence it is preferable not to miss. The experimental weapons were basically the same. They had the highest damage compared to everything else, but the ammo was even rarer, and it was so rewarding using it against those beefier enemies if you actually kept the ammo.\n\nFinally, the game is like 15 hours long. Gameplay just bores you to death, and some sections are just overextended, like car or boat chapters. On top of that, you have these annoying sections where you have to fight striders (machines from the war of the worlds), that take a billion rockets to take down, and the less annoying (but still annoying) helicopters. And, even though HL created narrative in FPS games, i don't like the story in any of the games. I don't even them a stories to be honest. My love for HL1 is purely for its gameplay.\n\nAlso, the story in half life 2 pretty much pulled a deus ex machina, meaning that they pretty much discard everything that happened in the last game, and start over. It's not a good characteristic in movies, and same goes for video games. \n\nEpisode 1 is pretty much the same, but maybe 3 hrs long.\n\nThat said, episode 2 is completely different from the other two. It takes a lot of things from HL1 basically. They add this 1 new enemy type (the hunter) that is just so good, from both artistic and design standpoint. I love the way it moves, and the sounds it makes. It is very mobile, dodges your shots sometimes, and charges or flanks you sometimes. It's beefy as well, and you know, all these high damage weapons have a purpose now. In fact, the machine gun has an alternative fire, that basically sends a ball and disintegrates the enemy. Very overpowered, but didn't have much use in the original HL2.\n\nI like a lot of things about ep 2 to be honest. Using the car was actually enjoyable. The aesthetic of ep 2 was different (was more colourful) and i just loved it, and the final battle was just epic. Imagine battle of hoth from stars wars, and you task is to take down all the AT-ATs (which are the striders in the game).Yep, they made fighting striders enjoyable too. If Valve ever makes another Half-Life, i hope they approach it, exactly how they did episode 2, or half-life 1.\n\nAnyway, it is good to finally let this off my chest. I have kept all of this in me, until i finally started meeting people that shared the same opinion. All this reminds me of the danish tale about the king's clothes. The king's tailor made him a costume that was invisible, while in fact, there was no costume, and he was naked; and none of the public would say a word in order not to feel unintelligent, for not seeing the \"costume\", so they all would pretend that they saw it.

Проснитесь и пойте!\". Именно так и начиналась легенда игра с которой я познакомился еще в компьютерном клубе, решил поиграть маленько на оставшееся время зацепило сильно. Первое, что мне нравилась всегда так это сюжет. Молчаливый Гордон Фримен,таинственный G-Man, охранник и должник Барни Калхун (он до сих пор должен Гордону пиво!) и малышка Аликс Венс! Ах да Илай Венс и Джуддит Моссман. Эти персонажи запомнились мне куда лучше тем персонажи других игр. Хоть игра и сделана в далеком 2004 году, но графика и по сей день прекрасна! Музыкальное сопровошдение в игре делает ее еще лучше и атмосферней! Так же есть множество любительских модов к HL 2. К сожалению мало модов про солдат Альянса...   И кстати ни кто не задумывался какой город послужил прототипом для City-17? И это действительно лучший город! Вообщем 10/10!
