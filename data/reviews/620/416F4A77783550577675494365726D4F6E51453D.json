One of the best computer games of all time, ever.  The sequel takes the original 3D puzzle mechanics of the original, and expands them, adds fantastic environments and atmosphere, suburb writing, and first class voice actors.  One of my top 5 favorite games ever in over 3 decades of gaming.  \n\nMy Mom liked it.  My niece liked it.  My friend who claims to hate video games liked it.  The teenage guy in my physics study group can't stop quoting lines from it years after it came out.  This is a great game for people who want to exercise their spatial reasoning skills.  It is also a forgiving game for a newbie who has never used WASD and mouse, or played FPS games.\n\nIf you have any interest in this game, buy it.  Also, it's often on sale.  \n\nWhen you've re-played it so many times it's boring, there are endless fan-made levels you can download, some of which are nearly as good as the real thing.","timestamp_created":1522806526,"timestamp_updated":1522806526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41259194","author":{"steamid":"76561198209800309","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":559,"last_played":1528829196},"language":"turkish","review":"Anlatılmaz yaşanır.","timestamp_created":1522798830,"timestamp_updated":1522798830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41258957","author":{"steamid":"76561198307748654","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":343,"last_played":1610300350},"language":"russian","review":"СЛОЖНА СЛОЖНА, НИЧЕГО НЕ ПОНЯТНО, СЛОЖНА!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1522797654,"timestamp_updated":1522797654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41258367","author":{"steamid":"76561198312629775","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":903,"last_played":1522793388},"language":"english","review":"epicly fun and mind bending game :) didnt play the co op until i played it. the humor made for luaghs while the puzzles mad e me have to think!","timestamp_created":1522794699,"timestamp_updated":1522794699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41258307","author":{"steamid":"76561198310366216","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1020,"last_played":1522950045},"language":"russian","review":"Шикарная игра .

Tested this with a mini tower from a few years ago with an Intel Pentium and integrated graphics and the game was playable. Mid-range computers will handle this game with no issues at all.\n-Excellent story. The gameplay mixes nicely with the story and makes sense. Not rushed at all.\n-Interesting and diverse characters despite there only being two major characters besides yourself.\n-Dry humor that isn't forced; the humor is integrated cleanly into the story.\n-Great replay value. Even if you somehow get sick of the main story, there's co-op and content from the Steam Workshop. Plenty of achievements too if you're interested in those.\n-Create your own test chambers.\n-The puzzles are unique and diverse. I never felt like I was replaying a previous puzzle.\n-Tons of easter eggs\n-Clean and simple UI\n\nNeutral:\n-This game will make you feel smart sometimes and stupid sometimes.\n-Some levels may induce extreme frustration, especially if it's your first puzzle game.\n-Graphics are acceptable, but still hold up well from a game released in 2011.\n-Some of the soundtrack is great, some of it can be annoying\n\nCons:\nNone\n\nThis game has been out for almost 7 years but is still worth playing.
