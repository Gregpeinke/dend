When I first began playing I had very mixed feelings about the game. The first half of the game had me feeling very isolated (especially the section of the game where you are mostly just driving along the coast) and made the story feel very slow to progress. Once I got to the second half of the game I was immediately hooked. The game is probably one the most polished games I've ever played. Everything works perfectly. \n   The story is very interesting. It always had wanting to know more. \n   The game also had a very nice atmosphere. The world has a similar feeling to that of Orwell's 1984. Very bleak and depressing, dystopian enviorment but also filled with an array of interesting characters.\n   I don't really have any complaints about the game and would honestly say it has one of the best stories I've ever heard. Now i finally understand why people want a Half Life 3 so badly.\n   \n   Ps. If anyone is playing this game for the first time, make sure to check out Half Life 2: Episode 1 and 2 as well.

lot can be said about Valve's Half-Life 2. In fact so much has been said that it feels redundant just talking about it. Yeah we all know the games amazing story, and the tight controls, and stunning graphics. I mean JESUS look at those graphics! But what really makes HL2 great, besides just the stuff mentioned? We know its the shining crown jewel of gaming, but do we really know why? The short of it is that the game is extremely solid on all fronts, something that truly can't be said about many games. Everything flows, in a way that AAA games still can't come close to, so much to an extent that I feel people sell Half-Life 2 short, even the people prasing it. Sure games today are made for a wider audience and they get that with shiny graphics and a more streamlined cinematic experience. The games are easier because they don't strive to highlight certain mechanics and instead focus on a wide apeal-story based narrative that can be experienced by everyone. But is that really the case? Truly think about it. HL2 doesn't need to pull you out of the world you have been experiencing in first person to show you a cutscene or have the \"tutorial guy\" , you never follow a map marker or preform a one button stealth takedown. Were made to think AAAs today are much better because theres more there, bigger maps, better graphics, and new toys all come with having as much cash that the companies making these games are willing to pump into them. We feel a sense of evolution that comes with the silver wraping under the christmas tree and are ready to easily consume more and more of the worlds were presented with because everything is made for that reason only. On the contrary Half-Life 2 did something more. The world is experienced by the player. The story is subtle and it only unwraps itself as you peel back the layers of the Half-Life world and see what Gordon Freeman, or you the player, has missed in the last 20 years. Half-life 2's story has a dark tone, with creative interiors and exteriors that never stray from the world being presented to you, refusing to abandon the lore of the world or dampen the experience all while flowing perfectly with gameplay and mechanics. The basics of Half-Life were run and shoot. And they sure as hell kept true to that in HL which is why the game is still so critically acclaimed. And HL2 does this but even better. Its a game truly worth of a sequel, being able to take what the predecessor had done and improving on every way while making each aspect better. The world you run and shoot in is the same world you live in. What AAA games take the time to truly accomplish the blending of the main concept of their game with every other aspect or even use it as one of their misguided selling points? The game Half-Life 2 truly speaks for itself in many ways. Once you have heard one person say it you have probably heard it all. And while we might not have listened well enough for this message to rub off on other games, the effects of HL2 will be felt by those who truly look for a reason to love it.","timestamp_created":1460271263,"timestamp_updated":1460340150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.717626988887786865","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22332706","author":{"steamid":"76561198172438263","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":123,"playtime_forever":1141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1613344191},"language":"english","review":"year A.D 3000 \n-Philip J.

I've beaten the game several times. It is one of my personal favorites. Now its sequels (Half Life 2, EP.1 and EP.2) are included among my favorite titles.\nI really liked the episodes as well. They were too short though. The creators announced that in fact the three episodes (With the third one not released at this point) are just one long game. Of course that brings many negative aspects. For instance if you want to play all three of them, you may want to install them simultaneously, resulting in some big portion of your memory being occupied. But there will be plenty of time to talk about these games. Let's focus on this title for now.\nThis sequel had a lot of work. It had to surpass the original game. Half Life was a unique game. It has an amazing story, great characters, and was really entertaining. It also had a certain kind of \"magic\". It became a classic almost instantly. Its second installment kept a lot of the great details that made the original so good and improved them with other features that helped to create an immersing gaming experience. Half Life 2 is as good as the original.\nThe old characters returned, but with better skins. Some new and interesting characters are introduced. There new and cool enemies (Whose A.I. is good). The graphic detail is incredible. The water effect is by far the best I've ever seen in a game. They took a lot of time polishing this features and it shows. The only negative thing I can say is that this title is shorter than the original.\nThe plot is great also. It is almost too linear though. We now follow the adventure several years after the events of the first game. The population is being enslaved and is our duty to help them before annihilation. To make the game even more appealing, the creators added the spectacular gravity gun, which is an extraordinary weapon (Well, not a weapon per se). It has the power to lift heavy objects and neutralize their weight. This weapon is almost as important as the characters. We wouldn't be able to solve some of the most interesting physics puzzles without it, and is extremely fun to use. And I almost forgot, the physics are great.\nIt was extremely difficult to reach the first Half Life game in terms of quality, but I think that this game pulled it off. It has that certain \"magic\" also. And is highly enjoyable. I recommend this title. It might not disappoint anyone.","timestamp_created":1460100537,"timestamp_updated":1460100537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537216842174530029","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22295079","author":{"steamid":"76561197983122815","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1533242420},"language":"english","review":"love it","timestamp_created":1460088336,"timestamp_updated":1639627620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456754118204116821","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22294187","author":{"steamid":"76561198028733730","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1027,"last_played":1578871962},"language":"english","review":"A great game that you play like watching a movie.

протагониста посадили на лодку.Потом его посылают в зомбированный Рейвенхольм,чтобы продемонстрировать хоррор игроку.Не страшно,но интересно.Затем садят в машину.А примерно тогда,когда Фриман вылез из машины и начал атаковать Нова Проспект,игра окончательно наскучила.Подземелия,бег-стрельба,может,нектороые головоломки и так до конца.Хоть управлять транспортом и было интересно,мне бы хотелось наматывать киллометры,а не убирать препятствия на каждом киллометре.Я играл в эту игру для того,чтобы узнать хронологию вселенной HL.Мне было интереснее стрелять по бойцам ХЕКУ,прибывшим для уничтожения всех причастных к проекту,чем по силовикам тоталитаризма.Мне было интереснее видеть,как Фриман в гордом одиночестве пытается выбраться,иногда встречаясь с безымянными учёными и охранниками,чем видеть дружескую атмосферу,при которой протагонист немало времени находится в одиночестве.Однако,эпизоды мне почему-то целиком и полностью понравились.Выражусь обьективо:игрок один,больше половины игры разворачиваются под землёй,присутствуют головоломки,которые порой решаются только после просмотра прохождения на YouTube,раздел физики \"механика\" неплохо продемонстрирован,похоже,это и было фишкой игры в 2004,графон...Чёрт возьми,даже 11 лет спустя неплохо выглядит.Лично мне было скучно.Даже если вы фан серии или просто хотите узнать хронологию,как я,то я советую вам приобретать эту игру не отдельно,а в комплекте с каким-нибудь сборником.У меня вот был диск The orange box,а потом я ещё и Valve complete pack скачал.","timestamp_created":1459929647,"timestamp_updated":1459929647,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22264947","author":{"steamid":"76561198280444863","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1250,"last_played":1612128653},"language":"english","review":"Game is fun 100% of the time, valve knows what makes a game good.","timestamp_created":1459926922,"timestamp_updated":1459926922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22262929","author":{"steamid":"76561198142672091","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":2095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1653855426},"language":"english","review":"mlg still waiting for hl3 seriously  valve pls fix","timestamp_created":1459912016,"timestamp_updated":1459912016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528487205505371094","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22262435","author":{"steamid":"76561198057864808","num_games_owned":490,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3058,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1587783772},"language":"english","review":"One of the greatest shooters and all around games of all time, Half Life 2 manages to blend an amazing stroyline with fun gameplay and beautiful graphics-- even 12 years later.

ее.\nшедевр как никак гениальная и игра ну так все говорят а по мне среднячек проходной. игра просто скучнейшая заставка в начале прикольная и обещает много интересного но когда уже дают тебе лодку а потом багги это превращаеться в такое скучное гавнище просто описать словами трудно на сколько это скучно. а потом эти унылые перестрелки раз за разом такие скучнейшие. сюжет вообще не интригует после того как вы сбегаете из сити17 часа на 2 вообще никак не подают. потом в нова проспект немного что то там разшевелилось и подконец чутка а в основном куча унылейшых перестрелок с армией врагов котоырые практически не дамажат вас никак. все случаи смерти были либо от турелей и прочего стационарного дерьма либо от того что я прыгнул куда то не туда. врагам вообще похуй что вы в них стреляете  как будто они стена а не живые люди. временами радовал дизайн всяких железных стен которые в последствии были перенесены в игру dishonored. эта часть дизайна удачна и приятно любоватся в перерывах между убогими перестрелками. кстати о дизайне некоторые уровни такие гумозные ну стреляете вы кучу врагов минут 10 а потом просто забываете от куда пришли и непонятно куда идти. потом еще минут 10 ищите нужную дырку.\nпрошел игру до конца лишь только по тому что практически  везде на игровых сайтах всяких новостях и прочим этот хайлфлайф много раз упоминался а комменты были о игра века шедевр гениально и куча нытья габееен выпусти 3халфу ну плиз и куча дебильных шуток на 1 апреля с анонсами этой игры. а по мне дрисня дрисней и после того как я сам прошел эту игру я полностью в этом убедился. никогда не ждал 3ую халф и не буду даже не поиграю в нее если она когда нибудь выйдет. возмоно даже сам гейб понял что игра гавно и не спешит выпускать продолжение ну по крайней мере это единственная причина почему он еще не выпустил его хотя это странно. гавно типо последнего года штопают каждый код как и асасинов всяких и чем хуже игра тем она чаще выходит. странно что валвы не

I loved the orginal Half-ife back in the day, and the sequel is awesome.  I feel like they really did a good job capturing the essence of the original, but improving the graphics and interface to match the newer games.  My only complaint is that for some reason, Valve never bothered to finish the story.  AFter you finsih Half-Life 2, there is an episode 1 and 2, and at the end of episode 2, there is a massive cliffhanger that never gets resolved because Valve never complete episode 3.  Great game, but if you need closure in your life, i wouldnt bother to download the dlc content, you will be dissapointed.","timestamp_created":1459812568,"timestamp_updated":1459812568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22242879","author":{"steamid":"76561198169185965","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":308,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1476481093},"language":"brazilian","review":"e melhor que minecraft","timestamp_created":1459804277,"timestamp_updated":1459804277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22242467","author":{"steamid":"76561198172866401","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1547500335},"language":"english","review":"Still looks good today.","timestamp_created":1459802357,"timestamp_updated":1459802357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22242275","author":{"steamid":"76561198201119565","num_games_owned":401,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1595157497},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever made.\n","timestamp_created":1459801585,"timestamp_updated":1459801585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22241554","author":{"steamid":"76561198054248854","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125,"last_played":1445973523},"language":"english","review":"Wont say nothing, you already know","timestamp_created":1459798659,"timestamp_updated":1459798659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22235463","author":{"steamid":"76561198203136906","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1460727558},"language":"english","review":"The game itself provides a singleplayer experience like few others.It is in perfect ballance with all its aspects.But as in all games there is a bad side the one here is that the game is WAY,WAY too over rated.I am not saying the game is bad it is a amazing game beyond a doubt.But the attention it gets is just way too much i can name a few games that could have the attention this game has and be totaly deserved for example: Star Wars KOTOR 1,KOTOR 2,Dishonored... and i know you will put the argument that its a totaly different type of game than half life and that the relese dates don't match but look the games i have listed have provided an singleplayer experience better than half life in my opinion.KOTOR is a game that not many people know about but is still an amazing game.So please stop feeding this game so much atention and love just spread that all out on other games cus every video game is a work of art in its respective field and way.This is only my OPINION. 9/10","timestamp_created":1459773735,"timestamp_updated":1459773735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22234498","author":{"steamid":"76561198148596769","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":26,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24,"last_played":1596230929},"language":"spanish","review":"Tiene algo que los demas no tienen...
