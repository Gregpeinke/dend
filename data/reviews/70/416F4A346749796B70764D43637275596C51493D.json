This isn't really fair though as this was of course back in 1998.\n-The Movement is pretty janky, You feel pretty slippery and often times you'll accidentally fall of platforms from said slippery movement.\n-The weapons are alright, They certainly do a some decent amount of damage.\n-The gameplay is wonderful, I had a lot of fun playing this game. It could kill a decent amount of hours.\n-The story is pretty alright. It's not too complicated and very simple.\n-The music is incredible, I really really love the music. It fits the game nicely, and is really enjoyable.\n\nOverall, If you have a few buck to spare. I'd recommend you buy this game.

Не буду врать, для современного игрока эта игра может не подойти из-за графики, моделек и истории, которая очень проста, но по своему привлекательна.\nЕсли объяснять на пальцах, то замес такой:\nОчкарик по имени Гордон Фримен приезжает в блек мезу, чтобы запихнуть кристалл из потустороннего измерения в большую х**вину под названием Антимасс-Спектрометер. Естественно, запихнув кристалл все взрывается, пердит и кряхтит и в итоге происходит каскадный резонанс и существа из другого мира начали атаковать Исследовательскую корпорацию. И начинается п*здец. Сначала все красиво и весело дохнут напоказ, а потом нам выдают оружие, чтобы мы присоединились.\nГоворя о достоинствах игры, можно выделить подачу самой истории, дизайн локаций (до сих пор помню всю черную мезу во всех деталях), интересный геймплей и атмосферу, которая она смогла подарить большому количеству игроков по всему миру. В то время она смогла взять много наград за графику, повествование, и инновационный мир игры.

A história começa de uma forma bem interessante gerando curiosidade e criando um cenário caótico de invasão alienígena.\n O game apresenta momentos de combate, plataforma e puzzle:\n\nCombate: É bem simples e fácil de dominar, resumindo-se a atirar, o que torna o combate um pouco repetitivo mas é reciclado de acordo com as diferentes armas.\n\nPlataforma: A física é impressionante para a época, dominar a mecânica de movimento do jogo é essencial para os níveis que utilizam de parkour para desafiar o jogador.\n\nPuzzle: Definitivamente esse é o melhor ponto do game. Half-Life apresenta desafios mentais bem interessantes que utilizam do combate e momentos de plataforma para dificultar ainda mais os puzzles do jogo.\n\nPortanto eu recomendo muito Half-Life, é um clássico dos vídeogames e deve ser jogado pelo maior número de pessoas.\n\nObs: O jogo apresenta alguns bugs durante a jogatina que poderiam ter sido resolvidos depois de tanto tempo. Quebra um pouco a imersão mas não estraga a experiência.\n\nObrigado por

раз я прошел Half-Life через 22 года после её выхода, однако это не помешало мне получить хорошие впечатления от процесса игры, от продвижения по сюжету и от массы мелочей, которые делают это произведение искусства уникальным. Никогда не гнался за реалистичной графикой, меня устраивает схематичность и красота этой игры. В Half-Life, всё на своём месте, она не требует доработки.\nИгру прошел сам, без прохождений, и поэтому создалось впечатление, что некоторые уровни разветвленные, то есть к следующему этапу можно прийти несколькими путями. Хотя позже я выяснил, что сюжет линейный. Наверное чувство выбора в игре создается благодаря развернутым полям боя, загадочному сюжету, большому количеству тайников и нестандартным решениям, которые игра заставляет пробовать.\nТем, кто ещё не играл советую:\n1. Не пользуйтесь прохождениями и подсказками, это погубит возможность попробовать все варианты и самому найти правильный путь.\n2.
