There is a handful of enemy types each with their own little gimmick which as you play learn to deal with depending on the class you are playing. The game offers great support for custom mods and using them and generally all maps are whitelisted allowing you to level up even when playing on unofficial stages. This game is highly recommended if you have friends since it can be a blast working together as a team and completing challanges you are willing to face. Even if you don't have many people to play with the community is large and elaborate and boasts over thousands of free working servers for you and other random people to join whenever you feel like. One of the nicer things about this game is the constant support and updates from the team at Tripwire releasing new content and holiday events switching up the look and adding more new things to do to keep you playing. With all that said this is easilly my favorite Steam multiplayer game so I say it's 100% worth a buy. I hope support for this game continues even with the release of Killing Floor 2 down the road.","timestamp_created":1401045533,"timestamp_updated":1401045533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10233809","author":{"steamid":"76561197992492436","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1766,"last_played":1535605478},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego, buen rendimiento y buen gameplay, pero lamentablemente después de jugarlo durante un rato se torna monótono y suele aburrir.","timestamp_created":1401045434,"timestamp_updated":1401045434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10233721","author":{"steamid":"76561198080243184","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3678,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2703,"last_played":1585277052},"language":"english","review":"Dis game is de bumb\n","timestamp_created":1401044939,"timestamp_updated":1401044939,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10233672","author":{"steamid":"76561198077973328","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":14901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1630,"last_played":1557962563},"language":"spanish","review":"Un buen Juego momentos en camara lenta y muchisimos mounstros y misiones Best game ever 10/10","timestamp_created":1401044767,"timestamp_updated":1401044767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10233670","author":{"steamid":"76561198081352776","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3018,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1199,"last_played":1444437685},"language":"english","review":"kill it with fiiirrre","timestamp_created":1401044750,"timestamp_updated":1401044750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10233662","author":{"steamid":"76561198031621868","num_games_owned":325,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1425,"last_played":1428750992},"language":"russian","review":"Заебатая хуерга, но только с френдами гамать надо.","timestamp_created":1401044686,"timestamp_updated":1401044686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10233508","author":{"steamid":"76561198079523281","num_games_owned":270,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1545759060},"language":"english","review":"Killed my floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n10/10 10/10 10/10 Best game ever","timestamp_created":1401043813,"timestamp_updated":1401043813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10233440","author":{"steamid":"76561198041677385","num_games_owned":522,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8057,"last_played":1619104732},"language":"italian","review":"è così divertente che ci gioco da anni","timestamp_created":1401043402,"timestamp_updated":1401043402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10233433","author":{"steamid":"76561198085168502","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":29522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20515,"last_played":1656240635},"language":"romanian","review":"Want to see the true experience of playing a real Killing Floor ?

I waste all the ammo for it, thinking it's a beautiful gun, when all of a sudden I find out that I have to pay 3000 to refill it's ammo stock. \n\nOn to the graphics. For god sakes. Why on earth did the head designer of this game feel the need to crap a bunch of tesselated gibs onto a wireframe body and let them fly off when a monster gets shot in the head. for FUCK SAKES, YOU PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT TRIPWIRE.

First let me say that Killing Floor is a well made game and is fun to play. With the focus being on multiplayer co-op this first-person shooter will send wave after wave of specimens(zombies basically) at you until the final round where you will face off against a boss(the only one), the patriarch. Before you spawn in the round you must choose one of the seven classes avaliable to you. If you enter the game in the middle of a wave you must wait until the end of the round, which is understandable. People wouldn't want to join in the middle of at least one hundred specimens with only a pistol to aid you. Between each wave there will be a small amount of time to rest and buy new guns with money earned by killing zeds and for surviving a round, the prices of each gun will vary from class to class. As far as graphics go the game holds up well considering it's age, although there will be a few occasions where you will see a zed poke it's head or arm through a solid door or wall. Sound quality is good however there is a small amount of music played during the waves. At the moment of typing this I cannot think of a few flaws for the game. If I think of any I will revise the review. \n\nIn total would I recommend this game? Yes I would.","timestamp_created":1400615393,"timestamp_updated":1400615393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10179963","author":{"steamid":"76561198129865175","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":112,"last_played":1413707150},"language":"english","review":"very cool game","timestamp_created":1400604444,"timestamp_updated":1400604444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10179933","author":{"steamid":"76561197969724342","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5224,"last_played":1457938441},"language":"english","review":"GET IT THATS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW GET IT \n","timestamp_created":1400604186,"timestamp_updated":1400604186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10179790","author":{"steamid":"76561198068342446","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":4026,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3117,"last_played":1538329229},"language":"german","review":"Killing Floor ist nicht nur irgendein Zombie shooter es ist meienr meinung nach der Beste den es gibt.\nEs überbietet in sachen Gameplay einfach alle anderen spiele gut story und inszenierung hat man schonmal besser gesehen z.B. l4d.\nAllerdings macht das spiel einen riesen Spaß und bietet durch das hochleveln der Perks meiner meinung nach wehsentlich mehr Langzeitmotivation als l4d (einfach mal so zum vergleich).\nGrafisch ist das Spiel dank unreal 2 engine (wenn ich mich nicht schwer irre) zwar keine Meisterleistung sieht aber ganz nett aus und läuft auch auf schwächeren Pcs.\nNur die DLCs sind etwas störend wobei niemand gezwungen ist diese zu kaufen es gibt auch Waffen DLCs allerdings sind diese dann nur optisch verändert oder bieten eine Zwischenstufe es gibt also nicht die Möglichkeit sich einen unfairen Vorteil durch DLC's zu beschaffen.\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad ist ziemlich gut zwar kann man auf normal schon alles umholzen wenn man dann aber nicht aufpasst und eingekreist wird wars das dann schnell mit einem.\nDer Endboss der einzige Boss im spiel der sogenannte \"Patriarch\" ist ein wenig stark und man muss aufpassen da er einen sonst mit 2-3 treffern umhaut er ist meienr Meinung nach etwas stark aber besiegbar.\nFür die die sich an der Zensierung stören (wie ich) es gibt eine einfache Methode dafür das man im Spiel genau so viel blut und leichenteile umher fliegen hat wie alle anderen Länder auch dafür muss man nur etwas in einer Textdatei ändern und das Spiel auf englisch stellen was auch gut ist da die Deutsche synchro schon fast an Körper verletzung grenzt...","timestamp_created":1400603034,"timestamp_updated":1400603034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10177198","author":{"steamid":"76561198063647696","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1781,"last_played":1526156747},"language":"russian","review":"ира очень веселая в ней можно убить время","timestamp_created":1400580650,"timestamp_updated":1400580650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507692337036132813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10176693","author":{"steamid":"76561197991722476","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":423,"last_played":1330502400},"language":"french","review":"Le jeu est sympa aux premiers abord, une fois qu'on à compris que c'est toujours pareil ça deviens lassant et on le désinstalle assez vite. \nC'est sûr les armes sont sympa, buter du zombie c'est sympa, mais pitié, les voix Française -_-\nAucun scénario à part tuer tout les zombies vague par vagues jusqu'à tous mourir donc au final très peu d'intérêt sur le long terme.
