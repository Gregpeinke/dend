They took away many things I liked in the first 2 games(open environments, being able to carry more than 2 guns), but kept mechanics that don't make any sense considering what they removed(upgradeable weapons for example). The vigors ,aka plasmids, also aren't integrated into the world as well as in the original.

It holds a special place in my heart for that reason. I decided to replay it while I still had free time during this quarantined summer, and as much as I want to keep my nostalgia glass locked on tight for this game, I just can't. \nI think this is a great fps. The story is fun and twisty and the gameplay is a blast. It's a satisfying play for sure. But the issue lies with the \"both sides are bad\" theme that weasels its way into the story. It's a product of the 2000s/early 2010s no doubt, and as someone who was looking to experience the game that made me fall in love with \"big boy games\" again, it leaves a slightly bittersweet taste now. \nMaybe that is what people like to call \"taking video games too seriously,\" but it's a real pitfall to a lot of players today, ya know? In my heart Bioshock Infinite is still a great game, but maybe we can rethink our nostalgia glasses for its story as it continues to age.","timestamp_created":1594454085,"timestamp_updated":1594454085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72483939","author":{"steamid":"76561199069794961","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":972,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":186,"last_played":1621613884},"language":"english","review":"gg","timestamp_created":1594451912,"timestamp_updated":1594451912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72482756","author":{"steamid":"76561198798721858","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":687,"last_played":1594468980},"language":"schinese","review":"如果下载完点开时后显示下载证书之类的，连接手机热点就能解决\n","timestamp_created":1594449982,"timestamp_updated":1594449982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72482228","author":{"steamid":"76561199050380892","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":561,"last_played":1594188723},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情有点烧脑 但是很棒的游戏","timestamp_created":1594449142,"timestamp_updated":1594449142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72479851","author":{"steamid":"76561198404693226","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":951,"last_played":1627833446},"language":"english","review":"其实已经玩过很多次了，怎么都不腻","timestamp_created":1594445254,"timestamp_updated":1594445254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72479688","author":{"steamid":"76561198099659593","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1594400573},"language":"schinese","review":"很棒","timestamp_created":1594444981,"timestamp_updated":1594444981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72479525","author":{"steamid":"76561198319022215","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":856,"last_played":1594415595},"language":"schinese","review":"求求了，把伊丽莎白小可爱送去巴黎吧","timestamp_created":1594444759,"timestamp_updated":1594444759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72478588","author":{"steamid":"76561198253592430","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":448,"last_played":1596167318},"language":"english","review":"10/10 Best story I've ever played","timestamp_created":1594443326,"timestamp_updated":1594443326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559471368789672852","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72478113","author":{"steamid":"76561198300416594","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":617,"last_played":1596844052},"language":"english","review":"The gameplay mechanics and level design allow for a lot of versatility in how you approach each room, and the story keeps you intrigued the whole way through.","timestamp_created":1594442612,"timestamp_updated":1594442612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72477870","author":{"steamid":"76561198956821659","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1122,"last_played":1623202228},"language":"spanish","review":"Muuuy recomendado!

It has some truly incredible moments, but also has many core flaws. The highs are extremely high but the lows are quite low. The game's aesthetic is absolutely gorgeous, still standing out as one of the best videogame aesthetics to date. The colors are vibrant, and the environment is unique and immersive. The narrative is easily one of the best narratives in gaming. The primary character, Elizabeth is used brilliantly and truly shows the strength that good use of ludonarrative can have. The plot is consistently interesting, maintaining frequent twists and intrigue. However, the gameplay is extremely mediocre. The shooting of the guns is standard, nothing bad, nothing good. However, the real draw of the combat is the vigors. They seem to provide the immersive sim freedom and variety on paper, but almost all of them end up feeling the same, either being some sort of damage or stun power. The game has guns carry limited ammo, intending you to drop and pick up guns depending on the situation. However, this becomes problematic late game. The game has an upgrade system for guns, which seems fine on paper, and it works early game. However, as the difficulty increases later in the game non-upgraded guns become near useless. Limited money and expensive purchases result in you only being able to upgrade a few guns. This, combined with frequently running out of ammo, results in a system where your good guns run out of ammo and you are forced to use weak guns at worst or are forced to ignore the gun switching mechanic, leading to an even more mediocre and dry gameplay experience, to the point where you become sick of the gameplay after only 10 hours. There's a lot to love in Bioshock Infinite, but that content is often muddled by chunks of mediocrity.  You could love it, or you could find it unenjoyable.","timestamp_created":1594430119,"timestamp_updated":1594430119,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496774196624755859","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72469513","author":{"steamid":"76561198285767306","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":560,"last_played":1594429712},"language":"english","review":"I'm really glad I bought this game!!","timestamp_created":1594429783,"timestamp_updated":1594429783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52191239595413208","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72466599","author":{"steamid":"76561198158059156","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":818,"last_played":1641387889},"language":"turkish","review":"oynamayan da ne bilim","timestamp_created":1594425128,"timestamp_updated":1594425128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72466009","author":{"steamid":"76561198145754715","num_games_owned":359,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":607,"last_played":1614701935},"language":"english","review":"Yes, this game is one of the best games I've played and engaged my interest more than the other entries in the Bioshock series.

Считаю BioShock Infinite великолепной историей, но средним шутером, с которым он пытается ассоциироваться. Концовка и все что к ней вело - поразило мои очи. После этого несколько дней обдумывал всё в игре и ещё больше проникся ею.\nКоротенько: Букер ДеВитт - рабочий наёмник, который, чтобы откупиться от долгов решается отправиться в Город в Небе - Колумбию, чтобы доставить Заказчику некую девушку по имени - Элизабет. Вот и всё, дальше не буду спойлерить. Скажу только то, что сложность игры не особо влият на что-то и выборы тоже ничего не решают, в отличии от других частей.\n\nО DLC: (Про арену распинаться не буду т.к. все, кто хоть раз играли в игры от 2K знают, что арены они делают хоть-куда.)\n\nМорская могила. Эпизод 1.\nВот уж чего не ожидал, то это Восторга от эпизода (во всех смыслах). Это маленькая подводка, продолжающая историю основной игры, которая рассказывает, что у Элизабет не всё закончилось хорошо. По поводу Салли ничего не скажу т.к. BioShok 1 и 2 не прошел еще.\n\nМорская могила. Эпизод 2.\nЭто дополнение заставило меня попотеть. Проходить через орды мутантов по стелсу из-за того, что Лизка не хочет и не умеет нормально убивать - крайне муторно. Сколько смертей я перенёс. Дополнение из часового (коим и являлось первое DLC) стало максимально долгим и тянется почти как основная сюжетка (если Вы - рак, как и Я). Оно впринципе и понятно. Причина такого растягивания является простой - [spoiler] привыкнуть к более взрослой Элизабет до её смерти [/spoiler] После титров, (а сцену Я очень ожидал) Я понял, что по-моей щеке течёт слеза которая понимает - Элизабет больше нет! \n\nЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ.\n\nПосле полного прохождения всех сюжеток этой игры Я понял. Это не история Букера ДеВитта, далеко не так. Эта игра явлалась именно историей (нашей) Элизабет. Нам показали всю её жизнь от начала и до конца. [spoiler] Нам показали её похищение Комстоком/Букером, становление в стенах Башни под охраной Соловья, первое убийство, первые полноценные правильные для развития персонажа действия, её полноценное изменение в характере после смерти отца, её предательство и понимание того, что она сделала неправильный выбор, принятие того, что Двери скрывают за собой не только правильные действия, но и крайне спорные, и как итог - смерть настоящей и неповторимой Элизабет ДеВитт/Комсток.
