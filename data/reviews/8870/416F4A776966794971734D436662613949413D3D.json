My brother bought it during the Autumn Sale, and after playing through it on his account I bought a copy of my own during the Winter Sale (and I don't usually Buy Things - it's that good).  I haven't played the first two games yet, but that wasn't a problem - each game has a different story and new characters.\n\nBioShock Infinite probably gets classified as a shooter most of the time, but don't expect it to be one, because that's not what it's about.  It's about the characters, the setting, and the story, and these things are beautiful.  If you're addicted to well-executed period films, you'll get the same buzz from this richly detailed universe.  The world of Columbia is filled with subtle touches which are every bit as amazing as the big things, so you'll get a lot out of the game if you sit back and take some time to explore each environment.  Go into the extra rooms.  Listen to all the voxophones.  There are lots of little stories to learn about if you keep your eyes and ears open.\n\nUnless you're of a particularly sensitive disposition, don't be put off by the fact that the game has been called 'needlessly' and 'ridiculously' violent by various reviews.  There's some splashing blood, yes, and a bit of mutilation and decapitation occasionally, but once you're using a gun instead of your melee weapon you can stay further from the spray if you prefer.  That being said, there will be times when you will [i]want[/i] to melee people.  I don't often get emotionally involved in things, but this game has ensnared my mind and my soul, and my fighting style tends to change depending on the situation in which I find myself.\n\nSo if you love stories, or history, or music, or beautiful things, play BioShock Infinite - no, better yet: [i]live[/i] it - and, for Heaven's sake, SIT THROUGH THE CREDITS.","timestamp_created":1388700715,"timestamp_updated":1388700913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8521232","author":{"steamid":"76561197987948529","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1389118422},"language":"english","review":"Good Game","timestamp_created":1388700043,"timestamp_updated":1388700043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8520958","author":{"steamid":"76561198068106244","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1422777522},"language":"english","review":"its soo good. never really like the bioschock series but this one is a must have.","timestamp_created":1388699370,"timestamp_updated":1388699370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8520859","author":{"steamid":"76561198048016010","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":336,"last_played":1446428024},"language":"brazilian","review":"A história é muito boa, e a jogabilidade também.","timestamp_created":1388699156,"timestamp_updated":1388699156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8520660","author":{"steamid":"76561197984284997","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":169,"last_played":1585859559},"language":"german","review":"Klasse Spiel!

Graphics are unbelievable and you can really see the emotion on Elizabeths face as she goes thru all the turmoil of being a caged prisoner to roaming the streets of Columbia and seeing the world for what it is. The story telling is incredible, with a lot of twists and things to make you scratch your head. The story comes to a beautiful and mind blowing close in only the way Ken Levine can create. I cannot recommend this game enough for anyone who wants to enjoy some FPS action with some great story telling, and really, really fun skyhook battles. 10/10 and my Game of the Year choice for 2013.","timestamp_created":1388695754,"timestamp_updated":1395338167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536784708499908447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8519181","author":{"steamid":"76561198020737637","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1409307043},"language":"hungarian","review":"Egyik legjobb játék","timestamp_created":1388695620,"timestamp_updated":1388695620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8519082","author":{"steamid":"76561198027173884","num_games_owned":624,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":31,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26,"last_played":1388678835},"language":"german","review":"Top Spiel kann ich nur jedem Empfehlen.....","timestamp_created":1388695398,"timestamp_updated":1388695398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8519055","author":{"steamid":"76561197970366139","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1390759240},"language":"english","review":"What a crazy game, not played anything quite like this :-)","timestamp_created":1388695329,"timestamp_updated":1388695329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8519014","author":{"steamid":"76561198041892314","num_games_owned":528,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":800,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1388618586},"language":"english","review":"went to the shantytown and stole from poor people\n10/10 would steal again","timestamp_created":1388695266,"timestamp_updated":1388695266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8518855","author":{"steamid":"76561198012263802","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":3371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":847,"last_played":1494901689},"language":"english","review":"awesome game","timestamp_created":1388694924,"timestamp_updated":1388694924,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8518718","author":{"steamid":"76561198065486575","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1384,"last_played":1497641326},"language":"german","review":"Das beste Spiel des Jahres 2013!","timestamp_created":1388694651,"timestamp_updated":1388694651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8518507","author":{"steamid":"76561198055524695","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1419261742},"language":"english","review":"THis game is far by the best game of the year!!!","timestamp_created":1388694200,"timestamp_updated":1388694200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8518460","author":{"steamid":"76561197971767116","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1576,"last_played":1389033661},"language":"english","review":"A year later I can't say I ever really enjoyed this that much.
