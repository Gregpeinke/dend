평가글을 쓸 때마다 가독성이 떨어지는거 같아서 요새는 웬만하면 짧게짧게 가려고 하는 편인데, 3회차 달리면서도 여전히 차오르는 이 갓겜뽕을 차마 어떻게 할 수가 없어서 결국 평가창을 열고 말았습니다.\n\n\n\n제게는 소위 말하는 '갓겜'을 구분하는 지극히 주관적인 기준이 몇가지 있습니다.\n\n\n\n1. 시스템적으로 기존에 없던 혁신적이고 색다른 기능을 선보여 플레이에 활력을 불어넣음\n(주로 톡톡 튀는 아이디어를 무기로 하는 인디 게임판에서 자주 나옵니다.)\n\n2. 생동감 있고 역동적이며 다양하게 상호작용 할 수 있는, 살아있는 인게임 세계를 구현함\n(오픈 월드 장르에서 나오곤 합니다.[strike]윾비소프트가 잘 못하는겁니다.[/strike])\n\n3. 쩔어주게 환상적이고 독창적이며 몰입되는 세계관을 무대로 환상적인 이야기에 빠져들게 함\n(선형적인 스토리 구조를 가진 게임에서 주로 나옵니다. 물론 드물게 오픈 월드 장르에서 나오기도 합니다.)\n\n4. 연출과 디테일, 비주얼과 음향 같은 액면적인 부분에서 높은 퀄리티를 보여줌\n(혹자는 그런 부분에만 힘줄거면 차라리 영화를 만들라고 하기도 하는데, 저는 그 영화 같은 연출 속에서 플레이어가 주연이 될 경험을 만들어줄 수 있는 것이 게임이라는 매체가 가진 장점이라고 봅니다.)\n\n\n\n이외에도 자잘한 평가 요소들이 있지만 크게 분류하면 이 정도가 되겠습니다.\n\n바숔은 이 중에서도 3번 조건에 있어 압도적으로 두각을 드러내는 편입니다. 4번 조건도 어느 정도 게임성을 받쳐주고 있구요.\n\n1편과 2편에서 해저 도시 랩쳐를 배경으로 쌓아올린 바이오쇼크 세계관만의 특별한 테이스트는 3편, 인피니트에서 공중 도시 콜럼비아를 무대로 삼아 다시 한번 플레이어들을 사로잡습니다. \n\n랩쳐와 콜럼비아, 두 도시 모두 실패한 사상과 체제가 만들어낸, 속에서부터 곪아 터진 막장 도시라는 공통점이 있습니다. 랩쳐는 유토피아를 꿈꾸며 만들어졌지만 몰락했고 콜럼비아는 애초에 막장으로 만들어졌다는 차이 정도는 있지만요.\n\n그래서인지 겉으로 보이는 색감이나 화려함에 있어서는 랩쳐와 극도로 대비된다고 느껴질 정도로 화사하고 밝은 느낌의 콜럼비아임에도 불구하고 바이오쇼크 특유의 음울하고 이질적인 감성은 그대로 느껴집니다.\n\n그러한 도시를 배경으로 바이오쇼크는 당신을 쉽게 빠져나오기 힘든, 몰입감 넘치는 이야기 속으로 다시 한번 끌고 들어갑니다. 매력적인 동반자 엘리자베스의 손을 잡게 해서요.\n\n\n\n이 이상 이 게임에 대한 설명을 계속 해나가면 스포일러가 무더기로 나올 것 같아서 설명은 이만 줄이려고 합니다. 개인적으로 제가 진짜 갓겜이라고 느낀 게임의 경우 추천을 할 때 왠만하면 말을 아끼려고 하는 편이거든요. 추천을 받은 상대가 왠만하면 게임에 대한 사전 정보 없이 날 것 그대로 경험하며 감동을 받았으면 하는 마음이 있어서요. [strike]그런 것 치고 꽤 많이 나불댄거 같긴 하네요[/strike] \n\n\n아무튼 갓겜입니다.\n\n당신이 스토리 뽕에 매우 잘 취하는 게이머라면, 살면서 반드시 해봐야할 작품이라고 생각합니다. \n\n\n\n\n\n다만 몇가지 게임 시작 전에 유의해야할 부분이 있긴 합니다. \n\n첫번째로 게임 내에서 이야기 하는, 현실에 있었던 서구 역사와 관련된 사건들은 사전 지식이 없는 상태로 접했을 때 다소 생소하게 느껴질 수 있습니다. 이런 부분에 있어서는 따로 정보 검색을 해보시는 것을 추천합니다. 물론 그렇게 하지 않아도 맥락상 스토리의 이해가 가능하긴 하지만 아무래도 이에 대해 알고 있으면 몰입감의 깊이가 확 달라집니다.\n\n두번째로 게임 내에서 공식 한글화를 지원하지만 번역이 개판입니다. 유저 패치가 있으니 이를 찾아서 [h1]반드시[/h1] 적용해 플레이하시길 바랍니다. 저는 그것도 모르고 1회차를 대부분 공식 한글화로 진행해 스토리 이해에 많은 혼란을 겪었습니다. \n\n세번째로 게임 내의 대사와 간판들에 대한 자막은 지원하나 '복소폰'이라고 불리는 음성 수집 요소에 대한 자막은 지원하지 않습니다. 하지만 '복소폰'에서 제공하는 메세지들 자체는 세계관과 배경, 스토리 이해에 있어 굉장히 큰 도움을 주기 때문에 따로 'O'키를 눌러 나오는 메뉴에서 텍스트로 읽어보시길 추천드립니다.\n\n\n이 부분 유념하시어 공중 도시 콜럼비아에서의 멋진 모험이 되시길 기원하는 바입니다.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"부커, 당신은 신이 두렵나요?\"\n\n\"아니, 난 네가 두려워.\"\n\n\n\n크으...","timestamp_created":1592925772,"timestamp_updated":1592958050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71225936","author":{"steamid":"76561198854348467","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":884,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1593093946},"language":"schinese","review":"神级序章，神仙结局","timestamp_created":1592922789,"timestamp_updated":1592922789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71224476","author":{"steamid":"76561198403157962","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":1551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":798,"last_played":1629811143},"language":"brazilian","review":"Gostou dos anteriores?

vie en rose》，才发现至今都忘不掉那依然绝美却凄凉的笑容，还有骤然落下的纤纤玉手。\n这部作品在我心中的地位是如此之高，以至于和任何人谈起游戏，都会急于表达它是我心中最好的游戏、真正的第九艺术代表，以至于这么多年玩过了这么多第一人称游戏之后，如今回来补票+再刷，才意识到原来它的射击手感并不那么极致，建模并不那么完美，可是哥伦比亚依然是我心中最美的城市，《无限》的战斗依然是我心中最具沉浸感的战斗，这个故事依然是我心中最隽永的传奇。\n这么多年，玩过这么多单机游戏，但只有在这个游戏中，游戏体验才不是孤独的，只有与伊丽莎白同行的时候，才真正有一种生死与共的“队友”的感觉。比起大多数第一人称游戏中要么不说话，要么喃喃自语、和NPC只做必要交流的主角，本作中布克和伊丽莎白的对话是如此鲜活、如此真实。她会欣喜，会得意，会童心泛滥，会对这个世界充满好奇心，会和人群一同欢快起舞，也会在经历了太多的事之后愁眉不展、忧心忡忡。如导演所说，“极乐城是一座城，而伊丽莎白是一个人”，这就是对这个故事的最完美的概括。\n我后来喜欢《消逝的光芒》，也是类似的原因，甚至只是为了主角曾回答别人的那一句“我是谁？我……就是个跑腿的”这般鲜活的对话。这种表达让我觉得，我不是一个没有感情的机器，而是一个在经历这一切故事的人。\n《无限》中，一路同行，刀山火海同赴，再也不用像前两部那样担心弹药不够，蓝不够，你安心杀敌，她全力支援。想起救出伊丽莎白后的第一场战斗中，系统提示说“伊丽莎白可以照顾好自己”……她又何止是能照顾好自己。只可惜，我们没能照顾她到最后。\n主线中如此畅快的战斗体验，却在其中一方离场后如此黯然。海葬中，那个曾经游刃有余能够照顾好自己的少女，却要带着满身伤痕潜行摸索，再也没有充足的弹药，再也没有充盈的蓝条。她说，布克，我好想你。是啊，我也很怀念和你一同战斗的日子。\n所以终究还是没有勇气把海葬再通一遍。\n她在这世界上见过那么多平行时空，真希望在某一个时空中，她最终能在巴黎街角的咖啡馆，安心喝一杯咖啡，再看一本书，再画一幅画，想起过去波澜壮阔的岁月，嘴角泛起浅浅的微笑，就好。","timestamp_created":1592884269,"timestamp_updated":1592884269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71199959","author":{"steamid":"76561198112066727","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":6650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6650,"last_played":1592381912},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1592871330,"timestamp_updated":1625713066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71196923","author":{"steamid":"76561198798224118","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":645,"last_played":1520140162},"language":"english","review":"i

best shot and give us the end result. ken levine tried his hardest to give us bioshock in the clouds, and we may have gotten call of duty instead, but I still appreciate the massive effort and undertaking that this game represents. i can rest soundly knowing that somewhere in an alternate timeline they got the bioshock infinite that we wanted.","timestamp_created":1592781602,"timestamp_updated":1592781602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71150651","author":{"steamid":"76561199006344617","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":543,"last_played":1592780418},"language":"latam","review":"muy

On your journey, you will have to shoot your way through a city as you learn more about the city, the girl, and you.\n\nThe game offers you about 8 different guns, two of which you can have equipped at once. And you get access to 8 plasmids (magic powers). Each gun and plasmid has its own unique function and you will likely stick to one combination you really like, though there are certain combination that will be required in more difficult situations.\n\nWhile I am not a fan of shooters, as I have the dexterity and reaction time of a frozen popsicle, this game does a fairly decent job at keeping enemies hittable while having them still be a challenge to hit.\n\nThe narrative is enjoyable as well. What turns out to be fairly run of the mill rescue the princess story will eventually unravel into a unique story of its own. There are very sparse cutscenes, and the majority of background information is provided in the form of audio logs that you can find scattered throughout the city.\n\nThere is also DLC that continues to add to the story as well as a high score shoot em up arcade.","timestamp_created":1592770510,"timestamp_updated":1592770510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504504501819610596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71142323","author":{"steamid":"76561198452658003","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":792,"last_played":1592766291},"language":"english","review":"Holy mother of god what did I just play oh my god I am totally blown away by this......
