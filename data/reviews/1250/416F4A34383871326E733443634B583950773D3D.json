Während des Spiels könnt ihr immer wieder einen Händler aufsuchen und Waffen mit InGame-Geld kaufen. Jede Klasse hat seine eigenen Waffen; Berserker geht bspw. eher auf Nahkampf; Scharfschützen haben Pistolen und Scharfschütztengewehre; andere Klassen haben eher MGs und SMGs, etc. Natürlich könnt ihr immer jede Waffe kaufen, aber achtet darauf, dass ihr nur ein gewisses Gewicht tragen könnt. \n\nKilling Floor macht mir richtig Spaß; der Aufgabenmodus motiviert, der normale Modus unterhält eine längere Zeit, gerade dadurch, dass ihr viel einstellen könnt - Rundenlänge, Schwierigkeitsgrad etc. Sehr gutes Spiel - sehr zu empfehlen.","timestamp_created":1435597060,"timestamp_updated":1435597060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16777800","author":{"steamid":"76561198018777581","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":994,"last_played":1427829333},"language":"russian","review":"Сильно.","timestamp_created":1435575563,"timestamp_updated":1435575563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16776332","author":{"steamid":"76561198199626435","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":729,"last_played":1527709346},"language":"russian","review":"рекомендую эту игру всем кто хочет повыживать вместе с друзьями","timestamp_created":1435567305,"timestamp_updated":1435567305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16772423","author":{"steamid":"76561198122436295","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1638,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1239,"last_played":1489555852},"language":"english","review":"This game is really fun but it's a lot of the same stuff over and over.","timestamp_created":1435544027,"timestamp_updated":1435544027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16772320","author":{"steamid":"76561198064476978","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1970,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1694,"last_played":1530833241},"language":"english","review":"This game brings back memories from when i used to play the Doom games and when you would have to kill these werid monster that would teleport or even kill you from behind.
