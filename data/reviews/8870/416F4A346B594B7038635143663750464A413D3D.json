Many people I know don't necessarily enjoy though because of the \"simplified gameplay\" or something like that (they related it to other shooters instead of a Bioshock game). I on the other hand, loved the gameplay. For me, it felt smooth and fast paced, neatly blending in with cutscenes or any other event in the game. Not to mention that the game's environment is just so breathtaking. It's highly immersive, almost to the point that you forget you're sitting in your bedroom. The characters are deep and not predictable in the slightest. Especially Elizabeth and Booker. Elizabeth is highly helpful in combat and very rarely (like VERY RARELY) fails to save you with some ammunition, a health item, or whatever else she finds. The plot itself may feel straightforward and maybe even cliche to some, but that only counts until you meet Elizabeth. After that, all bets are off. The plot will go in directions that it'd (Bio)shock you left and right. Puns aside, just buy the game. I don't want this review to go on and on and on so, just buy it. You will not regret it.\n\nI have yet to buy the DLCs, but I'm sure they won't disappoint either.

The story however makes the game shine.

It is a prime example of what kind of story can be told and to what effect when utalising of the tools a video game presents to do so.  This is just one of the reasons i have played through it over a dozen times.  \n\nColumbia is a absolutely breathtaking world and you will easily find yourslef getting carried away just wanting too look around and see everything.  From the first moment you see it you just fall in love with it.  Those first steps through the city are such a marvel unlike anything I have ever experienced before in a game.  You want to hear every line of dialog from all of the people on the streets, and just sit there and take in the sights, from musical acts, to the fabulous scenery, everthing this city lays out is fantastic.\n\nElizabeth and Booker take center stage in this piece of art though.  The chemestry between them is like none other I have ever witnessed.  Booker is a hardened P.I. going into columbia to find and rescue Elizabeth,  while Elizabeth is a girl who has been locked in a tower for the past 19 years guarded by the Songbird, a giant mechanical bird that will do whatever it takes to keep her there.  But being locked up for so long, she has developed a child like nievety towards the world.  And it is this that makes it so  great to see these two interact when they first meet up.  But don't let that make you think Elizabeth is stupid and helpless.  She has spent her time reading and studying about the world,  and she certainly helps Booker along, and progresses in her own way as the story continues.  She also possess the ability to open tears, windows to other worlds.  This gift of hers not only makes for some interesting gameplay, but ties in heavily to the story.\n\nWith story telling mechanics like parallel universes, you might think the game is not able to do its self justice and leave a open a lot of loose ends,  But Bioshock Infinite ties it all up really well leaving little unaswered.  It is a very ambitious story that is absolutley jaw dropping when all is said and done.  And it demands to be replayed.  You will find yourself starting again right after the credits finish.  \n\nIts all these things and more that Make Bioshock Infinite an experience like no other and my favourite game of all time.  It really is that good,  if you consider yourself a gamer, you owe it to yourself to play it.  It is a benchmark in videogame story telling,  and no matter what people say, it has great combat!  Vigor are loads of fun and the skylines add big sense of speed  and agility to fights.  Columbia is one of the best worlds ever created second only to Rapture.  \n\nRapture originally was loved for having great atmosphere and being very creepy, but you always knew the city had more to tell, especially in its early years.  Burial at Sea lets you see what the city was like before the civil war and that is reason enough to buy the seasons pass,  but its great continuation on the story line from Infinite is very cool.  It also has a very different approach to gameplay, relying more on stealth and branching paths, Burial at Sea almost feels like a different game.  \n\nI can not recommend this game enough, and if you have not played it, now is as good a time as ever, its cheap and Burial at Sea Part 2 is almost upon us!  Bioshock Infinite is a Crowining achievement in gaming that deserves your attention.","timestamp_created":1395381132,"timestamp_updated":1395381132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9580106","author":{"steamid":"76561198049156052","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1531,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":749,"last_played":1572621138},"language":"english","review":"Gud game while it lasted, kind of live up to its hype.
