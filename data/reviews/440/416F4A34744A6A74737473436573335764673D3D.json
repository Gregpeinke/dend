Diese erlauben jedoch bloß für unterdchiedliche Spielweisen, bringen jedoch keinen direkten Vorteil. In den meisten Fällen würde ich sogar die Standard Waffen vorziehen.\nDer einzige Grund Geld ausgeben zu wollen ist entweder wenn man Extras an seinen Waffen haben möchte (Killstreak/Killcounter) oder wenn man kosmetische Items haben möchte. Auch diese kann man jedoch über Handel mit anderen Spielern völlig kostenlos bekommen.\n\nIch habe wenig Erfahrung mit FPS Spielen, jedoch glaube ich, dass sich die Mechaniken der unterschiedlichen Klassen fundamental von dem Durchschnitts-FPS abhebt. Das zeigt dich z.B. in Racketensprung, Backstab, Ubercharge ect.. \nEs ist relativ einfach in das Spiel reinzukommen, insbesondere in jene Klassen, welche mehr mit dem typischen Shooter zu tun haben. Die Dinge, welche einem vielleicht nicht bekannt vorkommen lernt man schnell kennen und mit ein wenig Probieren versteht man auch diese (z.B.Racketensprung). Insbesondere diese Dinge erlauben jedoch auch für sehr viel Verbesserungspotential. Das führt dazu, dass ich mich nach 400h in diesem Spiel immer noch bei weitem nicht als gut bezeichnen würde und sich viele tausende Stunden mit diesem Spiel verbringen lassen. \n\nWenn man ein Spiel spielen möchte, dass für viel Spaß Abseits des Spielzeils erlaubt, findet man dies hier genauso wie ein sehr Wettkampforientierte Szene. Es ist aktuelle mein Lieblingsspiel und wird es auch noch für eine Weile bleiben.

No início do gameplay pode baralhar, mas habituas-te durante algumas horas. Embora que a comunidade é um pouco tóxica, pelo menos n é muito mais tóxica do que o csgo como estas crianças do csgo a dizerem \"eu comi a tua mãe\", ou por exemplo \"skins = skill\". \n\n[H1]pros[/h1]\nComunidade ainda está viva durante 10 anos\nTu recebes qualquer arma aleatóriamente durante 2 ou 3 horas depois\nSe quiseres tornar premium com inventário mais de 300 items, há 2 opções:\n1) comprar um dos 2  items na mann.co store cujo são billhetes mvm e chaves. Daqui 1 semana, poderás trocar por metal refinado que podes comprar diversos chapéus e armas estranhas. Sites que recomendo para trocar e ver os preços, obviamente backpack.tf. N recomendo comprar chapéus ou armas na mann.co store porque primeiro armas custam normalmente 0.05 refs cada arma (menos de 3 centimos) e 2 chapéus normalmente 1.33 refs cada (uns 9 cêntimos)\n2)podes sempre comprar a orange box na loja steam, isto inclui tf2 premium.\nTf2 premium o k pode dropar n são so armas, mas sim chapéus, etiquetas nome, descrição e tintas para pintar chapéus\nEstás farto de receber items da mesma classe que nunca usas? Podes fabricar items como por exemplo metal de sucata, recuperado e refinado.\n[B]Como é que se usa isto?[/b]\nTens de ter 2 items da mesma classe (pode ser qualquer arma, incluindo corpo a corpo) e começas a fabricar, a seguir 3 metais de sucata por um metal recuperado, 3 recuperados por 1 refinado e assim sucessivamente.\n[B]mas tenho 2 items de diferente classes, posso fabricar?[/b]\nNão. Mas se fores premium, podes ir ao scrap.tf, cujo recomendo muito porque tem raffles/giveaways, cujo a entrada é de graça, trocas as tuas armas por metal (mesma coisa como fabricas), podes comprar jogos, csgo skins, cartas colecionáveis, etc..\n\n[H1]TF2 Competitivo[/h1]\n\nEmbora que o tf2 competitivo esteja, bem.. \"morto\", há servidores para competitivo, como por exemplo, faceiT, tf2center etc. ]\n\n[H1]Cons[/h1]\nCasual pode ter vários níveis desde 1 até 150, mas n há recompensas depois de chegares a nível 150. A medalha é mais para \"decoração.\"\n[B]por favor, não vaias aos fórums do TF2 e pedires ajuda, mais pareçe lá a \"3a guerra mundial\" sem moderação lá. Se pedires alguma ajuda, melhor usares google e pesquisares[/b]\nNo tf2 competitivo oficial, há demasiados hackers, smurfs, etc. Se tens um pc da xuxa como eu, os fps rodam 12 fps enquanto no casual rodam uns 50 fps.\nTf2 competitivo oficial tens de participar se fores premium, com autenticador móvel, se não tiveres o autenticador móvel no teu smarthphone, tens de comprar um passe que custa uns 10 euros, por isso mais vale ir ao tf2center ou faceit em vez de gastares numa coisa que nem sequer vale a pena\n\n[H1]Conclusão[/h1]\nVale a pena jogar, n só servidores comunitários, mas também casual pk está cheio de jogadores k não são esperientes, como o mapa turbine por exemplo\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1498637010,"timestamp_updated":1498666555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":40,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.790379106998443604","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32891321","author":{"steamid":"76561198119687477","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":390103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":520,"playtime_at_review":215675,"last_played":1660269719},"language":"english","review":"Nice game 10/10 jiji\n\n2019 and still a very nice game","timestamp_created":1498599851,"timestamp_updated":1574905865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.620565056800842285","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32889698","author":{"steamid":"76561198106820066","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":26887,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7987,"last_played":1626752787},"language":"spanish","review":"Team Fortress 2 es un juego adictivo, lleno de accion, trabajo en equipo, extensa cantidad de armas, y lo mejor...

However, the matchmaking of this game still lacks for improvement.\nIn my first experience I suffered a lot with my enemies in the matches, because the matchmaking doesnt divide new players from pro/casual players: you can have 2 hours in the game while somebody from your or the other team can have 100 hours for example. Because of this I still have struggle to have fun in casual matches, remaining only the community servers to enjoy.\nBut overall, its a pretty solid fun game and I tottaly recommend playing it, despite my experience with it.","timestamp_created":1494682818,"timestamp_updated":1659280726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31719996","author":{"steamid":"76561198113466410","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":78742,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51125,"last_played":1652268360},"language":"english","review":"Really good game but could use some optimization on the cpu usage and make it more gpu dependent.","timestamp_created":1494668773,"timestamp_updated":1561803825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530761182308197021","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31719135","author":{"steamid":"76561198344543608","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":153205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":151071,"last_played":1657965604},"language":"russian","review":"Люблю с девства гонять лысого!","timestamp_created":1494665755,"timestamp_updated":1574060909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563758373260498047","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31664771","author":{"steamid":"76561198291594634","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":30173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5222,"last_played":1626742279},"language":"spanish","review":"Está muy bien pero podría mejorar","timestamp_created":1494421702,"timestamp_updated":1494421702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31664746","author":{"steamid":"76561197961781399","num_games_owned":709,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":2151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2091,"last_played":1587281403},"language":"english","review":"It was fun until hats ruined everything.
