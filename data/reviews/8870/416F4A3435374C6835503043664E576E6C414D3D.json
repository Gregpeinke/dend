thinking about it for a while and the game may do many things right i cant bring myself to recommend it.\n\nOh where to begin il start with the positives and story, story-wise i dont think iam qualified to say my opinion on the game, mainly because its a taste thing, i dont necessirily think its poorly written but the fact it has time travel/parallel worlds and all that shit, 9 times out of 10 i end up hating these stories and the same thing happened with Bioshock infinite, but still there are some good moments here and there i thought the main twist was a bit predictable, booker dewitt and elizabeth are amazing characters even the side characters/villains are great aswell, so all in all the story is not my cup of tea despite the pacing being all over the place, i still managed to appreciate the characters and i vastly prefer this story over the one from bioshock 2, its a problem that i can overlook. \n\nThe setting and visual design is drop dead beautiful i really loved the fact that its not taking place in rapture but it takes place in the sky and i really loved the fact that it was also lively with multiple npcs. \n\nElizabeth is one of the greatest video game companions ever, the way she interacts with the environments, help you with supplies during combat is simply incredible its just sad that this awesome AI does not carry to the enemies but il get there shortly.\n\nSkyline is a very fun mechanic. \n\nSo the question is where does Bioshock infinite fails and falls apart? well its in the gamepaly/game design to begin with unlike its predecessors Infinite is far more linear, the past games were well structured giving you a lot of room to explore that rewards you incredibly well and objecitvely speaking linearity is not bad what so ever like some idiots make it out to be, linear games like RE4 and Half life 2 are widely considered some of the best games ever because of how these games nailed the linear game design bioshock infinite on the other hand fails miserably in that regard.\n\nThe games i had mentioned earlier spice things up in many ways to keep them from becoming stale and repetitive, bioshock infinite is extremely repetitive, all you do is fight a group of enemies, pull a lever/open door/press a button, watch a story segment, rinse and repeat and thats it, no interesting puzzles, very few unique encounters, barebones exploration and limited interactivity with the world, it feels like a beautiful art that you can only look at but cant interact with.\n\nCombat is very generic it may get the job done but sadly it didnt feel like a step forward compared to bioshock 2, but like i mentioned earlier 99% of the gameplay is you fighting waves of enemies over and over again, the switch to two weapons was a very dumb design choice to pander to more modern FPS games, plasmids were just okay nothing completely new or unique.\n\nEnemy variety was really bad this is a key area that Bioshock 2 improved on but sadly this game does not, its especially a problem since this game tries way to hard to be an arena shooter, the fact that it tries to be a linear shooter is not bad but compare it to something like Doom eternal where the gameplay loop is polished to perfection with well designed enemies and encounters, Bioshock infinite sadly does not even come close to that level of quality as an arena shooter. \n\nEnemy AI is fucking stupid, its quite baffling to see how stupid they are in comparison to elizabeth's smart AI. \n\nElizabeth's tear manipulation is an interesting mechanic but it really does not add any depth to the gameplay at all, its one of these things that the developers had great ideas for but couldnt execute it properly due to budget or development time.\n\ni dont like how its connected to the original Bioshock game.\n\nAs someone who has been playing single player games for over 20 years i can easily see that there were very high ambitions for this game and most of these great ideas ended up on the chopping block and all we got is a skeleton of these ambitions and the fact that ken levine left right after this kinda shows it.\n\nNot saying that Bioshock infinite is a bad game im pretty sure it will grab some people, to me Bioshock 1 was a game that proves that video games is the greatest storytelling medium by managing to flawlessly combine story telling and interactivity, Bioshock infinite gets rid of key aspects that made the original bioshock such a masterpiece by completely ignoring the mediums greatest strength and thats interactivity.","timestamp_created":1639870129,"timestamp_updated":1639870129,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472636818885803223","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106068826","author":{"steamid":"76561198448332063","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1089,"last_played":1639869451},"language":"english","review":"9/10\n\nan

You play as Booker Dewitt, a private investigator who also happens to have impressive combat abilities due to the fact he was a soldier prior. He is tasked with retrieving a girl named Elizabeth so that his debts would be wiped away.\n\nThis game was definitely a fun experience. There are a variety of skills (called Vigors in the game) that you could unlock by playing through the game. You won't be able to miss any, and all of them have their own distinct uses. Another noteworthy thing is that you could combine the usage of two vigors to create fun and deadly combos. One example would be using Bucking Bronco to make enemies levitate then using Undertow to grab an enemy mid-air to throw them off the edge of the floating city.\n\nThe base game's atmosphere is totally different from the previous Bioshock games. The connection between this game and its predecessors doesn't seem to be clear at first, but playing through the DLCs will explain it. Though, I think this game should be a separate game unrelated to the previous games as it takes place in a completely different setting with a new set of characters.\n\nI would recommend playing this game for those interested in a fun shooter game with a decent story. The voice acting and dialogue between characters are top notch as well. Note that playing the first two games isn't really necessary as the main campaign doesn't really reference it much or at all.","timestamp_created":1639783397,"timestamp_updated":1655985632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.667648017406463623","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105998151","author":{"steamid":"76561198065290898","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2703,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2703,"last_played":1637381886},"language":"russian","review":"Покупая Игру в 13 году на тот момент просто пробегая и не понимая сюжет но лишь воспринимая красочность игры она меня очень впечатлила\nПроходил я её несколько раз\nИ скажу так Сюжет достаточно сложный в понимании и чтобы его понять нужно будет пройти игру не один раз\nя как фанат игры хочу сказать что она стоит денег и времени \nно советую купить дополнения или же ремастер всех частей.","timestamp_created":1639777305,"timestamp_updated":1639777305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105996834","author":{"steamid":"76561198882372840","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1272,"last_played":1622396337},"language":"english","review":"Elizabeth - I hate it when you kill people \n\nAlso Elizabeth - Here, take some ammo","timestamp_created":1639775601,"timestamp_updated":1639775601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105992345","author":{"steamid":"76561198038150873","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":777,"last_played":1638883073},"language":"koreana","review":"옛날게임이라서 최근에 나온 총게임을 해본 사람들은 조작이나 편의성에서 답답함을 느낄수 있겠지만\n2013년에 이정도 퀄리티면 명작이라고 생각합니다.\n그래픽, 타격감, 재미는 지금해도 손색이 없을정도로 좋습니다.\n지금와선 본값은 아깝지만 2만원 아래면 충분히 살만하다 생각해요.","timestamp_created":1639769871,"timestamp_updated":1639769871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105987420","author":{"steamid":"76561199032571795","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":429,"last_played":1639763483},"language":"english","review":"Absolute Masterpiece","timestamp_created":1639763515,"timestamp_updated":1639763515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ457Lh5P0CfNWnlAM="}
