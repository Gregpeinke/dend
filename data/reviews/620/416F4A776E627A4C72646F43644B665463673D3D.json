As well as this, the (re)introduction of GLaDOS was done well, and sets the players the tone for how the next segment will go.\n\nChapter 2 was a good introduction back into GLaDOS' test chambers, and had lower difficulty as it was still near the start of the game. It gives introductions on how the Emancipation Grills/'Fizzlers' work and can be used as testing elements. It also introduces brand new testing elements to this game: Lasers/Laser Redirection Cubes and Aerial Faith Plates. These elements are given equal introductions, and are simple to pick up on.\n\nChapter 3 introduces a third testing element: (after some advanced tests using Aerial Faith Plates) Hard Light Bridges. The way that they are used in its introductory chamber is to cross a large pit that is full of toxic goo. Later on, they are used to block Turret fire, which is a creative way to use them. \n\nSpeaking of Turret fire, this chapter also re-introduces us to the adorable things known as Turrets. They act just like in the first game, and are still as innocent as they used to be. \n\nChapter 4 continues using mixtures of Lasers/Redirection Cubes, Aerial Faith Plates and Hard Light Bridges in it's test chambers. Then, during Chamber 21, the Personality Core 'Wheatley' finds you and helps you escape from the chamber. With the best-worst imitation of an accent I've heard.\n\nDuring this segment, GLaDOS gives you the 'final' test chamber. (Including a heart on the wall! I mean, how could you say no to that!)\n\nChapter 5 sees you go behind the scenes of Aperture, as you sabotage the only weapons that GLaDOS can use against you: Turrets and 'Deadly' Neurotoxin. I liked this part especially because it shows the inner workings of the facility, and how big Aperture really is. It also has some good dialogue too.\n\n[THE NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE MAIN PLOT/CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE SECOND HALF OF THE GAME]\n\n[spoiler]At the end of Chapter 5, the plot (and Wheatley) decides that the game isn't over yet, and brings you (literally) falling down to Chapter 6.\n\nChapter 6 and 7 are interesting chambers, because you not only have to use portals and puzzle elements in the chambers themselves, but to get from chamber-to-chamber. The new testing elements of the three Gels was interesting, but I feel like Conversion Gel (White) is 'broken' when you use it in the PeTI (Chamber Building) because when you put it into a chamber you know that people will over use it.\n\nStory-wise, these chapters give a backstory to GLaDOS, and how she was made. Which was a nice addition. The puzzles, I feel, had a difficulty spike here, mostly in between chambers, when you have to get to the next Testing Sphere.\n\nChapter 8... Chapter 8. Back in 'modern' Aperture and Wheatley's sheer idiocy has basically sent the facility into meltdown. The chapter shows just how the mainframe has changed him, and most of his dialogue is humorous. He's still evil though. \n\nThe chapter introduces Excursion Funnels, which are used to move vertically, across gaps (in this case, bottomless pits) and to push buttons that are on the walls and ceilings. Oh, and Frankenturrets: two Turrets fused to a Storage Cube, which are the basic cube for this chapter instead of the regular Storage Cubes. (They're admittedly cute, and I wouldn't mind having a real one.)\n\nChapter 9: 'The Part Where He Kills You'. Dragged the title out, a little bit (GLaDOS and Wheatley's dialogue,  the achievement and the soundtrack title all variants of the title) but it was funny the first time. \n\nThis Chapter is the final one, and is basically an escape sequence where Wheatley throws EVERYTHING at you. There are two parts where you have to be quick with portals, which the game switches round if you shoot the wrong one, which is very kind. Also introduces Bombs. They'll be useful later.\n\nAlso contains my favourite quote of the game\n\nFinally, the Boss Fight and Credits: The boss fight was done well, using some of the elements from earlier in the game. And bombs. (Told you they'd be useful)\n\nI was fine with the difficulty of the boss fight, but it only uses the Gels, and nothing else. I would have liked to see some other testing elements in there, like Hard Light Bridges or Excursion Funnels, but the Gels were worked well into this part, so I'll let it slide for now.[/spoiler]\n\nThe credits were courtesy, once again, of Ellen McLain, and her wonderful singing.\n\nNothing more to add than, in short, this game deserves the awards it's won, and is one of the best games I've played in a while.\n\nOh, and the Co-Op mode is fun to play after the main game.It's own small campaigns are unique and add some information as to what GLaDOS did after Chell left. Nice touch Valve.","timestamp_created":1487862367,"timestamp_updated":1537392349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535477280616760254","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30119681","author":{"steamid":"76561198170510963","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2943,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2112,"last_played":1648807419},"language":"russian","review":"продолжение афигенной игры\n","timestamp_created":1487858915,"timestamp_updated":1487858915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472636818885803223","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30119597","author":{"steamid":"76561198116879965","num_games_owned":1065,"num_reviews":5902,"playtime_forever":131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":131,"last_played":1590446158},"language":"russian","review":"суперское гавно","timestamp_created":1487858703,"timestamp_updated":1487858703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491675734519958496","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30118947","author":{"steamid":"76561198120911646","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1414,"last_played":1552921999},"language":"russian","review":"Единственные 2 дырочки в которые я заходил","timestamp_created":1487856316,"timestamp_updated":1487856316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":110,"votes_funny":338,"weighted_vote_score":"0.884787082672119141","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30118867","author":{"steamid":"76561198025424037","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":684,"last_played":1467452372},"language":"english","review":"The game needs more Ratman","timestamp_created":1487856081,"timestamp_updated":1487856081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500356912612915039","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30118773","author":{"steamid":"76561198322319888","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1273,"last_played":1640711455},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego me parece una obra maestra de los videojuegos y el entretenimiento en general.

All in all this game is a masterpeice and a great followup to the legacy of the first.","timestamp_created":1487605928,"timestamp_updated":1487605928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30059510","author":{"steamid":"76561198286965603","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":564,"last_played":1554080441},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game get it now","timestamp_created":1487604204,"timestamp_updated":1487604204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30058058","author":{"steamid":"76561198152384674","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":43,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":41,"last_played":1498396738},"language":"schinese","review":"脑力不够","timestamp_created":1487599711,"timestamp_updated":1487599711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30057866","author":{"steamid":"76561198112522720","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":813,"last_played":1649979563},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the best Games I have EVER played.
