For me, I make puzzles, and use different ways to do things, for instance, pressing a button that times you, and you jump on bouncy gel to get on a plate that flies you through the air while wall crunchers try to kill you, and you have to get to the other button to open the door. Easy enough for you to say a review, you would say that its a real hard game but fun at the same time, but I have just one word for the game, and this is the word. Awesome. Thats all for Portal, and my next review will be going to Goat MMO Simulator.","timestamp_created":1419698104,"timestamp_updated":1419698104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13640440","author":{"steamid":"76561198059032714","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1340,"last_played":1479976465},"language":"english","review":"i like. im just doing this to get the badge","timestamp_created":1419698025,"timestamp_updated":1479976352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13640172","author":{"steamid":"76561198077624056","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":695,"last_played":1626894185},"language":"turkish","review":"Zor bulmacalara sahip, ilk oyunun aksine, kabul edilebilir bir uzunluğa sahip bir oyun.

I loved Portal, but in my opinion Portal 2 is even better - it's longer for one, and while there's almost *too much* story to gameplay, it's still challenging, atmospheric and engaging. The 'old' levels - intentionally being vague here, because of spoilers - are my special favourites for atmosphere and sheer puzzleness. Probably one flaw - arguably a feature not a bug - is that some levels are just a little tedious because they teach concepts vital for the big complex puzzles in later chambers. This reduces the replay value a little, but there's always value in trying to figure out a better way to solve a chamber, or in learning to do things that are not necessarily fun but definitely necessary.\n\nAnd I haven't even gotten round to playing co-op yet! I anticipate many, many more hours spent in blissful mental labour, thinking with portals. I really love this game - the only thing about it that makes me sad is that the fact that it exists and that I have played it means that the next puzzle games I play will probably be held up to this standard, which is just too bad for all of us.","timestamp_created":1419690304,"timestamp_updated":1419690304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13637588","author":{"steamid":"76561198168907825","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1564686697},"language":"english","review":"wow amazing","timestamp_created":1419689872,"timestamp_updated":1419689872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49253728985786438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13637095","author":{"steamid":"76561198107964783","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":937,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":859,"last_played":1428556194},"language":"schinese","review":"第二作比第一作剧情长了许多,很耐玩,可以自己做房间来玩,不过双人不能本地双人好可惜","timestamp_created":1419688224,"timestamp_updated":1419688224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13636480","author":{"steamid":"76561198092407779","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":523,"last_played":1419167728},"language":"english","review":"11/10","timestamp_created":1419686176,"timestamp_updated":1419686176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13636315","author":{"steamid":"76561198108495770","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":612,"last_played":1413833071},"language":"english","review":"A great sequal","timestamp_created":1419685625,"timestamp_updated":1419685625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13636140","author":{"steamid":"76561198034365992","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1080,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":595,"last_played":1565992675},"language":"russian","review":"Игра на столько крутая что ее хочеться пройти и в 10 раз..правда есть очень запарные уровни, но все же)))Всем советую сингла просто супер:D","timestamp_created":1419685068,"timestamp_updated":1419685068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13636062","author":{"steamid":"76561198169372108","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1436710484},"language":"german","review":"Portal 2 ist auf meiner persönlichen Topliste ganz weit oben und kann nur empfohlen werden für Leute die spaß an Denk- und Geschicklichkeitsspielen haben. \nAbgesehen davon unterhält die Story mehrere Stunden mit Sarkasmus und einem genialen Humor. 2 Dinge die man für gewöhnlich nicht mit Maschinen in Verbindung bringt, aber eben darum, so gut Funktionieren!
