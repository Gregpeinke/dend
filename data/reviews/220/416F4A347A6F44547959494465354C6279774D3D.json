New Super Mario Bros. Wii on the other hand I think is a great game with lots of unique concepts, while not being anything super different from its predecessor it is overall a better experience with more unique levels that the game doesn't lock behind secret exits in castles and a greater use for star coins in the ninth world of the game, which despite the tediousness of entry to the levels they provide a good challenge. New Super Mario Bros U and New Super Luigi U are just a better version of the Wii game seeming very similar on the surface but with a better world map and level design. New Super Luigi U Has a great challenge due to the new physics which makes the game fun and satisfying to complete. Overall I think they get too much hate for how much better they are even compared to the older NES and SNES games.","timestamp_created":1660347019,"timestamp_updated":1660347019,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474820166826248169","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120524054","author":{"steamid":"76561198414150915","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":681,"playtime_at_review":681,"last_played":1660345638},"language":"english","review":"Game

Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.","timestamp_created":1660332464,"timestamp_updated":1660332464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120513711","author":{"steamid":"76561198936164215","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":196,"playtime_at_review":939,"last_played":1659893038},"language":"italian","review":"absolute fucking master piece\nstory 10/10\nphysics 10 out of fucking 10 \nwould buy it 100 more times.","timestamp_created":1660332169,"timestamp_updated":1660332169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120513258","author":{"steamid":"76561198928374111","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":303,"playtime_at_review":659,"last_played":1660331594},"language":"hungarian","review":"I do in fact love lean","timestamp_created":1660331651,"timestamp_updated":1660331651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120512983","author":{"steamid":"76561198422059564","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":709,"last_played":1650478557},"language":"english","review":"Linkin Park HL2 music video the game","timestamp_created":1660331349,"timestamp_updated":1660331349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120512913","author":{"steamid":"76561198322072088","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":830,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":830,"last_played":1658603463},"language":"english","review":"Valve does it again. Another masterpiece!\n\nObvious that Valve improved upon creating Half-Life. The path is always clear, the game yells at you where to go, but you don't notice, which makes it very enjoyable. The usage of Source's physics engine in different puzzles and other places is always very fun (except when they get janky (love you source)). The narrative of the whole story makes you feel like you really take part of it!\n\nAnother game added to my list of favorites!","timestamp_created":1660331265,"timestamp_updated":1660331265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120512612","author":{"steamid":"76561198025853660","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":522,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1660594402},"language":"brazilian","review":"Otimo, Steam.","timestamp_created":1660330902,"timestamp_updated":1660330902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120510983","author":{"steamid":"76561198993883580","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":501,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1660443169},"language":"english","review":"yyyyuy","timestamp_created":1660328839,"timestamp_updated":1660328839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120510763","author":{"steamid":"76561198043829074","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":533,"playtime_at_review":689,"last_played":1660328526},"language":"english","review":"gaben pls\nwhere half life 3?","timestamp_created":1660328609,"timestamp_updated":1660328609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zoDTyYIDe5LbywM="}
