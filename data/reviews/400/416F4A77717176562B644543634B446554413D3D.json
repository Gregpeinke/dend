The concept of portal is that you shoot a blue portal then you can shoot another one which is orange and walk through them. This is probably the most innovative idea i have seen in a while. Puzzles are fun to complete but get repetitive quite quickly. This I feel is the main let down, there are enemies in the game but very little the game doesn't mix things up.\n\nYou have probably heard already that this game is very short. My first play through was just under 1hr 30mins which is really short for a game but it needed to be shortened otherwise it would've just dragged on and got boring after. Portal comes with some bonus levels and those are rather short too but a good fun time-waster, I now play these bonus maps in the background while waiting for games to load up.To be honest there is not much I can say other than its the best puzzle game I have ever played so far. Unlike puzzles in Zelda these ones are actually fun to complete and require no backtracking whatsoever. I am keeping this review short because the game it self is short and I have said all there is to say. Pick it up on a sale you wont be disappointed\n\nWith that said i would give portal a\n\n7/10: A Good Game","timestamp_created":1451687929,"timestamp_updated":1451752804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20195721","author":{"steamid":"76561198212444156","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":925,"last_played":1597785363},"language":"english","review":"fun","timestamp_created":1451687682,"timestamp_updated":1451687682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20194578","author":{"steamid":"76561198161503473","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":732,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":179,"last_played":1602064086},"language":"czech","review":"Jste testovací subjekt a pokoušíte se uniknout z +-20 testovacích místností pomocí portálů které si vytvoříte :) Super hra, která zabaví na hodiny. \n\n     8/10","timestamp_created":1451685456,"timestamp_updated":1451685456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20193350","author":{"steamid":"76561198119066939","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1451612621},"language":"english","review":"Incredibly short but fun","timestamp_created":1451683053,"timestamp_updated":1451683053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20191985","author":{"steamid":"76561198219524665","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1574009658},"language":"turkish","review":"bu oyun gerçekten çok iyi. belki bazıları sıkılıp hemen oynamayı bırakacak ama insan kafa yordukça ve başardıkça gerçekten çok zevk alıyor.özellikle sondaki şarkı da 10 numara :)","timestamp_created":1451680590,"timestamp_updated":1451680590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20191113","author":{"steamid":"76561198257677740","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1202,"last_played":1575948588},"language":"english","review":"4/5. Portal is insane. I would give it a 5/5, but it's story is really short. It took me less than 2 hours to beat it, so I recommend the bundle. The gameplay from the trailer is completely different and so is the graphics than the actual game. It doesn't have the feel the trailer gives it. On the other hand, It runs 80-120 fps on nearly any machine because it is kind of old but still good. The graphics are very good, the loading doesn't take long, and the gameplay is great.

Ok first about the game. Portal inovated every aspect of puzzle games introducing a VERY interesting story/narrative and using an FPS perspective but without any shooting. Just you, a portal gun and a new way of thinking with portals. The puzles get each time more difficult but the game always finds a way to give you hints (usually subcontient hints, using mainly the level desing) as where to go next. The physics is amazing here and the portals is something that one cannot explain, it is like explaining how to ride a bike, really. You will only understand how interesting is to solve those portal puzzles when you begin to do that. This game took some 24 hours at the first time to finiish it and 7 hours on a second time, so it is a short game if you know your way, but nevertheless those were the most funny hours I ever played in a game.\n\nOk game asside, let´s talk GLADOS.

It is surprising how a relatively simple idea of a device that opens static portals can turn into very complicated puzzles, but the base game progresses in a way that doesn't become too difficult, yet still offers a challenge in later levels and the bonus maps. The game is also filled with humor, especially from the always-watching GLaDOS that is quick to offer comments from helpful to snarky, and even downright psychotic near the end of the game, and from automated machine gun turrets that sound and speak like children. To me, though, the best feature of the game is the modding, and there are some excellent mods for this game available both on Steam and other locations on the internet. I recommend Rexaura and Portal: Prelude, the latter of which is a prequel to Portal before the GLaDOS system was first turned on.","timestamp_created":1451542135,"timestamp_updated":1451542135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20139291","author":{"steamid":"76561198260457111","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":342,"last_played":1454126150},"language":"english","review":"really good for relaxing and teasing your brain . worth it","timestamp_created":1451540494,"timestamp_updated":1451540494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20138950","author":{"steamid":"76561198176548370","num_games_owned":387,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":300,"last_played":1540063822},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego es de mi favorito (en especial saga) ya que tiene una dificultad buena, no muy elevada pero no muy facil.\n  En cuestion a durabilidad es alrededor de 4-7 horas, si ver ningun gameplay o guia.\n  GlaDos :D la odiaras pero la amaras...\n\nSin duda juegalo.","timestamp_created":1451539297,"timestamp_updated":1574451906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20138790","author":{"steamid":"76561198225625796","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":19,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2,"last_played":1444374618},"language":"english","review":"Just Buy Valve Complete Package\nBest Package Ever!!!","timestamp_created":1451538745,"timestamp_updated":1451538745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20138428","author":{"steamid":"76561198085786617","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1456957221},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de los mejores juegos que jugue hasta ahora.

The only thing which tests lacks in Portal 2 are energy orbs.","timestamp_created":1451489680,"timestamp_updated":1451489680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20117303","author":{"steamid":"76561198240158220","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1451477858},"language":"russian","review":"лучшее творение на земле","timestamp_created":1451489116,"timestamp_updated":1451489116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20117301","author":{"steamid":"76561198080934137","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1451489695},"language":"schinese","review":"当之无愧的神作","timestamp_created":1451489112,"timestamp_updated":1451489112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20117186","author":{"steamid":"76561198043605440","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":3087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2803,"last_played":1545857371},"language":"english","review":"One of my all-time FAVORITE puzzle games, Portal is a great adventure with plenty of unique levels, hilarious lines of dialogue, and cake. Rather short, but worth the experience. Plus, if you haven't played it in a while, you forget most of the puzzles, so it's practically a new game at that point. Not much else to say, only get it if you like puzzles.","timestamp_created":1451488847,"timestamp_updated":1451488847,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20116840","author":{"steamid":"76561198127693688","num_games_owned":736,"num_reviews":91,"playtime_forever":819,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":819,"last_played":1452198936},"language":"hungarian","review":"Egyszerűen imádom!
