Half-Life is the reason first-person shooters have puzzles or reward you for thinking your options through. Half-Life is the reason first-person shooters have companion NPCs. Half-Life is the reason first-person shooters (often unfortunately) have platforming segments and jumping puzzles.

A good majority of the basic innovations that we see in successful shooters today come from Half-Life, save for health regeneration and a two-weapon limit - Halo did that.

Here you get to know how to the amazing universe of Half Life and Portal started and the consequences of the chain of events Gordon got himself into.\n\nA very bad aspect of the game is that many friendly human models and voices are the same throughout the game and said people will be torn to pieces and blasted full of holes and that somewhat gives a bizarre feeling and it makes a bit confusing to be able to tell who is the real Eli Vance and Kleiner but I guess technology was more limited back then.\n\nThe game itself tries to combine puzzles, shooting and a bit of sci-fi horror into a nice little mix. You might be trying to figure out how to turn on the water to some device but you know that when you go back to activate it you will to pass through those alien clawed tentacles of death or you will be having a flame throwing gargatuan on your tail and you have to see how to dispose of him while running like a mouse.\n\nSmall creatures will always be jumping on you and making you keep an eye out in every little hole and corner and the huge enemies will make you run and hide to safety giving that chasing sensation. In terms of enemy variety it’s a pretty nice selection going from generic army thugs and ninjas to energy shooting aliens, grunts that fire a barrage of homing “bees” to you and even vehicles and artillery strikes.\n\nEvery gun in here has its purpose, you want to explode a few barrels but not waste precious ammo? Use the normal gun. Want to see your enemies go up in pieces with some traps? Place some remote charges here and there and then cover the door ways in optic mines. A huge firefight got you trapped in a corner? Well thanks to a grenade barrel in your assault rifle you can noobtube your way out of trouble. But wait, massive ordinance is being deployed on poor little you? Well those huge aliens, tanks and helicopters won’t expect a guided missile on their face, or will they? In that case they should be no match for a charged radioactive shot or maybe your Gluon Hyper Beam that can rival the most legendary of Pokémon.\nIf all fails, nothing says DIE like a crowbar to the face.\n\nThere’s not much to say about the environments they are quite varied and include even ice parts and water parts where you will have to face the terrors of the deep with your “water usable” weapons only. Basically you go through offices, warehouses, factories, sewers a bit of desert canyon and at last the mysterious and bizarre Xen where everything came out of Gabe Newell’s fever dreams and rules of gravity allow you to be fabulous.\n\nTL;DR: You should play this, see how old things are done right  and explode the microwave casserole.  \n","timestamp_created":1403366101,"timestamp_updated":1403366101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10618872","author":{"steamid":"76561198077309207","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":127,"playtime_forever":3893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":506,"last_played":1598545019},"language":"brazilian","review":"Isso que é jogo porraaaaaaa","timestamp_created":1403364506,"timestamp_updated":1403364506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10612982","author":{"steamid":"76561198026641932","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":629,"last_played":1389202325},"language":"russian","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1403355548,"timestamp_updated":1403355548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10610543","author":{"steamid":"76561198102286996","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":369,"last_played":1618247114},"language":"czech","review":"jj","timestamp_created":1403351413,"timestamp_updated":1403351413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10610234","author":{"steamid":"76561198068332248","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":491,"last_played":1653831138},"language":"english","review":"all I can say is: truly art!","timestamp_created":1403350881,"timestamp_updated":1403350881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10607229","author":{"steamid":"76561198141424548","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":59,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1404631729},"language":"english","review":"supa dupa awesome","timestamp_created":1403346018,"timestamp_updated":1403346018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10599851","author":{"steamid":"76561197999296780","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":92,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1584573311},"language":"english","review":"the og","timestamp_created":1403333688,"timestamp_updated":1403333688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10599230","author":{"steamid":"76561198027944811","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1848,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1592,"last_played":1403437675},"language":"english","review":"A must Play game.

While the graphics haven't aged particularly well, you can tell they were good for their time. The story is compelling too, and it gets even better with the sequel. Overall, I really recommend this (and the other games in the series) to anyone who likes FPS or sci-fi games.","timestamp_created":1403326783,"timestamp_updated":1403326783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10594449","author":{"steamid":"76561198095517900","num_games_owned":395,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":405,"last_played":1414423155},"language":"english","review":"It's from 1998 and it's still better than Call of Duty.\n\nPS: I have never played Call of Duty.","timestamp_created":1403321347,"timestamp_updated":1412038207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1277,"votes_funny":21,"weighted_vote_score":"0.847843706607818604","comment_count":39,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10593604","author":{"steamid":"76561198133953787","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2249,"last_played":1435363419},"language":"english","review":"This game was was amazing it gave me a good sense of suspense and it was very challenging on hard at least and it was also quite a long game so you will definitely be satisfied with this purchase.
