Это нечто! Такого удовольствия от самой игры и прохождения этой игры я получаю очень редко. Я прошел много игр, и некоторые из них были весьма неплохими, но все это не то, не было в них \"вау\", или \"ох\". Обычно доходишь до конца и про игру забываешь. А BioShock: Infinite не такая игра. Чем дальше проходишь, тем больше не хочешь появления финала. Да и начало самой игры – необъяснимое явление. \"Немая сцена\" - вот ты появляешься в красочном городе Колумбия, то тут, то там бегают дети, гуляют молодые пары, играет музыка, проводится веселая ярмарка, и тут же – бах! И ты начинает кромсать полицейских и тебя объявляют убийцей и все начинают на тебя охоту. Ситуация в игре меняется так быстро, что не совсем понимаешь, что тут происходит. И так, до конца самой игры. Игрок всегда, повторюсь, всегда на шаг позади от разворачивающегося сюжета. Вроде вот оно – понимание сюжета, смысла игры, ан нет, всегда происходит что-то резкое, необычное, из-за чего меняется само восприятие сюжета. Удивительное свойство, подвластное только ограниченному числу игр. Тем не менее, если говорить конкретно об игре, то: \n1. Удивительный дизайн уровней. На максимальных настройках графики – выглядит все просто отлично. Правда, реалистичности от графики ждать не стоит, все-таки стиль игры немного другой.\n2. Сюжет в игре просто превосходный. К слову, на нем и держится вся игра, но это не недостаток, а отличительное свойство, поскольку, редко можно встретить игру, где хорошо продуманный сюжет и где умудряются этот продуманный сюжет планомерно подавать, да так, что интересно играть.\n3. Игровой процесс. В основном, придется ходить вместе с Элизабет, которая не является тяжелой ношей и занозой в одном месте у игрока. Без нее, вообще толком никуда не придешь. Во-первых, она умеет вскрывать замки, что дает возможность поизучать какой-нибудь магазин или дом, где обязательно будут деньги, различные припасы, оружие, эликсиры со сверхспособностями или одежда. Во-вторых, она неплохой криптограф, она умеет ломать чужие шифры, что дает возможность найти какую-нибудь секретную локацию, где будет лежать что-нибудь интересное. Но на этом способности Элизабет не заканчиваются. Во время боя, она будет искать патроны, аптечки и прочие полезные вещи для главного героя. Очень часто приносит деньги, в разном количестве. Иногда, из другого мира, может принести в реальность различные элементы: укрытия, ящики с оружием, автоматические турели, приманки и все тому подобное. Апгрейд оружия не убрали, производится он за деньги в определенном торговом автомате, правда на внешний вид апгрейд никак не влияет, что не очень хорошо, кстати. У ГГ так же есть сверхспособности (превращать людей или роботов в союзников, навлекать на врагов кровожадных воронов, кидать в противников огненными шарами, стрелять молнией, поднимать врагов в воздух, или останавливать пули, как Нео, можно даже таранить цели, или поливать всех водой). Это дело тоже можно апгрейдить, тоже за деньги и тоже в специальных торговых аппаратах. Апгрейд правда не особо полезный, обычно только увеличивается длительность какой-нибудь способности, или уменьшение затрат \"маны\". Порадовали своим интеллектом враги, всегда стараются обойти ГГ стороной и напасть сзади. Всегда бегают из стороны в сторону и прячутся за укрытием. Чаще всего, нападают в огромном количестве. И пока разбираешься с теми, кто прет \"во весь рост\", другие тебя обходят и нападают сзади. Есть так же система добивания в рукопашном бою, что приводит к отрубанию головы или чему-то подобному. На что Элизабет всегда рапортует: \"фу, мерзость какая\". В игре, так же присутствует одежда, которая приносит какой-нибудь бонус.\n4. Что не понравилось. Таких моментов мало, честно. В основном, это придирки, из серии: стандартные настройки мыши уж больно плохи. Но, если говорить честно, то выпили свободу действий. Вроде как от игрока требуют что-нибудь выбрать, но это ни на что не влияет. Так же, огромные локации, на которых абсолютно нечего искать. . Мест для исследования крайне мало. Так же, почти нет дополнительных заданий, ну, т.е. они есть, но в основном – это \"найти спрятанный сундук\", \"расшифровать настенную запись\". Интересные же задания относятся только к сюжетным.

Этот шедевр цепляет вас за душу, может вы и не понимаете к чему все это приводит, но вас тянет проходить её дальше и дальше, чтобы узнавать все больше и больше. Просто головокружительный сюжет с неожиданными поворотами, не даст вам заснуть, сам геймплей кажется скушен, но это не делает её хуже. Я рекомендую вам эту игру так как рекомендуют книги, фильмы которые обязательные к просмотру / чтению, такое нельзя упускать и надо обязательно прочувствовать это. Моя оценка 10/10 она действительно этого заслуживает, вы поймете когда пройдёте сами.","timestamp_created":1403610656,"timestamp_updated":1403610656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10750458","author":{"steamid":"76561198071609760","num_games_owned":376,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":906,"last_played":1417382682},"language":"english","review":"It is great, but not as good as Bioshock 1 and 2.","timestamp_created":1403609475,"timestamp_updated":1403609475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50199204683303833","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10749732","author":{"steamid":"76561198084353977","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2958,"last_played":1585599566},"language":"french","review":"Excellent jeu, excellents DLC.
