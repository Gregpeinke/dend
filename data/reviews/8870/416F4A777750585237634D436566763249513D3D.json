Pak jsem zahlídl lauch trailer a hra mě zaujala ještě o něco víc... Totální destrukce herních magazínů s hodnocením a metacritics s mimozemským číslem 98...\n\nPrvní plavba:\nHned ze začátku hry, jsem zavzpomínal na předchozí díly a uvědomil jsem si co vlastně hraju, že tohle bude zase mistrovský dílo..hned první hříčky v prvním rozhovoru mě nenechali na holičkách a už jsem se setkal s docela složitou angličtinou, samá slovní hříčka a dvojsmysl, co člověka nutí přemýšlet a to pánové u fps hry je asi jako cikán v práci - neni to žádna narážka, ale moc se to nevidí. :)\nVzhůru do oblak:\nLepší úvod do hry, jsem asi nezažil...kde zase všechno perfektně sedí a funguje..\nPříběh se hned rozjede jako mašina co nejde zastavit a člověk s otevřenou hubou kouká co se děje..město žije na každým kroku a snažil jsem se o nic neošidit, takže jsem procházel každičkou skulinku..Nic nebudu prozrazovat ani říkat, protože příběh je meta na kterou musí každý dosáhnout sám...Jen vám můžu říct, že jakmile se dostanete k první akční pasáži tak se hra rozjede jako nezastavitelná mašina, která se řítí plnou rychlostí ke konci, ano na steamu mam 14hodin a od hry jsem nemohl prostě odejít a těch 14hodin se mi zdálo jako 14minut.. :D\n\nZbraně,hák a ohňostroj:\nVe hře jsou zbraně klasika samopal,brokovnice,pistol, pak je tu hák, kterej už každej ví, že je tu protože je to něco jako HL2 a jeho gravity gun..Porcování z lanovky je prostě boží..\nPak jsou tu tzv Vigory, což jsou v podstatě kouzla, můžete na nepřátele poslat vrány nebo je prostě spalíte,dáte jim trošku elektřiny do těla..sranda je to kombinovat, na to si každý přijde sám co mu bude vyhovovat, vylepšení a nové zbraně,vigory kupujete v automatech..Docela výzva je ajch v módu 1999 dokončit hru bez nakupování v automatech, tak se pochluPte kdo ho má. :-))\nBird,Bird,Bird!\nSakra...koho to napadlo, kdo vymyslel tohohle opeřence si zaslouží oscara! Lepší postavu,příšeru,miláčka,mazlíčka jsem neviděl...Po prvním setkání, které bylo epické,famózní,velkolepé,kulervoucí,držku rozbíjejíci jsem se na opětovné setkání s opeřencem těšil víc a víc a to byl přesně ten moment, kterej si člověk veme do hrobu...od tý chvíle jsem věděl, že to nejde vypnout..nemohl sem přestat...\n\nOstatní aspekty hry:\nTakže abych vás nezdržoval a mohli jste to jít dohnat, tak to zkrátim.\nGrafika: Nádherná stylizace,hra vypadá skvostně..nemůžu si vůbec stěžovat...Engine vyždímanej na max.\nHudba: Epická,Velkolepá,Famózní Songbird song je prostě masterpiece!\nDabing: Perfektní emoce jsem prožíval s bookerem až do konce..uvěřitelnost na 100% tohle se taky jentak nevidí ve hrách..\n- Možnosti volby potěší i když hrajou druhý housle, dobrý zpestření a znovuhratelnost. Hned jak přestanu psát jdu hrát. :)\n- Vyšlo DLC v podobě Burial at Sea, které je rozdělené na 2části, nyní již můžeme hrát první, no já vim, že kdybych jí začal hrát tak se nemůžu dočkat na zbytek, takže si radši počkám, to bych taky nemohl přežít to čekání. :)\n- Ještě jsou skladem CE edice se soškou snad nejhezčího monstra ve hře, neváhejte! Sám jsem si jí hned objednával, po tom co jsem se setkal se songbirdem, tohle prostě musíte mít!\n- Nejchytřejší (možná i nejhezčí :D) společnice ve hře, dokonce i než Alyx z půlky života. :))\n- Ještě zkusim napsat několik bodů proč hrát Infinite, zkusim jich 10:\n1) Příběh\n2) Grafika\n3) Hudba\n4) Propracovanost, kde každej klíč co něco odemyká má svůj důvod, každej střípek něco vysvětluje nebo na něco upozorňuje!!\n5) Ellizabeth věrná společnice\n6) Složitost příběhu,která vás nenechá spát a můžete si každej myslet jak to vlastně bylo a nikdo vám nemůže říct, že ne protože to je síla, už jsou dokonce i konspirační teorie!!\n7) Vigory+zbraně+lanovka!\n8) Songbird!\n9) Songbird!!\n10) Songbird!!!","timestamp_created":1391218801,"timestamp_updated":1391218801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8927944","author":{"steamid":"76561198034737683","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":168,"last_played":1482113210},"language":"spanish","review":"holy turtles","timestamp_created":1391217940,"timestamp_updated":1391217940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8926903","author":{"steamid":"76561198062914088","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":753,"last_played":1389678178},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING GAME.

Прекраснейший сюжет, отличная графика, интересные персонажи. Очень интересно сделан воздушный город, лишний раз я просто бегала не в те стороны, что бы просто посмотреть город. Больше всего мне нравится путаница в сюжете. Все очень сложно, запутано и невероятно интересно. Было бы очень нехорошо не упомянуть об Элизабет, очень милая и умная девушка, не бесполезна, но могли бы ей и побольше способностей добавить, что бы  сильнее влияла на перестрелки и всякие разные стычки с плохими дядями, роботами и турельками.\nОтдельно напишу о DLC - Burial at Sea. Ep. 1.\nМеня очень заинтересовало развитие событий в подводном городе, кроме того, они пофиксили некоторые баги с графикой. И это возвращение к первой части Биошока навеяло воспоминания о том, как я бегала по Восторгу. Кстати, такая Элизабет мне понравилась больше. Ее характер, внешность, манера речи – идеально для меня, но она все так же взламывает замочки и открывает разрывы. Очень надеюсь, что Элизабет станет полезнее во втором эпизоде. \nDLC - Burial at Sea. Ep. 2.\nКак ни странно, я была в глубоком шоке от того, что я увидела в этой части. Это было прекрасно, я играла за Элизабет и мне нужно было работать больше головой нежели расстреливать всех, кто мне не нравится. Даже такая мелочь как взлом замочков мне казалась очень интересным занятием. В общем, дабы не спойлерить, скажу одно - это нужно пройти и не один раз. К тому же, для полной картины обязательно поиграйте в первый Биошок. Немного грустно, что это все кончилось вот так, но это великолепная игра, больше бы таких.\n\nПолный обзор: http://dangermayer.tumblr.com/post/97518166698/bioshock-infinite","timestamp_created":1391201438,"timestamp_updated":1410737921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":46,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.794303655624389648","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8924555","author":{"steamid":"76561197970110990","num_games_owned":643,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":2353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":775,"last_played":1537624811},"language":"french","review":"Les funambules et les amateurs d'escalade vous le diront : quand on évolue entre le ciel et la terre, tout est affaire d'équilibre.

E não coloca todas as cartas na mesa mas te dá ferramentas suficientes pra refletir, pensar sobre o que vê, sobre cada palavra dita, e tirar suas próprias conclusões, principalmente quanto ao final que é sem dúvidas um soco bem dado na cara! Muito voltado pra reflexões acerca da metafísica. Sobre o visual... andar por Columbia me deixou de queixo caído, parece que cada pedacinho foi muito bem pensado e elaborado pra justamente te deixar pasmo. E a trilha sonora então, nem se fala! Na verdade todo o trabalho de som é impecável. Além do mais o jogo é muito fluido, uma jogabilidade muito boa, refinada. Ah, sim! Fiquei muitíssimo bem, obrigada, jogando esse título antes dos primeiros da série.

Даже сразу скажу она оказалась превосходной, несмотря на мои скептические ожидания. До этого знаменательного момента знакомства с игрой, решил, посмотреть на оригинал,[i] первые части данной серии.[/i] Был несказанно разочарован, не знаю то ли старость и дряхлость движка сих игр, то ли заезженность тематики... но игры не впечатлили. \n\n   Поэтому долго не решался на прохождение [u]Infinite[/u], но вот решился, игра просто захватила меня, в хорошем смысле. Вместо унылой картинки старых катакомб, какой-то психушки - нам предстал изумительный красы воздушный город и мир, что сказать... я был впечатлен ! Хоть завязка сего произведения довольна странна, но подача сюжета интересна и местами интригует; хотя вспоминая все те же первые части, можно найти аллюзию на антоганиста и в данной игры. Боевая ситема претерпев незначительный изменения, отошла на второй план, здесь главным становится взаимодействие с окруженим, и различными альтернативами пути... что несколько похоже на [i]Dishonored[/i]. Главная же героиня довольно забавна, при этом прописанные поступки ее довольно интересны... а взаимодействие с ней во время боя хоть и приедается со временем, но не дает наскучить. [b]В этом простом факте и кроется различия между третьей частью и всеми остальными[/b], вместо одинокого скитания по крязным тунелям в батискафе, мы путешествуем с обворожительной напарницей по красивому, но неменее развращенному миру.\n\n   [b]Решил продолжить, так как предыдущая часть была написана после прохождения половины игры. [/b]И скажу что вторая половина постро потрясает и выводит из равновесия. Все эти фишки с альтернативными реальностями, вносят какую-то безбашенность и потрясность всему финалу. Раскрывается вся эта странность с завязкой, просьбый о поиске девушки, странные лодочники...

It's linearity wasn't a bad thing; it had a story to tell and an open world wouldn't have facilitated that process.  Still, it was a shame there was this rich and gorgeous world floating there and the game ended before I felt like I'd really seen everything Columbia had to offer.  \n\nMy one complaint, and one that is entirely my own fault, is that I'd been led to believe that finishing the game opened up a new game mode (1999), and that the story would continue there.  Instead 1999 mode is just the same game with a dash of extra difficulty, and I was sad my adventure with Elizabeth was over.  \n\nOh, also, it annoyed me there was a scene in the trailer that doesn't even remotely happen in the game, which sucked because it was awesome.  :(\n\nAnyway, Bioshock: Infinite deserves all the praise it has received and more.
