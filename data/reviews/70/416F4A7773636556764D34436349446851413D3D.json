It's undoubtedly a great game. It's different from everything I've ever played. I decided to play it on medium difficulty because why not? I am used to playing shooters after all. Hell, it was so frustrating, sometimes. Not because the enemies would be that hard to kill, they were not, but because I got lost and didn't know how to continue and while I was going through all the rooms again to find my way out, I fell down here, lost a bit health there and after some time I couldn't continue without loading an older save to try to play that part again and to be more careful this time.\n\nIn chapter 6, Blast Pit, I totally lost clue about what to do next. I was struggling to motivate myself to keep playing. But then I found those amazing walkthrough videos made by BigMacDavis and he and his love for Half-Life made me want to continue. I really have to recommended them because it helps you, it's fun and very nice to listen to.\n\nAfter chapter 6 I started to love the game more and more. I got several new weapons, also unique ones, which were fun to use and very effective. The use of different weapons for different enemies was very satisfying. Valve did a really good job there.\n\nIf you like sci-fi and shooters and don't care about nicest graphics. If you want action without too many dialogues and if you don't get easily frustrated. Or if you just want to know why this game is so popular, give it a chance.

I have not even played any horror shooters or console games of the 20th Century. (Also, I'm a coward) So I don't really know how to judge Half-Life in terms of the tech of its time, and I was originally skeptical if I would get my moneys worth.\n\nBut I know its a great game. Even on Easy Mode, its a intense and stressful(I dont play it at night, the headcrabs!(also it gave me nightmares)) experience. The atmosphere and enviroment is immersive. I could think Black Mesa is a good place to work, except for its poor layout, in office-ey terms. The enemy A.I is good. Although there's not as much guns as some other games out there, each weapon has its own stragety and abilites for attacking enemy strongholds.\n\nAnd now, I know why this game is a classic.\n\nJust like the description says: Run. Shoot. Think.

Las diferentes situaciones en que te pone, la dificultad general del juego (no es nada fácil), el que este doblado en español (algunos juegos actuales no lo están) y su potencia gráfica (sobre todo respecto a las animaciones faciales).
