Macht sowohl mit Freunden als auch im Singleplayer-Modus Spaß, obwohl die anderen drei Teammitglieder als NPC dann doch ein wenig unfähig sind und man es somit schwerer hat.

There is however still enough of a playerbase for you to jump on at any hour of the day and organize a full group (4 players).\n\nDespite what you may have read, left 4 dead 2 is not exactly the \"same game\" as left 4 dead, there are many differences, such as the assortment of enemies and overall gameplay.\n\nLeft4dead is much more pure and vanilla, it has 4 primary special infected instead of the 8 in left4dead2, no melee weapons and less map event triggers/sidequests.\n\nIt would be accurate to classify Left4dead2 as an updated version of this game, but with that you're losing the simplistic gameplay of the first, for a much more contrived chaotic version of itself.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes:\n\n- This is NOT entirely what I would consider a survival game, it is not team based Resident-Evil, it is an episodic action shooter.\n\n- It is a team based game, while it is possible to operate solo within a map, you're more or less dependant upon those you play with, whether its AI or PC's.\n\n- The graphics and sounds effects are good for when it was released, no complaints there.\n\n- Level layouts are done pretty well, there are always a few bonus areas to explore, you will never find you're stuck wondering where to go or what to do, but because of this the game feels largely linear... I suppose this was the intention of the creators as it is broken down into goal oriented episodes/chapters, as a result this game can start to feel rather repetitive after playing through a particular map a few times.\n\n- The game is never boring, it is constantly throwing enemies at you, and you're constantly rushing to finish the current map, there is very little \"downtime\" other than the starts and ends of each map.\n\n- There are also two different modes of play offered apart from the regular \"movie\" mode. Survival, where you have to survive in a set location for as long as possible while the difficulty increases and Versus mode, where one team takes control of the zombies as the other team works its way through the map.\n\n- There can be a few bugs in the game, such as those regarding players falling off buildings and teammates attempting to rescue them, but largely the game is not full of any bugs that directly affect gameplay.\n\n- Personally I feel both L4D & L4D2 should have more weapons, but you never get bored with what you're given.\n\n- Regular zombies in this game are \"runners\" they're not the classical slow / shuffling Romero zombies, headshots are not required to kill them. In fact these are not \"zombies\" at all, they're infected/mutated humans, so shooting anywhere can result in a kill.\n\n- The amount of zombies/infected is determined largely upon the players movement through the map, there is no significant set amount of zombies within each map, player progress results in map triggers that spawn hordes of infected that rush to the players location. So moving slow, keeping quiet , etc will be of no real benefit if you're trying to avoid detection.\n\n- It has a few additional items one would expect, med kits, pain pills, molotovs, pipe bombs, gas cans and propane tanks...all spread out rather liberally across any map, irregardless of difficulty, although it does significantly change in expert mode.\n\n- The game offers various difficulty levels, the difficulty level does not affect regular zombie health, instead it changes the the DMG they inflict on a player when hit. Special infected on the other hand are given HP & DMG increases. With each increase in difficulty the available additional items, weapons and ammo on a given map will decrease. If you're wanting to play this as a \"survival\" game, setting the difficulty to \"Expert mode\" may offer the play experience you're seeking.\n\n- L4D & L4D2 also seem to have a large map making community, so there will always be something new you can decide to download and play through.\n\n- This series is not ignored by the company Devs, and they don't hesitate to fix problems or show community support.\n\nI would recommend buying L4D/L4D2 as a bundle, if you're interested in playing. If you're seeking community numbers I would not advocate purchasing this game over L4D2, as most L4D players have migrated there.\n\nIf you enjoy team based gameplay and blasting away zombies to the point of nausea, then this is probably the game for you.\n\nThese are well made games that are supported by their company, you will never feel as if you had wasted your money, even if you don't particularily like the game.\n\nEnjoy :)","timestamp_created":1449048714,"timestamp_updated":1449049158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.599052250385284424","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19431205","author":{"steamid":"76561197990784674","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"they claimed this game would have plugins and be THE game and there'd be content for it, etc....\n\nthen they came out with L4D2, and that was like....

Source, оказывается, ещё может поддать жару, да какого! На экране сотня полигональных мертвецов - производительность и не помышляет падать. В развороченном аэропорту разбивается самолет, и восхищение каким-нибудь Unreal Engine 3 отступает на второй план, ведь в воздухе десятки обломков, а к взрыву не придерешься при всем желании. \nКооператив волнующ где-то до двадцатого прохождения. При хорошем интернет-канале и верных друзьях, также обладающих копией игры, на ознакомление с четырьмя способами выжить при зомби-апокалипсисе вряд ли уйдет больше десяти часов. Режиссер удивляет, как может, но из \"Твою ж мать: игра\" Left 4 Dead превращается в эдакий Serious Sam. Тут-то и выезжает самая главная революция, которую очень зря подавали без особой помпы: режим Versus (в нем люди так же проходят кампанию, а зомби - уже от лица других игроков - мешают). Возможность самому поиграть за мертвецов увлекает не на шутку, благо рулить дают не унылой \"массовкой\", а теми, кого инфекция затронула особо драматичным образом.","timestamp_created":1448869374,"timestamp_updated":1448869374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555072546005249023","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19383371","author":{"steamid":"76561198203491480","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":79,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79,"last_played":1449318025},"language":"schinese","review":"经典的游戏，什么也不用多说，赞一个！","timestamp_created":1448867554,"timestamp_updated":1448867554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19379576","author":{"steamid":"76561198044737426","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":51148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1200,"playtime_at_review":16862,"last_played":1660540807},"language":"english","review":" You like shooting zombies and running for your life and using teamwork?

Приятный геймплей,довольно хороший и простой мультиплеер,а стычки с зомби тоже не проходять стороной. Но у всего есть и минусы.Сейчас я напишу все плюсы и иминусы игры:\n+Геймплей делает игру довольно \"приятной на ощип\"\n+Кооператив превосходен\n+Большие и многочисленный карты для игры\n+Графика собственно тоже нормальная\n\n-Очень мало лоби для мультиплеера(лоби steam)\n-Недостаток разнообразия оружия\n-Глупые боты неумеющие стрелять\n\nЯ не прошел всю игру но играл в неё много, и поэтому думаю что моего обзора достаточно. Наверное многие не соглаятся со мной, но кому как. Если вы сомневаетесь в игре и не хотите спешить с покупкой, то посмотрите побольше видеообзоров или поиграйте чуть чуть,а потом если не понравится-то требуйте возврат денег.
