Not so complex puzzles that causes you to stop and think twice before starting a test chamber (i.e puzzle), yet not so tough that it makes you throw your keyboard (or mouse, a laptop is quite heavy) against the wall and, like the Stanley Parable's achievement, go outside and not play the game for 5 years.\n\nThe storyline is quite simple, yet it is beautifully written. You can see GLaDOS in a whole new light (not just the metallic Hal-like psychopath who wants to slaughter you and laugh at your demise) and one can appreciate the extent of Aperture Labs, perhaps even wondering about the ethical conundrums that preludes the whole corporation.\n\nPonder harder as you step into multiplayer and the \"Perpetual Testing Initiative\", a place where you can create your own test chambers and share them with the Steam community! Let your imagination run wild as you test other's test chambers while creating really wacky ones of your own. Do you want an ambush of turrets hiding around the corner, trapping the exit room door? Now you can! Do you want to create a laser grid that frys the test subject when he/she activates the wrong switch? Now you can! The sky is the limit! (Although due to limitations, one can't stack too much stuff into any one test chamber, so that is a challenge in itself!)\n\n9.5/10 indeed.

I feel really bad about the dog. I had a thing for this trapeze chick, once. Her name was Jess, great kisser. Her lips tasted like cookie dough ice cream. I love cookie dough ice cream. Man, Slatkin makes a really great smelling candle. When you live a life like I do, you tend to spoil yourself.","timestamp_created":1383318314,"timestamp_updated":1383318314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7536382","author":{"steamid":"76561198018040552","num_games_owned":403,"num_reviews":222,"playtime_forever":1690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1512,"last_played":1630959058},"language":"english","review":"Nothing more to say about that hasn´t been said already.

The original Portal was a game that had everything it needed and nothing more, and while this made for a tight, filler-free experience from start to finish. it also failed to satisfy many people, who saw the massive potential the mechanics had and demanded more to whet their appetites. This is the game to satisfy those people. Portal 2 takes the original game's concept and runs with it, adding a ton of new ways to sove puzzles and interact with the environment, from light bridges to lasers to three types of gels, each having a unique impact on the surface it coats. While this adds variety and a greater play time, it comes at the cost of adding some flab to the slim as a whistle Portal experience, meaning that some of this game's playtime is wasted on pointless filler, something that could not be said of Portal 1. However, the advantage of this is a much greater sense of scale and ambition, making the game feel more substantial and leaving the player less hungry. It's like choosing between a small portion of a fantastic steak and a medium portion of a fantastic steak that's just a tad overdone. Which one you prefer will depend on whether you want the best experience possible of if you don't want to feel hungry at the end of the night. The story is also top-notch. The principle of more carries over here, as more characters are added and more time is spent developing the world and the characters and the plot. Again, which plot you prefer is down to personal preference, but either way you'll be getting a lot of laughs. Finally, on top of all that, this game has a fantastic co-op mode, which, unlike the single player mode, is short, sweet, and has no filler to get in the way of some of the most brilliant puzzles in the Portal canon. If you can find a friend willing and able to play, this extra alone is worth the price of admission.\n\nScore: 9/10","timestamp_created":1383294397,"timestamp_updated":1505425662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7536057","author":{"steamid":"76561198070614531","num_games_owned":298,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1105,"last_played":1527315485},"language":"english","review":"It's got to be hard to make a sequel to one of the best games ever made, but Valve has done that a few times.
