Mas o que o Portal tem de diferente que fez o sucesso que é agora?\n\nVamos descobrir em mais uma análise!\n\n* A historia começou antes do Portal em si\n\nTudo começou na conceituada Digipen Institute of Technology: um trabalho de conclusão de curso deu origem a um jogo chamado Narbacular Drop. O conceito do jogo é simples: uma princesa incapaz de pular está fugindo de seu calabouço usando habilidades de abrir portais nas paredes. A princesa usa um portal laranja e um azul. Com isso, ela vai abrindo caminho para a liberdade.  O jogo foi lançado e Gabe Newell, fundador da Valve, o descobriu, gostou do conceito, contratou toda a equipe que criou o jogo Narbacular Drop e fez uma proposta: recriar o jogo usando a engine Source, a mesma do Half-Life.\n\nA medida que o jogo foi sendo refeito, mudanças ocorreram: a primeira delas é a narrativa da história, que não era tão interessante. Mexendo ali e aqui, o game Portal começa a tomar corpo da forma que conhecemos, com parte da história sendo contada por meio de mensagens na parede em áreas escondidas.\n\nOutra ideia que foi incorporada foi de uma voz para narrar/treinar como usar os  portais durante as séries de puzzle. Foi usado como teste um programa sintetizador de voz. Dessa forma, foram surgindo as correntes de ideias: e se fosse a voz de um robô com inteligência artificial? E se esse robô tivesse uma personalidade Passiva-Agressiva, estando  de brincadeira com o jogador? Então aí surgiu a GLaDOS, a sarcástica Inteligência Artificial do jogo.\n\nO jogo levou 26 meses para ser concluído e, na metade do ano de 2006, o jogo foi vendido na coletânea Orange Box, que continha, além de Portal, os jogos Half-Life 2 e Team Fortress 2. Também em 2007 levou mais de 30 prêmios “Jogo do Ano” em diversas organizações.\n\nA trilha sonora tem algumas músicas que servem para enfatizar as partes dramáticas do jogo. Entretanto, a maior parte dele possui apenas efeitos sonoros dos equipamentos e cenário e comentários da GLaDOS. Outro destaque é a música de encerramento: “Still Alive”, que viralizou tanto quanto o Companion Cube, um objeto que você deve carregar em uma das fases.\n\n* O Portal está pronto\n\nO gameplay é bastante simples, bem semelhante ao de FPS atuais, com a seguinte diferença: botão esquerdo do mouse abre um portal azul, enquanto o botão direito abre um portal laranja. Portais podem ser colocados em qualquer superfície não metalizada. Quando o jogador atravessa o portal, a inércia do jogador é mantida. Isso permite que eu possa abrir um portal no fundo de um buraco e aproveitar a velocidade ganha na queda para ser arremessado para alcançar lugares mais altos. Por ser um Puzzle que envolve a física, não preciso dizer o quanto ela foi bem implementada.\nA narrativa do jogo é contada de duas formas: a primeira pela própria GLaDOS que, conforme vai passando as fases, ela vai revelando as suas verdadeiras intenções. A segunda forma é contada por meio de mensagens deixadas pela parede, geralmente em lugares secretos longe das câmeras  da GLaDOS.\n\nPoucos são os defeitos do jogo. Um deles é que relativamente ele é rápido de fechar, embora os desafios de Time Trial dão um objetivo interessante a mais. Para quem jogou Portal 2, viu que existem diversas formas de aproveitar o mecanismo do jogo, mas, para um game inicial, ele foi bem desenvolvido.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nPontos Fortes\n_______________________________________________\n\n\n* Conceito de jogo diferente do que está no mercado;\n\n* Boa narrativa, sem precisar parar o jogo para entender a história;\n\n* ”Still Alive” é uma música obrigatória para um repertório gamer;\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nPontos Fracos\n_______________________________________________\n\n* Jogo bastante curto.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nConclusão \n_______________________________________________\n\nPortal é um daqueles jogos diferentes, que não se vê por aí. Também possui uma história interessante por trás do desenvolvimento, onde a ideia começa em um trabalho acadêmico e acaba parando na equipe de desenvolvimento da Valve. Apesar de curto, ele é um bom jogo para quem quiser um game de puzzle físico em primeira pessoa.","timestamp_created":1399496377,"timestamp_updated":1434526661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10046290","author":{"steamid":"76561198096150390","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1480579177},"language":"english","review":"To be Honest, this 'game' is not really a game.

You will on occasion breeze through one room only to be stumped by the next. The peaks and troughs in the learning curve help to vary things up and keep the game interesting, plus beating a room that is difficult feels really good, I had a great time figuring out all the levels and how to get from point A to B. \n\nThe story is sparse but I get the feeling that was only to add to the constant isolation you feel whilst traversing the Aperture Science Laboratories. The antagonist GLaDOS, whom is really the main character, is fantastic. She has all the witty comments and snide remarks you could want in an evil AI gone mad.

GlaDoS taunts you throughout the game, and most of the time, it's very funny. other than that, the game does not have much plot, unless the cliffhanger at the end counts, and of course all the half life references. the gameplay is a fun idea based on another game,Narbacular Drop, where the character shoots portals with a gun to avoid death and solve puzzles. the idea does not falter in conceptualization. most of the 19 test chambers you play through, are pretty fun. the game did make me feel stupid at certain moments for not realizing how to solve the puzzle, even though it was so simple. the physics also seem a bit weird at points, and the jump is a bit stilted, but overall i think it's a good game. it's not the best looking game, but it was an early 7th gen game, so i think it can be excused. it is also a very short game, i finished the game in a little over 2 hours, and in subsequent playthroughs, ive beaten it in less than 45 minutes. However, the legnth, is only a problem if you think you are not getting your money's worth. however, even if you happen to be one of these people, no matter the legnth. the extra challenge maps help the game fix this \"problem\", although being ridiculously hard at points. Luckily, ALL of the problems i just mentioned were fixed in portal 2. So in the end, should you buy this? i would definately say yes, and if you have enough money, buy the bundle!","timestamp_created":1399122033,"timestamp_updated":1399122562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10005535","author":{"steamid":"76561198042194858","num_games_owned":1158,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":427,"last_played":1398634987},"language":"spanish","review":"Hasta que jugué a Portal, nunca habría imaginado que jugaría a un juego de puzzles en 1ª persona.

The puzzles become more devious, but the game is much less about living through the puzzles.  It is much more about solving the puzzles, which helps to free a player to think outside the box.\n\nAnd the puzzles from the point of getting the Portal Gun onward all concern physics, spatial awareness and oh yes, a really cool spatial displacement gun. ;)\n\nMany a denizen of the internet will recognize GLADoS, even if they haven't played this game yet.  What many don't fully appreciate, at least to my mind, is how fully the feeling in the game is sculpted by this disembodied voice egging you on, while at the same time insulting you or saying things that frankly wouldn't seem out of place in 2001: A Space Odyssey or some Stephen King novel.  While you may be playing the game and solving the puzzles as Chell, the personality-null protagonist, it's this disturbing combination of Hal and Christine that makes the game so worth-while in narrative terms, especially when the test chambers end and the climax of the game begins.\n\nIf you haven't gotten the game already, you should do so, and play it as soon as possible.  It is in many respects required, not just as a mark of inventive combination of  game play mechanics or narrative driven gaming, but also as a cultural understanding of many references of the internet.  Much like the movie Aliens is a required movie to watch to understand many references on the internet, Portal is a requirement for much the same reasons.","timestamp_created":1398966155,"timestamp_updated":1398966155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9988673","author":{"steamid":"76561198062999946","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1529676276},"language":"japanese","review":"かなり面白かった。ストーリーが奥が深く、のめりこむようにはまりました。steamが初めてという人はこれをプレイするのもいいかもしれませんね。\n\n\nタレットかわいい\n","timestamp_created":1398950313,"timestamp_updated":1398950313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9988624","author":{"steamid":"76561198068375601","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1420231963},"language":"italian","review":"Consiglio l'acquisto, gioco valve,validissimo e a volte complesso,peccato però per la durata,se lo si gioca per 4-5 ore di fila si rischia di finirlo subito.","timestamp_created":1398949915,"timestamp_updated":1398949915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9988547","author":{"steamid":"76561198002388163","num_games_owned":645,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1404042509},"language":"schinese","review":"3.7小时就通关了啊，比预想的短很多，不过值得拥有！！奖励地图比常规难很多，需要多花些时间了~~~","timestamp_created":1398949385,"timestamp_updated":1398949385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9988056","author":{"steamid":"76561198068184778","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1577110605},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un gran juego en el que se pondrán a prueba tus capacidades de concentración y que tiene la dosis perfecta de  complicación para los inexpertos.\nHabiendo completado el 100% de los logros del juego debo de decir que es una experiencia frustrante a la vez que gratificante.

The puzzles are made so you can progressively learn and put together new tecniques, the difficulty progression is linear and overall puzzles itself aren't hard at all, provided you are a human being willing to elaborate about the odds and unusual puzzles(compared to more classic games)... just a bit!\n\nGraphic wise the game still looks fine in 2014. For a feeling, It feels closer to Half Life 2 than Portal 2, and the minimalistic graphic style points more to the mechanics than to the plot (but that's where Portal 2 stands out of course). \n\nAnd Glados humor :) although it's not a defined character as much as in Portal 2, it will still make you smile.","timestamp_created":1398937719,"timestamp_updated":1398937719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9985899","author":{"steamid":"76561198090757534","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1332,"last_played":1399226476},"language":"hungarian","review":"VERY VERY GOOD GAME :D","timestamp_created":1398924519,"timestamp_updated":1398924519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9984774","author":{"steamid":"76561198066389600","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":124,"last_played":1398875295},"language":"schinese","review":"       身为+1党总算趁着放假期间把传送门1给撸完了，前面实验室19关感觉会比较枯燥，当我快完成第19关的时候，神展开配合着出乎意料的的转角和突如其来的音乐出现，之后才是游戏的精髓，所以请耐心坚持到第19关~\n       传送门系列最大的卖点就是剧情和音乐，剧情我就不剧透了，音乐在传送门里面其实出现的不多，但是往往出现的非常关键，比如衬托突如其来的紧张的气氛。\n\nPS：另外游戏里面有很多小细节值得注意，比如出现过“BLACK MESA”（黑山基地）。另外，我还不止一次在游戏里发现了红星炸弹=。=","timestamp_created":1398909556,"timestamp_updated":1398909556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9984002","author":{"steamid":"76561198087796791","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1398901243},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game.

It is pretty easy, and the flexibility of the solutions to each level makes the timed challenge mode more complex. Also, the \"Transmission Recieved\" achievement makes it more challenging for the overachievers. I have most of the radios, but I still have a headache or two to defeat still. The advanced test chambers demand better planning, timing, and nerve, and are relatively challenging... until you beat the first couple of levels. From there on, it gets easy until level 18, which puzzled me for a while on the first time playing through on the NORMAL version. The game is not very long. I wish it was longer. It needs to introduce the turrets earlier, if you ask me. If not, it needs to have more turrets and it needs to make removing them more challenging. Even the upgraded version of the turret seems almost harmless if you have a good rame rate. Even the final boss fight was simple and easy to defeat. I do not think difficulty was the point of this game. I think the main point of it was to just introduce players to the idea, concept, story, and format of the Portal series. All of these four things are artfully designed and are quite entertaining. I think the point of this game is to prepare players for the sequel, Portal 2. I have not played the sequel, so I do not know that for sure. If you're looking for just a fun and quick puzzle game that is relatively easy to master, then this is the game for you. If you are looking for more action in your gameplay, this may not be the game for you. I am one of those people, but I still enjoyed, enjoy, and will enjoy this game for a very long time. I think everyone can and should do the same, if they have the right mindset.","timestamp_created":1398835178,"timestamp_updated":1398835178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9976467","author":{"steamid":"76561198049375612","num_games_owned":359,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":579,"last_played":1406435235},"language":"spanish","review":"buen juego para pensar no solo matar :D","timestamp_created":1398829437,"timestamp_updated":1398829437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9976088","author":{"steamid":"76561198134096620","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":342,"last_played":1403447746},"language":"english","review":"Probably one of my all time favorites","timestamp_created":1398825051,"timestamp_updated":1398825051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9975919","author":{"steamid":"76561198134325596","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":358,"last_played":1480021607},"language":"english","review":"Great game.
