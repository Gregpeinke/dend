\n第一关到第十关，不说了。\n \n第十一关，先下到下层，按按钮，到对面去，透过玻璃看到黄门开在接收器对面时就在球的落点开蓝门。拿枪过关。\n \n第十二关到十四关，很简单。\n \n第十五关，跳不过去的离子墙，利用旁边房间的小坑的高度差起跳。\n反向移动的移动平台，在折角通道里运动，利用传送枪跳上正在转角的平台，向下一个直角射一个门。如此类推。\n最后一个房间，先在两个延时按钮间建立传送关系，按下按钮后引导能量球进入接收器，过关。\n \n第十六关，搞定机器人。\n \n第十七关，同伴方块。\n先拿着方块挡能量球。跑过长廊。在一个能量球的落点开黄门，在斜面上开蓝门，打开1号接收器。拿着方块进入2号接收器的房间，一统乱弹，2号启动。\n把方块放到3号接收器房间最里面的按钮上，回到能量球通道，在能量球落点开黄门，回到3号接收器房间，站在按钮上，在对面的板子上开蓝门，躲开能量球，迅速跳上按钮，开启3号。拿上方块，毁了它，过关。\n \n第十八关，\n第一步，传送进标记有1234的地方，发现出口的按钮需要方块。\n第二步，按下小按钮，在有机器人的房间里开一个门，传送进去。利用能量球干掉机器人（看机器人瞄准的点和能量球的落点）。\n第三步，在接受器对面的板子上开黄门，能量球的落点开蓝门，等球通过了迅速在小按钮的对面和自己就近的地方建立传送去按按钮，打开移动平台。\n第四步，做移动平台到对面，跳到下层，在里面的板子上开蓝门，然后，存盘。接下开动作要连贯，按下按钮（14秒延时），在对面反转的斜面上开黄门，迅速穿过，接着从进来房间的路出去，跳下平台，获得足够速度开蓝门，从黄门飞出，飞到上层。拿方快。传送到对面，过关。\n下一个房间，利用高度差连跳。过关。\n \n第十九关，逃生。\n打开移动平台。\n利用传送门穿过障碍，最后一个障碍，因为它的面积较小，你可以从它旁边的缝隙看到对面的墙，在那里开门，在障碍的这一边开另一个，在平台移动到一半时跳过去。\nGLADOS要杀人了，在火场对面墙上开门，身边火焰上的墙开另一个。再利用高度差飞跃。\n在一处有水的场景，先飞跃到中心的走廊上，到隔壁屋，利用高度差，飞跃上二层的铁走廊，跳进破口的管子。\n寻找能够开门的地方，一路逃亡。\n在一处头顶都是大柱子“对对碰”的场景，跳上最高层的柱子，会看到外面的地面，开个门马上跳下去，最高层不安全。\n跳上管子走。\n下个场景是三个机器人，干掉它们。其中一个机器人的头顶有地方可以射击，那就是出口。\n继续干掉机器人。从二层一个小洞跳下去，干掉机器人，循环跳上对面的走廊。\n来到办公区，诱导飞弹机器人打破玻璃，在它旁边墙上开个黄门，诱导它打破玻璃和打破管子，拿到方块，进风道。\n透过扇叶射击墙壁，传送过去，继续走。来到下水道，上去，来到满是机器人的大厅。\n一个个干掉。利用斜板跳到高处的通道，解决掉两个从天而降的机器人，继续利用自己和大厅地面的高度差往上跳。又到了办公区，遇到GLADOS。\n \nBOSS战：\n解释一下场景：GLADOS身上有三个模块（就是球，像个眼睛似的），打掉它们并且毁掉就过关。毁掉它们的方法是扔进焚化炉，焚化炉的开关在那间小黑屋里，开关只有几秒的延时。GLADOS下方有个飞弹机器人。\n在焚化炉右侧墙壁的高处开黄门，站在焚化炉左侧，诱导飞弹打GLADOS，每打掉一个模块，就要去捡起来。利用传送门快速按按钮，扔模块。\n第一个模块在焚化炉右侧的管子上，用传送门就能拿到。第二个模块在GLADOS高处的透明台子上，里用循环跳去拿，第三个在半空飘着，还是利用循环跳去拿，住抓紧时间，过关很容易的。\n\n建议自己先玩最好，实在不行再看攻略。","timestamp_created":1591365831,"timestamp_updated":1591365831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600203335285186768","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70328815","author":{"steamid":"76561198866591060","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":233,"last_played":1617397557},"language":"english","review":"good

Sabía que era un buen juego y que iba de resolver puzzles utilizando portales, lo tenía hace tiempo en mi biblioteca junto con su secuela y no les había dado una oportunidad previamente. Menos mal he decidido jugarlo antes de que pase aún más tiempo...\n\nEs un juego corto, me lo pasé en 4 horas sin tantas prisas (No es algo malo, lo hace rejugable). Eres una sujeto de pruebas llamada Chell, se desconoce bastante de su pasado (tampoco habla) y de cómo terminó dentro de las instalaciones de Aperture Science. Desde el principio se percibe una soledad apabullante, todos los entornos son cerrados [spoiler](de hecho el juego es muy lineal, pero eso no impide que existan soluciones creativas y variadas a los puzzles)[/spoiler] , de concreto y acero principalmente y tiene un toque futurista. Durante los niveles o pruebas nos guía [i]GLaDOS[/i], una inteligencia artificial de lo más sarcástica pero aun así te encariñas con ella... y con cualquier objeto inanimado que te encuentres dada la naturaleza de la situación. La banda sonora juega un papel muy importante haciéndonos sentir aún más desolados. \n\nEl juego puede llegar a ser muy difícil y desafiante, especialmente si quieres todos los logros. Tiene además un trasfondo oscuro y rodeado de misterio, juega con nuestras mentes en diversos momentos. Las instalaciones en sí parecen interminables y laberínticas, uno solo quiere culminar las pruebas y largarse de ese lugar tan lúgubre lo antes posible, los de VALVE lo han hecho muy bien. \n\nRecomiendo jugarlo, vivir la experiencia... merece la pena.
