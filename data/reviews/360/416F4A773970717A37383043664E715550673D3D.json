Приходиться стрелять по сторонам чтобы привлечь к себе внимание дабы тебя убили, тем самым даровав милость.\n- Лифты на второй этаж часто глючат. Не всегда удается с первой попытки подняться наверх. Более того, иногда при использовании лифта бьешся головой об невидимую текстуру, тем самым подняться наверх не предоставляется возможным.\n- При использовании оружия \"раскрутки\" (gauss) для длинных прыжков часто выносит за пределы карты откуда открывается незабываемый вид через прозрачные и искаженные текстуры.\n- Дверь в тайник на crossfire'e часто заклинивается. Как результат - отсутствие доступа к аптечкам, брони и арбалету.\n\nИ отдельно несколько слов об оружии:\n\n- Подствольный гранатомёт у оружие mp5 имеет неоправданно высокий радиус поражения. Даже если вы особо не прицеливаясь выстрелили во врага, высокий шанс что его заденет. А его у него мало хелс-поинтов то скорее всего даже убьете.\n- Взрывчатка с пультом дистанционного управления (ранцевый заряд) часто заглючивает. Не всегда можно бросить заряд так же быстро, как и должно быть по задумке (по крайней мере, в хл1 он работает нормально)\n- Жуки. Та же ситуация как и с предыдущим пунктом. При выборе выборе жуков и нажатии кнопки мыши часто не срабатывает. Приходится жать повторно, надеясь что враг не убьет тебя быстрее чем ты его.\n- SPAS-12 (дробовик). Урон по врагу существенно и неоправданно занижен. Стреляя левой мышкой по врагу, даже если он не далеко, вы вряд ли убьете его даже с 4х выстрелов. (если у него полное ХП).\n\nИ это не полный список. Я фан дезмач версии халфа еще со времен оригинального хл1. И я провёл более десяти лет играя в мультиплеер оригинальной версии игры. Я категорически не советую вам играть в Half-Life Deathmatch: Source. Возможно, вы теперь понимаете почему сервера этой игры пустые. Игра сырая, и баганая. Если очень нравится мультиплеер, играйте в оригинал. Он стабильный и очнь играбельный.\n\nИтог: 10 грустных Фримэнов из 10.","timestamp_created":1448657633,"timestamp_updated":1448657633,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489051073789596558","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19286312","author":{"steamid":"76561198148971237","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":39,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31,"last_played":1467699621},"language":"russian","review":"Ну что тут скажешь?

Здесь, конечно, есть свои плюсы, такие как обновленый движок и графика, но минусов больше чем плюсов, и поэтому я не могу порекомендовать эту игру.
