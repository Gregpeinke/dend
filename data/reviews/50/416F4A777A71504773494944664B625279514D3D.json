It was great, the way it expanded the half life universe was really good, new weapons, new enemies and how you could see the events of Half-Life unfold from the eyes of the enemies. \n\nRecently I found the original big box for the game and it reminded me of the fun I had. I wanted to replay it, but upon picking up the box i felt some really strange [b]grease[/b] on my fingers. The box was fully covered with this [b]grease[/b]! It was strange, because you would feel like that grease would belong on some very old [b]gears[/b] and not on a [b]box[/b]. The whole thing also smelt like some fat [b]software[/b] engineer!\n\nLuckily steam has this version digitally so I don't need to touch all this [b]grease[/b]. And the game is still as good as in 1999! If you played Half-Life you should play this too! Just don't buy it boxxed from some stranger with a name like [b]Randy[/b] or something along that from craiglist, and use the digital version instead :)))","timestamp_created":1659520058,"timestamp_updated":1659520189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119976193","author":{"steamid":"76561198882549301","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":312,"playtime_at_review":290,"last_played":1659903413},"language":"latam","review":"muy piola, necesita esa secuela","timestamp_created":1659504324,"timestamp_updated":1659504324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119966316","author":{"steamid":"76561198258896846","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":26,"playtime_at_review":297,"last_played":1659937109},"language":"english","review":"a must have if youve completed half-life","timestamp_created":1659486412,"timestamp_updated":1659486412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzqPGsIIDfKbRyQM="}
