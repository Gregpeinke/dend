The gameplay is brilliant, the level design is superb, and the two characters are well crafted, Chell (yourself), and GLaDOS.

Buy the Portal bundle, play both games, and enjoy the thrilling ride of the Portal series.","timestamp_created":1432373374,"timestamp_updated":1432373374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15959775","author":{"steamid":"76561198139432911","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1432956721},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would die again","timestamp_created":1432353378,"timestamp_updated":1432353378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15959186","author":{"steamid":"76561198168728803","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":100,"playtime_forever":1493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1355,"last_played":1544392487},"language":"english","review":"This game is great!
