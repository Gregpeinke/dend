I was skeptical of its quality before I played it. I finally got it during the Steam Summer Sale 2017 in the Valve Classic Collection. I first booted up Half-Life: Source. I got to Blast Pit before switching to GoldSrc Half-Life upon hearing of a glitch involving rockets and Apache Helicopters that was present in HL:S. The opening sequence on the tram was cool, but I'd still want an option to skip it. I appreciate the slower buildup to action thats present, a contrast to other 90's shooters like DOOM and Quake, both games that I love and play frequently. The gunplay was solid and fun. I really liked the amount of diversity in enemy types that kept fights from getting stale. However, the human enemies were not so fun. The soldiers had perfect aim, high HP, and the actual AI was uber annoying. Thankfully the human enemies are only present in about 50-60% of the game. Your weaponry is a nice blend between returning FPS classics like the shotgun, SMG/Assault Rifle, and pistol, and unique weapons, like the Tau Cannon, Gluon Gun, and the Hivehand. Even the .357 Python is a nice little addition. The level design was very high qualiy in parts of the game, but did suffer in other parts. I give Half-Life a pass in some of its confusing level design because it was made in the 90's. As long as I don't have to use a walkthrough online, the level design isn't too obtuse. I never had to use a walkthrough while playing Half-Life. \n\nDespite all this, despite all my praise and two negative comments, I agree that Half-Life is overrated. I HIGHLY recommend playing this game, but do not go in expecting one of the greatest experiences of your entire gaming career. But perhaps that's just me. Keep your mind open if you buy this game. Don't expect disappointment, like I did, but don't expect a Video Game From The Gods. Instead, expect a high quality First Person Shooter with an immersive setting, no cutscenes, good gunplay and occasionally confusing level design. Also, don't expect a great story or great storytelling. The story is OK, but the storytelling is worse. There really are no characters in the game. Half-Life 2 fixes that and adds actual characters, but I'm talking about Half Life 1. I give Half-Life an 8.5/10. I recommend that anyone who likes First Person Shooters buy this game.\n\nEDIT: I can't believe I left this out, but the last four levels, (The Xen levels) are complete garbage. Everything up to this point is great. Thankfully three of the four Xen levels are short.","timestamp_created":1502281844,"timestamp_updated":1502288925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602867007255554199","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34123648","author":{"steamid":"76561198129624732","num_games_owned":351,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2918,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1469,"last_played":1593720127},"language":"russian","review":"10 убитых зомби из 10","timestamp_created":1502280018,"timestamp_updated":1502280018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34120791","author":{"steamid":"76561198357153235","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1651403074},"language":"english","review":"dont try and mod this version it will break the game, i tried and it it went proper mental\notherwise the normal version of half life is great, intense and quite funny. 8/10","timestamp_created":1502269023,"timestamp_updated":1502269023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34120210","author":{"steamid":"76561198260497433","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":104,"playtime_forever":489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":453,"last_played":1631956188},"language":"koreana","review":"이걸 재미없다고 생각했던 내가 병신이었다","timestamp_created":1502266241,"timestamp_updated":1631954308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34117001","author":{"steamid":"76561198218092588","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":890,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":430,"last_played":1511591388},"language":"english","review":"\"Why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties?\"","timestamp_created":1502249520,"timestamp_updated":1502249520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":81,"votes_funny":71,"weighted_vote_score":"0.826279163360595703","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34116811","author":{"steamid":"76561198107880019","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":142,"last_played":1435667592},"language":"schinese","review":"（通关了起源版，但是对原版还是有好感，所以来原版评论下）\n大概我的岁数还是个位数的时候就接触到了这款游戏，当时只会乱走，黑山基地崩溃后的气氛十分恐怖，因为被猎头蟹吓尿了导致当时没继续玩下去。\n\n剧情令人的情绪起伏拿捏有度，最让我难忘的是开场那一段，后来发现半条命1在当时的游戏中，其构架之大也是FPS游戏数一数二的佼佼者了。","timestamp_created":1502248505,"timestamp_updated":1502248505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566017866134643555","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34112025","author":{"steamid":"76561198290631650","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":128,"last_played":1523016922},"language":"french","review":"*bruits de pieds de biche*","timestamp_created":1502226518,"timestamp_updated":1502226518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34110440","author":{"steamid":"76561198062592923","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5746,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2012,"last_played":1602174529},"language":"english","review":"probably one of the best games i've ever played in my entire life. hl1 is one year older than me, yet its graphics still stand out when you think about how old it is.

Не скажу, что это первый в истории 3D-шутер с осмысленным игровом миром (поскольку в том же, 98-м, году вышел не менее продуманный в этом плане Unreal), но все-таки он стал одним из законодателей моды в своем жанре. Ведь раньше, во всяких «Квейках» и «Дюках», как было? Весь мир жил ради игрока – это никак и не пытались завуалировать. А мир Half-Life будто бы живет сам по себе – есть там игрок или его нет. Безусловно, это только такой хитрый трюк, иллюзия, созданная при помощи различных скриптовых сценок (в сущности, бесхитростных и наивных), а также особого подхода к повествованию. И левелдизайну. \n\nНутро «Черной Мезы» вроде как вполне функционально: тут есть всякие лаборатории (это научно-исследовательский центр таки), очистные сооружения, склады, подсобные помещения, канцелярии – бестолковым нагромождением коридоров и помещений это не назовешь. Комплекс цельный: переходы между картами практически не заметны.

Также в игре нету никаких видеовставок. Все это погружает игрока в игровой процесс. Единственным минусом халфы является её сюжет. История как бы рассказывается, но очень вяло. В целом все неплохо. Мультиплеер также понравился, хотя у него тоже есть минус: практически все серверы пустуют. В общем, half-life заслуживает 10 монтировок из 10.","timestamp_created":1501610388,"timestamp_updated":1501610388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33953824","author":{"steamid":"76561198076938812","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":873,"last_played":1501247074},"language":"german","review":"Half-Life im Steam Sale für 1,50€ gekauft ---> 14 Stunden Spaß mit toller Story.

Помимо того, что это шутер, тут присутствуют элементы хоррора, лично мне, нападение хедкраба в шахте ужасает и пугает, а также резкое нападение огромной и страшной пираньи в воде. Кроме всего этого, стоит отметить некоторые моменты, которые усложняют игру, что дает мотивацию пройти это. И все это мы увидели 19 лет назад, понимаете, 19 лет назад! Таких игр мало или вовсе нету, шедевр рождается всего лишь 1 раз и именно Half-Life получает такую коронацию статуса. \n\nПомимо фантастического сюжета имеется мультиплеер, который не умер, до сих пор играют люди, серверов немного , но они работают и это замечательно.\n\nНе забывайте такие игры, играйте и получайте от них удовольствие.\nТакже, хочется сказать о том, что 10 июля было обновление, где исправили множество багов с вылетом игры, что может не радовать. А теперь пасхалка . 10 число, июль - 7 месяц года =====>>> 10-7=3.
