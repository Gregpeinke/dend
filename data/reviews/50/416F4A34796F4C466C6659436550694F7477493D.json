(can't really review this without making comparisons between the two)  While Blue Shift has good quality level design, polished and is a smooth playthrough (GearBox seemed to take a different approach after a couple years of looking at Opposing Force) however no new content outside of the levels themselves. OF is just the opposite, unbalanced, awkward, simply feels like a bunch of incomplete efforts all thrown together (hey it's content).  However OF introduces new weapons, enemies, squadmates, the infamous Black Ops, and a couple facepalm bosses. The main issue is all this new content is where the flaws with this game shine through.  \n\nThe weapons are terribly unbalanced, and there are simply too many of them.  The shotgun is massively underpowered, takes 3-4 point blank double blasts to take down anything, pretty much the entire clip defeating the whole purpose of ever choosing a shotgun for close quarter combat.  The standard machine gun is the same problem, gotta empty the whole clip to even get a kill.  Whereas the  the laser pointer pistol takes about 2 shots to kill most enemies, near the power of the sniper rifle.  Aside from the laser pistol and sniper rifle, both of which you rarely have ammo for, the Heavy Machine Gun is the only effective, non-explosive weapon in your arsenal.  The Electrical charge alien gun doesn't do enough damage, just another weapon to clutter up the selection.  The version of the BFG has a unique alternate fire with dimensional side effects, though it doesn't really prove helpful, it is quite intriguing.  The Alien Grenade launcher is decent, but still seems to not do as much damage as it should, much like the rocket launcher.  still gotta throw 4+ into the big aliens that you gotta fight over and over in the sewer level near the end.  You can break crates and come across a trove of ammo and you'll know it is only going to get you through a few enemies.  Just feels like you gotta sit there forever either exploiting the flaws of the AI and burning through clip after clip just to kill anything.  You are better off just running past most enemies as it isn't worth the time/health/effort to sit there emptying clip after clip when you can just run and jump, essentially speed run approach to get through areas.  Black Ops can be dealt with in either of these ways as well, although it is often best to hide somewhere while they keep throwing grenades around and eventually blow themselves up.  And of course the squadron AI is atrocious, luckily there is only one sequence where you have to keep one of them alive.\n\nOF should take most about 6 hours to beat on hard mode first try, although gotta consider there will be a lot of autosave reloading until you get a hang of how combat has to be dealt with (those Black Ops hehe, probably the best part of OF). Whereas BS is very short, easily completed on Hard Mode first try in less than 3 hours, forgettable ending, no new enemies or weapons.  OF does bring some new content to the table, although not delivered very well. Honestly I may play through OF again to see if I get a different impression but BS is just a much better quality experience.  I love difficult games (classic ones for sure), which is the main issue with BS, it is not.  While striving to do something new, OF is unbalanced and awkward, left to either run by enemies/exploit bad AI or tediously battle through with the tiny bits of ammo on the extremely inconsistently balanced weapons.  What Blue Shift lacks, OF's attempts to cover that feels like a constant fumble.  Whereas Blue Shift didn't introduce anything new and was very short, it plays much better than OF.  But as I wrote a review for BS before this one I realized that for me BS overall is just going to be forgettable in comparison to the aspirational but massively flawed

It shows what happened to the research facility after Gordan Freeman's story was over.\n\nThis is a wonderful expansion! Half-Life: Opposing Force is even better than the main Half-Life game IMO. Thanks to multiple changes to the gameplay that amount to quality of life improvements. One example is in Half-Life there are some areas that are really dark so the game gives you a flashlight. But the light from the flashlight is just a tiny decal that only lights up a small area making it hard to use effectively. In Opposing Force you have night vision goggles which pretty much fixes that problem. Another stand out example is in the main Half-Life game most of the enemies have projectile weapons that are impossible to doge. In Opposing Force there's new enemies and you can actually doge their projectiles. Turning strafing into a viable tactic most of the time.\n\nBlue Shift felt like the devs just took some assets from the main game and used those to make an expansion without adding any thing new. The tutorial for Blue Shift is basically a recycled version of the tutorial from the main game. But the tutorial in Opposing Force is totally unique with a whole new level where you start out in a marian boot camp. In Blue Shift you got some of the same weapons that Gordan Freeman used in the main game, but nothing new. In Opposing Force there are multiple new guns added to the game and they're actually pretty good. There's a squad system where you can get the other solders to help you fight your way through the facility. Some of the solders will be a special class such as a welder with a blow torch that can cut down some doors to get to optional areas with supplies. As well as a medic that can heal you. In the main game you could get some people to help you fight but you could only have one escort at a time. In Opposing Force you can have three or fore guys with you at once, although the path finding is still awful. There's also this alien grappling hook thing that you can use to grapple on to certain points and most of the trickier platforming sections are centered around using it. I still don't like the platforming but using the grappling hook to get around is still better then the tedious platforming puzzles from Blue Shift.\n\nIf I ever replay Half-Life I can see myself replaying Opposing Force again as well. In some ways its even better than the main game thanks to the quality of life improvements, GG.","timestamp_created":1607244616,"timestamp_updated":1607244616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81709035","author":{"steamid":"76561198876760836","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1607788449},"language":"russian","review":"конечно игра для своего времени даже очень хороша, но сейчас не очень актуальна. \nбежишь, стреляешь, пытаешься понять куда идти и как пройти.\nЕсли вы тогда собираетесь в онлайн, то он 0.","timestamp_created":1607240011,"timestamp_updated":1607240068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81684564","author":{"steamid":"76561198294753180","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":792,"last_played":1588383510},"language":"english","review":"by far the best half life game by far","timestamp_created":1607203601,"timestamp_updated":1607203601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81673363","author":{"steamid":"76561198273371074","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":387,"last_played":1625307566},"language":"english","review":"buy for single player.mp is kinda dead\n","timestamp_created":1607190791,"timestamp_updated":1607190791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81672168","author":{"steamid":"76561198854460786","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":693,"last_played":1609946036},"language":"english","review":"One of the best expansion packs I've ever played","timestamp_created":1607189485,"timestamp_updated":1607189485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81667409","author":{"steamid":"76561198390754687","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":349,"last_played":1607183578},"language":"italian","review":"Parecchio bello, con un level design che per i tempi era ed è tutt'ora eccellente, ma soprattutto parecchio difficile.
