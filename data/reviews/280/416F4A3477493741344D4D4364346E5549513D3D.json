I never played it nor Half Life 2 back in the day, so I am completely unbiased by nostalgia. Both games have intrigued me for years, though, and I saw them together in a Steam sale bundle so decided to pick them up and finally play through them. The original Half Life looks quite dated and is missing many modern FPS creature comforts we have come to take for granted, but still shines thanks to its brilliant & pioneering design.\n\nYes, it was state of the art when it came out and a truly groundbreaking game for its time. But is it fun to play now? When I first fired the game up my initial thought was, “I can’t do this. It’s too old.” The polygon models are harsh, even in Source version. People’s hands look sharp enough to poke your eye out. The sound is downright terrible in some places. Environments are often sparse with low-res textures. It can also be difficult to tell whether or not you are damaging certain enemies.\n\nDespite all that, I took a break and came back to it. I’m happy to say I got hooked shortly afterward. Half Life is made so well, I was able to overlook its technical shortcomings and get immersed in Gordon’s flight from Black Mesa. The pace is frenetic, rarely giving you the chance to catch your breath. It’s a very intelligent shooter, also. There are many hidden areas, multiple paths, clever puzzles, and neat surprise moments along the way. You keep moving almost continuously to the very mysterious ending.\n\nWhich brings me to why I almost gave the title a thumbs down. The ending is deeply unsatisfying. After everything that happened I still only had the vaguest idea of what was going on. I think there was an accident in the lab that led to an alien invasion, with either the gov’t or privately contracted troops trying to destroy the entire facility to cover it up. And then, dude in suit with briefcase in the interdimensional train car. The end.\n\nI have started Half Life 2 and while I love it so far, in terms of story it adds even more confusion to the narrative. Gordon Freeman is one of the most incurious people in the universe, never once pausing to ask anybody, “Hey, WTF is happening!?!?” I’m hoping more light gets shed on the plot as I progress through the sequel. You can only tease people for so long before they get bored.\n\nFrom a pure gameplay standpoint, though, Half Life: Source will not disappoint. If you have never played it and can deal with outdated graphics & sound, go ahead & pick it up. If not, you can skip straight to Half Life 2 without missing a whole lot. In other words, you’ll be just as confused at the beginning of HL2 whether you played through the first game or not.","timestamp_created":1395151732,"timestamp_updated":1395151732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9540974","author":{"steamid":"76561198052310785","num_games_owned":486,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":279,"last_played":1487622918},"language":"russian","review":"ааааааааааааааа!!1","timestamp_created":1395148692,"timestamp_updated":1395148692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485089302062988281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9537525","author":{"steamid":"76561198099447074","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72,"last_played":1588298894},"language":"english","review":"The one that started the Half-life saga!

It seems buggy as heck\n\nI dont really understand, from what Im reading the game was fine when it came out? But now its near completely broken I think. There are glitches EVERYWHERE and other weird going ons. I don't really understand how Valve could have broken so much in this game with updates?\n\nTechnically speaking there are supposed to be very little changes, controls feel like you would expect in Source and are good and accurate when compared to how the old GoldSrc games control today which can take some getting used to but isn't bad. The way everything is rendered and shaders are diffrent, things look a bit more crisp but all models and textures are old. They actually look uglier to me than the standard HL1 non-hd models which I feel are the best to me visually. Ragdolls are added but thats really the only physics addition. Everything else from gibs to med packs uses the old HL1 physics where it simply falls or for gibs bounces and bounces. The water looks nice but does not fit in when everything around it looks cartoony. It ruins the dam scene for me atleast. Also they made some small changes in areas that I wasn't a huge fan of, mostly just looks related stuff and nothing big or something worth whining about. But of all the ports of HL1 I have played, which is only the PS2 and Source port, I like this one less. Atleast the PS2 version was objectively better than the original on PC when it came out in 2001. The orignal was released in '98. The Source port came out in 2004 and has none of the new content found in the PS2 version including the Coop expansion, Half Life Decay. I have not touched the Dreamcast version nor have I ever owned or played the Dreamcast aside from maybe one time at a family friends...maybe..its been probably near a decade since that. I also have not played the Linux or Mac ports but honestly I have no reason to ever want to us Mac OS. Linux is gaining ground though.Also the expansions are not present. Just basic Half Life 1.\n\nPresent in this current version there is a huge problem with hit boxes on tanks, helicopters, and enemies of that type. The Gonarch also seemed to not take damage alot of the time when I was hitting it. Its just iffy and I want to say broken. Also with source some of the design decisions that were taken with Half Life 1 just seem awful. Vorts never missing even though it feels like your moving like Speedy Gonzalez just feels like bs and Xen still sucks. Yeah, Xen always sucks. I hate it so much until you get closer to the end and fight the nihlanth/final boss.\n\nBut Half Life is still half life and its still fun. But this just isn't better in any way than the original aside from a few negligible graphics points. \n\nBlack Mesa Source is what this game should have been, except for the fact that they did change alot of the game and removed some points and added others. This game should have just been Half Life but graphically updated with some small gameplay upgrades. Its just not what it should have been and falls short of the original.","timestamp_created":1393544128,"timestamp_updated":1393625742,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.45814669132232666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9263457","author":{"steamid":"76561197997192720","num_games_owned":615,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1576429718},"language":"english","review":"Graphics better than Cryisis 3\n\nStory line not as good as Call of Duty: Ghost Multiplayer\n\n9/10\n\n1v1 is pretty good in the game too.\nTry it out with a friend.","timestamp_created":1393375133,"timestamp_updated":1393375133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":35,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496215879917144775","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9252127","author":{"steamid":"76561197998418888","num_games_owned":480,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":1149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1149,"last_played":1351926000},"language":"english","review":"I don't know how I racked up 20 hours in this game but hey, I did it, so I must like something in this game.","timestamp_created":1393286538,"timestamp_updated":1393286538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538676619529724121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9221557","author":{"steamid":"76561197983191258","num_games_owned":427,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":622,"last_played":1397931623},"language":"english","review":"I have played the game for about 2 hours now.

They also keep the tone and mood from the first game by including all of the original textures. But some of the sounds (Like the foodsteps) are directly from HL2 witch makes the game sound alot better. And if you're a fan of the HD content the original Half-Life had, they included all of those moddels into this version. Witch makes it look even better.
