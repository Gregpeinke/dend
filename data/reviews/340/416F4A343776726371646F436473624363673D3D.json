Jest to właściwie fragment misji, ponieważ nawet nie cała, i nie wnosi ona nic nowego do całkowitej fabuły gry. Mimo to gra się bardzo przyjemnie i miodnie:-)). Oczywiśće, jak zawsze w Half-Life, trzeba troszeczkę pomyśleć, nie tylko strzelać. Jest to chyba najładniejsza z \"cześci\" Half-Lifa pod względem graficznym. Mam tu na myśl nie tyle jakość grafiki - choć ta jest bardzo dobra, ale piekno lokacji, w której poruszamy się. Po raz kolejny wychodzimy na zewnątrz z mrocznych korytarzy i gramy w pięknym prawosławnym klasztorze nad brzegiem morza. \n\nPodsumowując: polecam zagrać! Trudno to ocenić w punktach, ale gra jest fajna i godna poświęcanei 0,5 godz. czasu. POLECAM !\n\nP.S.

I guess so, If you think 30 minutes or less can satisfy you then go for it.\n\nPlus this game Is free to download when you purchase a copy of HL2.","timestamp_created":1487469437,"timestamp_updated":1487469519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30020710","author":{"steamid":"76561198274936088","num_games_owned":489,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":29,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29,"last_played":1487105698},"language":"russian","review":"Очень было интересно послушать как говорят разработчики Half-life 2 и почитать как делалась игра :)","timestamp_created":1487458785,"timestamp_updated":1487458785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522632360458374023","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47vrcqdoCdsbCcg=="}
