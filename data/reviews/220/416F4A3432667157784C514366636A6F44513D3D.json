The graphics aren't as cutting edge as they were on release but still hold up well, helped by some fantastic art direction and sound design.  The pacing is excellent, always changing things up at just the right time to keep things from getting too samey.

The series that put Valve on the map. Without this title, everyday people would not have access to their endless mods, CSS, TF2, GMod, and many others. For its time, Half Life 2 had a great engine running behind it, and still today the engine has many jaw-dropping capabilities. With impeccable physics, AI, and scale. The plot is deep and rich, if you have played all of the Half Life titles, you have only skimmed the surface. One of the few games that I think could be considered on an art level of a poem. The gameplay is great and plays smooth. Puzzles keep this game requiring wits and intelligence. Scripted sequences and random occurences based out of the engine make gameplay unpredictable at times. As well as the greatest atmosphere I have ever experienced in a game ever. A good try. Pick this up to see how Valve came to us today.","timestamp_created":1327946770,"timestamp_updated":1327946770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4261529","author":{"steamid":"76561198034672038","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2286,"last_played":1452900694},"language":"german","review":"geiles gameplayer, geile story, spannend und mysteriös, was will man mehr. :) wann kommt endich episode 3 oder half life 3 raus?","timestamp_created":1327858713,"timestamp_updated":1327858713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2660534","author":{"steamid":"76561198010660168","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1101,"last_played":1585481431},"language":"english","review":"Kdo tuto hru nehrál tak snad ani neexistuje :D .
