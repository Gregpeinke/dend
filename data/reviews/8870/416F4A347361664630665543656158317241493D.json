The unique, story-centric shooter presents a campaign that is not only challenging and full of entertaining collectibles, but also confounding and awe-inspiring in its narrative. I haven't much bad to say about the game, except for the impression that it might leave you on the line in terms of comprehension of the plot, maybe even intentionally so, to make the writers themselves seem more mysterious. \nBesides this, the combat is highly enjoyable and merits repetition, I am fond of the Clash In the Clouds expansion particularly because it it gives you plenty of time to explore the combat mechanics yet is not afraid to challenge you and kill you outright. Ken Levine and Shawn Robertson undoubtedly surpass any realistic expectation levied against them in lou of Bioshock with this piece, its brings the game play for fans familiar to the series to much bigger and better heights with implementations such as the sky-line, the rechargeable shield and Elizabeth's \"tears\" and items that allow you to keep fighting when you would have normally died. The Burial At Sea expansions are also a an engaging story in addition to the excellent writing in Infinite and gives the players a return to Rapture, something that long time fans like myself I'm sure have been hoping for. \nI look forward to whatever Ghost Story Games has in store for us in the future, thank them for this masterclass in addictive game creation and encourage anyone who is a fan of Halo, Bioshock or similar shooters to give this a spin.","timestamp_created":1605010424,"timestamp_updated":1648946587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496790528297424316","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79044104","author":{"steamid":"76561198204927100","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1605167803},"language":"english","review":"Best in the series when nostalgia isn't factored in.

Proprio quest'ultima si presta ad essere il punto focale del gioco, ben disegnata e con tante piccole chicche narrative. Il gameplay generale lascia un pò a desiderare, il sistema di combattimento è quello tipico di uno sparatutto, poche armi e poca possibilità di personalizzarle, accanto a queste ci saranno però i vari Vigor che daranno un pò di enfasi ai combattimenti. La grafica cartoonesca è gradevole nonostante si tratti di un gioco ormai datato.

The gameplay is very responsive and maybe not very tough on the normal difficulty but Elizabeth is the heart and soul of the gameplay. You truly end up caring about both Booker and Elizabeth.

One is endless horde mode and other challenge modes to climb on the leaderboards where the main focus is map design and gameplay!\n\nThe other two DLC's are story-based gameplay that loops around the first Bioshock game as events take place before the game! The story choices are debatable, some may like it and some may not! I didn't like it, due to many loopholes. I like the new stealthy gameplay choices in 2nd episode playing as Elizabeth without powers, while the 1st episode plays similar to the base game but with limited ammo, so that's a plus too.\n\nOverall, I'll like to conclude that this game is a must-play for its strong mindgasmic story and enjoyable gameplay!","timestamp_created":1604904833,"timestamp_updated":1604904833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583597719669342041","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78977420","author":{"steamid":"76561199052550556","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":1005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1005,"last_played":1596592101},"language":"english","review":"sky racists","timestamp_created":1604891885,"timestamp_updated":1604891885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78977114","author":{"steamid":"76561198394549264","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1397,"last_played":1632901441},"language":"russian","review":"Игра невероятная, жаль, что всего одна концовка","timestamp_created":1604891272,"timestamp_updated":1604891272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78974833","author":{"steamid":"76561198996559520","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":826,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1607305546},"language":"spanish","review":"Ufff!

the best game I have ever played (at the time of this review).\n\nThe narrative of Bioshock Infinite is incredible. A complex story that holds you from beginning to end, nothing about it is predictable and it baffles you. The game has no cutscenes, everything is played in the air during the gameplay and it is necessary that the player is really inside the game, paying attention to every detail because if you are distracted for a moment it is almost certain to lose the thread. A lot is explained through voxophones that are scattered on the map, in lines from the npcs of Columbia, in things that can certainly go unnoticed, so be on the whole game to not miss anything because the story is beautiful and fantastic. And it is almost certain that you will finish it more than once to understand the story well or for pure pleasure.\n\nThe gameplay is very good. It matches very well with the game and the map, it is easy to play and very enjoyable.\n\nInfinite's scenery is stunning. The game is set in Columbia, a floating city and unlike anything you've ever seen. At each place you see something different, something that conveys a message to you, NPCs with excellent AI talking about something, it's really fantastic.\n\nThe soundtrack is beautiful. It fits perfectly with the moments of the game and in several moments you are faced with songs from the time when Infinite (1912) takes place. In addition to having original compositions of the time, there are \"re-recordings\" of newer songs to make them look \"older\".\n\nThis game is a great example that a complete masterpiece can exist, incredible characters, remarkable story, extremely fun gameplay and a very interesting and well developed world, we explored this universe by controlling Booker DeWitt in the company of the incredible Elizabeth (BEST COMPANION OF THE GAMES), we explored great Columbia, one of the best backgrounds for a game, a seemingly perfect city more than revealed by the height of human rot, where inequality is explicit, racism is practiced without any punishment and religious fanaticism is intrinsic to the population , where a profiteer and villain of the story Zachary Comstock, takes advantage of blind faith to call himself a prophet. With one of the best plots if not the best in the history of video games, Bioshock infinite rewards you with a great experience worthy of the Bioshock series, with the right to a great plot twist in history, which will make you think and play again for a total understanding, hardly you will forget this universe.\n\n\"A COMPLETE AND DELICIOUS MASTERPIECE TO EXPERIENCE\" 10/10 - My favorite game of life!","timestamp_created":1604786919,"timestamp_updated":1604786919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78905348","author":{"steamid":"76561198804149220","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":6739,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6700,"last_played":1618337317},"language":"english","review":"[h1]Infinitely Fantastic [/h1] \n\nDiehard Bioshock fans complain about this game, and many people claim that the story makes no sense, but it really doesn’t deserve the hate it gets.

I really did not have any fun with Bioshock Infinite…\n\nWhy that?\n\nI loved the graphics of Bioshock, the setting, the omnipresence of water, risk of floods, varied special powers and weapons. Interaction with the world and varied enemies. You had to think, you had to use finesse to go though the levels. You had choices in the way of doing things, you had choice amongst alternate routes.\n\nThere is none of that in Bioshock Infinite: The setting in flying cities is much less believable and give way fewer interesting levels: If you don’t look out of the window, you could think you are in a normal town! I did not like the art style either (but this is personal). Weapons are all the same, simply different names, models, and rate of fire. I would rather have 4 vastly different and very well-designed weapons than 10 boring ones.\n\nIn Bioshock Infinite you can just blast thought the levels, killing everyone via brute force, or simple using the same special power over and over. There are no alternate routes, no real secrets. And there is a check-point system which is a pain in the ass for a PC game (what if you had to leave and need to turn off your computer? Seriously?)\n\nYou know the irony? I liked the DLC “Burial at Sea”! How that? Because it makes you goes back to Bioshock 1 world in a nicely setup adventure. That confirmed the feeling I had about Infinite: This is not a good game after all...\n\nJust skip it and play Bioshock 1 & 2 instead.
