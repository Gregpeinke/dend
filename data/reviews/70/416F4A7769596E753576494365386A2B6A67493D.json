Es por lo mismo que muchos jugadores le tienen un aprecio incondicional, incluyéndome. Pero resaltar un juego sólo por el estudio detrás de su desarrollo es injusto y poco práctico, así que a continuación detallaré mis impresiones inmediatamente después de que finalicé este título.\n\nDebo reconocer que Half-Life está muy adelantado para su época (año 1998), en gran parte gracias al galardonado motor gráfico Source, propiedad de Valve. La duración del juego es meramente subjetiva y depende de la habilidad del propio jugador. En mi caso, me tomó 13.3 horas terminarlo en dificultad normal (los First Person Shooter no son lo mío), lo cual es una cantidad de horas razonables (a mi parecer) en un juego de su tipo.\n\nLa Inteligencia Artificial del juego no está muy bien desarrollada, hasta los zombies de la saga de Left 4 Dead presentan mejores respuestas que los enemigos que encontraremos en Half-Life, pero, esto es algo que perdono por la época en que fue publicado.\n\nEl apartado gráfico del juego es una nota alta totalmente. De nuevo, considerando la época en que el título fue publicado, tengo que reconocer que el diseño de los escenarios y diferentes espacios del juego es nítido, junto a una paleta de colores acorde.\n\nLa historia, sin embargo, es lo que más me decepcionó del juego. No sólo quise jugar a Half-Life por ser obra de Valve (a quienes les debo mucho por el simple hecho de haber creado Steam), sino porque entre la comunidad gamer y mi circulo de amigos cercanos siempre he leído y escuchado que Half-Life es una obra maestra. Ya sea por su motor gráfico, la acción, y la historia. Sinceramente, la aventura de Gordon Freeman me pareció a ratos aburrida, no porque estuviera mal narrada o hecha con desdén, sino porque es inexistente. Hay muchas áreas o niveles del juego en el que no existe mayor profundización de la historia, ni siquiera diálogos. Simplemente somos un científico que debe disparar a todo lo que se le mueva en frente, y eso a ratos, aburre.\n\nEn síntesis, recomiendo este juego totalmente. Es parte de la historia de los video juegos (para bien), su precio es bastante bajo (en ofertas de temporada es literalmente un regalo), la cantidad de horas que ofrece son acordes a lo que espero de un First Person Shooter, su banda sonora es reducida pero de buena calidad (de aquí salió el icónico tema de Valve, utilizado en la mayoría de las intros de sus títulos), y finalmente, se encuentra totalmente doblado al Español (aunque es el de España, se agradece).","timestamp_created":1592803341,"timestamp_updated":1592803341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71159898","author":{"steamid":"76561199050929654","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":872,"last_played":1624325081},"language":"russian","review":"поцаны вопще ребята","timestamp_created":1592800917,"timestamp_updated":1592800917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71152465","author":{"steamid":"76561198854361250","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1636845133},"language":"english","review":"It has zombie","timestamp_created":1592784517,"timestamp_updated":1592784517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71151349","author":{"steamid":"76561198102442688","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":3365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":3229,"last_played":1660496976},"language":"english","review":"run, think, shoot, live","timestamp_created":1592782040,"timestamp_updated":1592782040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71144742","author":{"steamid":"76561198145321174","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":933,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":933,"last_played":1578453686},"language":"english","review":"I've played Half-Life just recently, after all the HL3 meimeis and HL2 comments expressing the masterfulness of it's very design.

Konečne dohral Half-Life 1. Musím povedať, že som z hry poriadne frustrovaný (hlavne kvôli poslednej kapitole), a tak som ju musel dohrať v podobe remaku Black Mesa. Posledná kapitola XEN je vrcholom zlého level dizajnu spojeným s hnusným vizuálom a generickými BOSS-FIGHTmi. Hru som dohral len z povinnosti, ale jej návykovosť a intuitívna hrateľnosť ma donútila hru dohrať. Bohužiaľ už nie v origináli, lebo v mojom ponímaní je Gold Source ako engine v mojich rukách nefunkčný (oproti Sourcu) a nie som schopný s ním kladne spolunažívať. Naopak Black Mesa je naozaj výborný a poctivý remake, ktorý v mojich očiach hru extrémne vylepšuje a prerobenie celej poslednej kapitoly je výborné rozhodnutie, pretože originálny XEN je dneska už totálne nehrateľný. Ak si chcete zahrať Half Life, kúpte si Black Mesu, podporíte tým fanúšikov, hru si viac užijete a nebudete z toho takí frustrovaní ako ja. Ak vám to rovnako ako mne nesadne radšej skúste stokrát lepšiu dvojku.

worth playing, but the platforming at the end is frustrating and janky.\n\nThis is from a time when games were simpler, but this game pioneered integrated narrative.

Ya iba siendo hora de reseñar este juego. Hoy me he completado Half-Life en la máxima dificultad, y me he llevado una sorpresa. ¡Este juego tiene mejor IA que la mayoría del mercado actual! ¡Voy en serio! Los militares flanquean y tiran granadas, los vortigaunts huyen para curarse... ¡Es increíble!\n\nHalf-Life es una obra maestra sacada en 1998 por Valve. Este videojuego hizo que la industria de la época explotase. Un FPS con una historia buenísima, gráficos y sonido bastante avanzados para la época y el inicio de una saga que movería a un montón de fans. Si te encanta DOOM, Quake o Unreal Tournament, DEBES jugar a Half-Life.\n\nHacer a Gordon Freeman un personaje mudo fue una decisión muy grande. La historia ocurre alrededor de ti. Sin cinemáticas, guías o pistas. Tú eres el que decide el camino. Siempre puedes preguntar a los científicos y guardias, pero Half-Life te motiva a ser creativo. ¿Campo de minas? Fúndelo a balas. ¿Francotirador oculto? Tira una granada. La sección de Xen entera es sobre ser creativo, en como saltas, corres y disparas.\n\nDejando de lado algunos bugs, el movimiento mantequilla, y la mucha injusticia que puede haber en el combate, Half-Life es un juego que puedes volver a pasarte, porque siempre te olvidas de algo. En mi caso, la primera vez que jugué, me salte casi todos los bonus de munición en el capítulo 7. Tampoco recordaba que la lucha contra Nihilanth fuera tan tediosa. Siempre descubres nuevos caminos para llegar a tu meta. Este juego es increíble en este aspecto.\n\nLa historia de Black Mesa empieza normal. Te llamas Gordon, tienes un doctorado en Física teórica y llegas al trabajo tarde. Todo normal hasta que realizas el experimento. Cascada de resonancia. Bichos interdimensionales empiezan a aparecer. Todos tus compañeros están muertos. Debes hacer una cosa y es salir a la superficie. Corre, piensa, dispara, sobrevive. La atmósfera en la que se encuentra Half-Life es una ciencia ficción muy 90ventera y la verdad es que hay algunos momentos en que la acción es tan buena que parece que estas jugando a una película.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1592590492,"timestamp_updated":1592590492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":36,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.782894730567932129","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71038091","author":{"steamid":"76561198922800008","num_games_owned":411,"num_reviews":674,"playtime_forever":96,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":96,"last_played":1574889319},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun büyük çığır açan bi oyun zaten bilmeyen az bulunur.Çoğu pc de açılacağı için de oynanabilirliği yüksek bir oyun.","timestamp_created":1592589306,"timestamp_updated":1592589306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiYnu5vICe8j+jgI="}
