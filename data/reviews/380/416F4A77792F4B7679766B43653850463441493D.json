В дело тут же вступает загадка от ядра Цитадели: на стабилизацию даётся 30 минут. Выиграв время и прихватив с собой инопланетную флешку с очень секретными файлами, герои, как и все нормальные россияне, отправляются за город. А теперь давайте разберёмся, что порадовало игроков, а за чем Valve недоглядели.\n\nПлюсы:\nГордому одиночеству Гордона пришёл конец: Аликс стала играть важную роль в сюжете. Она пытается шутить, активно подкатывает и меньше застревает в дверях.\nУровни пополнились тяжёлыми предметами: орудовать грави-пушкой стало легче, а за отказ от огнестрела вам дадут ачивку.\nВ наличии пара новых механик: приготовьтесь поджигать фальшфейерами несчастных зомби и затыкать машинами гнёзда муравьиных львов.\nВ целом графика идентична Half-Life 2, но есть и небольшие отличия в виде допиленного освещения и подправленной лицевой анимации. Оранжевые тона подчёркивают нездоровую ситуацию в Сити 17.\nЗвук работает на погружение — мы ещё никогда не слышали, чтобы голос Патруля несла бессвязный бред. Саундтрек тоже хорош: Келли Бэйли мастерски передал атмосферу трещащего по швам города с помощью индустриального скрежета и внеземного эмбиента.\n\nМинусы:\nИгра длится всего 4 часа. Эти часы запомнятся вам надолго, но смысл эпизодической модели состоит только в том, чтобы поднять бабла.\nСеттинг мало отличается от последних глав Half-Life 2. В добавлении нового контента разработчики ограничились зомбайном — омертвелым аналогом обезьяны с гранатой.\n\nВывод [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/31943256] читайте на VALVe MEMES!

Set right after the ambiguous ending of the incredible Half-Life 2, this \"episodic feature\" is merely the length of a sizeable slice from the main game. Not exactly short, but hardly long, this game serves as an enjoyable extension of the Half-Life 2 story, while also whetting our appetites for the next (and hands-down, superior) episode. I find it worthy of mention that this game was released nearly a whole two years after its predecessor, in June of 2006.\nAs far as game-play goes, this is simply more of the game we know and love. I applaud the developers for starting the game with the interesting gimmick of having ONLY the gravity gun as your weapon. Without even a crowbar at your side, you rely entirely on the great and satisfying physics of the Source engine to clear the path through your enemies. As much as I do love the execution of this idea, I still think it's a little annoying to have to wait until the third chapter before you are equipped with a pistol and shotgun. This is, after all, a first-person-shooter game. \nWhile Half-Life 2 boasted fourteen whopping chapters, Episode One has only five. But that's why it's called an EPISODE. I also must express my displeasure with the blandness of the Urban Flight chapter, which almost feels like a clone of Anticitizen One or 'Follow Freeman!' from the last game. Still, the chapter does include some nice set-pieces, cool challenges and an epic shootout in a hospital. \nNot that you may notice, but the Source engine looks ever so slightly better than it did in 2004, and it's good to see a real expansion utilising new animations, more detailed facial expressions and of course the high dynamic range first showcased in the Lost Coast bonus chapter from 2005. Alyx, who now accompanies the player for practically the entire episode, has been tweaked up a little so that her A.I is a little more dynamic and she seems a bit more realistic. Also, (thank God) she no longer charges ahead into the fray and actually lets you, the player, decide the pace of the game. I will say up front that if you were not a fan of Alyx Vance in Half-Life 2, then avoid this game at all costs. I can't imagine why, however. She is literally designed to be an enjoyable companion, and I'd say Valve really outdid themselves in this regard. \nI find that this game is often overshadowed by its counterpart Episode Two, and for good reason. Nevertheless, what we have here is a game that - despite some sticky pacing at the start and a slight bit of repetition throughout - is perfectly worth your money and does a really great job at throwing us back into the fantastic Half-Life universe. \nLastly, I want to say that the developer commentary (inspired by the well-received audio nodes in Half-Life 2 Lost Coast) are really great to listen to. It's not every day that developers themselves take us deep into what makes their game tick, and I'm sure it's worth listening to even for players who might not be all that interested in game design anyway. \nSo, if I haven't stated it clearly enough already, pick up that can... er, crowbar?

Overall, a really great time.","timestamp_created":1621804799,"timestamp_updated":1621805032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92489704","author":{"steamid":"76561199112588068","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1647713133},"language":"polish","review":"Polecam","timestamp_created":1621804185,"timestamp_updated":1651532191,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92481591","author":{"steamid":"76561198892869066","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1621625759},"language":"russian","review":"Побег из цитадели с обоятельной Аликс.
