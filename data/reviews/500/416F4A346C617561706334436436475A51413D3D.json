I go up against a tank, and  as of expected the other computers don't know how to run away so they litterally just stand there as the tank charges and knocks each of them down one by one. (we are in a tight area) I'm left to fight this giant beast all by my self. I however manage to find a circle route and i kind of just train him around it while constantly shooting, slowly draining his health until he dies.\nI'm left by myself so the tension is high, I'm praying to god that i dont run into a smoker or hunter. I rush on forward untill i finally see their respawn shadows in a upcoming room. My heart calms down for a momment as i rush on towards the room and open the door for the other survivors. As i do that the horde noise comes up, I can hear a boomer and smoker screem so I take refuge into the room that they were in, knowing its a good place to camp in. I tuck myself into the corner and point my gun at the one door entrance getting ready to shoot at the horde of zombies to come in, but the other dumb computers decided to stand outside of the door. i try to squeeze a bit more into the corner to give them the idea to get into the room but they stand their vulnerable. As expected they go incappitated, and i try my best to shoot off the incomign zombies, but then next comes up Loise who decided he wants to close the door on me (for some reason he was the only one who stayed in teh room with me). I couldnt open it because the other survivors got themselves incappitated blocking the door. On top of that loise decided he wanted to stand in face plant in front of the door so i couldn't shoot it down without incappitating him. I watched as the other computer survivors litterally kill themselves and put me a complete disadvantage. The other two computers die off quickly and its just me and loise. He stands their idle infront of the door as i  wait and curse at him telling him to get the $%^# out of my way! He litterally just sits there, and the zombies could attack through doors so he ends up getting hit. (despite that he still stand there!) so I say screw it and shoot him untill he goes down, I manage to shoot several zombies after words but as soon as i do that the door breaks and a smoker tounge lunges out and gets me. I rage quit before anything happens.\n\n\n\n\nBut I still get back on later becasue I'm stubborn and i want to beat this game.","timestamp_created":1438311726,"timestamp_updated":1438312014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.446799933910369873","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17285767","author":{"steamid":"76561198201771425","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":116,"last_played":1457622758},"language":"russian","review":"НЕШТЯК РЕБЯТ !!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1438195029,"timestamp_updated":1438195029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17280329","author":{"steamid":"76561198019218926","num_games_owned":577,"num_reviews":289,"playtime_forever":452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125,"last_played":1451998365},"language":"english","review":"Super!","timestamp_created":1438168965,"timestamp_updated":1438168965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17275701","author":{"steamid":"76561197988512539","num_games_owned":357,"num_reviews":125,"playtime_forever":646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":646,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Another zombie shooter, this one forces you to confront the enemy while completing a series of task to escape the infected areas.

The game uses Valve's well known Source engine, released in 2008. \n\nThe game is set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, you take control of one of four protagonists, which will be known as the \"Survivors\". They will be pitted against hordes of infected zombies in four different game modes, a single player mode which the three other characters are controlled by the AI. A co-op campaign mode, an online versus mode and a four player survival mode. \n\nthe game play focuses mainly on cooperation and working as a team. You will see all the regular features included in other FPS games, such as outlined teammates throughout the world, so you know where they are all the time. A cool feature which I found to be a nice surprise was if a member of your team were to fall off a ledge, they won't automatically plunge to their death, they will manage to hold onto the ledge and the other team members may go and \"Help them up\" much like you would do if you were healing them. \n\nThe campaign mode has six levels, each containing anywhere between three and five individual chapters in them. Each of the chapters takes place in a set environment which allows the player to explore around to find little Easter eggs, pick ups - such as medi-packs, pain pills, weapons and ammo. These points are supposedly randomly generated so each time you play, they will be scattered around in different spots. There are tons of rooms, tunnels and buildings to explore on every level, and there is no time limit either so you can roam around to your hearts content, provided you don't mind the odd zombie jumping out of the closet to try and eat your brains every now and again. \n\nEach of the Survivors are individually voice acted very well; and you can communicate with your team using quick menus. Some voice commands will sound off automatically such as when you are reloading, you'll let the rest of your team know so they can cover you. This to me was a small addition but added to the realism of the game. \n\nThroughout the game you will encounter a number of different zombies which have their own special attack or mutation, such as The Boomer, which is a bloated zombie that will spit bile onto the Survivors which attracts other zombies to your location. This again adds a lot of variety to the game so you don't feel as if you are just mowing through hoards of regular zombies all the time. \n\nThe graphics, while are running on an engine which is a number of years old now, still look awesome, and games today sometimes struggle to present them selves as well as Left 4 Dead. Even with settings right the way down on low, it still looks impressive - meaning any rig or potato will be able to run this. \n\nI played the single player campaign on normal mode; while I had no real issues finishing the game, apart from the last level, I still was satisfied with the level of challenge which was on offer, I can imagine the hard and advanced levels will be completely mind fumblingly hard though. I tried to play the campaign mode online, but sadly there weren't many games available at the time, but it is something I really want to try just to experience the co-op side of things on this game. \n\nPretty much every one owns Left 4 Dead already, and most will have probably already played it; but I really suggest people that haven't played it or at least purchased it but not tried it to play. You will not be disappointed and this is one of the classics of our generation that you need to experience. \n\nP.S - if anyone would like to have a play through the campaign with me, please add me or hit me up as I would welcome any opportunity to give it ago!","timestamp_created":1435910556,"timestamp_updated":1435910556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531835198402404785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16842854","author":{"steamid":"76561198123139818","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1650493243},"language":"french","review":"Excellent

мои руки дошли,до моей любимой онлайн игры.\nПрежде чем читать этот обзор,я сразу говорю что это ИМХО,и ваше право вполне со мной не согласиться.\nДа,я понимаю что обзоров до меня было реально много,но я обязан поделиться своими мыслями.\nИтак начнём:\n+Сюжет\nСюжет в игре довольно прост,Четверо выживших пытаются спастись от толп зомби,но после очередного спасения их выкидывает на новую локацию.\nP.s Если вам интересна предыстория персонажей,настоятельно рекомендую прочитать комикс ЖЕРТВА.\nP.s.s Наверняка найдутся умники,которые скажут что сюжет могли сделать и получше,но я отвечу.\nКак говорил один известный человек-Сюжет в зомби-фильме,должен быть как в порно-простой.\n+Персонажи\nВ игре присутствуют очень колоритные персонажи,за которых действительно переживаешь.\nЭто Байкер-Френсис,Старый Вояка-Билл,Офисный работник-Луис,Привлекательная девушка-Зой.\nЗа них действительно,переживаешь,они заботятся друг о друге.\nОчень порадовало наличие юмора,меня лично некоторые фразы прям до слёз доводили))\nP.s У персонажей нету навыков,выбор персонажа ни на что не влияет.\n+Атмосфера,музыка\nЭто главный плюс игры,движок соурс делает чудеса.Музыка действительно угнетающаяя и даже жуткая.\nнапример когда появляется танк,прям мурашки по коже пробегают от такой шикарной музыки.\n+Геймплей\nЛефт был бы посредственным шутаном,если бы не 1 НО,в игре присутствуют Особые заражённые.Благодаря им игра становится действительно тяжёлая,но самое ГЛАВНОЕ командная.\nВ игре есть кампания , сражение,выживание.\nВ кампании,игроки проходят из точки а и б,отстреливая врагов,попутно спасаясь.\nВ сражении ситуация аналогичная,но вы уже можете играть за особых заражённых.\nВыживание(ну вы поняли)\n+ИИ\nЯ с уверенностью могу сказать,что ИИ в этой игре я могу назвать прекрасным,это делает игру реиграбельной еще больше.\nОбъясняю почему:\nВ игре всегда будут разные ситуации,толпы зомби могут сидеть где угодно и как угодно,в игре может быть несколько танков и наоборот.\n+Оружие\nОружия мало,но этого вполне достаточно:2 вида дробовика,узи,М16,снайперка,пулемёт стационарный,канистры,баллоны.\nОружие чувствуется в руках и это действительно радует.\n\nВ завершении своего обзора хочу сказать,что игра,мертвая,в плане игроков.\nНо несмотря на это я считаю эту игру лучшей на тему зомби.\nТакой игре грех не поставить высшую оценку.\n10/10\nСпасибо что уделили время\nP.s Озвучка в игре просто бомба.Актёры дубляжа,низкий вам поклон","timestamp_created":1435821100,"timestamp_updated":1435821100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16838646","author":{"steamid":"76561198219374240","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1442765346},"language":"russian","review":"ВСЕМ
