good, if short campaign, campaign itself lasted about 6 hours and had some pretty neat weaponry, had mechanics like night vision instead of the standard flashlight and some other thematically appropriate stuff, the training room was a joy to play through this time around even if I knew all the controls beforehand. Overall, solid campaign with some new weapons and a nice little twist on the classic half life formula, only complaint I have is that we haven't seen another official appearance of Mr. Shepard.","timestamp_created":1644209851,"timestamp_updated":1644209851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109692709","author":{"steamid":"76561197998374155","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1645495716},"language":"english","review":"Hardest game of the HL original series, but totally worth it.

Al giorno d'oggi dovrebbero prendere spunto tutte le case produttrici sul significato di DLC, ma andiamo con ordine e capiamo perchè l'ho apprezzato cosi tanto.\n\nLa storia è ambientata contemporaneamente alla storia principale. Noi vestiremo i panni del marine Adrian Shephard arrivato poche ore dal disastro di Black Mesa. Lo scopo principale sarebbe trovare Freeman (o comunque qualsiasi scienziato per ucciderlo) ma il tutto si trasforma in una fuga per salvarsi la vita, dopo un attacco a sorpresa da nemici sconosciuti.\nOpposing Force ha tantissimi punti di forza, il primo è proprio la trama e lo svolgimento degli eventi: bellissimo il fatto di poter vivere la storia da un punto di vista \"opposto\" appunto e bellissimo il modo in cui è stata gestita la campgna. Come nel primo HL il ritmo sarà sempre serrato e con momenti memorabilissimi!\nDavvero interessante.\n\nIl gameplay è lo stesso del fratello maggiore ovviamente, ma Gearbox è stata cosi buona da aggiungere nuove armi (davvero bellissime, divertenti da usare e POTENTISSIME) e addirittura nuove razze aliene!\nAggiunte graditissime.\nL'atmosfera che si respira in questo caso è opposta a quella del primo: se nel primo si respirava quella sensazione di smarrimento e solitudine (nonostante si potesse essere aiutati per un breve tempo da qualche scienziato o guardia) qui si respira più un aria da guerra, con marine armati fino ai denti che ci aiuteranno per quasi ogni capitolo. Tutto ciò ovviamente senza snaturare l'atmosfera del primo gioco.\n\nNon ho trovato veri e propri lati negativi, se non qualche problema audio e l'I.A. nemica invecchiata. Ma comunque non sono problemi enormi, se non dovuti alla vecchiaia.\n\nNon c'è da aggiungere chissà cosa, è una espansione divertente e interessantissima.\nGiochi cosi servirebbero al giorno d'oggi!\nConsigliatissimo!\n\nPRO:\n- La storia da un altro punto di vista\n- Divertente e ampliato con nuove armi e razze di alieni\n- Atmosfera ottima\n- Ritmo serratissimo e pieno di momenti memorabili\n\nCONTRO:\n- Se non apprezzate il primo HL questo non vi farà cambiare idea\n- Qualche problema minore dovuti alla vecchiaia del titolo\n\nVoto: 8,5","timestamp_created":1644055255,"timestamp_updated":1644055255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109539661","author":{"steamid":"76561198106131668","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":300,"last_played":1644047046},"language":"english","review":"Muy buena expansión","timestamp_created":1644047128,"timestamp_updated":1644047128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109530260","author":{"steamid":"76561197992139113","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":329,"last_played":1644034864},"language":"english","review":"Good game.
