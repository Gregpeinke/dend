That is the best way to describe Bioshock Infinite.\n\nAt first Bioshock Infinite seems like a cut and dry FPS with basic mechanics and a nice setting. However, over the course of the game, you come to realise that this is unlike any game ever created- even the original Bioshocks. Gameplay is always dynamic and supports any style of play, and with the DLCs, you are even able to stealth your way through. Vigors add a new  twist to the genre, allowing the player to cast almost magical spells onto your foes- adding another layer to the deep combat systems. The Sky Hook is another mechanic that intesifies and deepens combat further. Traversing a beautiful landscape by soaring through the skies looks and feels magnificent. The AI dynamically adapts to the skyline as well, reacting to all your movements. Additionally, guns feel super solid to shoot, and coupled with the magnificent sound design, have a certain 'punch' to them that alot of other FPS' lack. I do however wish that the gunplay could have been broken up by some puzzles, as it sometimes got a bit repetitive. All in all, despite its short-comings, the gameplay is a fantastic twist to the FPS genre, spicing things up within a somewhat generic category. \n\nGraphics are obviously one of the strongest points in this game. The world of Columbia is fully realised within the Unreal Engine 3 and is a specticle to look at- all the textures and lighting especially look fantastic. The first 30 minutes of the game are some of the best, most pure world building portions of a game I have every played. Everything from the characters to the rooms are detailed, well thought out and created with passion. You can tell that Irrational spent alot of time designing each single focus within the dense world. \n\nBut the main draw of this game is its story. So is it any good? FUCKING YES. The story in Bioshock Infinite is one to marvel at; one that will be remembered decades from now as incredible- just like the original Bioshock. The reason it works so well, is that it takes its time. You really start to feel emotion for the characters that inhabit this world, and form deep connections. Booker and Elizabeth share amazing character development arcs throughout the entire game, and upon reflecting back at the beginning of your journey- you realise just how much you've been through. Each miniscule of detail in the story was thought through a million times over, and share a multiplex of depth with each other detail. The way Ken Levine and his team were able to craft such a magnificent tale, I will never know. I would go as far as to say this story is BETTER than Bioshock 1. I know that might be hard to believe, but Ken Levine is a master of pen- and this work of his is no exception. And the obligatory twist that every Bioshock has is of course here- and mark my words, YOU WILL NOT BE READY. They outdid themselves once again, and this twist will be remembered for generations to come.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nPROS:\n- New, fresh gameplay. A twist on the genre.\n- Marvellous graphics and world.\n- Story will blow you away. One of the best I've ever experienced.\n- Characters are well developed\n\nCONS:\n- Sometimes repetitive.\n\n\nOVERALL: 10/10\nGood job Ken Levine and team. You are masters of game development.","timestamp_created":1467791746,"timestamp_updated":1467791746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24127783","author":{"steamid":"76561198100128639","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":96,"last_played":1528560126},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏本身是非常好的，但我算是服了这个游戏的玄学加成。直到玩到这个游戏，我才感受到了别人说的晕3D是什么感觉[spoiler] 很好，你是第一个[/spoiler]这一定是玄学。（这只是我自己玩这个游戏的感觉，晕不晕还是因人而异的吧）\n这个游戏遇到打折时十分值得入\nPS：商店页面标的不支持中文， 其实是自带有繁中的还有字幕 在属性里调就行\n[spoiler] 哎，真的晕  滚回床上睡觉   _(┐「ε:)_    _(:3 」∠)_ \t[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1467787660,"timestamp_updated":1467787660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532163739204406738","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24127364","author":{"steamid":"76561198197860231","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":939,"last_played":1467910223},"language":"english","review":"Bring us the girl, wipe away the debt.

Very glad I didn't pay full price for it. Bioshock: Infinite is a mediocre console shooter \"Press E to win\" type game. For all the hype about it being the best thing since sliced bread with RPG elements, life like characters, and *The Best Story Ever* \n\nThe characters are beyond shallow, Elizibeth acts like a disney princess for half the game, and runs off and gets herself captured like an idiot. Then she cuts her hair like an edgy 13 year old and becomes \"badass\" after she kills some fool. The entire time she is nothing more than a slave, running around and tossing you money, items, health, and salt (mana). You could probably play the entire game without picking up anything, becasue she does it so often. Contrary to what was said in all the gamplay trailers and hype, she doesn't do jack shit in combat. She just hides. Elizibeth is nothing more than the girl with boobies that needs to be rescued/helped to win, surely a massive leap in game development. \n\nThe stroy was also a fricken' mess and the twist at the end was painfully obvoious as soon as you \"deafeated\" the anticlimactic \"final boss\" (in a cutscene, no less!). Another problem was that it was way too heavy handed in morals and its attempted satire. It was like listening to a 14 year old internet athiest tell you about how bad the government is. The hyperbole of the church and racism was also laughably overdone. A huge thing I didnt like is that you have no allies in game, you will kill every faction you encounter. Walk into a factory? kill everyone. A fair? lock and load. A random slum? kill 'em all! There was one point in the story where you briefly befriended a revolutionary group, and I was delightfully surpised I didnt have to mow them all down. Five minutes later? Just kidding- kill them all too becasue story.   \n \nOverall I would say don't buy this game unless you wait patiently to pre-order the next call of duty every 8 months. If you like those, this game is right up your alley. \n","timestamp_created":1467772684,"timestamp_updated":1467772684,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459231764078140259","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24124250","author":{"steamid":"76561198099636082","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":649,"last_played":1474294957},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bioshock Infinite é um jogo excelente, história muito bem desenvolvida, tendo em seu enredo personagens marcantes, como a Elizabeth, além é claro dos estranhos gêmeos Lutece.

Bioshok это та игра, которая подойдет для всех сразу.\n  Купил (по скидке) и прошел игру я достаточно давно, но впечатления остались до сих пор.\n  В Bioshok Infinite мы будем играть за одного детектива-Букера ДеВитта, который залез в \"трудное жизненное положение\" и чтобы  \"очистить\" прошлое  ему предложили работу по поиску девушки Элизабет и возвращению ее домой. \n  С первого взгляда задача предельно ясна и проста, но трудности начинаются с того что находится она не в простом городе а достаточно загадочном и мифическом, воздушном городе-Колумбия. Дальше уже начинается сюжет и любое слово о дальнейшей игре будет являться спойлером поэтому переходим к плюсам и естественно минусам:\n \n[b]Плюсы:[/b]\n\n[*] Хорошая графика. Графика в игре клонит к мультяшной, это добавляет игре живости и света.\n [*] Фантастическая проработка локаций. Половину время проведенного в игре вы потратите на изучение локаций.\n [*] Стиль вселенной игры-Стимпанк, тут и говорить нечего...\n [*] Харизматичные персонажи. Элизабет яркий тому пример ^^\n [*] Хороша озвучка персонажей. Тот случай когда отсутствие русской озвучки пошло на пользу)\n [*] Элементы RPG. По мере игры мы будем находить \"флакончики\" с какими то настойками, которые будут давать нам спец. скилы (Их эффекты просто офигенны)\n [*] Атмосфера вечной загадачности.\n [*] Сюжет. Главная составляющая часть игры.\n [*] Элизабет... она искала нам предметы до того как это стало мэйнстримом (псина из фаллаут4).\n\n[b]Минусы:[/b]\n \n[*]Он тут один- где продолжение, где объяснение всего этого???!!!\n\n   [b]Итог:[/b] Игра проходится на одном дыхании (особенно, когда у вас ничем не забита голова) и оставляет после себя приятное послевкусие, которое ничем не перебить, даже временем. После прохождения вы поймете что Элизабет была воплощением той девушки, которая сначала покажется странной, но не влюбиться в нее трудно, ведь все мы такие- странные...","timestamp_created":1467710411,"timestamp_updated":1467710674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.643821179866790771","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24104299","author":{"steamid":"76561198122684008","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1101,"last_played":1516318875},"language":"spanish","review":"uff, mejor de lo que espere","timestamp_created":1467708322,"timestamp_updated":1467708322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24103539","author":{"steamid":"76561197990486358","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":298,"last_played":1469992302},"language":"english","review":"Wow..what a game !!!","timestamp_created":1467705207,"timestamp_updated":1467705207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24103235","author":{"steamid":"76561198206385872","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":738,"last_played":1509284308},"language":"polish","review":"Super!","timestamp_created":1467704007,"timestamp_updated":1467704007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24103211","author":{"steamid":"76561198198420815","num_games_owned":602,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":570,"last_played":1645611545},"language":"russian","review":"Эта игра потрясающа. Шедевр, который не только можно считать игрой года, но и одним из лучших шутеров, созданных за всё время вообще. В этой игре хорошо практически абсолютно всё.\n- Великолепный сюжет и история, достойные фильма или книги.\n- Затягивающий надолго вкусный геймплей.\n- Интересные схватки, перестрелки.\n- Шикарная атмосфера, которая привлекает ещё с начала игры.\n- Превосходный дизайн, очень красивая и сочная графика (сразу понимаешь, что тут тоже поработали талантливые люди).\n- Большая продолжительность истории (увидительно, ведь обычно такие классные игры коротки, а тут всё-таки прохождение займёт немало часов, особенно если обыскивать каждый уголок и собирать всё по максимуму, находить секреты).\n- Множество вариантов прохождения. Можете заглядывать в каждый угол и задерживаться в локациях часами, а можете пробежать быстро сюжетную линию. Также имеется множество вариантов расправы с врагами, выбора в этой игре будет достаточно.\n- Невероятно детальный, проработанный и красивый мир, где уделено внимание разработчиков к каждой детали.\n- Элизабет. Это один из лучших персонажей и напарников всей игроиндустрии, что можно вынести в отдельный большой плюс. На протяжении игры сочувствуешь ей и её судьбе, заставляя игрока надеяться, что всё будет хорошо. Эмоциональная, живая и красивая девушка, в которую вы влюбитесь с первого взгляда. ^_^\n- Концовка. Она в то же время расставляет всё на места, логична и не имеет дыр, становятся ясны многие вещи (обойдусь без спойлеров), когда в другое время может сломать мозг, поскольку её трудно осилить из-за большого количества разрыва шаблонов, и вы начинаете понимать, что Кен Левин просто поимел ваши мозги, но это, блин, круто!\nЯ даже не хочу описывать то, насколько эта игра прекрасна, я просто хочу в неё играть снова и снова. С большим удовольствием прошёл два раза (в процессе третье прохождение, но уже на хардкорной сложности) и могу смело рекомендовать эту игру каждому встречному. Потому, что это нереально круто. Эта игра оставила мне столько позитивных эмоций, что о таком приключении и забыть невозможно. 10 из 10 баллов, не меньше.","timestamp_created":1467703883,"timestamp_updated":1467703883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24102975","author":{"steamid":"76561198122918257","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1227,"last_played":1467648731},"language":"english","review":"What a beautiful game, cant believe i missed it 3 years ago.
