Played it of course, maybe rarely, but neatly. Running on your computer 12 years later, I was immediately struck tear nastolgiya in the fall the player into the abyss.\nIt does not say, even a game to begin has been zero for half an hour. Content little ways of killing only two. Few in the 8-10 year-old age, wanted to delve into the system ricochets.\nPlayers online there. At all. Going with a friend, we saw only 6 functioning servers. Empty. True going to one of them we saw bots, which judging by the kDa alone to kill each other and to our parish.\nThat is to say, I want to believe in one of the old rumors about \"Ricochet 2\". Prakrut source engine, adding new features, skins and to realize, ranked, as for me the game can shoot. As if that was not, if the rumors were true, waiting for the continuation of this game from Valve more than \"Half-life 3\"\nRelying on interesting feelings put this game 6/10. Although in essence the game does not pull and 4-Rocco.\nBut again, continued with the implementation of the decent features, can shoot. And I hope what ever going on the continuation page, I shamelessly put the 2nd part of the game - 8/10.\n\n(Русский)\nИгра времен компьютерных клубов. Играли в неё конечно может и редко, но метко. Запустив на своём компьютере спустя 12 лет, меня сразу же пробила слеза настольгии при падении игрока в бездну.\nКак не крути, игра даже для начала нулевых была на полчаса - час. Контента мало, способов убийств всего два. Мало кто в 8-10 летнем возрасте хотел вникать в системы рикошетов.\nИгроков в онлайне нету вообще. ВООБЩЕ. Зайдя с другом мы увидели всего 6 функционирующих серверов. Пустых. Правда зайдя на один из них мы увидели ботов, которые судя по кда, одиноко убивали друг друга и до нашего прихода.\nЧто сказать, хочется верить в один из давних слухов про \"Ricochet 2\". Прикрутя сорс движок, добавив новых фич, скинов и реализовав ранкед, как по мне игра может выстрелить. Как-бы то не было, если слухи и были правдой, жду продолжение этой игры от Valve больше, чем \"Half-life 3\"\nОпираясь на настольгические чувства ставлю этой игре - 6/10. Хотя по сути своей игра не тянет и на 4-рочку.\nНо повторюсь, продолжение с реализацией достойных фич, может выстрелить. И надеюсь что зайдя когда нибудь на страницу продолжения, я без зазрения совести поставлю 2-ой части игры - 8/10.","timestamp_created":1470464314,"timestamp_updated":1470464314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24721796","author":{"steamid":"76561198065474587","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52,"last_played":1621293944},"language":"english","review":"Prob the best game valve has ever made\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthey should reprice to 60$","timestamp_created":1470387296,"timestamp_updated":1470387296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":12,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581978321075439453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24681650","author":{"steamid":"76561198048974529","num_games_owned":825,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1467911000},"language":"english","review":"totally not a bad game in any aspect, 10/10 would recommend. please play it.","timestamp_created":1470189867,"timestamp_updated":1470189867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24607960","author":{"steamid":"76561198099483538","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":49,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1611966091},"language":"english","review":"please play this gameguys","timestamp_created":1469851868,"timestamp_updated":1592903743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24606890","author":{"steamid":"76561198140654855","num_games_owned":1394,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1620013480},"language":"english","review":"5/7 almost as good as arkham city.","timestamp_created":1469845285,"timestamp_updated":1475544441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.416847497224807739","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24604190","author":{"steamid":"76561198069453065","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66,"last_played":1646702497},"language":"english","review":"BEST GAME EVER IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY xddddddddddddd\n99/10 -
