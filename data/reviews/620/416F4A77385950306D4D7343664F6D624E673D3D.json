Bla, bla, bla...\nWcielamy się tutaj w Chell, bohaterkę z pierwszej części. Znów walczymy z bezdusznym systemem, GLaDOS. Tym razem pomaga nam Wheatly, wcielenie głupoty i debilizmu. Grę naprawdę bardzo przyjemnie się przechodzi, czasem trzeba troszkę pogłówkować, gdzie tu ustawić portal, ale po jakimś czasie każdy poziom się przejdzie. \nMuzyka wspaniale oddaje klimat akcji. Można tu usłyszeć wszystko, co się rusza, spadające radio, tupiącą \"grubą\" Chell, śmiejącego się diabolicznie Wheatly'ego... Żyć nie umierać!\nGra została (jak na razie) najlepiej ocenioną grą na Steam przez Metacritic (95/100). Według mnie jest dobra, ale może z nią konkurować wiele gier.\nNajmocniejszym argumentem jest oryginalność gry. Nie znam innej podobnej serii gier. Mimo że jesteśmy uzbrojeni tylko w Portal Gun, to i tak możemy z nim zdziałać wszystko. I właśnie tego gratuluję Valve: przy zaledwie jednym urządzeniu, jednej broni, zrobiliście masę różnych interakcji z nią związanych.\n\n[b] OCENA CZĄSTKOWA [/b]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Fabuła[/td]\n        [td]95/100[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Grywalność[/td]\n        [td]94/100[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Grafika[/td]\n        [td]89/100[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Muzyka i dźwięki[/td]\n        [td]87/100[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Stosunek jakość/cena[/td]\n        [td]91/100[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]OCENA KOŃCOWA: 91,2/100[/h1]","timestamp_created":1422523607,"timestamp_updated":1422523607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.718554973602294922","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14221591","author":{"steamid":"76561198055978970","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":87,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":87,"last_played":1346828400},"language":"english","review":"wary goot game jas","timestamp_created":1422521650,"timestamp_updated":1422521650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14221582","author":{"steamid":"76561197962020154","num_games_owned":448,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":530,"last_played":1422489784},"language":"english","review":"Satisfying puzzles and wit for days.
