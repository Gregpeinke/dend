Есть два режима: Прохождение и Обычный\nВ Прохождении всего 2 официальные карты, но довольно таки не плохие.\nВ Обычном режиме карт очень много, на любой вкус. Так же большое количество оружия и еще можно купить дополнительное оружие если старое надоест :D Ну в принципе игра заслуживает хорошей оценки.","timestamp_created":1382803736,"timestamp_updated":1386013207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.438474833965301514","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3NDh+sECev7GHA=="}
