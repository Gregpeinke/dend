(It's Still Not An Original Joke) [/h1]\n[b] Note: This is a rereview, redone in my \"new style\" of review. [/b]\n\n[b] tl;dr: Now it's a jumbo but left out for a while marshmallow: fluffier, tastier, more fun, and more to it, but it also feels kind of dry, as if something was lost by having it sit outside for a bit. Still tasty, but it leaves one to wonder... [/b]\n\nPortal 2 is Valve's second puzzle game, but not just any puzzle game, as it sees you in the ruins of a testing facility in first person view and soon after picking up a gun... that shoots portals. All the while being talked to by a British robot sphere dude that is kind of a [strike] lovely baka that you should love~<3 [/strike] \"maron\" (won't spell it right because Steam censors harsh words, which is good) that very much enjoys casual and light conversation, jokes, and [spoiler] becoming mad with power. [/spoiler] As you progress through the game, you also get to learn more about the history of the facility and you even get to meet up with an old [spoiler] muderous [/spoiler] friend!\n\n[u] General Overview [/u]\nAs stated, this is a puzzle game. Each room consists of a puzzle, with each puzzle getting progressively difficult. You start off with just your hands, then a one-way portal device, and finally a dual portal device. There is also a co-op mode, which can be played before or after campaign mode (though the story in co-op is a continuation of the story in campaign, so it is best to beat the campaign first), as well as the ability to test your hand at building your own puzzles to share with the world, or try some community made puzzles using the Steam Workshop feature of this game! What fun!\n\n[u] Pros [/u]\n[b] MORE. MORE EVERYWHERE. [/b]\n- More music and ambiance\n- More campaign\n- More comedy\n- More achievments\n- More post-game in the form of co-op\n- Infinite post-game in the form of community made puzzles\n[b] *More ends here* [/b]\n- A deeper storyline and deeper lore\n- In co-op, customization in the form of cosmetics for your robots\n\n[u] Cons [/u]\n- The co-op customization loadout screen is nearly always broken\n- The only way to get cosmetics beyond the unlockable ones (which there is not many of) is by purchasing them\n- From what I can remember, there is no in-game chat in co-op\n\n[u] Nitpicks (That May Detract From Your Overall Enjoyment) [/u]\n- Some cosmetics are unlocked by owning the hat in Team Fortress 2. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that nearly all the hats you can unlock in Portal 2 by Team Fortress 2 hats can only be obtained by purchasing them on the Steam Market, or trading for them. Luckily, they aren't that rare, which makes this only a nitpick\n- Co-op is exclusively with friends. There is no matchmaking or anything, and your friend must own Portal 2 as well\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\nValve made a pretty interesting game here. A Puzzle and FPS hybrid, and it somehow manages to not botch it up. It's amazing to think that this game is the sequel to a game that was supposed to be a throwaway in Valve's Orange Box bundle, but instead that game became one of the most beloved PC games of all time, and even spawned a bigger and better sequel!... Though, for some reason, something feels lost in transition from Portal to Portal 2. The atmosphere, maybe? It feels less creepy, lonely, and mysterious in Portal 2... Maybe it's just my imagination. Anyways, this game is more quantity, less quality, but still good. It can be boiled down to a jumbo marshmallow that was left outside too long: fluffier, tastier, and more to it, but it feels dry, as if being left out for a time made it lose something.","timestamp_created":1465099336,"timestamp_updated":1466738207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23390812","author":{"steamid":"76561198005563341","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":536,"last_played":1465087611},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy entretenido, solo jugue la campaña de un jugador.\nHabia jugado Portal  1 y lo encontre muy bueno, este lo supera en muchos aspectos. \nAdemas de la campaña de un jugador, hay modo cooperativo y editor de escenarios.\nSi te animas a comprarlo, porfavor no leas guias o veas gameplays ya que le quitaras la diversion.\nEl desafio esta en superarlas por uno mismo, y eso hace que este juego sea recomendable.","timestamp_created":1465088407,"timestamp_updated":1465088407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23390366","author":{"steamid":"76561198093252273","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":2381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2191,"last_played":1470448204},"language":"english","review":"You aren't a real gamer if you haven't played Portal 2.\nPros:\n- Well written story\n- Great voice acting\n- Quite enjoyable puzzles\n- Quality level design\n- Multiplayer, if you're into that (but singleplayer was much better)\n- Good Steam Controller support because it is a Valve game\n- Mute protagonist makes the game more immersive\n- Good graphics (for Source)\n- Combustable lemons\n\nCons:\n- If you've taken the time to read this far, then you probably don't already have the game and you need to get it.","timestamp_created":1465085777,"timestamp_updated":1465085777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23389334","author":{"steamid":"76561198132875243","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1326,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1326,"last_played":1463328207},"language":"brazilian","review":"EXCELENTE OTIMO E EXTRAORDINARIO...zerem o jogo nao paren ateh zerar o game todo para ver o final a ultima fase e a musica das torretas\n\n\nSEJE INTELIGENTE","timestamp_created":1465080746,"timestamp_updated":1465080746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23389084","author":{"steamid":"76561198058268501","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2672,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1279,"last_played":1632359581},"language":"english","review":"\"Oh Hi, so how you holding up?

So........ heres the low down,\nPortal 2 is a sequal to Valves suc·cess·ful (Heh) Portal, Portal 2 greatly expandes on what Portal did, it added a richer storyline, more characters, and new locations, it also added gels to use with your portal gun, and Co-Op mode. In this review we will go over the gameplay, storyline, pros, and lastly cons, lets get started!\n\n1. GAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay of Portal 2 is extremely fun, you man the character \"Chell\" in different puzzle situations, all of the gameplay is first person. you have to go through different \"Testing floors\" avoiding lasers, turrets, laser turrets, deadly falls and deadly falling objects. In the game you use a tool called the portal gun, if you are familiar with Portal you should already know this, what it does is well obviously, it creates portals! The gun creates two different portals in two different locations, this is how you will solve the puzzles. The gameplay starts out easy, but soon progressing you will find yourself wanting to look up Youtube tutorials, I encourage you to not go to Youtube, the feeling you get when you figure out a puzzle makes up for how long it took, it makes you feel like a genius! The worst part of the gameplay for me is the fact that sometimes it feels like you are just doing a puzzle because you want to get to the storyline as soon as possible. Ultimately I think the gameplay for Portal 2 is probably 8/10.\n\n2. STORYLINE\nThe storyline for Portal 2 has to be good, without a good storyline the player has no motivation to play the game, Portal2's storyline is good, its not so great, but it is good enough. The storyline is interesting but at some points it dips into things like shallow and predictable. The storyline has a very neat twist in the end that I will leave it to you to figure out. The storyline doesn't go much into the unknown past of Chell her childhood mostly remains a mystery, it focuses more on getting her out of the facililty and stopping the evil GLADYS (Her name is something like that). I think that the storyline is worth it but it could have used some work. 7/10.\n\n3. Pros\n-Great brain racking fun\n-Cake!\n-Free cake!\n-interesting characters\n-Puzzles have more than one way to solve them.\n-strange drawings on the wall from ratman\n-Great atmosphere! A little creepy and mysterious\n-CO-OP\n-Great soundtrack\nAnd more!\n\n4. CONS\nThis is an interesting subject since so many people are always giving it great reviews, I will give you the \"Nitty-Gritty\"\n-Lack of player choice (Can not choose where to go, not open world, can't impact the storyline)\n-Can get boring after a while\n-Puzzles get repetitive \n-Not very much variety\n\n\nULTIMATELY I would give this game a 8/10 and I highly suggest you getting this game if you like puzzlers.\nNeed a review for your game?!
