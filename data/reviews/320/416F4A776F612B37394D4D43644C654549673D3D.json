If you couldn't tell by the title of the name, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch puts you into the boots of either a Rebel or a Combine soldier and you fight the opposing team to the death. All of the weapons from Half-Life 2 are in this game, including the Gravity Gun. So, yes, you can pick up a toilet and launch it at your enemy to kill them. You will start with a set of weapons usually consisting of a pistol, SMG, stunstick, and Gravity Gun. You will have to go searching for your other weapons including the shotgun, crossbow, magnum, and AR 2.  You can also pick up the weapon that your dead foe was using when they died. If they dropped a weapon you already have, it will be given as ammo for that weapon. Ammo, health, and suit chargers will also be scattered throughout the map. Be sure pick up those as you go. (Using health and suit chargers may leave you out in the open, so be careful of enemies.) The core character mechanics from Half-Life 2 also make a return, the only difference being that your character moves a little faster. That means that shooting while sprinting is still a thing. While it may be a bit cheap, it's still a game mechanic to be exploited. That also means that the game is a lot more fast-paced and frantic then most multiplayer FPS games on the market such as Call of Duty or Battlefield. (Note: I don't hate these two game series. So, shut up.) The maps in this game are based off of areas in Half-Life 2. While most aren't ripped straight from the game, I feel like maps like Lockdown is ripped right from Nova Prospekt, a level in Half-Life 2. There's also tons of people still playing this game. Though most servers may have bots, that shouldn't stop you from enjoying this game. Overall, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is a really fun multiplayer game. It's currently only $14.99 on Steam. You also don't need a very powerful computer to run it. So, go check it out.","timestamp_created":1394385498,"timestamp_updated":1394385498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9387844","author":{"steamid":"76561197961280719","num_games_owned":386,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":71,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1474474000},"language":"english","review":"Your typical deathmatch...in HL2 style!
