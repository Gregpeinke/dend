Но, отметём все эти заслуги в сторону, и зададим вопрос - а чем игра может заинтересовать современного игрока, уже повидавшего рассвет шутеров?\n\n Начнём с поистине интересного, что может удивить до сих пор:\n\n1. Полностью бесшовное повествование. Игра проходится одним кадром, без загрузок отдельных локаций или катсцен. За исключением крайне редких моментов вы никогда не теряете контроль над персонажем, что потрясающе работает на погружение.\n2. \"Агрессивный\" LvL-дизайн. Не так часто встречаемая, но в тоже время крутая особенность: игровое пространство в игре выстроено так, чтобы создавать перед вами всё больше и больше препятствий. С одной стороны это может показаться чуть ли не жестоким, однако ощущения от преодолевания подобных \"проблем\" как нельзя лучше мотивируют идти вперёд.\n3. Отсутствие излишков. Часто обилие оружия или противников в играх приводит к тому, что они становятся как один похожи друг на друга. В Half-Life же каждое оружие и каждый противник имеют свои яркие отличительные черты: подчас сражение с одним и тем же противником в разных условиях заставит на лету менять стратегию, по максимуму используя как свою экипировку, так и особенности локаций. А благодаря выстроенному в игре балансу, хоть раз, да из каждого типа оружия вы постреляете.\n\n Минусы в игре также имеются: в некоторых локациях присутствуют визуальные \"аномалии\" и баги, ИИ уже порядком устарел и время от времени ведёт себя неадекватно, но, подобное встречается в каждой игре. К серьёзным недостаткам стоит отнести отсутствие русскоязычной локализации (при её наличии в ремейке), однако, данная проблема легко решается пользовательскими модификациями.\n\n Помимо всего вышеописанного можно также долго рассуждать о необычном сюжете, сеттинге, вкладе в игровую индустрию и т.д., но, будем честны - куда интереснее это будет прочувствовать самостоятельно. Тем более, что купив данную игру, вы покажете, за что Valve в действительности любили в своё время.","timestamp_created":1564944313,"timestamp_updated":1564944313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.639160096645355225","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54458165","author":{"steamid":"76561198437882130","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2725,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2402,"last_played":1656212014},"language":"english","review":"Just beat it for the 7th time!","timestamp_created":1564941373,"timestamp_updated":1564941373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54457685","author":{"steamid":"76561198956651311","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1575684011},"language":"english","review":"guys, i don't think my copy of gmod is working correctly","timestamp_created":1564939308,"timestamp_updated":1564939308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54455979","author":{"steamid":"76561198070026159","num_games_owned":684,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":59926,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59926,"last_played":1503628002},"language":"english","review":"This is one of those games where you play it once, beat it, and forget about it, never returning to play it again.","timestamp_created":1564932379,"timestamp_updated":1564932379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":39,"votes_funny":153,"weighted_vote_score":"0.746736288070678711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54455297","author":{"steamid":"76561198077653717","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":515,"last_played":1607693710},"language":"english","review":"Classic .

Some of the weapons are a little unrealistic and make no sense, mainly being the real world guns. For example: most military grade smgs don't have GRIL attatchments (Grenade Launcher), and the shotgun appears to be a standard issue SPAS 12 with no butt stock, yet somehow in the Half-Life universe, with the click of the secondary fire button, can fire 2 rounds in one blast. Pretty sure only certain real life shotguns can pull this off, if any, without an extra barrel like the double barrel shotgun. Though unrealistic, this can come in handy, and is actually more fun to use, simply because it holds 8 rounds, as opposed to the Double Barrel Shotgun only carrying 2. Also, the MP5's magazine is average size, yet holds almost double the amount of a real world MP5. Though minor complaints from a nit picker, the overall gameplay is not effected by these in these slight oversights.","timestamp_created":1564795822,"timestamp_updated":1564795822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54429988","author":{"steamid":"76561198289462125","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":313,"last_played":1654884937},"language":"english","review":"neato","timestamp_created":1564795186,"timestamp_updated":1564795186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54427954","author":{"steamid":"76561198046673354","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":8880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6793,"last_played":1649466930},"language":"brazilian","review":"The

Сюжет игры действительно завораживает и заставляет задуматься над дальнейшей судьбой всей планеты Земля. Молодой учёный в очках и защитном костюме пытается спасти мир от нашествия пришельцев из мира Xen, и остановить их появление. Также в этой вселенной присутствует самый загадочный персонаж игры - G-Man. Мы не знаем о нём ничего, кто он, зачем он здесь, с какой целью... Именно он принёс кристалл Xen в Чёрную Мезу и превысить ограничения Антимасс-Спектрометра. Иногда он нам помогает, а иногда мешает нам достичь определенной цели. Игра заканчивается тем, что мы убиваем главу мира Xen - Нихиланта. И нам это успешно удалось. После чего наш друг G-Man приглашает нас работать на него и его работодателей. В конечном итоге мы соглашаемся, и через 20 лет на разбудят из стазиса, чтобы сокрушить Альянс на Земле. Самая шедевральная игра. Моя оценка - 5/5.\n\nМультиплеерная часть игры тоже заслуживает уважение. Классические оружия из Half-Life у вас в руках, и вы готовы убивать различных игроков практически как бог. Также создали не мало модификаций, таких как OZDM, ZXC, Weapon's Mod. Но в целом игроки на серверах еще есть, поэтому у вас есть все шансы погрузиться в этот прекрасный мультиплеер. Никаких задержек на серверах, никаких глюков и багов. Самая любимая моя карта в этом мультиплеере - Crossfire. В общем, мультиплеер здесь тоже шикарный, к которому сложно придраться :).

Wow that got crazy!\nA guy named the G-man pops up quite a bit, and is always going on about 'future employment' and how you, Gordon Freeman, are playing a vital role in the 'success of the employers'\n\nPretty intense atmosphere and the AI is very good at trying to kill/help you.\n\nThe voice acting was done by what sounds like 5 people, but the lines and dialogue help convey the sense of desperation during the events of the story. Most of the events you don't see are told to you by other scientists, security guards, and the PA so make sure to listen closely! (Or get on google and find a description of what is going on...)\n\nSound was great when this game came out, but it doesn't hold up now. It still works, but this is far from high fidelity.\n\nSame with the graphics. The UI and HUD scale to widescreen so YAY no stretched health and ammo!\n\nControl scheme is the standard WASD flavored stuff.\n\nThe story ends and is mostly contained within the 4 original Half-Life games, so you won't need to play Half-Life, Blue Shift, Opposing Force, or Decay to really know what happened prior to Half-Life 2. Half- Life 2 is mostly using the original's lightly developed characters and initial plot incident (the Resonance Cascade) as a base to create a new story in a different part of the world in the future.\n\nThis game is one of 'The Greats' because it helped change PC game design for the better. \nIf you consider yourself a member of the PC master race, buy this game and make sure to play it for a few levels.\n\n9/10\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3KuS4uYTAUuZJqBZowWe0gw7veu2FDOn","timestamp_created":1564396185,"timestamp_updated":1571029728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.729005277156829834","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54350247","author":{"steamid":"76561198846021533","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":715,"last_played":1657268987},"language":"russian","review":"мне эта игра нравится с помощью покупки халф лайв играю в adrenalin gamer!","timestamp_created":1564372798,"timestamp_updated":1564372798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54349910","author":{"steamid":"76561198978353270","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1564509368},"language":"english","review":"[h1] Half Life Review [/h1]\n\nHalf Life is my first game that I ever touched by Valve, and I extremely enjoy what I've been playing so far.
