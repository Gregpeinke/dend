is a nostalgic, Sci-Fi, storytelling, action, adventure, shooter.\nIt's the first game in the very iconic and beloved Half-Life Franchise.\nA masterpiece in gaming history that still lives up to this day in terms of gameplay.\n\nYou play as Gordon Freeman, a scientist who must find his way out of the Black Mesa Research Facility after an experiment with alien material goes wrong.\nWhich resulted in a dimensional rift called Xen being opened and Aliens teleporting and investing all over the facility.\nGordon doesn't only need to face Aliens but also the US Marines who are sent to cover up the incident and destroy the facility.\nAfter traveling through air vents, underground tunnels, destroyed buildings and water channels he arrives at the Lambda Complex where scientists have developed teleportation technology that allows people to travel to Xen.\nAnd it's ofcourse up to Gordon to save the day and kill the Alien leader named Nihilanth.\n\nDuring the game, Gordon travels through creative designed maps filled with puzzle elements.\nThe balance between action and puzzle solving is perfectly executed and the overall game felt well thought trough.\nThe game is full of surprises, and is continuously throwing new obstacles, enemies and challenges on your path.\n\nWith every area looking different it really felt moving through the entire facility and slowly getting to the surface.\nUnlike other games released around that time, Half-Life doesn't have levels that you complete.\nThe game is a seamless ongoing stream of locations from beginning to end, with only short loading texts between each area.\nEven though the game looks a little outdated, the graphics aren't that bad and the atmosphere is brilliantly captured.\nKeep in mind that this game was released in 1998 and at that time this was revolutionary.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the enemy AI, which is even better than some newer games that you'll see today.\nHowever, the scientist AI's are often dumb, slow and have a hard time following you.\nThey do have some interesting and hilarious dialogue.\nI personally enjoyed trolling them by turning off the lights, which they didn't like! And replying to my actions with things such as: “My God, what are you doing!?”\nThroughout the game you'll often come across a mysterious guy called G-Man, he seems to follow you along your journey.\nHe disappears and doesn't talk, unless you'll get to the end where he has an interesting offer for you.\n\nAs it comes to weapons, you'll start off with the iconic crowbar but as enemy threat increases so does your fire power.\nThere is a good variety of guns with each their own special ability that comes in handy in certain situations.\nSuch as a crossbow which you use underwater, but can also be used as a sniper.\nOr the Gluon gun that shoots a stream of energy that vaporizes enemies, which is great for killing large creatures.\nThere are also a few other fun weapons to play around with, such as throwing Snarks which are little alien creatures that bite your target and explode after a few seconds.\n\nThis amazing experience takes you back in time, it's a game that we owe so much to, because it changed everything for gaming in general. \nHalf-Life is an outstanding masterpiece and every gamer should have played it at least once in their lifetime.","timestamp_created":1579232174,"timestamp_updated":1579232865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":40,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.788403093814849854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61959660","author":{"steamid":"76561198023573160","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":75,"playtime_forever":251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":176,"last_played":1650131350},"language":"english","review":"I love this classic","timestamp_created":1579230226,"timestamp_updated":1579230226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61959377","author":{"steamid":"76561198862344350","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1627962328},"language":"english","review":"terrible","timestamp_created":1579229584,"timestamp_updated":1579229584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61958203","author":{"steamid":"76561198048951549","num_games_owned":848,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2548,"last_played":1579227316},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1579227330,"timestamp_updated":1579227330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61958037","author":{"steamid":"76561198183659141","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2634,"last_played":1593466806},"language":"english","review":"Many cool you get to shoot aliens","timestamp_created":1579226977,"timestamp_updated":1585591907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61957942","author":{"steamid":"76561198136535250","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2678,"playtime_last_two_weeks":92,"playtime_at_review":747,"last_played":1660497322},"language":"brazilian","review":"Como alguém que sempre ouviu falar da importância de Half-Life enquanto crescia, eu sempre tive curiosidade enquanto ao título, mas só tive a oportunidade de comprá-lo recentemente. Eu queria experienciar uma relíquia e ver como ela se mantinha. Será que Half-Life conseguiria se sustentar mais de 20 anos depois? Era isso que eu queria descobrir.\n\nUma das primeiras coisas que me cativou foi a atmosfera que o jogo te passa logo cedo na instalação Black Mesa. O jogo nunca tira o seu controle, o que torna o escopo das ameaças muito mais real. Some isso ao terror que o jogo propõe ao jogador e você tem um jogo de sobrevivência intenso em todos os sentidos.\n\nMuito do que torna Half-Life relevante ainda hoje é como suas ambições realizam coisas que poucos jogos do gênero arriscam fazer. As soluções para problemas como puzzles ou inimigos resistentes envolvem interação com o ambiente, trazendo momentos de glória ao eliminar obstáculos que antes pareciam inevitáveis de forma inteligente. Outro fator que enriquece a experiência é como funcionários da Black Mesa podem ser úteis, abrindo salas com recursos úteis ou dando suporte em áreas com inimigos.\n\nEm certos setores, Half-Life pode ser frustrante. Seu level design às vezes não é tão claro, principalmente quando algumas de suas soluções não são tão óbvias quanto o jogo pensa ser. Sua intensidade faz com que se tenha poucos momentos para respirar, muitas vezes te dando salas consecutivas de adrenalina desenfreada. Nada que algumas horas de descanso não resolvam, mas ainda desgastante.\n\nMas com tudo isso dito, como Half-Life se mantém hoje? A resposta é: muito bem até. Ele permanece rico ao lado do que temos nessa geração, seus fundamentos ainda são relevantes e seu universo continua imersivo e profundo, mesmo com algumas coisas datadas. Half-Life é como um vinho bem conservado: basta apuro para apreciar. Recomendo demais.","timestamp_created":1579226748,"timestamp_updated":1579226748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.634349048137664795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61957873","author":{"steamid":"76561198113683660","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":713,"last_played":1587683342},"language":"english","review":"amazing game","timestamp_created":1579226615,"timestamp_updated":1579226615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61957775","author":{"steamid":"76561198171868985","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1188,"last_played":1653269914},"language":"spanish","review":"Tiene una buena historia, y el diseño del mapa junto con los sonidos hacen que el jugador se sienta como si fuera el personaje.","timestamp_created":1579226386,"timestamp_updated":1579226386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61955143","author":{"steamid":"76561198203402963","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1014,"last_played":1585787072},"language":"brazilian","review":"Considerando-se que é um jogo antigo, é possível relevar o fato do boneco deslizar ou andar demais com um comando bem como o sistema de saving automático não muito bom, no mais, o jogo vale a pena ser jogado, tem um gameplay desafiador e interessante","timestamp_created":1579220704,"timestamp_updated":1579220704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61954755","author":{"steamid":"76561198048633410","num_games_owned":687,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":848,"last_played":1590099855},"language":"english","review":"If you don't own this game on Steam, then I'm sorry, but you don't exist.\nI'm sorry, I don't make the rules.
