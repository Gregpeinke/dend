Half-Life 2 actually tests the player to see if they can use physics to solve puzzles to progress and to their advantage in combat scenarios with a tool known as the Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator, better known as the Gravity Gun. the soundtrack was, once again, composed by Kelly Bailey, and was top notch.

Сотню раз проходил эту игру и никогда мне это ненадоедало. \nНекоторые говорят: \"После 2-х часов игры начинаешь тупо ездить и убивать горстки врагов.\" Однако,во время этой поездки на машине можно понаблюдать за пейзажем,увидеть красивые места,найти много тайников,а так же углубиться во вселенную игры. \n\nБоты в игре живучие,довольно умные. Вы даже не заметите,как один из них кинет в вас гранату. Многие сравнивают игру Half-Life с играми,дата выпуска которых начинается с 2010 года. Могу сказать одно: Эти люди - идиоты. Разница в программах того времени и нынешнего времени огромная,и я сейчас говорю не о серии игр Half-Life 2,а о игре Half-Life,самой первой из линейки. \n\nОтличная игра,которая затягивает любителей фантастики,шутеров и прочих игр.\n\nUPD: До сих пор лучшая.","timestamp_created":1400519429,"timestamp_updated":1606467411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517985641956329346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10170580","author":{"steamid":"76561198048590841","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1390082727},"language":"french","review":"Supers j'en dis pas plus sa renommé parle d'elle même.","timestamp_created":1400514440,"timestamp_updated":1400514440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10168985","author":{"steamid":"76561198061657303","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":620,"last_played":1448136370},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра навеки-вечные!!!","timestamp_created":1400502787,"timestamp_updated":1400502787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10168541","author":{"steamid":"76561198113248942","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1046,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":948,"last_played":1417306613},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2 is an amazingly well done game and runs great on any modern computer.

Levels are basically getting from point A to point B and can sometimes be annoying when enemies bombard you with no cover on your end. Waste of 12 hours. Bought it because it was \"the best game ever.\" Complete bull. Even worse is when people say that it can even be a great game in today's standards and expectations. I'd take any of today's shooters including the shitty ones, over this pile of steaming garbage any day.","timestamp_created":1400281834,"timestamp_updated":1409007379,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.376623839139938354","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10141336","author":{"steamid":"76561198084213203","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":86,"playtime_at_review":983,"last_played":1660526359},"language":"english","review":"This game is good.","timestamp_created":1400275277,"timestamp_updated":1400275277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10140931","author":{"steamid":"76561198089243479","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1022,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1400272398},"language":"english","review":"May not be everyone's cup of tea, but just so happens to be mine. 10/10","timestamp_created":1400272570,"timestamp_updated":1400272570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507462680339813232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10140437","author":{"steamid":"76561198087292767","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":609,"last_played":1400783160},"language":"french","review":"Que dire de ce jeu si ce n'est qu'on a probablement rien fait de mieux depuis ? ^^\nj'exagère à peine, les suites (ep1 et 2) sont bonnes mais loin de l'être autant que HL2, un bon FPS old school avec un bon scenar, des graphismes qui ont pas trop mal vieilli.\nLa seule chose qu'on pourrait critiquer c'est la musique, mais bon, c'est avant tout une question de gout.\nUn jeu de légende à acheter les yeux fermés (surtout vu son prix)","timestamp_created":1400269011,"timestamp_updated":1400269011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10139081","author":{"steamid":"76561198051995015","num_games_owned":1573,"num_reviews":382,"playtime_forever":1144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":810,"last_played":1608510223},"language":"spanish","review":"[code][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6867212/] Si quieres leer más reviews así, visita el mentor [/url][/code]\nUn verdadero juegazo. Lo he jugado varias veces ya, pero hace poco lo adquiri en steam rebajado, para volverlo a jugar y me sigue encantando. A dia de hoy, con la de juegos que hay y salen en el 2014, no se puede seguir valorando como la obra maestra que fue cuando salio, se esta quedando un poco viejete, pero aun asi, sigue siendo un juego muy muy recomendable a dia de hoy. Graficamente no esta muy mal, pero si quieres, puedes jugarlo en HD gracias a diversos mods, yo en particular use este: http://www.cinematicmod.com/cinematic_mod_2013.php . Como analisis del juego, dire que aun que las mecanicas empiezan a quedarse un poco anticuadas, este fue el juego que hizo posible la mayoria de los shooters actuales, ademas de ser el primero en incluir unas fisicas medianamente realistas (y usarlas a lo largo de toda la historia). Ojala hiciesen mas shooters asi, que alternan una buena historia, con freneticos enfrentamientos, y ciertos puzles. El juego es totalmente lineal, pero no es algo que moleste, ya que tiene una historia, enemigos y situaciones muy variadas. No es necesario haber jugado el half life 1 para entender este, pero si recomendable. Si quieres hacerlo, existe un remake gratuito en el motor source llamado: \"black mesa source\".  Tambien recomiendo muchisimo sus dos ampliaciones (episodio 1 y 2), que aun que no inovan mucho en mecanicas, traen una historia y escenarios nuevos muy interesantes. \nConcluyo diciendo que si en su dia jugaste este juego, seguro que si lo rejuegas ahora te dara unos buenos ratos, ya que aun que es bastante antiguo, sigue siendo mejor que la mayoria de los shooters actuales... Y si nunca has jugado a este juego, no se a que esperas para hacerlo, que aun que ya no destaque como la joya que fue en su dia, sigue siendo muy buen juego.\n9.5/10","timestamp_created":1400260004,"timestamp_updated":1530553974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.609391987323760986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10138963","author":{"steamid":"76561198061563723","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":686,"last_played":1584178203},"language":"english","review":"I think HL2 is a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny bit overrated, but I also think there's something wrong with me.
