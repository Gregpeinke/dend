LONG REVIEW, LIGHT SPOILERS\n\nInitially, I was going to give Bioshock Infinite a recommendation, with deep sadness in my heart perhaps, but still. But after a ridiculously tedious boss fight repeated three (!) times and insanely drown-out dull corridor shootouts with dummy AI and most importantly, increasingly inane, needlessly complicated plot about multiverses, that tries to be so important, complex and meaningful, but ends up just being pretentious and collapses on itself, I am doing the unthinkable and giving this \"masterpiece\" a thumbs down. What once started as an ambitious experiment with the first two System Shock titles, that revolutionized public's perception of first-person action games has now ingloriously devolved into a typical linear shooter with slightly more complex themes than its peers. I am kind of shocked (pun intended) that this has 94 on Metacritic. Then again, I always thought 96 for the original Bioshock was also too much. But Infinite is a whole different league. Save for storytelling, voice acting and excellent setting design, I really can't think of any other aspect in which Infinite truly excels. It is actually sad, that this game is held up as a \"masterpiece\" or an example of video games as art. Unless there's a huge discount (75-80%, not less), I wouldn’t recommend buying this game. \n\nLet's get this out of the way first – Bioshock Infinite is a first-person shooter. Not an RPG, an action RPG or even a shooter with some light RPG elements. It is a straight-up linear shooter with RPG cosmetics at best, no ifs or buts about it. There is literally nothing here that even remotely smacks of old Bioshock: there's no hacking, no research, no mini-games, no cameras, no crafting, no upgrades unless you count the most basic bare-bone ones and there’s pretty much zero exploration. Manual save option and the ability to carry more than two weapons are also missing. Gone is the depressing atmosphere in a bizarre hostile world you were merely trying to survive. Gone are small callbacks Bioshock 1 and 2 had to original System Shocks. Now you can't even carry medkits! The only thing you can do is trudge through corridors killing the same types of enemies again and again. Oh, and picking up audio recordings and other \"stuff\". No strategy or tactics required. I am surprised the game does not have regenerating health and Captain Price cameo somewhere. Although you still get – wait for it – a regenerating shield. Yeap, a regenerating shield in a Shock game. We lived long enough to see it.  \n\nMechanically speaking, even Rage 2 – an average game that does not even pretend to be anything more than full-blown fun shooting experience – has more actual RPG elements, as you can upgrade your multiple abilities, guns and vehicles in far more ways than in Infinite. Let that sink in: Rage 2 is more of an RPG than Bioshock Infinite. Even the original Dead Space had a more meaningful and extensive upgrade system, for crying out loud.    \n\nI still don't understand: why streamline (read: dumb down) to THIS extent? Was the original Bioshock really all that complex? Were there actually people, who thought that it required too much thought and effort to play? I can only imagine what they would think if they booted up System Shock 2. \n\nWhile Bioshock Infinite is a shooter, it not even a good one: it is quite a linear, on-rails experience and the AI is dumb as bricks. The latter levels are a chore, as the game throws dozens of bullet-sponge enemies at you in order to offer at least some kind of challenge. The melee types charge you out in the open like complete morons. In previous games those foes were basically robots or mindless zombies, so it was understandable. In Infinite's Columbia, I guess cops are just suicidal idiots attacking you head-on with batons. The ghost boss fight mentioned earlier is an insanely tedious affair, unless you exploit enemy AI. Generally, Shock games always felt at least somewhat grounded, even when they had supernatural elements. Infinite goes way too far with the multiple dimension mumbo-jumbo and weird ghost nonsense. Yes, Shock games were odd, but at least they tried to logically explain it somehow. Infinite does not even bother. It expects to take all these preposterous occurrences at face value. \n\nI also wanted to add on the lack of good characters. There is the boring main character, your \"sidekick\" Elizabeth, the evil religious cult leader, the twins, who appear here and there and… that's It. There are other side characters sure – Fitzroy, Fink, Slate – who appear to be interesting characters at least on paper, but none of them are explored in any depth. The closest we get to a deep character is probably Slate and even he is wasted.  \n\nThe biggest problem, however, is that the whole story and setting have a nasty tinge of artificiality to them. In Bioshock, plasmids and ADAM and Rapture were deeply intertwined, but in Columbia, they are there, because... well, it's a Bioshock game and we gotta have them. The same goes for other details. Vending machines selling you guns and ammunition made sense in the hyper-free market world of Rapture. But in Columbia, with its deep class divisions and conflicts simmering, I just can't see guns being sold so openly out in literal vending machines. There's even a subplot in the game to get more guns for the oppressed Vox Populi underclass, despite the fact that they are sold right there in the street. Or do they only sell gun upgrades, but not weapons themselves? I don’t know. In any case, these machines, as small of a detail as they may seem, went from being integral part of the world to just another video game spot to get more \"stuff\". Story-wise, Bioshock Infinite is just a chaotic mess that seems to be cleaved in two separate parts: the Columbia part (setting) and whatever pretentious story about multidimensions Ken Levine thought up. They seem to be at odds with each other, almost like they don't belong there. I don't know maybe that was the idea, but it still takes me out of experience and makes me realize I am playing yet another shooter with gimmicky and pretentious ideas about timelines (2010’s Bioshock-light clone Singularity sprang to my mind numerous times while playing, especially towards the end). \n\nI barely finished the game and my reward was one of the most confusing endings I have ever witnessed, that unloaded tons of \"revelations\" in the last 15 minutes. But if you really dig deep enough, you understand how truly shallow the game's narrative is and how it tries to mask it with needlessly complicated multiple dimension garbage, which has no relation whatsoever to Columbia or Rapture. Really, what integral connection is there between the setting of early 20th century fantasy-world of Columbia and the insanely convoluted story about multiverses and time loops? I failed to see any. The game might as well have been set in Ancient Rome or 25th century Martian colony and it would not have changed anything about the gist of the story. The basic narrative would have stayed the same mess devoid of actual themes other than redemption, I guess. Even that was done woefully poorly – Call of Juarez: The Gunslinger did a redemption arc in much more satisfying ways in just few lines of dialogue and with a tiny fraction of Infinite's budget, the very same year Infinite was unleashed on unsuspecting public, by the way. \n\nFinally, the Burial at Sea DLC – I won’t say much about it, except it looked promising at first, but ended up almost laughable in its pretentiousness. I won’t spoil much, but at times I legitimately thought I was watching a comedy sketch based on Bill and Ted movies. It was that absurd and borderline satirical. It doesn’t help, that there is a whole heap of plot holes the DLC introduces, so grave that even the people who liked Infinite are bothered. I just don’t care at this point. For me, Bioshock ended with really underrated Bioshock 2.","timestamp_created":1620500603,"timestamp_updated":1640628025,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91663079","author":{"steamid":"76561198930838931","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":211,"last_played":1620602535},"language":"english","review":"mmmm good","timestamp_created":1620499704,"timestamp_updated":1620499704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91661947","author":{"steamid":"76561198092235670","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":680,"last_played":1624575049},"language":"english","review":"I boght this game 7 years after watching Alexelcapo's let's play and i played for 11 hours straight.
