I know who you play as, and I know many facts about this game, but for the sake of reviewing just THIS game, I will review this as if I've only played through the first game.\n\nYou are a new test subject in Apeture Science Labs, testing the Portal gun (which is worth more than all the people in Subject Town 1 combined!) You will be going through 19 incredible puzzles, while being accompanied by GLaDOS, a computer/robot that appears to be in charge of running the experiments.\n\nFor those looking for a quick review, here you go. Portal is funny, entertaining, challenging, but not too difficult to the point you get angry. It's got a small story to follow, it's not too long, and the music is incredible. You will love this if you're even slightly a fan of puzzle games.\n\nNow, for those looking for the full review, let's get into it.\n\nOne quick thing to note: I love first-person Valve games like Half-Life and Portal because they contain environmental puzzles, and I absolutely love these. They are far more entertaining than puzzles normally found in games. I struggle to explain this, but if you've played through Half-Life/Half-Life 2, you'll know what I mean. The puzzles are built into the area around you, and the puzzle is trying to get past an obstacle.\n\nNow, I don't have a bunch to say about this game, because it is a rather short game (unless you attempt the Bonus Maps, which I'll talk about later). Still, this game is incredible for a few reasons. This game is humorous. GLaDOS is a very strange, creepy companion-ish robot that guides you through the puzzles. As you progress through, she begins to sound more corrupted and strange, and you'll learn what's going on once you reach the end of the game, which I am not spoiling. Even when she does sound more distorted, she has satire comments to give you, and it's all hilarious.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are a blast, and are the highlight of this game. There are multiple types of puzzles, and the obvious thing that makes this game different than others is the fact that you have a Portal Gun. This weapon allows you to create two portals, which connect to each other. This leads to a lot of physics-based and momentum puzzles. The puzzles are rather easy, while still being challenging in the sense that you will have to think about some, but not to the point that you get frustrated with it.\n\nThere's 19 test chambers, not counting the multiple puzzles within the innerworkings of the lab. There's plenty of hidden secrets and references in this game. There's secret areas where a mysterious man tries to explain how the cake that GLaDOS taunts the player with is a lie, in the sense that she is trying to kill you. He's a crazy man who managed to break into the innerworkings of the test chambers. While doing this, he had a Companion Cube with him, which he fell in love with. So clearly, he's crazy, and it's up to you whether or not you believe him when his scribbles say that GLaDOS is lying to you.\n\nI didn't go in depth on the puzzles for the simple fact that they're all unique, and it's something better experienced, rather than read. The same goes for the music, which is absolutely amazing. The highlight song of the game though is \"Still Alive\" which plays during the credits, and reveals more information about GLaDOS. This song is catchy, and sounds incredible.\n\nNow, as far as completion rewards, there's achievments, which are always satisfying. You get a new Main Menu scene for when you beat the game, which is nice. You also have access to all of the Bonus Challenges, which is where most of your time in this game will come from.\n\nThe Bonus Challenges come in three catagories- Least Portals, Least Steps, and Least Time. You can do these challenges for Chambers 13-18, and earn all Gold rankings on them, which gives you some more achievments. I personally haven't finished completing them all, but it's something fun to do if you really love this game.\n\nTo conclude, I loved this game from start to finish. There was never a dull moment, or a time where I was getting bored. I also like the fact that it's short enough to complete in one sitting. The puzzles are a blast, GLaDOS is hilarious, and the music is great. I'd gladly give Portal a [b]10/10[/b].","timestamp_created":1503689114,"timestamp_updated":1503689130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34487446","author":{"steamid":"76561198111870244","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1643160788},"language":"schinese","review":"good good","timestamp_created":1503686779,"timestamp_updated":1503686779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34486756","author":{"steamid":"76561198360982206","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1503511853},"language":"english","review":"Amazing Story\nAmazing gameplay\nGreat Credit and Ending","timestamp_created":1503684372,"timestamp_updated":1503684372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34486092","author":{"steamid":"76561198175496611","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":465,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":280,"last_played":1645109825},"language":"english","review":"thanks for killing our dreams","timestamp_created":1503682105,"timestamp_updated":1586622382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.368912965059280396","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34485866","author":{"steamid":"76561198275123649","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1503681299},"language":"english","review":"A brilliant game with an excellent but an unfortunately short story.","timestamp_created":1503681437,"timestamp_updated":1503681437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34484961","author":{"steamid":"76561198209763393","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":178,"last_played":1542917208},"language":"german","review":"Nach Abschluss der Kampagne kann ich dieses Spiel trotz des Alters nur weiterempfehlen!
