Teraz jesteś jednym z nich. A życie w Opposing Force nie jest łatwe. Jako żołnierz wysłany w celu wyeliminowania Gordona Freemana zostałeś oddzielony od swojej macierzystej bazy i odkryłeś nową rasę Obcych. Szybko okazuje się, że ta bardzo zaawansowana forma życia - znana na razie tylko jako rasa X - dostała się na Ziemię z laboratoriów Black Mesa, kiedy Gordon Freeman przebywał w świecie Xen.\n\n\n[h1] ROZGRYWA [/h1]\nChociaż początkowo zostałeś wysłany na Black Mesa tylko w celu uciszenia Freemana i jego naukowców, to w tej chwili musisz przede wszystkim walczyć o swoje życie z rasą X i licznymi innymi wrogami. Jednak jako specjalista wojskowy nie jesteś zupełnie bezbronny. Dysponujesz arsenałem najnowszych broni, w tym eksperymentalnych, a także bronią Obcych. W miarę zagłębiania się w kolejne obszary Black Mesa napotkasz zupełnie nowe postacie: przyjaciół i wrogów.\n\n\n[h1] AUDIO & GRAFIKA [/h1]\nWprowadzono doń cały szereg ulepszeń, takich jak animacja szkieletowa czy wsparcie dla Direct3D przez co gra nie wygląda tak najgorzej ale mimo wszystko grafika jest blokowata.

Life: Opposing Force[/u] is, like Half Life: Blue Shift, another spin-off of the famous video game Half Life.\n\nThis time, you will embark on the adventures of Corporal [u]Adrian Shepard[/u], a brave soldier from the American military, who, initially charged with capturing Gordon Freeman, will find himself having to cancel the mission and do the only more sensible thing: run away from Black Mesa at all costs!\nWith the help of the survivors of Black Mesa and his military companions, he will face the looming alien threat and the mysterious \"agents in black\", who also seem willing to hunt Gordon Freeman and eliminate anyone who dares to escape from Black Mesa.\n\nThe game proves much longer and richer in content (in fact you will be able to use many military weapons including the Desert Eagle which is a variant of the revolver, the LMG, the sniper rifle, the C4, the anti-personnel mine with laser sensor, the rocket-launcher with laser aiming system to guide missiles and even alien weapons, very useful when you run out of ammunition) and full of action compared to Half Life: Blue Shift (there are many types of aliens and zombies to face and there are the agents in black who are very tough).\n\nThe story may be trivial, but actually, like Half Life: Blue Shift, the game is another important part of the Half Life story.\nIn fact, through Shepard's eyes, you will be able to discover some parts of the Half Life story (for example the powerful explosion in Black Mesa, which occurred because of a bomb brought by the agents in black and tampered with by the mysterious Gman).\nWell yes, even in this game you will be able to meet Gman for more than once, who will sometimes try to help you and in other times he will try to stop you.\n\nAnother peculiarity of this game is the possibility of interacting with the characters, especially with the military companions, who will give you support by fighting alongside you (there are the engineer who, equipped with the blowtorch, can open any armored door and the doctor who will provide you with medical treatment).\nThe problem is their intelligence which is a little bad (they tend to disperse without reason and at some point they don't follow you, as if they don't see you anymore).\n\nThe game is a lot of fun because it gives you the impression of fulfilling a real military mission and acting like a soldier and above all there are some bosses to be eliminated.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1579983099,"timestamp_updated":1579983099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62389725","author":{"steamid":"76561198385036781","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1580233614},"language":"russian","review":"123455","timestamp_created":1579966969,"timestamp_updated":1579966969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62385885","author":{"steamid":"76561198857442455","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1619183524},"language":"russian","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1579962864,"timestamp_updated":1579962864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62384839","author":{"steamid":"76561198048718119","num_games_owned":269,"num_reviews":136,"playtime_forever":347,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":347,"last_played":1576373054},"language":"english","review":"Killing

Opposing Force é um jogo clássico excelente de ação[/h1]\n\nÉ um jogo muito interessante, o mesmo mostra certos acontecimentos do Half-Life 1 do ponto de vista de um militar chamado Shephard, passando por novas e também conhecidas localizações no complexo da Black Mesa, além de novas criaturas e armas novas, foi bem legal mesmo.\n\nO Jogo igualmente a versão \"Blue Shift\" é bugado, a mesma coisa de antes é que logo que você iniciar o jogo, vai perceber que tem algo errado com a câmera pois ela fica se movendo para direções aleatórias, isso se resolve indo em opções e na parte de \"Mouse\", procure uma opção chamado \"Enable Raw Input\" e ativando deve resolver.\nApesar de não ter um bug da versão \"Blue Shift\" da arma ficar atirando sozinha, esse foi introduzido um bug muito pior e horrível, que é por algum motivo você tem uma grande probabilidade de ficar preso nos elevadores sempre que eles terminam o percurso, teve uma ocasião que foram necessários 20 reloads até eu conseguir usar um maldito elevador e esse jogo eu acho que deve ter quase uns 10 elevadores que vc é obrigado a usar no total, apesar de não ser algo tão absurdo por ser possível dar quicksave antes de usar esses elevadores, fique atento a esse detalhe e sempre lembre de salvar antes de usar um.\n\n[b]Vale a pena comprar?[/b]\nSim, só que você tem que ter jogado pelo menos o Half-Life 1 e gostado do mesmo, se não gostou dele então não vai gostar desse, e durou bem mais que a versão \"Blue Shift\" que no qual foram umas 5 horas de campanha + multiplayer um pouco vazio, poucos servidores tem pessoas e sendo o mais popular atualmente um de gun game que tenho que admitir que é bem divertido e fica com uma média de 5 pessoas+bot nesse servidor, então minha opinião é vale a pena comprar,

no terminé de jugarlo, así que probablemente edite esta reseña más tarde.\nOpposing Force es otro juegazo. Si bien es un Half-Life, se siente distinto al original por las siguientes razones:\n-Hay mayor variedad de enemigos (Algunos son mucho más desafiantes que los del primer juego).\n-Mayor variedad de armas, dándote más opciones en un tiroteo, o incluso en resolver ciertos problemas.\n-Los puzzles se vuelven MUCHO más simples, no sé si es por el bien del jugador, la aparición de carteles repetitivos que te dicen qué hacer, o si fue solo el hecho de que agarré más experiencia al terminar HL1 con sus puzzles.\n-El diseño de los mapas (Black Mesa) tiene mucho más sentido que anteriormente, aunque sigue habiendo tonterías como depósitos de cajas cada medio capítulo.\n-Da una visión amplia del lado rival y ''malvado'', los HECU, al contrario que en Half Life, que todos usan el mismo uniforme y una misma función\n-etc.\n9.5/10\n\nEDIT\n\n(SPOILER ALERT)\n\n\n\nEl jefe final del juego es realmente decepcionante y aburrido. No solo eso, si no que siempre hace lo mismo. Matarlo ha sido un aburrimiento total. Modifico mi reseña sobre este juego.\nEl discurso de Gman fue... ok. No mejor que el de hacia Gordon pero de todas maneras bueno. Un final inconcluso. Me gustó. Linda
