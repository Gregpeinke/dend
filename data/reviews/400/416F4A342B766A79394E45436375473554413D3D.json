I beat the main story within 2 hours, and that includes bathroom breaks. There are, however, challenge maps/advanced maps which I am finding to be very enjoyable to play through, as they are far more interesting/challenging than the story puzzles. \n\nThough this game is short, it is lovable through-and-through. The witty humor, the concept of portals, the gear-grinding puzzles, and of course the little turrets. I almost felt guilty as I smashed a turret into his friend, ending both of their... lives?\n\nIf you like to get time for your money, I recommend waiting to get this game on sale (or just getting the second one, as it has fan-made content for never-ending portal fun). If you like to get content/an enjoyable experience out of your money, I recommend picking this game up whenever you get the chance.\n\nThe story great, in my opinion. It becomes more evident towards the end, where at the start the only real understanding I had of the story was placing a portal on the floor, and one on the ceiling and entering a never-ending joyride while listening to Glados talk about cake. \n\nOver-all, 8/10. Time is important to me, but enjoyment overrides it, and I found myself enjoying everything about this game. Hell, I'll even bump it up to a 9/10 just for the credits. \n\nHello?

An idea to use portal mechanic to create puzzles absolutely got me. I understand that it's a rather old game for today's standards, but I'd like to point some flaws of it. \n\nFirstly, it's rather short. Completing the main story took me around 2 hours. Not much comparing with other games. Don't expect a long journey from it, but on the other side, it's the time well spent.\n\nSecondly (that's gonna be a good one) - the puzzles were rather easy. I'm not telling it was a cakewalk (oops, that was an accident, I promise), but this game lacks real challenge aside from 6 advanced test chambers. That's only my opinion, though, I'd really appreciate to hear yours.\n\nBut there is also a thing I'd like to mention too - there are actually very few loading screens. Not like it has a crucial meaning, but it really makes you not die waiting.\n\nOverall, I do not regret playing this game. Of course, every game has it flaws, but hey - nothing's perfect. \nConsidering Portal's pros and cons, I can give it solid [b]7.5/10[/b]. See that game on sale? Buy it.

El modo historia se acaba en poco más de una hora si no has jugado nunca, esa es la pega. Pero tiene retos añadidos, sin embargo, estos retos son los mismos mapas que ves en la historia pero usando el mínimo de portales, mínimo de pasos o mínimo de tiempo. También encontraréis 6 mapas de la historia modificados para ser más complicados y a veces sí que suponen cierto reto. \n\nEn definitiva, es un juego que merece la pena comprar aprovechando que esté en rebajas del 75% o más.","timestamp_created":1451328465,"timestamp_updated":1451328465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20041446","author":{"steamid":"76561198261039328","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1591929239},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING GAME!!!!!\nLOVED EVERY MINUTUE OF IT\ngonna go play it again","timestamp_created":1451326891,"timestamp_updated":1451326891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20041234","author":{"steamid":"76561198188294478","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1583971240},"language":"english","review":"IT IS SSOOOOOO COOOOLL","timestamp_created":1451326425,"timestamp_updated":1451326425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+vjy9NECcuG5TA=="}
