Bardzo podoba mi się efekt graficzny a także małe wymagania systemowe tej produkcji. Uwielbiam Gry FPS w połączeniu ze strzelanką i z fabułą przeplataną światem science fiction, a jeśli gra posiada jeszcze świetny soundtrack, to jest to gra stworzona dla mnie, tak jak dla wielu innych fanów tego typu produkcji. Na prawdę, warto kupić Half-Life 2 za tą cenę 36 zł, lub na przecenie za mniej pieniędzy. Gra mi się bardzo spodobała.\n\nPodsumowując:\nJak najbardziej dla fanów którzy lubią strzelanki, science fiction oraz świetną fabułę.

There are 14 chapters in this game, some are very long and can take up to 1 hour to finish, while others are shorter. I have to say, all 14 chapters are very fun to play through and have memorable events in them.\n\nCompared to Half-Life 1, this game is very different, you're no longer stuck indoors all the time, the graphics are very different, the new weapons are so fun to use and now you can drive on vehicles which was so fun that i enjoyed repeating the levels over and over.\n\nThe story is fantastic, on my first playthrough it was full of surprises and kept me engaged and i wanted to keep playing to find out what happens next. Half-Life 2's ways of telling you where you need to go was very straight forward and simple, making the game very enjoyable. \n\nThe violence is extremely strong, some of the scenes in this game are pure shocking and the violence was pretty scary. For example, there are parts in the game where the game wants you to commit arson to protect yourself, and you can see zombies just burn and scream their heads off, then see the human heads all cut up. No mercy to the human enemies, which makes you understand that this game is serious, you now have to face war, the proper way, or never complete the level. \n\nOne thing to note is that this game is extremely long. It's probably the longest FPS single player game i can think of, took me 20 hours (Just like Half-Life 1 did) so if you enjoy long games, then this is perfect for you, however it doesn't drag and make you frustrated or bored at all. \n\nThe chapters have different themes, there is one particular chapter which i will not name (don't want to spoil) which is just completely different to all the other chapters, it felt like you were playing a completely different game. And those moments are very fun and keep you thinking what the hell you're gonna expect next. \n\nin my opinion, the first Half-Life was better, but this was also amazing! If you have not tried the Half Life games then you are missing out so much, this is one of the best games ever made and i can 100% agree to this. i had so much fun playing this game! one of the best single player games i have played in all my life","timestamp_created":1559922864,"timestamp_updated":1559922864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51100214","author":{"steamid":"76561197975825099","num_games_owned":581,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":883,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":883,"last_played":1521004523},"language":"english","review":"This is an exclusive Terry Bruge-Hiplo report:\n\nHalf life 2 is an experience quite like none other.

Very detailed, although textures didn't age very well. Also, I don't get why people always say \"The combat isn't very good\" because to me it feels fine. But that's just my opinion. Overall a very good game.\n\n1. The story is still superb, although some chapters such as Black Mesa East aren't as good after the first playthrough because of all the talking and scripted sequences.\n\n2. The combat is also great, although sometimes when you're below 15 health almost everything becomes almost an instakill, although health kits are more plentiful than original Half-Life.  If you think Half-Life 2's gunplay could use an overhaul, check out MMod, it overhauls the weapon animations, sounds, bullet physics, and more!\n\n3. The graphics are amazing for 2004, and still great today. You can run this game on almost any computer! The textures are quite low quality though, but you don't notice it that much unless you look at something closely. Some models can also be blocky though, but that's usually reserved for models such as the models used in the skybox, or the weapons NPCs carry. The character models and first person weapon models still look great.\n\n4. The physics are great, and what make mods such as Garry's Mod have so much freedom in building. Ragdolls are super good, and the way the Civil Protection and Combine Soldier ragdolls tighten up for a second when you kill them is great. Sometimes though the physics bug out, such as if you put something in a plastic crate then carry it.\n\n5. The sound design is really great, the world feels alive, voice actors are all amazing, weapon sounds are easy to tell apart, the only thing bad is that some sounds, notably ambient sounds, are super compressed, I get that it was 2004 and computers didn't have much space, but its still not that pleasing to the ears. Luckily, because Valve used to use stock sounds for almost everything, people have been finding the source sounds, then modding them into the game. The sound track is also great. There's a great mix between droning ambiance and punchy, fast-paced songs for combat.\n\n6. The mod support on this game is really good, its super easy to mod in sounds if you know what to do, and so many good games such as Garry's Mod, Team Fortress 2, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Black Mesa, Portal, and so much more are mods of this game or mods of this game's engine.\n\nSpoilers below! Do not continue down if you haven't played the entire game or watch someone play it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. The final chapter, Our Benefactors, is quite the enjoyable experience the first time. Your Gravity Gun gets supercharged and you can mow down Soldiers with ease. Though after a couple playthroughs, it isn't as fun. Most of it is riding a stalker pod, or talking with Breen, and the Super Gravity Gun isn't as fun to use anymore due to it being your only weapon. The chapter Sandtraps isn't great either, due to it being a long drag with barely any combat, and tons of platforming. And you have to keep off the sand, but usually my strategy is to just run to the one thumper, turn it on, kill the Antlions, then run to the Antlion Guard arena and kill it.\n\n\n\nOverall, Half-Life 2 is an amazing game with excellent sound design, visuals, story, and combat making for one of the best games of 2004.","timestamp_created":1559677831,"timestamp_updated":1628961870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50027763843536377","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51051500","author":{"steamid":"76561198288139168","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1588,"last_played":1628973820},"language":"english","review":"No emphasis on dodging whatsoever.
