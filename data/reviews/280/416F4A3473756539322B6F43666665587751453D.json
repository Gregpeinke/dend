Is it good? Yes, but it's got some issues. This game started out perfectly fine, and I had written a positive review with only about 3 hours on my belt, and it was pure fun. now with a solid 13 hours and a good amount of experience with bugs, I still enjoy the game, but I must insist if you want clean pure nostalgia and don't want something that goes as far as Black Mesa, play the original, this is fine, and has a lot of added benefits that are to be expected with an already great game being ported to the Source Engine. But that's all it is, a port, not that that's a bad thing, but the only thing this game has that stands out from the original is some of it's game breaking graphics glitches. At points it was so incredibly bad that my entire screen had been blocked out by glitched textures. And man, oh man The Gorge, the absolute worst part of this game. Now the section itself is fine, but at one point a Helicopter flies in and starts trying to nuke your ass like the US on Hiroshima, you have to shoot the thing with an RPG you've just found, only problem? The thing's hitbox is so small it's practically begging for you to make a dick joke about it. Now after a solid 45 minutes of shooting and loading my save, I finally gave up, went into God Mode and progressed to the next area. After that horrible experience, I've since experienced no more than the occasional graphics glitch. Overall, should you buy this game? If you can sit through a couple of lousy hitboxes, and graphics glitches, then go ahead. It's a pretty good game, I mean how bad can a port of the original be anyways?","timestamp_created":1561786942,"timestamp_updated":1563439004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51678677","author":{"steamid":"76561198024970562","num_games_owned":837,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2490,"last_played":1393151837},"language":"english","review":"HL: Source has a DirectX mode, which runs much better than original HL1's OpenGL mode on my laptop with old Intel integrated graphics.

It may seem playable at the beginning. But in fact it's a total garbage. And here i'm gonna tell you why\n\n1. HECU grunts won't deal you damage when you're looking 90 degrees up or down.\nNot even a joke, bullets just won't hit you, you can pass ALL areas with grunts by looking on your legs (oh, i forgot - no fucking legs here). It concerns not only grunts, but also turrets, Barneys, massns - everyone who use bullets.\n\n2. Crowbar bug from HL2\nRemember this bullshit in Half-Life 2 when Combine Soldiers couldn't do anything against crowbar? Their melee animations just stucked, so you were able to kill them by spamming crowbar attack. In HL Source this shit works not only with HECU, but also with Alien Grunts and Alien Slaves. It's just ridiculous that one of the most powerful enemies become dumbass losers when Freeman takes his crowbar. Idiotism.\n\n3. No damage from Tentacles\nFunny as hell but you are not supposed to do anything to encounter this trashy thing. Just reach Blast Pit chapter and enjoy Barney fighting Tentacles for 1 million years. You have to be the luckiest (or unluckiest?) bastard ever to get hit by Tentacle in this game (frankly speaking, on the lowest level this chance increases). And you've paid money for this, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n4. MP5 became useless piece of shit\nWell, name of this paragraph speaks for itself - try to kill someone from MP5 at a distance more than 3 metres, see what happens\n\n5. Fucked up reflections\nYou don't need flashlight inside the vent anymore since it's glowing like a goddamn Christmas Tree. Why? What does it reflects? Only Valve knows. Same thing with some other textures and especially with the water - sometimes it's HL2-like and sometimes just blurry translucent blanket. Looks awful and i don't remember such shit in HL2. New Source technology, huh?\n\n6. Gauss=MP5\nYes, useless too because you can't hit almost any surface without getting damage. You're just too scared to use it. Well, at least this explains why had Barney killed himself with it.\n\n7. Helicopter with fucked hitboxes\nWhen i was trying to pass the entire game without getting any damage that cliff in Surface Tension chapter has spoiled my nerves damn hard since i weren't able to hit helicopter by shooting AT it. Only much later i understood that i have to fire UNDER helicopter. Absurd, isn't it? No, HL Source. Same thing for Houndeyes, by the way.\n\n8. Anomalous Materials bug\nDon't laugh guys, but there is a bug that doesn't let you pass through Barney after getting a HEV suit. I've always skipped this part, prefering to start from c1a1 but once decided to pass Anomalous as well. And what did i get? I've got a suit but Barney didn't open the door! What the fuck?! Imagine: you have bought the game and after 10 minutes of playing you're getting THIS! Hilarious.\n\nI could write few more paragraphs, but isn't it enough? This game is ass.

Black Mesa is great and all, and i highly recommend, but i guess in my own sadistic way, i prefer the original aesthetics over that.\n\nHowever, i did encounter a bug that would crash my game when i would enter the next level (after rocket launch into space), and made my autosave corrupt. It did it again, and would corrupt the second autosave (this game has 2 autosaves). So i had to replay 2 levels, because that's the last time i manually saved. The crash hasn't happened again since then, and i have successfully managed to finish the game, but i did see a lot of reviews saying that HL1 source is very buggy since 2013 patch, and apparently most bugs have no solutions.","timestamp_created":1561069597,"timestamp_updated":1561069597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526782453060150146","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51344611","author":{"steamid":"76561198445206904","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":751,"last_played":1556048877},"language":"english","review":"It's Half-Life but shinier.

done, Mr. Freeman. I will see you up ahead.\n\nPROS: As stated in my previous review, nearly every piece of this game can be considered a positive.  The gameplay is tight, and the weapons give a 'mere' physicist the feel of an almost immortal powerhouse.  The soundtrack plays haunting and spine tingling tones at the proper moments, and the sound effects each have a solid kick to them.  The aliens are all designed in a way to be unfamiliar rather than terrifying, giving them an otherworldly feel without making them feel undefeatable.  The story, of course, is the clear shining point, taking a first person narrative with no interaction of the player, and giving it a sense of scope and agency that makes you question what else was going on behind the scenes, what deals were undertook while Dr. Freeman helped begin the resonance cascade.  And most importantly, the Source version takes minor improvements to polish the game up even more.\n\nCONS: Although the action shift can be a small turnoff, the major issue comes from first person platforming, creating a sense of unease upon dropping into an environment that one hopes their feet just happen to exist in today.\n\nFINAL: Half-Life is one of the games that defined the path to modern FPS games, and even other genres.  It's powerful mix of gameplay into the story creates an experience that must be played to truly see everything it did, highlighting some of the best parts of classic FPS gameplay.  In my opinion, a must play for any fan of FPS games.","timestamp_created":1560044198,"timestamp_updated":1560044198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51126557","author":{"steamid":"76561198067343516","num_games_owned":535,"num_reviews":106,"playtime_forever":233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":233,"last_played":1527215802},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good for a game from 1998.","timestamp_created":1560032066,"timestamp_updated":1560032066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519320249557495117","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51113074","author":{"steamid":"76561198882296560","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":415,"last_played":1559320172},"language":"english","review":"gae m good. will buy.\n\n","timestamp_created":1559980630,"timestamp_updated":1559980630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482093662023544312","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51096372","author":{"steamid":"76561198301186134","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1561820622},"language":"turkish","review":"Mazi oyunun kaliteli versiyonu","timestamp_created":1559904575,"timestamp_updated":1559904575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461506366729736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51090551","author":{"steamid":"76561198426384866","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":881,"last_played":1644368031},"language":"spanish","review":"Me acabo de completar el juego y me encantó, me gusta que sea largo pero divertido, 100% Recomendado","timestamp_created":1559872785,"timestamp_updated":1559872785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517906367778778076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51036374","author":{"steamid":"76561198114750497","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":151,"last_played":1557251170},"language":"english","review":"cool and good","timestamp_created":1559591495,"timestamp_updated":1559591495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51031477","author":{"steamid":"76561198326757481","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":78,"playtime_forever":139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":139,"last_played":1559494133},"language":"russian","review":"Графика уже устарела но для того времени это было не плохо.
