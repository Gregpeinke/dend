Exatamente o oposto dos títulos anteriores, a nova cidade explorada em Infinite está nos ares, viva e radiante, e também bastante hostil. O desenrolar da história gera situações ainda mais confusas que só poderão ser entendidas com atenção total à trama, que possui elementos interessantes e com a loucura característica de um Bioshock.\n\nO motor gráfico utilizado é uma versão bastante modificada da Unreal Engine 3, e que por sinal, foi muito bem aproveitada: os cenários e modelos são muito bem trabalhados, e a iluminação e efeitos proporcionados pelo motor incrementam ainda mais a visualização do universo do jogo, o nível de detalhes chama a atenção.\n\nA jogabilidade mantém o tiroteio frenético junto ao uso de poderes sobrenaturais, uma combinação letal e essencial no jogo. A troca de armas e habilidades místicas é mais intuitiva e dinâmica e há uma variedade maior no arsenal. Além do combate aprimorado, a nova cidade de Bioshock Infinite, por planar nas nuvens, apresenta trilhos que fazem com que você possa se locomover rápidamente pela cidade e te da uma vantagem estratégica no combate, algo criativo e divertido, fora a ajuda de sua companheira, que pode mudar os rumos da luta.\n\nA trilha sonora também é rica, os sons ambientes não deixam a desejar e as músicas tocadas em combate combinam bem com o estilo do jogo, fora a adição de algumas músicas de compositores clássicos como Chopin e Mozart, que também dão um clima ao contexto do jogo.\n\nSem receios, Bioshock Infinite é mais um título de ótima qualidade da série, obrigatório para os fãs e fácilmente indicado para o público em geral, especialmente para os apreciadores de jogos de tiro em primeira pessoa.","timestamp_created":1392707373,"timestamp_updated":1392707373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9164469","author":{"steamid":"76561198061105968","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1178,"last_played":1480202348},"language":"english","review":"This game is amazing in every way.

Bioshock Infinite blends top notch story telling with fantastic, fastpaced, gameplay. The Skyhook traversing system adds to the already diverse combat system and compliments the swashbuckling pace of combat encounters. \n\nWhere the original Bioshock was more of a horror genre shooter, and focuses on the player feeling that their power is limited, Infinite gives the player sense of empowerment and satifaction that would be dificult to top.\nBut a huge element setting Infinite apart is its fantastic writing. It is constantly intriguing and leaving the player asking what's arround the next corner. While there are parts of the story that tend to lean towards over complex concepts used for the convienence of advancing the more nonsensical parts of the plot, it isn't enough to really devalue your experiance or distract you from the overarching story. \n\nWithout giving anything away, THE ENDING WILL STICK WITH YOU. Some people will love it, some will hate it, but there is no denying the overall impact of it, after the rollercoaster ride of the game. \n\nWhile many games in 2013 had great story telling, but only simply good gameplay, or the reverse of that, Infinite excelled in both catagories, and wove the gameplay into the narative, very smoothly making in central to the overall concepts at play in the plot as well.\n\nWhen it comes to graphics, Infinite is gorgeous and atmospheric. It features brilliant attention to detail. The art direction creates sense of disonance with the violence of the game, that actually aids in pushing the overall themes and characterization at play. Enough said.\n\nBuy it. Play it. You will be hard pressed to find a game will give you such a lasting and worthwhile experience. \n\nSide note the DLC is equally fantastic, if you want explore the world and the questions it leaves you with further.","timestamp_created":1392676455,"timestamp_updated":1392676455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9160687","author":{"steamid":"76561198027862458","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":913,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":890,"last_played":1392653760},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegazo de los pies a la cabeza!

Booker is responsive to the situations/discussions he finds himself thrown into, which helps attain that sense of immersion developers strive to create. It does the job far better than any Gordon Freeman character ever could. Can't really talk about Booker without mentioning Elizabeth too :- the best AI companion i have ever seen in a game. The lengths the designers went to to make her feel as if she were a real companion, it's simply amazing. Cant really go into detail about the characters and storyline otherwise i'd be spoiling the game, but both are great and are fluid such that you just want to see what waits around the next corner... [spoiler] Most likely a bloody turret. [/spoiler]\n\nMy only general complaint about Bioshock infinite is that the worst thing about it is also one of its biggest strengths - it's completely different whilst being more or less exactly the same. Rapture? plasmids. Columbia? Vigors. Big daddies? Rapture. Handymen? Columbia. Rapture? Atlas/Eleanor. Colombia? Elizabeth. Civil war? Colombia & Rapture. A lot of the core elements feel as if they have just been reskinned and repackaged as something new - though ultimately they are pretty much some of the reasons i fell in love with the series. So if anything, it refreshed the franchise while retaining what i really held dear to it. Don't mistake the similarities as its only content however, as there are a fair few scenarios that you would never have expected to see in a bioshock game. Lets just put it like that.\n\nAs far as the little details are concerned, the top end graphics are beautiful, the combat is often mixed up in most situations and there are a few places you'll visit which will give you a hint of nostalgia. With the graphics though, its a killer for lower end machines even on lower settings. At least have the reccomended stats to have a reasonably enjoyable time.\n\nTo sum up, i'd definetely reccomend it to anyone thats played the previous games, even to the newcomers to bioshock (though you may not understand a few references hidden in the enviroments).

The trailer has attracted my attention first, then while watching it I was already impressed to get it. The trailer has shown me many things I would like to do in a game. Hook into skycranes and skylines and fly around with it for fun. The graphics require a beast of a GPU: By the incredible look of it, it's obvious to have some powerful hardware. And the pretty girl in the role has got me too XD. \nI was tired of wandering in the depts of rapture so did the developers expected. A city in the sky is something brand new to experience. The keypoints of what i especialy liked in Bioshock Infinite are:\n+ The design of: Levels, sounds, graphics, storyline, foes... They are just... WONDERFUL! I can't explain it accurately enough!\n+ The arsenal of the protagonist Booker DeWitt is reasonable big even if it may come limitted. Deal with it :) I did.\n+ You have a range of Vigors (or Plasmids) to use. Each is special for something.\n+ Love the pretty girl :) (not literally lol!) [spoiler]♥ Elizabeth ♥[/spoiler]\n+ The lenght of the game is pretty long enough. This plus is missing on most singleplayer titles. I've beaten it in 12,8 hours. Remember, that i was NOT rushing trough the game like a speedrunner or some other gamers but i was going to explore, what the developers put behind the scenes and levels.\n+ Liked the cutscenes with First-Person camera and animations. They are designed with much details and fairly-real movement-animation.\n+ Liked the english voice acting. It's fitting almost perfectly.\n+ Again I can not say enough, how much I liked the storyline... from the beginning especialy. It was actualy very touching. Almost indept touching...\n+ Very interesting adventure\n+ Okay you've got to trust me on this one, if I am going to tell more it is going to SPOIL and RUIN your gaming experience and fun!\n\nNow to the negative sides:\n- I miss one content. It's a spoiler! Avoid hovering your mouse here if you have not played Bioshock Infinite yet ([spoiler]My most favourite element plasmid is not available in this title. ICE. Icy warfare for me![/spoiler])\n- Placeholder!!! As soon as I find something to complain about I will let the readers know.\n\nWhen I have beaten the game I was sad :( i LOVED THIS GAME and i WANT MORE. No, no, no, no this can't be the end.

My main complaint is that there is no variation in the game, the enemies all behave the same, the powers all do the EXACT same thing, 1 projectile attack and 1 trap attack, the guns are completely unoriginal and have nothing noteworthy of interest, standard pistols, shotguns, submachineguns etc, and the characters are all one dimensional idiots with \"dark pasts\". I literally couldn't care less.  If you're looking for a cliche FPS game with cheap emotional plot points, then this is the gmae for you.

It has all the makings of a game that will keep you griped onto the edge of your seat from the vairy moment you start playing. unlike BioShock 1&2 the story is vairy rich full of imagination and a over all sence of a deeper thought to the plot but with no spoilers. On top of that it is a (First Person Shooter) FSP for short. It flows smooth and the controles handle like a dream, (I play mine with a Xbox-360 controler so with a key board it will vary) And finaly we come to the graphics wich left me with my eyes gluid to the screen, it is vivid and sharp in all areas making this game not only atractive to the mined but to the eyes as well. As for scares and suspens in battle there are a few but for me there was only one that had me puase the game and colect my sences befor moving on. But for the most part it is vairy casual game play but has a way to blow your mined when you least expect it. And as for the rest, I look forword to buying the DLC's and playing them. Yes bioShock Infinite is a master piece and i would recomend it to anyone.","timestamp_created":1392527051,"timestamp_updated":1392527051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9131722","author":{"steamid":"76561198052767983","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1307,"last_played":1450340467},"language":"english","review":"Great graphics, addicting story. buy it god damnit!","timestamp_created":1392517849,"timestamp_updated":1392517849,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9131711","author":{"steamid":"76561198008849573","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":29,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27,"last_played":1516549394},"language":"english","review":"Played for 30 minutes.
