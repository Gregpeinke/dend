However, the more I played it the more I realised how great the game was.\n\nWhether you want to be a hack 'n' slash beserker, a madman with a flamethrower, tactical sharpshooter, close range support specialist, generalist commando, explosives wielding maniac or the much needed field medic, KF gives players a diverse range of classes in which to dispatch of the enemy hordes. Each of these classes allows for destruction in their own unique way, however the game really shines when teamwork is utilised. The more I played it, the more I realised that either play together or it is likely you will die alone getting your face bitten off by a Clot or some other twisted version of a science experiment gone wrong.\n\nNot only does KF offer a great range of potential classes to play, but a diverse range of enemies to massacre. These range from the common slow moving Clot or the obese vomiting Bloat, to a mad chainsaw wielding Scrake or the final dreaded Patriarch, with plenty more to be discovered between waves. KF provides players with enemies that are better suited to certain player classes, especially as the difficulty and map duration goes up. This really solidifies the need for teamwork.\n\nThe graphics aren't the best by today's standards, but it is the gameplay that draws you in to the extent that you won't care about them anyway. Furthermore, KF is a great LAN game not only for the team based aspect or that it is easy to pick up and play, but for the fact that it can be run on fairly low spec PC's so pretty much any player can get involved. Another cool aspect I think is that at Halloween and Christmas KF have previously released themed units and maps. This may be a little gimmicky for some, but I enjoy 'slaying' twisted Santas' minions, ha.....\n\nOne of the only real criticisms I have of the game is that you are limited to 6 players in matches without steamworkshop contributions. This is a bit of a pain, especially at a lan, but it can be worked around. Another thing that can get a little repetitive after hours of play is the player narration. “can't you see i'm reloading”, “i'm trying to heal you not shag you”. While funny at first, it can get on your nerves.\n\nNever the less, taking all the above into account, and the fact that it goes on sale so frequently at below $5, I believe that it is worth your time, money and the addition slot in your steam library. Achievement hunters, lan enthusiats, casual players and those hardcore individual looking for a challenge will all find KF to be worth your investment.","timestamp_created":1401233850,"timestamp_updated":1401354645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10257346","author":{"steamid":"76561198051236069","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":35413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33874,"last_played":1610406344},"language":"english","review":"Choose your perk, grab your gun, get ready and kill\n\nKilling floor is one hell of a game, very good, lots of guns and 7 perks to choose, From Medic to demolition.\nDifficulty from Beginner (Aka, Zeds dont even know you exist) to Hell On Earth..

In between each wave you can spend money you earned on weapons. The game has many more weapons than Left 4 Dead and the variety of the weapons is incredible. There are a multitude of maps to try out. It's very fun to try out different weapon combos. \n\nThis game is HARD, the game adds in more enemies as more people join. The zombies can jump off roof tops and pounce on you from just about any angle. The shooting is also very realistic. There is no targeting reticle and when you move you lose accuracy. If you try to shoot randomly, you will undoubtedly miss a whiole ton of shots and waste your very limited ammo. This makes the game more about positioning and strategy then mechanics. You will have to think about which doors to weld and which pathways to defend.\n\nAlso this will run on just about everything.  Its actually bizzare how well optimized it is. This isn't Crysis but considering how how detailed and large the maps are, its amazing.","timestamp_created":1401154511,"timestamp_updated":1401154511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10246905","author":{"steamid":"76561198073680977","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":13497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10369,"last_played":1561855140},"language":"english","review":"I still don't know if this is my family trying to speak to me in very nebulous metaphors or it's my therapist trying to end my life. \n\n\nEither way, I still will continue to gut these puss-bags like they're my siblings. :^)","timestamp_created":1401152725,"timestamp_updated":1457080670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10246825","author":{"steamid":"76561198021425284","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2131,"last_played":1403488249},"language":"english","review":"a bunch of old people that smell bad try to steal your spare chagne i think? i got scared","timestamp_created":1401151891,"timestamp_updated":1401151891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5734596848487854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ446TKncYCeaqLJw=="}
