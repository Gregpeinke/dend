The game is evenly paced, so the game is a learning experience rather than a frustrating one. The best part about Portal is that it utilizes the source engine, which allows user created materials to freely flow around the internet waiting for you to download and play. You have to use both your lateral thinking and cognition to decide where the portals should go. In most cases there isn’t multiple ways to solve a portal puzzle, but they are designed so meticulously that your brain will pick it up immediately after a quick analysis.

It's a first-person shooter where your gun allows you to link two locations with portals. Send objects or yourself through portals to solve a series of physics puzzles in the mysteriously empty Aperture Science Laboratories, all while under the instruction of the abusive AI, GLaDOS.[/b]\n\nSome of the puzzles in Portal can be difficult, but are extremely gratifying when you manage to figure them out. The use of portals and the Portal Gun are so creative and unique that almost everyone has heard of Portal before. There's a real build-up of mystery and intrigue as you go through the test chambers, which culminate in an action-packed finale. The star of the show is GLaDOS, the facility's AI which \"guides\" you through each of the tests, whose true personality and ulterior motives are hinted at throughout the game. Overall, Portal is a great experience. However, the game is rather short, and doesn't have a lot of replay value.\n\nDefinitely pick it up and play it at least once.
