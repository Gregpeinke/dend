The new weapons are pretty fun to mess around with and Race X is a interesting new type of enemy that feels rather different from all the aliens you fight in the base game. It's also pretty interesting to see the different perspective of the marines, there are several moments where you see events from the base game from another angle. Something I specifically I don't like are the new AI squad mates who can fight alongside you as their pathfinding is not great, they are easily killed, and they are capable of friendly fire but they are required in several segments to cut through doors or heal other squad members who then cut through doors. However much like regular Half Life, the good far outweighs the bad.","timestamp_created":1610629445,"timestamp_updated":1610629445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84668462","author":{"steamid":"76561199064102812","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":68,"last_played":1644667725},"language":"english","review":"I absolutely love this one.

present in Half Life 1 and then continues to blow your mind with the vast amount of new weapons, traversal opportunities and enemy types that are introduced and the challenges that these present.\n\nThere's no argument, if you're going to buy Half Life 1 then you must buy Opposing Force with it - or you could buy the Half Life 1 Anthology like I did because you then get Blue Shift for free! ;)\n\n[i] There was an issue with the mouse locking when I first loaded the game up, this can be fixed by going into 'Options', the 'Mouse' tab and clicking the checkbox which says 'Raw mouse input' - the issue never happened again and otherwise the game is flawless :)

Bu oyunun yapımcısı Valve ile çok çalışmış bir firma. Oyunda başlangıçta verdiği tabanca süper. Öncelikle oyun bitince oyunda bir şeyler eksik hissediyorsunuz. Bazı yerler gereksiz zorken bazı yerler gereksiz şekilde çok kolay. Ben bitirdiğime şükür ettim. Oyun daha çok Doom' a benziyor. Her yerden canavar çıkıyor, haritada boş kalan her yere gıcık kapacağınız şekilde aynı canavarları koymuşlar, tamam bitti derken aynı canavardan tekrar çıkıyor tekrar tekrar ve tekrar çıkıyor artık bıkıp oyunu kapatıyorsunuz anlayacağınız tek amaç öldürmek. Kafa kullanacak bir bölüm tarzı yok. Half Life 1' e kıyasla Valve 'nin yapmadığı bariz şekilde anlaşılıyor. Silah çeşitliği var ama doğrusunu söylemek gerekirse 3 silahla çok rahat oyun bitiriliyor. Sonlara doğru çok uzun zaman hep gece görüş kullanmak zorunda kaldım ortam çok karanlıktı(keşke fener olsaydı), gözlerim çok yoruldu. Genel anlamda hiç zevk vermedi. Çok hata var özellikle asansör hataları beni yedi bitirdi, asansördeyken bu hata yüzünden asla hareket edemiyorsunuz. Bu yüzden her asansöre gelmeden önce save yapmanızı öneririm. Ben beğenmedim. Half Life 1' in grafikleri ile oyun oynamayı seviyorsanız alın derim ama sevecek kişi bence yoktur. Bölüm tarzı çok güzel olsaydı ve hatalar olmasaydı önerirdim. Son olarak Valve bu yazıyı okur musun ? bilmem. Bu zamana kadar oyunlarda ortaklaşa iş yapmışsınız. Ama bu adamlara zamanında fikir olarak yardım etseydiniz, bölüm tasarımı bence çok güzel olabilirdi. Oyuna çok güzel eklemeler yapmışlar. Silahlar tam olarak bilim kurgu oyununa benzemiş. Özellikle silah olarak canavarları kullanma konusunda iyi düşünmüşler.
