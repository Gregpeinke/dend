Хочу в космос[/i][/h1]\nPortal 2 уникальная игра в жанре пазл-адвенчура, которая по мнению многих являются лучшие игрой Valve, лично я придерживался такого же мнения пока не вышла Half life: Alyx, но это уже другая история. Итак, разберемся со всеми основными аспектами игры:\n[h1]Сюжет[/h1]\nДобротный сюжет, который наконец отвечает на все вопросы первой части и полноценно раскрывает всех фигурирующих в игре персонажей. Хоть по началу и кажется что сюжет топчется на месте выбрасывая нас на те же тесты из первой части, но вскоре [spoiler] после побега от GlaDos [/spoiler] игра начинает раскрывать все свои преимущества.\n[h1]Геймплей[/h1]\nПо сравнению с первой частью геймплей игры значительно преобразился. Во первых были вырезаны ненужные механики из 1 части, а взамен предложили более интересные воздушные воронки, мосты плотного света и это не весь список нововведений. Во вторых Добавление гелей, которое по моему мнению привносит а игру разнообразие в плане прохождения уровней.\n[h1]Персонажи[/h1]\nПерсонажи Portal 2 харизматичны, будь это ИИ GLaDos со сложным характером или молчаливая Челл, а также стоит выделить своеобразный юмор игры, который построен в основном на научных терминах. \n[h1]Графика[/h1]\nО графике сказать особенно нечего, Source делает свое дело. \n[h1]Кооператив[/h1]\nКооператив Portal 2 практически идеален. Более сложные тестовые камеры, введение двух новых героев (испытуемых роботов), каждый из которых уникален, все такой же неплохой юмор и наличие своего локального сюжета. Но почему практически идеален? Роботов можно кастомизировать, хоть сами скины и не плохие но сам факт наличия магазина в такой игре немного огорчает.\n[h1] Кастомные карты от пользователей[/h1] \nЭтот пункт является одним из самых важных, так как повышает реиграбельность игры в разы и позволяет игрок побывать в шкуре создателя тестовых комнат, которыми пользователи могут делиться и оценивать. Хоть и редко, но все же иногда встречаются шикарные комнаты со своими уникальными фишками.\n[h1]Итог[/h1]\nОдин из лучших проектов Valve, в который стоит сыграть хоть раз, благо ценник позволяет.

I first played it on the Xbox 360, but never completed it until later on. I started a \"Let's Play Series\" of the game on my YouTube channel back in January of 2018, a little while after I got my old Gaming PC and I quickly fell in love with it. (Oh and not that kind of love, ya sickos!) Since then I've made 13 videos so far, 12 of them being videos from my \"Let's Play Series\" and one of them being a \"Custom Chambers\" video, AND that's not counting the second \"Custom Chambers\" video I've been working on, OR the \"Portal 2 Co-op\" video that isn't edited, but is recorded. The game is one of two game series that I've actually completed on my channel, the other one being: \"Octodad: Dadliest Catch.\" And the thing is is that \"Octodad: Dadliest Catch\" is my FIRST ever series that I completed on my channel so you'd think that I would like that game more, but that's obviously not the case because I only made 7 videos on that game whereas I made 13 on Portal 2 AAANNNDDD..... I'm getting ahead of myself, so the only solution is for me to actually review the game and for me to stop rambling.\n\nThe Review:\nNow there's a few things to clarify before I start the review.\n\nNumber one: I have played and completed Portal 1. So for the people who read this review and know my YouTube channel they might be confused when I talk about Portal 1 because I haven't played for the channel. (Trust me, I will play it eventually.)\n\nNumber two: I might not be able to do a more in-depth review of the game because of a 1 year time gap between my 10th and 11th episodes of my \"Let's Play Series\" of the game, which in turn made me forget some of the test chambers.\n\nAnd finally Number three: This review contains spoilers for both Portal 1 and Portal 2.\n\nWith that all said let's start the review...\n\nThe Story: Portal 2 is the sequel to the award winning puzzle game \"Portal\" and is, like Portal 1, a puzzle game as well! Both games are story based and revolve around the \"Aperture Science\" facility, where an evil robot named \"GLaDOS\" killed \"ALMOST\" all the scientists on \"Bring Your Cat to Work Day.\" In the beginning of Portal 1 you wake up and GLaDOS makes you perform puzzles in \"Test Chambers\" with a device called the \"Portal Gun.\" Which allows you to make interdimensional wormholes where you can enter one \"portal\" and come out the other. You then escape and defeat GLaDOS by grabbing her \"cores\" and incinerating them. You are then sucked up and you face the outside, but you are then pulled back to the facility by an unknown figure which is revealed to be a purple core with arms in the \"Portal 2: Lab Rat\" comic. (Side Note: The \"Portal 2: Lab Rat\" comic is a comic that links what happens between the end of Portal 1 and the beginning of Portal 2, and features the character \"Doug Rattmann.\") At the beginning of Portal 2 you wake up after, let me just say A VERY LONG TIME and you are introduced to the character \"Wheatley.\" Then you wake up GLaDOS and OKAY!!! This is going on for a little too long.\n\nThe ACTUAL Review: So basically Portal 2 has a pretty lengthy story, much longer that Portal 1's story. And Portal 2's story is pretty dang good. The end is good and I like how the final boss fight with Wheatley is like the one from Portal 1 except instead of taking OFF and destroying GLaDOS's cores, with Wheatley your stunning Wheatley and putting cores ON. Like I said the end is good, with you finally facing the outside world and are free. Because you are free I'm not sure if Valve would really need to make a Portal 3, but of course I DEFINITELY WANT PORTAL 3!!! Anyways, Portal 2 also has Co-op and Custom Chambers on PC so that's also great. But yeah, I'm not sure what else to say. Portal 2 is great and being the same price as Portal 1 means your definitely getting more bang your buck, but I still think Portal 1 is great too it's just that Portal 2 is even better and holds a bigger place in my heart. So yeah...\n\nJUST GET IT!!!!!","timestamp_created":1594840925,"timestamp_updated":1594841821,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72747058","author":{"steamid":"76561198388951800","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2356,"last_played":1645301233},"language":"english","review":"Excellent game!

Игра классная, VALVE хоть где-то постарались. Хоть на момент 2020 года игра уже немного старая, но графика, текстуры и картинка вообще смотрятся всё равно очень современно и красиво. Наиграл 22 часа (на момент написания обзора), ничуть не жалею, сам не заметил как пролетели))) . Сюжет прикольный, интересный, захватывающий. Единственное что не понравилось, так это размусоливание в начале, обучение как для идиотов), но думаю тем кто с серией знаком не был, как и с самими играми от компании было полезно. Насчёт кооператива, то лучше играть только со знакомыми и друзьями, потому что люди из рандомного подбора иногда туповаты или токсичны, следовательно сговориться и работать как единое целое (а в этом режиме это необходимо) у вас вряд ли получится. пасхалки и отсылки приятные и узнаваемые, озвучка великолепная, особое внимание хочу уделить русскому переводу, просто респект. Скины есть красивые и оригинальные, но по моему мнению они в игре лишние (я не виню разработчиков за то что скины есть, ведь это способ заработка, а кто-то терпеть не может игры без альтернативных текстур и окрасок (надо ведь выделяться) и само собой разумеется, что это моё личное мнение). В общем-то, игрой я доволен, своих денег стоит, Так что если вы не тратили мамины деньги в столовой, а копили на покупку в Стим, то спокойно покупайте.  \n\nСпасибо за внимание, это был мой первый
