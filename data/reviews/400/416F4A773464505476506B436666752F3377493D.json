I played Portal 1 years ago, but never came around to finishing the game. Now, revisiting older games during this downtime for games had me revisit Portal 1. This game has first person gameplay. There are puzzles to learn and complete. The game starts with levels which are designed as tutorials, but the player does not get large boxes on screen holding their hands. The design of Portal 1 is interesting because there is a natural progression of the game. The very beginning you learn the basics. As a result, the levels towards the end are a culmination of the previous puzzles wrapped in a bow for the player. This is an entertaining and enjoyable game. Portal 1 does not outstay its welcome. The game designers and developers could have elected to add more gameplay and puzzles, but they chose not to. Anyone who has played the game before and not yet finished the game should come back and fire it up again.

The art design, however, is appealing through its sterile and futuristic appearance; the environmental primary color scheme of white, gray and blue gives the convincing impression of an automated, high tech location with a suspicious lack of life signs. Animation is reserved for the occasional moving set-piece or enemy entity. It is nice to see your physical character model through portal holes, yet you still bear a curious form of the \"first person ghost\" syndrome, and your legs and lower body are invisible when looking down.\n\nThe menu interfaces are as simple as Half-Life 2's, being constructed mostly of plain text elements with a couple of thumbnails for the levels you can load. In gameplay, the HUD is even more minimal as the most you'll get regularly is close captions and subtitles. \n\nPerformance and stability are excellent - praise the Source Spaghetti Monster! On my system with a 12-core CPU, 64GB RAM and 1070Ti the framerate was consistently above 300 FPS.\n\n[h3]Good job! As part of a required test protocol, we will stop enhancing the truth in three, two, o-[i]bzzt[/i][/h3]\n\nIn keeping with Valve's tradition throughout the 2000s, the synth/electronic music is subdued and minimal but has moments where it picks up in intensity according to the situation that unfolds. The Portal Gun's sound effects are wholly satisfying, while the remainder of the SFX library is still recognizably based off of HL2's, especially the metal impacts, enemy weapon fire and general interaction. The winner in the audio department is the dialogue lead by GLaDOS, who communicates objectives, advice and \"trivia\" with an initially deadpan demeanor. Throughout the game she gradually shows human-like traits and reveals its more openly hostile side, whilst delivering copious amounts of particularly dark humour. The other recurring dialogue is from the turrets set about in the later parts of the game, who have a dissonant cheerful and polite tone despite being, well, murderous automated weapons.\n\n[code]Is anyone there?[/code]\n\nThe game starts out with simple puzzle elements based on opening doors by weighing down buttons with \"weighted storage cubes\". It doesn't take long to have the levels become interesting and complex, which is achieved largely with the game's primary gimmick, the Portal Gun. It is introduced as a tool to create paths between hard-to-reach places and allow the player to move rapidly across the chambers. Later on it gets upgraded, allowing the player to freely shoot both portal ends at any white surfaces. The puzzles also become more complex, requiring momentum preservation, tighter timing and better avoidance and exploitation of the frequent hazards. You're given helpful advice along the way from GLaDOS, such as how the toxic goop is toxic and you should avoid it, lest your test result is unsatisfactory. Not to mention it kills you.\n\n[h3]Now that you are in control of both portals, this next test could take a very, very, long time. If you feel lightheaded from thirst, feel free to pass out.[/h3]\n\nThe nature of the Portal Gun provides extensive freedom to solve the majority of puzzles in the game, even in ways not intentionally designed by the creators. Several levels can be conceivably skipped or trivialized through smart exploitation of the momentum carried over between the two portal holes. It is, however, quite literally rough around the edges. There's a good chance you'll get caught or tripped up by the solid outline of your portals, misjudge chained jumps by a fraction of an inch, or drop objects you were carrying between them. Adding onto that, the view self-righting is very slow, and this can potentially disorient you in time-sensitive moments. In fairness, these are minor annoyances with the physics and movement system, and the rest of the game is well behaved in that regard. Plus, you're promised cake at the end of the game, and cake is great.\n\n[h3]Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-[i]bzzt[/i][/h3]\n\nThe story is concluded in roughly two or three hours, so you'll probably be wanting more. Advanced test chambers provide experienced players with a more difficult set of levels that eliminate prior shortcuts, while challenges task you with finishing regular chambers in the least time, fewest steps or fewest portals used. They're welcome for the variety and longevity, but the whole package can still be completed in under seven hours, including dedicated achievement hunting.\n\n[b][i]Portal[/i][/b] is an excellent first-person puzzler bearing the charisma to remain a unique experience even to this day, and a high recommendation overall.\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41371179/]Check out Tomato's Bag of Games for more high quality reviews on great games.[/url][/quote]","timestamp_created":1621352083,"timestamp_updated":1634571210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":31,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.767249405384063721","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92211749","author":{"steamid":"76561199107350938","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1623359192},"language":"english","review":"Bill says its a good game, it makes him happy","timestamp_created":1621351838,"timestamp_updated":1621351838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92211697","author":{"steamid":"76561198342249624","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1621346212},"language":"english","review":"Timeless.
