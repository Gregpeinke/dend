This is less noticeable in Portal 2, but it is still there. Now it took  me around 6 hours to finish single-player and that is long enough for a FPS. \n \nThe story, in my opinion, was amazing. It is one of the few games that kept me guessing. It's  characters are well written and Stephen Merchant, Ellen McLain, and J.K. Simmons did a marvelous job as voice actors. Wheatley, Stephen's character. Is hilarious and immediately brings you into the game. The story has a comical approach that fits Portal 1's humor. \n \nI do not have many characters left to talk about co-op. It took me and a friend around 6 hours and was, challenging at times.
