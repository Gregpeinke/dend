The characters are great. The story is mysterious and catching, and there are many humorous moments as well.\nOf course there are a lot of puzzles to solve again. But now there are a lot of additions to the gameplay like gels or the gravity beams. Which makes the puzzles more challenging, but they are still doable. \n\nThere is also a co-op mode, so you can play with a friend. It has also a good storyline, and maybe it is a bit less serious than the single-player storyline. It is very enjoyable to play if you both are serious players, but also when you want to troll your friend. The puzzles are also nicely made for 2 players, you really need to cooperate and think together how to finish a level. \n\nI think anyone can enjoy this game, even when it is a different genre than you usually play. If you are not so sure about it, I recommend to buy it on sale. I am sure that you won't be disappointed. I did the same and now it has grown to be one of my favourite games.\n\nMy rating for this game: 9/10.","timestamp_created":1421344127,"timestamp_updated":1421344127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512195110321044922","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13997183","author":{"steamid":"76561198150264180","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":556,"last_played":1558951713},"language":"russian","review":"КОРОЧЕ ТЫ ДУМАЕШ И ФАНИШСЯ,ДУМАЕШ И ФАНИШСЯ,ДУМАЕШ И ФАНИШСЯ И КОНЕЦ ИГРЫ.","timestamp_created":1421342796,"timestamp_updated":1421342796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13996147","author":{"steamid":"76561197997873256","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":46,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46,"last_played":1335250800},"language":"german","review":"nicht schlecht","timestamp_created":1421337561,"timestamp_updated":1421337561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13995874","author":{"steamid":"76561198126702561","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1085,"last_played":1642554299},"language":"greek","review":"cool game!","timestamp_created":1421336146,"timestamp_updated":1421336146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13994922","author":{"steamid":"76561198114811167","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":15706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5183,"last_played":1599706872},"language":"english","review":"how to win portal:\n1:portal on the roof\n2:portal on the floor\n3:go through portal\n4:wait","timestamp_created":1421330657,"timestamp_updated":1421330657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13994680","author":{"steamid":"76561198052589685","num_games_owned":668,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":975,"last_played":1480852306},"language":"russian","review":"Прекрасное продолжение потрясающей игры!

With the second one having a playtime of 389 hours.[/b]\n\nPortal 2 is another masterpiece of puzzle FPS games Valve has ever forged out of their workshops, and this game remains to be fascinating and a reminder of how challenging things can be no matter how simple the direction this can give.\n\nStarting off from the previous game, you awake as a girl on her mid-30s, confused as to what just happened and reminded that the facility you once destroyed reached conditions that doesn't reach the quotas of building inspectors from your local Department. Then of course you get to use a gun that blasts two kinds of portals, and [i]heck[/i] you dive in to the experience of the old, new and old and then new again before ending this all with a [b]bang.[/b]\n\nAs you'd expect, the gameplay is very simple, and that's exactly what everyone wanted it to be. The right kind of simplicity from a video game, while leaving a few more sparkles for us to walk into and look through the possibilities we can do with the portal gun in our hand.\n\nYou'll be introduced to the novice level type of puzzles before going to puzzles that requires more brain work than simply creating portals from your side to the other separated by the gaps that leads you to hours of falling. Companion cubes and other such remains, even the cute, feisty little turrets while introducing new elements to the puzzle that involves from pointing a laser device to unlock your way to salvation, light bridges that reminds you of most sci-fis out there, and other related physics stuff like gravitational bridges too. Oh, did I tell you that they have those jumping pads that makes the work easy? And yes! They have those gels that makes you jump higher, run faster, or give you a painful slip to your doom.\n\nEnvironments and level designs are some of the best that Valve ever made. And while the new stuff is indeed a pleasant gift for those making their comeback here, vintage type of levels that reflects our early concepts of sci-fi becomes a refreshing moment of the past. Although some of them don't seem to get the appeal or rather an annoyance especially if they were puzzle levels, these sorts of discomforts fades away like you never noticed once you completed these levels and become satisified as a puzzle master.\n\nAnd what this? A coop mode? Yes indeed folks, a coop mode. Inviting a friend ( or simply dragging them ) gives you a new experience of what Portal 2 can deliver to push in the interests of new challenges, which most of them requires more than just two portals and one brain! You gotta multiply them by two, and everything will be a piece of cake. [strike]Of course that's a lie in the last stage.[/strike]\n\nBut if all of these don't seem to satisfy yourself and science itself, you can try the level editor! Yes, you don't need to go full complicated SDK making, making levels is simple as baking a cake and sharing it to the rest of your folks. You can make it alot more complicated, but overall challenging not only for yourself, but for everyone out there in the Steam Workshop! Yes, you can upload your levels, and that also means you can try out everyone's creations too! Solo or Co-op maps in the game will always satisfy your urges to complete the meaning of science itself, and portals too.\n\nWhile this game already placed itself as the best puzzle game that involves physics and what not, I've already mentioned that some levels in the game are slightly repetitive. As for the difficulty,  every levels require the attention of your intelligence which is the point of this game, but the logic becomes unusually flawed by the time you reached the later levels of the game. Technical issues aren't present most of the times, but they still appear as a bit of a hinderance to anyone who's attempting to make a speedrun or just focusing on each level. The Coop levels shares the same issues in regards to both design and difficulty, but the latter two becomes predictable and doing all the puzzle now is a chore as you press on.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nWell that's a long paragraph for some of the game's negatives but every games have their own pros and cons, and maybe I'm wrong with my experience on this game. But that doesn't mean I'm not gonna recommend this to everyone, because [b]I will freaking recommend this to everyone![/b] It's a game worth both from it's value, gameplay and story.

It improves and adds to Portal 1's foundations in all aspects, creating a near perfect game. \n\nThis is a first-person game. The basis of Portal 2 is a Portal gun. The fully upgraded device shoots two portals, which can be shot on certain surfaces. Step into one, and you come out the other. With this power in your hands, you're required to solve numerous puzzles in the single-player campaign. The puzzles start out easy at first, but as you continue, the player must use other objects to complete them, including lasers, weighted cubes, etc. Also added to the game are special types of \"gels\" which can be spread on surfaces to create different effects. Pretty much all of these means require guiding them through the portals you place. Gravity is another factor that comes into play in certain puzzles. It's kind of hard for me to describe overall. But all in all, it's really awesome and well rounded.\n\nYou play as a test subject named Chell (a girl btw), who worked/works for a company known as Aperture Science. Except the thing is, the world seems to have gone through an apocalypse, and you're stuck doing challenges for robotic AI still active in the building. I don't want to spoil the characters too much, so I'll only mention that their dialogue is extremely well written and acted, and keeps you really immersed in the game. Your player character is a silent protagonist, just like Gordon Freeman from Half Life, so the backstory is told from other characters and audio recordings, along with clues like graffiti on walls.\n\nWith that said, the enviromments are highly detailed, some outdoor/underground areas are even jaw dropping. Although difficult to see in the earlier stages of the game, the scope of and around the Aperture Science Laboratory becomes massive. The confines of the test chambers are rarely similar, but they're sometimes deliberately confusing. The designs of the maps always are meant to make an effect on the puzzle solving, like portaling to a high pedestal only to spot another surface you can make a portal on elsewhere on the map.\nBut I did become a little burned out on the puzzle solving about two thirds into the game. In most cases, the pacing between puzzles is great, but some people might reach a point where they're just tired of them. But even so, this IS a puzzle game, nothing like Left 4 Dead or the Half Life series.\n\nAnd no, you don't NEED to play Portal 1 to enjoy Portal 2, but I still recommend playing them in sequence just to fully understand certain aspects of the story. I myself played Portal 2 first, and when I went back and completed Portal 1, things became a bit clearer.\n\nAside from the brilliant single player game, this also includes a two player cooperative mode. Instead of Chell, you take control of one robot, and you have to work together with a partner to solve increasingly difficuly puzzles. It's a blast to play, and the co-op campagin is pretty lenghty, especially when you and your partner struggle with solving certain levels. Good luck!\n\n9.5/10","timestamp_created":1421200270,"timestamp_updated":1421200270,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13976438","author":{"steamid":"76561198075440709","num_games_owned":366,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1558979824},"language":"english","review":"portal

Depois dos eventos de Portal, que a deixaram profundamente magoada, ela simplesmente consegue se superar a cada câmara de teste. Cada frase, cada provocação constitui uma personalidade singular e extremamente carismática da antagonista. Gostaria ainda de ressaltar o excelente trabalho de dublagem (que inclusive rendeu um easter-egg no trailer do filme \"Cìrculo de Fogo\").\n Todo esse carisma dos personagens, aliado a uma jogabilidade admirável e muito bem desenvolvida pela equipe da Valve e uma ambientação espetacular (sem falar nas referências a Half-Life), fazem de Portal 2 um dos principais destaques da sua geração e com certeza, uma das horas mais bem-aproveitadas que uma pessoa pode ter. 11/10 \n","timestamp_created":1421095338,"timestamp_updated":1421095338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13961431","author":{"steamid":"76561198135017242","num_games_owned":318,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":812,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":627,"last_played":1523130512},"language":"english","review":"Loading takes too much time between chambers.

The puzzle variations seem endless and the community content (anyone can edit and publish maps) makes for an endless stream of trials.\n\nThe game is wonderfully produced, awesome voice acting, cool music, breath taking sceneries and gameplay is super fun.
