There are a wide variety of weapons to use, along with well hidden lambda caches to find and use to your advantege as you battle through City 17 and through the outskirts.\n      \nHowever, I don't think Half Life 2 is as amazing as most people claim it to be. \"10/10. 11/10. Best game ever!\" It kinda makes me laugh...\n With Half Life 2 being a very solid shooter. I find It difficult to follow the story, or figure out why these events in the game are happening; It feeels like it's out of nowhere. For example: The Combine. They are not in the original Half Life. All that's explained is they are this Inter dimensional organization That wants to enslave Humanity, and you have to fight them. \nSequel bait endings are the least of satisfying endings ever, and this game has that.\n\nI rate Half Life 2 with a solid 8/10. When this game goes on sale, definitely pick it up. I got the Half Life Collection for about $5.00\n\nThat's my review for Half Life 2 and I will see you on the next one.

Для 2004 года игры была бомбой: начиная от графики и физики, и заканчивая взаимодействием с предметами и (немного багнутым) искусственным интеллектом персонажей. Даже  после N-ного прохождения в 2016 году, игра оставляет частичку себя где-то далеко в душе. Half-Life 2 - это игра, где есть практически всё: юмор, атмосфера, головоломки, запоминающиеся персонажи, техника (воздушный катер и багги), огромная хреновина, называющаяся Цитаделью Альянса, которой в конце благополучно разорвёт верхушку после нашего \"небольшого\" вмешательства в планы побега доктора Брина. Стоит ли покупать игру - определенно да. С 2004 года рукастые люди наделали тысячи модов к Half-Life 2. Так что, если Вам надоест прохождение оригинальной Half-Life 2, Вы всегда сможете найти моды в интернете.

It's hard to believe it was only released around 3 yea-, I mean... 4 years after the original half-life.\n\nHad too much fun throwing random crap at every character that was unfortunate enough to step into my path >:D & my own Antlion army was perhaps my very favourite part. The puzzles weren't too easy or too hard (have to admit that a couple took me around 3-3 mins to solve). Great game. 3/3, I do like the number 3.","timestamp_created":1456837114,"timestamp_updated":1535651274,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21562546","author":{"steamid":"76561198032387180","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":892,"last_played":1578516581},"language":"french","review":"Half life 2 est l'un de mes jeux préféré je vous le reconseille vivement, une bonne histoire,des égnigmes;ce jeu restera pour moi le meilleur je vous le reconseille","timestamp_created":1456831629,"timestamp_updated":1456831629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21562412","author":{"steamid":"76561198156365715","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1555281057},"language":"russian","review":"Класс","timestamp_created":1456830973,"timestamp_updated":1456830973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21561181","author":{"steamid":"76561198062698877","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":1235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1538270897},"language":"koreana","review":"하프라이프2는 지금해도 여전히 재밌다.","timestamp_created":1456824957,"timestamp_updated":1456824957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21559984","author":{"steamid":"76561198272711515","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":713,"last_played":1466272692},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2 is one of the best FPS games I have ever played in my life.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a sequel to the critically acclaimed game, 50 times PC Game of the Year awards, and often considered the greatest FPS game of all time Half-Life. Half-Life 2 is set over two decades (20 years) after the events of Half-Life. The mysterious G-Man had just woken up Gordon Freeman from stasis on a train to City 17, and tells him to \"Wake up and smell the ashes.\" As Freeman gets off the train. He soon learns after the events of Half-Life, that the multdimensional empire, the Combine took over Earth. You now find your self as a leader of the Resistance, and must free Earth of the control of the Combine.\n\n\n-The First Person gameplay element is simple, but it does plenty things different than the regular First Person Shooters you've come to expect. Like for example, you've a health bar, and a armor bar that you have to keep track, and you have to do platforming, and be quick to solve puzzles. Also not to mention that the Source Engine is absolutely insanely good.\n\n-Half-Life 2 came out in 2004, and the game still looks absolutely amazing. Now while the game has low res textures, it still looks beautiful, like in the water, and endgame chapters.\n\n-Now Half-Life 2 took me about 11 hours to complete. I felt this was a good amount of time for price I pay for this game. This game was worth every single penny.\n\n-Half-Life 2 for me was mostly easy, though there were tough parts, because of the right timing, and the fast movement I had to time. I still thought the game was easier then the first game. I played through almost all of the game without any problems.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the end Half-Life 2 is an phenomenal game. It's a must buy for any gamer, and fan of the first Half-Life. It's a piece of art, and in my opinion, one of the best FPS games I have ever played in my life.\n\nI've encountered no problems in my playthroughs. I have played the game on all of the highest settings, and the game runs pretty well on my PC. This game should run well on all PCs, or other systems.\n\nMy Final Rating\n\n10/10: Must BUY, Must PLAY, and a Masterpiece\n\nNote: PLEASE VALVE WE NEED HALF-LIFE 3","timestamp_created":1456818150,"timestamp_updated":1456818359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21557410","author":{"steamid":"76561198266952100","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":80,"last_played":1607313178},"language":"spanish","review":"10/10 \nGran jugabilidad, historia, graficos para la epoca, una gran aventura llena de accion :)))))))","timestamp_created":1456802867,"timestamp_updated":1456802867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21555983","author":{"steamid":"76561198245782180","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":154,"last_played":1458006016},"language":"english","review":"OMG!!!
