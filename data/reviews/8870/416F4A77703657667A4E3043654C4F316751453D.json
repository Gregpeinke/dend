This is not your regular shooter but a whole universe (Won't say more due spoilers). \n\nHave you ever read on 9gag about this gaming inspiring feelings? Well, it does. The game does a great job in inmersing you into this role and history.  The graphics, and by those I mean aesthetics, are good, due a superb concept art. You will find yourself just looking at those floating buildings with no reason, just to apreciate their beauty. Also, Character design is great as well, and AI companion (Elizabeth) is one of the best AI's I've ever seen. SPOILER ALERT. You simply cannot fall in love with Elizabeth. She's a well developed character, both in complexity and design, and develop during the game.\n\nWell. This is a modern gem. I'm quite positive that this will be considered a piece of art in the future as we do now with clasic movies or art. You see, videogames are today's art, and this is a great example of a fine piece. And the truth is that this is not a surprise considering that this game's budget was more than USD 100 million.

I Played through the main storyline on easy in just under 14 hours. Burial at Sea Ep 1 was done at about the 15.5-16 hour mark. I just finished Burial at Sea Ep 2 with a total of 22+ hours. I have only played Bioshock Infinite and none of the ther Bioshocks (yet.) I watched a playthrough of each game and their DLC on Youtube sometime in 2016. [u] 4.9/5 Stars [/u]\n \n\n[h1] Main Storyline [/h1]\n[b] Playthrough Style: [/b] Aggressive, Loot Bug\n[b] Play time: [/b] ~14 Hours\n[b] Difficulty: [/b] Easy\n\nThe gameplay of Bioshock Infinite was fantastic! The controls are well placed and easy to use (SIDE NOTE: I utilized the additional buttons on my mouse for melee and aiming.) The storyline is very full 97% of the time, there are a few times it got (at least it felt) off course at times but the greatness of the rest of the story counteracted that. This was my first experience with a semi-recent story driven game, my previous being Portal 2. It was a very pleasing flow of events and movement, to just get to run around and hop from sky hook to sky hook blasting, shooting, and bashing enemies was the thrill and adventure I expected. The graphics are very well done and on par with if not better than most graphics from 2013. A very bright and open game compared to the previous Bioshocks. With my GTX 750Ti I can run the game on the highest graphic settings with no visible issues. The music and sounds will normally make or break a game for me. The music is fantastic, honestly amazing. Gotta love 1912. Needless to say Bioshock Infinite has become my all time favorite video game.\n\n\n[h1] Burial at Sea: Episode 1 [/h1]\n[b] Playthrough Style: [/b] Semi-Aggressive (Leaning towards the aggressive side), Loot Bug\n[b] Play time: [/b] ~2 Hours\n[b] Difficulty: [/b] Easy\n \nBack in Rapture, Pre-Sh*t Show too! Just amazing. Beautifully created and imagined, you get to spend some time in Rapture prior to the first game. Much like the main game, BaS:E1 just exceeds expectations in gameplay and graphics. Pretty much the same controls as the main game you can feel right at home while wandering around or fighting baddies. A big contrast would be the dark dinginess, once you get into Fontaine's, definitely a bit more spooky than previous. As this wasn't the longest playthrough there honestly isn't too much else to say about Burial at Sea: Episode 1.\n\n\n[h1] Burial at Sea: Episode 2 [/h1]\n[b] Playthrough Style: [/b] Non-Lethal (kill Count: 0), Loot Bug\n[b] Play time: [/b] ~6 Hours\n[b] Difficulty: [/b] Easy\n\nWow... That's all I'll say about the ending of BaS:E1. I feel... I feel... different, more like.. a woman... WHAT?!?!? I'M ELIZABETH!!?!?!?! That's new! We are now playing as Elizabeth. But that isn't the only new thing. New mechanics have been introduced to the game. Like the 1998 Mode, similar to 1999 Mode but it forces you to play a non-Lethal on top of the 1999 Mode difficulty. Stealth, Stealth is the new name of the game, at least my playthrough was. Enemies now have visible and a new sense of awareness from the main game. Sneaking around avoiding things that make noise such at broken glass and puddles of water (and other liquids) definitely adds to the feel of playing as someone like Elizabeth. You are given a new (to Bioshock Infinite) weapon to use, a crossbow, which fires non-lethal bolts like the tranquilizer bolt, the noise-maker bolt, and the Gas Bolt. You get to crawl around in airvents to escape enimies and even find secret rooms! The graphics still continue to shine as you run around the the underwater prison. The storyline for this is just filled to the brim and ready to be played over and over again. My biggest complaint (a small one at that) is that it feels like too much of just running in circles around the map going into each building a few times.\n\n\n[h1] Overview [/h1]\n\nDo I recommend this game?
