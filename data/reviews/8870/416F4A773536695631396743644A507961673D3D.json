However, do pay attention to the dialogue and in-game diaries that are found throughout the game; they have the potential of giving subtle yet deep hints of the explanation of the game's ending. Even paying attention to small details in certain levels would provide deeper insights into the background of the story.\n\nThe setting is captivating, and also gives me mixed feelings in a positive way. The setting is based in a unique flying steampunk-themed city, with all kinds of fascinating sights and sounds to experience while travelling through various districts of the flying city. However, as you continue throughout the story, you would begin to see the uglier side of this floating city. So yes, the setting in itself is an interesting mixture of fascination and horror. You would begin to adore yet despise this flying city of wonder.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I find the combination of guns and Plasmids to be thrilling indeed. It allows you to defeat your foes in a wide variety of ways, and it does so in a casual yet challenging way. In other words, you are free to use whichever gun-Plasmid combination to progress through the game, instead of relying on a deeply set formula to defeat any particular enemy or event. The gameplay's pace is also light and breezy, allowing the user to choose to waltz around, guns ablazing, or play more cautiously, with the usage of covers, long-ranged weaponry, and defensive Plasmids. However, this is not a stealth game at all. Though, interestingly, the 2nd DLC, \"Burial at Sea - Episode 2\", has a much more stealth-based gameplay.\n\nSpeaking of the DLCs, the \"Clash in the Clouds\" DLC is both fun and challenging! It is an arena-styled DLC, which means that you would be thrown through waves upon waves of different enemies in various maps. The difficulty of this DLC is rather high, but experienced players would definitely enjoy the fast-paced continuous combat that is present throughout this DLC. The \"Blue Ribbon Challenges\" system, which encourages players to try different combat techniques, may be challenging or plain annoying to different players, but they are fortunately optional, as the player may choose to entertain or ignore any of these challenges.\n\nAs for the \"Burial at Sea\" DLCs, the stories are expanded from Bioshock 1, so please remember to complete Bioshock 1 first before even attempting to play any of these DLCs! The first episode has a more defensive gameplay feel than Bioshock Infinite's base game, whereas the second episode is much more stealth-based. And both episodes have short but interesting stories to tell. Just remember to evolve your playstyle in this DLC set, and you shall do fine.\n\nOverall, I do think Bioshock Infinite is worth a try, for its story, setting, and gameplay. The story does have a few minor imperfections, as it does leave the player with several questions in the end, but the ending is a complete conclusion of the story and worth pursuing. Just remember to pay attention to the dialogue and diaries within the game, think outside the box a little, and you would be able to appreciate the ending. But above all, do enjoy the journey through this bizarrely captivating game!","timestamp_created":1480432443,"timestamp_updated":1561834773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28059231","author":{"steamid":"76561197994266251","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1469431083},"language":"spanish","review":"horas y horas jugadas y la verdad muy bueno","timestamp_created":1480431104,"timestamp_updated":1480431104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28058339","author":{"steamid":"76561198119850401","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":816,"last_played":1456460182},"language":"tchinese","review":"必玩的大作，整體劇情令人難忘，前兩代重製後沒有中文感覺非常可惜。\n","timestamp_created":1480430556,"timestamp_updated":1480430556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28057435","author":{"steamid":"76561198264270823","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":624,"last_played":1469519722},"language":"schinese","review":"“家畜的最佳用途”奖","timestamp_created":1480429951,"timestamp_updated":1480429951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28057390","author":{"steamid":"76561197972271628","num_games_owned":660,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":901,"last_played":1544132365},"language":"english","review":"Another classic from Irrational Games.  While Infinite is more run-and-gun than its predecessors (mainly Bioshock 1), I never particularly thought of this as a negative; it's just different.  The level design accomodates this kind of gameplay well.  The visual and audio design are beautiful, Elizabeth is unforgettably charming, and the atmosphere--while quite different from Bioshock 1--totally sucks you into this very strange and wondrous place.  \n\nAnd that ending...oh man.  Few game endings have ever made me stare slack-jawwed at the screen as this one did.  \n\nThe game isn't perfect and I believe has some pacing issues and can get pretty repetitive around the middle section, but if you stick with it you're sure to find a lot to enjoy about it.  Be sure to pick up the DLC, too, as it really fleshes out the story, and the production values are just as good as the main game.  \n\nShame Irrational is no more, but they sure left us with some stellar games to revisit again and again.","timestamp_created":1480429925,"timestamp_updated":1480429925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28057345","author":{"steamid":"76561197994844752","num_games_owned":476,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1462,"last_played":1473550350},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite remains to this day one of the deepest, richest and most engaging games I have ever played. \nVisually stunning, with charming and relatable characters and a mind-boggling storyline, this masterpiece should not merely be played but experienced.","timestamp_created":1480429893,"timestamp_updated":1480429893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28057145","author":{"steamid":"76561198037426513","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1429104494},"language":"russian","review":"12/10","timestamp_created":1480429749,"timestamp_updated":1480429749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28056871","author":{"steamid":"76561198097310891","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1005,"last_played":1467736306},"language":"spanish","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1480429565,"timestamp_updated":1480429565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28056654","author":{"steamid":"76561198116986520","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":584,"last_played":1618520956},"language":"russian","review":"Игра, которая должна быть у каждого.","timestamp_created":1480429422,"timestamp_updated":1618938619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28056434","author":{"steamid":"76561198047464647","num_games_owned":266,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":348,"last_played":1417636546},"language":"russian","review":"Самый лучший шутер, в который я играл.

Красочные и живые персонажи, отлично проработанный дизайн уровней, звуковое сопровождение на самом высшем уровне. Это - первая причина, почему стоит поиграть в это творение. Второе. Немаловажно для людей не игравших в предыдущие части - вы не потеряете ничего, если начнете играть в серию Bioshock с Infinite. Да, вы получите чуть меньше удовольствия не узнавая те или иные детали из первых двух частей. Но это не помешает вам насладиться ими позже, проходя первую часть. Третье - сюжет.

The story is one that will stick with you for a long while after playing (at least it did for me). While you could just watch someone play it on youtube just to see the story play out, you would be doing yourself a disservice if you did as the gameplay is one of the best parts of the experience. That is what this game was for me; an experience. The storytelling and gameplay elements came together in a way that really stands apart from other narrative focused, and FPS games alike. Talking about it doesn't really do it justice, just grab it on sale and regret not playing it sooner. \n\nNote: I consider it a must to play the original Bioshock before hand, as well as getting the Burial at Sea dlc for Infinite. Bioshock 1 provides a lot of much needed context to appriciate some of the twists and other references in Infinite, and Burial at Sea ties everything together in a way that makes the story feel complete (at least it did for me). Bioshock 2 is worth playing, however it is not necessary for the story coherence (I.e. you wont be lost if you skip Bioshock 2)","timestamp_created":1480417013,"timestamp_updated":1480417013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28040882","author":{"steamid":"76561198079033814","num_games_owned":414,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1625,"last_played":1473390768},"language":"brazilian","review":"10/10 would be killed again","timestamp_created":1480416629,"timestamp_updated":1480416629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28040721","author":{"steamid":"76561198168229777","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":801,"last_played":1564339580},"language":"russian","review":"Masterpiece","timestamp_created":1480416483,"timestamp_updated":1480416483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28040682","author":{"steamid":"76561198002351446","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":87,"last_played":1431810316},"language":"english","review":"This is one of my favourite all-time games and rounds off the BioShock series really well.\n\nAs with previous entries the setting is very unusual, but it is the story and character interaction that is really special and sets this apart from other games in the \"FPS\" and \"Action\" genre's. I thought the game builds really well to the ending and ends on a pretty spectacular note. I think this is a game that you need to go into the story blind to get the best out of though.\n\nThe combat is good. It's enjoyable enough to play but I wouldn't say is a strength of the game or the series in general. If you played the previous games and liked the combat then you're bound to like this.\n\nGraphically this is a very bright and vibrant game and at times looks beautiful.\n\nAll-in-all this is an excellent game that I'd recommend to anyone reading this page. You should definatley try it if you played the previous entries and hadn't gotten around to this. 10/10.\n\nNB: My gameplay hours stats is erroneous as should be obvious from the fact I've got the achievement for completing the game despite it showing as 3 hours playtime.\n\n","timestamp_created":1480416427,"timestamp_updated":1480416427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28040041","author":{"steamid":"76561198105952589","num_games_owned":311,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1654936886},"language":"english","review":"personally one of my favorite in the collection very intense story that keeps your attention drawn to the story but as well the new functions in the game is slowly addressed to you giving you the proper amount of time to figure it out for a later time the villian personality is very well captured and the main protaganist booker is as well portrayed extremely well \n10/10\nDLC is also very well put together and continues the game beautifuly i cant really find flaw in them\n10/10","timestamp_created":1480415745,"timestamp_updated":1480415745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28039627","author":{"steamid":"76561198091814354","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1645119166},"language":"russian","review":"Когда понял концовку))))","timestamp_created":1480415344,"timestamp_updated":1480415344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28037768","author":{"steamid":"76561198075232853","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":412,"last_played":1487517921},"language":"english","review":"Great game but a bit confusing (to me anyway)","timestamp_created":1480413375,"timestamp_updated":1480413375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28037678","author":{"steamid":"76561198106228811","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":731,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":731,"last_played":1453660739},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un gran juego.
