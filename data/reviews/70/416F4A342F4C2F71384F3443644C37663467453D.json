I had no reason not to do so, I just never really got around to it. On a whim about a week ago, I decided to play it late one night since I had just finished replaying another [i]Valve[/i] classic, [i]Portal[/i]. This is one of the best last-minute decisions I've made, although it did keep me up for hours on a work night, it was well worth the sleep deprivation. I was glued to the screen, the gameplay was so fluid and the world was so interesting, if it weren't for the dated graphics, I really wouldn't be able to find many things aside from nitpicks that would make me to rate it below any really quality titles coming out today. However, this game set the standard for plenty of these titles, and judging it in comparison to these acclaimed games today isn't very hard, as [i]Half-Life[/i] is very easy to pick up and fails to be much of a roadblock for people spoiled with modern video game technology. You are doing yourself a disservice by not at least trying this game out, as it has aged much better than a majority of old video game titles for sure.\n\nThe journey of [i]Gordon Freeman[/i] is a science-fiction spectacle to behold. As you journey through your now-destroyed research facility in hopes of smothering the alien invasion at hand, you will be presented with many puzzles and challenges that will test your skills and judgment. There are enthralling set-pieces here, and the length of this game is surprisingly longer than I anticipated, but it is an arguably perfect length, so it doesn't overstay its fantastic welcome, instead it knows exactly what it wants to do and keeps you entertained until the very end. The variety of aliens and other enemies you encounter keeps the many battles fresh and always presents a new challenge to the player, especially during boss segments, which even when their battles get obnoxious, it's still fascinating and a unique fight each time.\n\nOverall, [i]Half-Life[/i] is a timeless masterpiece. There is really little to say about it that hasn't already been said. The classic label is earned here, whether you're talking about the creative set-pieces and environments or the nearly perfect gameplay that keeps one hypnotized for hours, it all accumulates into a must-play for anyone that's a fan of science fiction and first-person video games. It has me very excited to revisit [i]Gordon Freeman[/i] in the sequel, [i]Half-Life 2[/i]. If it's anywhere near the quality of its predecessor, then I am definitely in for a unforgettable, entertaining joyride.\n\n[b][RATING: 9.5/10][/b]","timestamp_created":1575851294,"timestamp_updated":1624157845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516074419021606445","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59530169","author":{"steamid":"76561198284453348","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1612371859},"language":"brazilian","review":"um clássico.\n\nmesmo com toda essa idade, Half-Life consegue ter uma história boa, e uma gameplay quase perfeita\n\ncompra ae ;)","timestamp_created":1575850388,"timestamp_updated":1575850388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59530136","author":{"steamid":"76561198124348420","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":275,"playtime_at_review":713,"last_played":1659766820},"language":"english","review":"old game is very good much appreciate\n","timestamp_created":1575850342,"timestamp_updated":1575850342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59529111","author":{"steamid":"76561198158634155","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2596,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2596,"last_played":1575848390},"language":"brazilian","review":"JOGÃO!!\nÉ ESTRITAMENTE OBRIGATÓRIO JOGAR ESSA MARAVILHA!!\nNão é à toa que Half Life é um dos maiores FPS's da história, se não o maior.\nGOZEI!!!","timestamp_created":1575848640,"timestamp_updated":1575848640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59528323","author":{"steamid":"76561198050223423","num_games_owned":346,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1575845254},"language":"english","review":"This game had me engaged from beginning to end.

I just can't think of an area of this game (i.e. story, gameplay, art style, etc) that rises above another game in the same era. Not sure at all where all the hype is from.
