Also in left 4 dead 2 they remastered the campaing from the first game and it now has better graphics but if your pc's specs are not that great i suggest you play left 4 dead 1! The controls are simple and easy to remember! \n\nSo my review for the game is: 9.9/10 the game is fun to play but a few times it might get a little boring","timestamp_created":1596837544,"timestamp_updated":1596837544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73935704","author":{"steamid":"76561198802388524","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":92,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1599079907},"language":"latam","review":"Juego muy bueno ya con sus añitos pero aun es entretenido...","timestamp_created":1596832214,"timestamp_updated":1596832214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73930448","author":{"steamid":"76561199000929077","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7908,"last_played":1606575954},"language":"russian","review":"Ништяк игрушка!)","timestamp_created":1596825680,"timestamp_updated":1596825680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73928544","author":{"steamid":"76561198384109309","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1640016276},"language":"english","review":"pills here","timestamp_created":1596823416,"timestamp_updated":1596823416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73924387","author":{"steamid":"76561198366295611","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":907,"last_played":1606062111},"language":"russian","review":"Всё через ОчКо","timestamp_created":1596818786,"timestamp_updated":1596818786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73923026","author":{"steamid":"76561198434703633","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":47,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1596773839},"language":"brazilian","review":"Amei o JOGO\nMatar Zumbis e uma delicia aqui","timestamp_created":1596817194,"timestamp_updated":1596817194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73914834","author":{"steamid":"76561199066317481","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":916,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1648473332},"language":"english","review":"for everyone to see how i play left 4 dead","timestamp_created":1596806996,"timestamp_updated":1596806996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73914354","author":{"steamid":"76561197980775533","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":313747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":815,"playtime_at_review":274323,"last_played":1660403942},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game with lots of replay value.

You and other 3 Survivors need to cooperate your way through the zombie (or infected) horde, and find rescue then escape.\n\nThis game has 4 difficulty options, each of them manipulate how good are the items you may get, your damage, the zombie's damage, spawn rates, and other misc tidbits. I play at the highest difficulty most often, which makes zombies very brutal if you let them attack you. Though, I recommend Easy for absolute beginners, Normal for the same beginners who may think Easy is too uneventful, and Advanced for players who developed enough gamesense, but are still beginners.\n\nWhile fighting the horde of infecteds, there may be special types of infecteds, literally called \"Special Infecteds\", can potentially ruin your team if given the chance. These Infecteds serve to test the teamwork of you and your teammates, or to see how good your team can readapt. They shine the most when fighting along side a big amount of common infecteds, or they'll be disposed of easily.\n\nThere are also two Boss Infecteds: Tank and Witch. The Tank is a really muscular zombie that can absorb a lot of damage, AND down a survivor in just a small amount of swings. While the Witch is a crying woman with really long nails, that gets angered if they feel AND are sure someone noticed them. Angered for too long, and they will chase down their victim.\n\nThese are cool and all, but the main attraction is the game's AI Director. The Director is the one who manages what items are allowed to be active in the map, how good the players's items are, when should zombies spawns, where should the zombies spawn (the game uses no set spawn points!) and whatnot. The Director serves to keep the game intense, but also to give players breaks when it feels they need to, as it actively tries to estimate the players's stress level, so they don't get overwhelmed or too tired from the intensity.\n\nOh yeah, there's also versus mode, but I don't play that. You can play as the zombies though.\n\nOverall, this game is worth your time AND is replayable, but be noted I bought the bundle on the Summer Sale where it costed somewhere around $1.79 USD! (I converted my country's money to this)\n\nWithout the Summer Sale, think it costs around $3.49. (actually $23.50?)\n\nBut, if you have Left 4 Dead 2, should you get this?\n\nWell, personally, if you are not too intersted in the presentation, your only reason to get Left 4 Dead 1 would be to either re-experience it and have a retrospective. Sure, the L4D1 campaigns are ported to L4D2, but they actually changed some stuff in some campaigns, and some of the things have been changed that alter the atmosphere, such as commons having a different look which looks strange. Mods DO exist, but do you really wanna go through so many hoops and all that to find out everything that changed and fix it, and I also somehow couldn't find a mod that turns back commons to L4D1 look.\n\nPersonally, I myself don't really give a damn about graphics or anything like that, but this game, its magical. It got me into appreciating the presentaton. The ambience.... The atmosphere..... Damn. Never have I felt stressed, dreaded / hopeless, on high alert, and thinking about the well-being of my teammates. (unless if they're being the person who plays L4D optimally, of course)\n\nWith my friends, we usually end up getting a break moment in one of the saferooms and proceed with something that resembles a campfire discussion.

decir de Left 4 Dead que no se haya escrito ya. El genial juego de acción y zombies de Valve fue una consecuencia inesperada de esas míticas lan partys que montabas con tus colegas allá por los cercanos , y al mismo tiempo lejanos , años 90.\n\nCorria la mitad de los dos mil cuando Turtle Rock Studios, hasta entonces un estudio relativamente desconocido, recibió el encargo de portear y actualizar Counter Strike , tanto para PC como para la primera consola de Microsoft: X-Box. El encargo no fue todo lo fructífero que se esperaba y en la intentona se perdió un prometedor modo historia nuevas armas y elementos para el modo online que chocaban frontalmente con la comunidad ultraconservadora de un juego, que por aquel entonces, mandaba con puño de hierro en las estadísticas de los mas jugado.\n\nDe esta manera obtuvimos Counter Strike Condition Zero , una singular actualización de la version 1.6 del juego , con unas escenas para un jugador eliminadas y la posibilidad de , por primera vez, jugar online en consolas.\nSin embargo no todo fue negativo , y es que durante el desarrollo de este juego sus creadores, como recalqué al inicio del texto se divertían organizando lanes en sus estudios. Disfrutaban de aquellos bizarros servidores de zombies, mod del mod que transformaban al juego de acción táctica en toda una locura de supervivencia.\n\nPoco a poco lo que fue un pasatiempo fue cogiendo forma, transformándose en algo mas que una modificación para disfrutarla entre colegas y termino siendo el juego que actualmente conocemos. Y es que Left 4 Dead tiene ya 10 añazos a sus espaldas y sin embargo continua siendo un referente. Gráficos mas que correctos , acción a raudales, escenarios interactivos...todo ello explotando el juego cooperativo y añadiéndole ademas la posibilidad de jugar en VS encarnando a la facción zombie.\n\nLo mejor:\n-Gráficos que aun hoy en día sorprenden: hordas, animaciones, efectos de luz...\n-Su genial formato episodio nos cuenta una historia a través de unas campañas presentadas como si se tratase de peliculas.\n-Cooperativo muy bien planteado.\n-Modo vs que exige una coordinación de equipo brutal.\n-Mods y servidores dedicados.\n\nLo peor:\n-Que valve no conozca el numero 3.\n-Que no se desarrollen nuevas campañas oficiales ( que personalmente pagaría con gusto )\n-Quizás peque de ser algo repetitivo.","timestamp_created":1596559254,"timestamp_updated":1596559254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.68787616491317749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73754012","author":{"steamid":"76561198302067524","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1821,"last_played":1596557376},"language":"english","review":"This Game Is Very Fun, Its A Shame No One Plays It Anymore.
