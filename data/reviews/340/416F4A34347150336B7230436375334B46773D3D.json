However, I'm still greately dissatisfied. While my computer is not quite top of the line and quite a large step from it, I am able to play Episode 2(which honestly has much better lighting than this and wasn't realeased all that long after this) at between 30-60fps on maximum graphical settings. I got no higher than 40fps and it dropped as low as 15fps at times on this. I wonder if it might be poorly optimized, considering so little gameplay exists in a \"game\" that is so large in size. It's roughly a quarter the size of Half Life 2 itself.(half life 1 is close in size to this, I haven't even finished it and I'm more than 3 hours in if I remember correctly!) I have, and this is for apparently 30-40 minutes of gameplay.
