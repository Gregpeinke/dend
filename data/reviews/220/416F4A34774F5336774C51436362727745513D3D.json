On the surface you have fantastic graphics that still hold up today, the gravity gun which is probably the funnest weapon/tool ever, and silky smooth gameplay manifested in gunplay and some amazing physics puzzles.  But when you really stop and take a closer look at all the little details like charecters you travel with, and the story's impact and listen to the sounds of the game it quickly becomes an immersive and masterfully paced experiece unlike any I've had before from a game.  From the your giant robot friend Dog, to the horror filled streets of ravenholm, to thowing grenades back at enemies with the gravity gun... the game is just plain old fun and yet meaningful on so many levels.  I've probably played through it at least nine times and everytime it gets better and better.  Quite possibly the best game I've ever played.

I had lots of fun. I recommend getting the expansions to this game since they directly relate to the storyline.\n\nPros: There is a lot of reasons to love this game. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where the world is ravished by a powerful galactic empire that has enslaved earth. You are left with many questions. Some get answered. But you get even more questions as you play. The story is very interesting. The gameplay is challenging. You will be exploring a lot of places and solving all sorts of puzzles. What I love about this game is nothing repeats. You keep moving forward and every room is unique. You actually feel like you are going somewhere the entire game.\n\nCons: It is a bit dated but don't let that stop you from enjoying this awesome game. Ammo is scarce in the game which means you will be using a lot of shotgun and pistol. I wish Gordon Freeman could hold a bit more backup ammo.\n\nI definitely can replay the game more than once.

This is a monster which will be recalled fondly by a whole generation. Like DOOM2, this game will be happily remembered long after it is totally obsolete, and the state-of-the-art has moved off over the horizon.\n\nThe Source engine has now replaced Q3 as my ultimate FPS engine of choice, in a purely PC context. The capability to run amazingly large and complex maps, on very modest hardware, simply puts this game engine head and shoulders above any current competitor. Even 6 years after it was released.\n\nHL2 itself is a wonderful romp through a dark future. The airboat and the dune buggy are both well designed and executed, and they integrate into the play of the game in an absolutely seamless manner. Even the little touches are superb, like the ability to use the Grav Gun to flip the buggy back over again, if you get stranded some place other than on your wheels.
