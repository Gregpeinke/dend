There are some necessary story elements that transfer from the first to the second game. I will end up giving spoilers to the first game here, probably. Who knows. It depends on my writing process.\n Anyways, this game exceeded my expectations. This one is the harder of the two Portal games. It's very, very enjoyable. In my review of Portal 1, I gave a crash course of the game mechanics, so I don't feel the need to do so here, but I will give you some information on the new mechanics. Along with the basic Portal gun and lazer technology in the last game, this game has many different features, such as gel. That is one of the biggest new features. You use this gel for bouncing, speeding up, and even creating Portals on surfaces you coudn't before you put the gel, there. \nThis game, though. I dare not give you spoilers, because the story is astounding. I will say, though, the characters are always great in these games, and always memorable. In this game, you of course have GLaDOS, from the first game. The song at the end of the first game, \"Still Alive\" was actually hinting at the sequel, and I didn't realize it, but I should have. It was very obvious. GLaDOS, in that song, was just letting everyone know that she's still alive! And, you have a new character: Wheatley. Wheatley is a hilarious character. He's a moron, but he's hilarious and has a wonderful character arc. You're sure to love him. This game is my favorite Valve game I've ever played. Of course, I haven't finished Half Life, yet, though. So, I have to finish that, too. But this is a good game. I give it a 9.9 our of 10. It's a great game!

It boasts a longer, more diverse campaign that still manages to hold on to the humor, atmosphere, and overall quality that made the original so enjoyable. It also boasts a new cooperative mode, which brings the experience to a new level. And to top it off, with Steam Workshop integration, the possibilities for new content become limitless.\n\nIn the campaign, all of the strengths from the first game return and are fine-tuned to perfection. The puzzles are more diverse and interesting, with more advanced mechanics introduced. The atmosphere is even more fleshed out and enticing. The dialogue is even more hilarious and entertaining. And to top it all off, the game is about twice as long.\n\nAfter that, there is also an incredibly well designed cooperative mode, complete with its own characters and puzzles. This adds what is effectively another whole game to the mix, which is a very welcome addition.\n\nAnd to top it all off, with the Steam Workshop integration, there is endless possibilities for new puzzle rooms in both single-player and cooperative modes. Not all of it is great, of course, but some of it is arguably better than the real game.  It is a gift that just keeps on giving.\n\nWith the gameplay being so intuitive and enjoyable, and the limitless possibilities of the Workshop, [b]Portal 2[/b] rockets to the clouds as a deity among video games.  It is hands-down one of the absolute best games in existence.  If you haven’t yet tried it, now is the time.  There are hours of entertainment waiting for you. \n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]","timestamp_created":1465685775,"timestamp_updated":1465685775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":135,"votes_funny":14,"weighted_vote_score":"0.841714382171630859","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23510297","author":{"steamid":"76561198052850121","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":967,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":966,"last_played":1561523620},"language":"schinese","review":"谜题和故事结合的还是不够好\n别的都很不错","timestamp_created":1465683851,"timestamp_updated":1465683851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23509906","author":{"steamid":"76561198119865566","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":465,"last_played":1590860577},"language":"english","review":"I think it's a must-have game!
