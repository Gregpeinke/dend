You were told that there would be cake, but in the end, the cake was a lie. You defeated Glados since \"she\" were trying to kill you and then you escaped the underground test facility called Aperture laboratories.\n\nA long time later, by the looks of it, the story of Portal 2 begins. You, this time as another test subject, still alive in the facility are having a really long sleep when you are woken up by a small robot stuck to a rail system in Aperture laboratories. He wants your help to get out of there and as a team you begin your journey towards freedom. What we know is that Aperture laboratories is really old and deserted and that Glados was defeated a long time ago...\n\nGet this game, it's really good!
