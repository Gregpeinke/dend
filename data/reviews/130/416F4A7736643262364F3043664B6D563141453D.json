game depicts the life of a security guard inside Black Mesa Research Facility on THAT day. It gives you a more in-depth idea of what Barney Calhoun had to go through while Gordon was trying to get out of the facility. This was the second DLC released for the original Half-Life, and unfortunately a bit shorter than the first one, Opposing Force.\nIf you like the Half-Life world and story, definitely worth playing through at least once in your life.\n\nAs a game it's quite clunky by today's standards, but it has some depth so points for that. 4/10.","timestamp_created":1573742790,"timestamp_updated":1573742810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57145478","author":{"steamid":"76561198173301250","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2088,"last_played":1573711126},"language":"english","review":"KINDA BORRIGN DONT SAVE DURRIGN THE CHAPTER DELIVERENCE WHICH IS THE LAST CHAPTER CAUSE IT WILL CRASH YOUR GAME (WELL ATLEAST FOR ME)","timestamp_created":1573711103,"timestamp_updated":1573711103,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57101666","author":{"steamid":"76561198839643286","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":260,"last_played":1582636003},"language":"russian","review":"dfddd","timestamp_created":1573656259,"timestamp_updated":1573656259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57070632","author":{"steamid":"76561198327158043","num_games_owned":572,"num_reviews":98,"playtime_forever":1737,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1593,"last_played":1658137891},"language":"russian","review":"Blew sh¡t","timestamp_created":1573599337,"timestamp_updated":1573599337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581881523132324219","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57063645","author":{"steamid":"76561198033626347","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":78,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":49,"last_played":1590653013},"language":"koreana","review":"[h1]입대하자마자 최전방 현역으로 활동하는 칼훈의 대 모험!![/h1]\n[b] * 마우스를 사용하고싶다면 마우스 옵션에서 raw mouse input을 켜야한다.[/b]\n\n[b]1. 출시년도다운 그래픽[/b]\n -

Although fun, it is significantly shorter than Opposing Force and contains a little bit less to do in general, also the weapons available to Barney are limited.

Так это внятная небольшая история про нескольких уцелевших работников комплекса, которые хотят сбежать оттуда и не возвращаться.\nПока там в оригинальной игре Гордон Фримен спасает мир, тут мы наблюдаем за простыми людьми которые хотят всего-то выжить. Добавьте к этому то, что игра абсолютно не затянута, и получите замечательное дополнение к оригиналу!\nОднако рекомендовать купить её за полную цену всё ещё могу только фанатам.
