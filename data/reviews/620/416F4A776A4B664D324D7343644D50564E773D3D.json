из 43890 обзоров этой игры положительны - это сильно. Если честно, я вобще не понимаю, как эта игра может не понравиться? Тут есть все: и графика, и сюжет, и кооператив, и даже немного экшена.  В целом, раз здесь столько положительных отзывов, расписывать ничего не буду. Скажу только одно: если возникнет вопрос \"Покупать или нет?\", то мой вам совет - брать однозначно.\nНу вот, теперь 99% из 43891 обзора этой игры положительны :)\nУдачи!","timestamp_created":1424606968,"timestamp_updated":1424607036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjKfM2MsCdMPVNw=="}
