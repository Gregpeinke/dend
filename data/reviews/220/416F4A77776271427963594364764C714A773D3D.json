A lot of other single player first person shooters have come out during that time. This is still the best one, and the gulf in quality between it and every other title in the same genre to be released subsequently is so huge that it's kind of embarrassing. It's on sale now for a pittance and in exchange you get 15-25 hours of game design of such brilliance that if you were to count all the games that are in the same stratosphere, you would not need more than one hand. A thoroughly essential part of the gaming canon. Unless you don't like shooters, puzzles, scary stuff, or games that lack cutscenes, dialogue trees or role-playing/character customisation.

If you like puzzles, this is for you. if you like a game with a good framerate, even on a laptop (which is how i played it), this is for you. This game is a good FPS because it doesn't get old quickly, since you can easily change how you go through the game with the console (press the ` located above Tab and left of 1). I tried going through the whole game with [insert gun used in final level of HL2].\nThis game is a good puzzle game because puzzles are put throughout the game for continuing the game, or getting more ammo/healthpacks/armor. When I played through some of these, said puzzles would baffle me, then, once I finally figured it out, stumped me on how I didn't see that. Moving on...\nThis game has a good FPS because it runs off the Source Engine. Don't know what that is? Google it, I'm sure you'll find it there.\nWith that said, I give this game a 10/10, because Steam doesn't use a point system, it uses a Yes/No system. It'll do, though.

Es hat sich wirklich gelohnt. Das Spiel ist einfach ein würdiger Nachfolger für den ersten Teil von Half-Life. Jeder sollte diesen Teil mal gespielt haben. Auch wenn die Grafik etwas in die Jahre gekommen ist, die Story und das Feeling sind einfach genial. Es macht soviel Spaß alles zu entdecken und auch die \"kleinen\" und \"großen\" Rätsel zu lösen. \nEine klare Empfehlung für Fans von Ego-Shooter mir einem guten Maß an Story.","timestamp_created":1402790674,"timestamp_updated":1402790674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.65887153148651123","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10475632","author":{"steamid":"76561198124647277","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":107,"last_played":1501099475},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente juego lo recomiendo... :D","timestamp_created":1402785005,"timestamp_updated":1402785005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10474292","author":{"steamid":"76561198067258937","num_games_owned":241,"num_reviews":102,"playtime_forever":1619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":980,"last_played":1646452606},"language":"english","review":"I'm not going to get into everything and typed a super long paragraph, because while they're informative I personally never read them because of how long they are.

Игре уже 10 лет, однако при этом она до сих пор держит высокую планку качества.\n\nИгра является продолжением первой части. Спустя несколько лет, G-man вовращает Гордона из стазиса, решив его использовать в своих целях. За время отсутствия Фримена, прошли довольно глобальные изменения в мире. Планета была захвачена могущественной инопланетной организацией, именуемой Советом Альянса. Большиство людей, стали жертвами и рабами захватчиков, однако были и те кто пытался сопротивлятся. Небольшие отряды повстанцев, не теряли надежду спастись и вернуть Землю обратно. Роль главного повстанца сыграет бывшый сотрудник научного комлекса Black Mesa.\n\nПервое, что на тот момент бросалось в глаза, это новый движок Source. Помимо прекрасной графики, крутой анимации, движок имел отличную техническую составляющую. Большая качественная работа была проведена с физикой. Все предметы, оружие, техника, повинуются физике, с учётом их массы, трения и силы тяжести. На этой основе сделано немало различных простеньких головоломок.\n\nТем не менее игра является классическим представителем жанра шутер от первого лица. Так же игра сохранила все классические традиции первой части. К примеру за действиями игры, мы наблюдаем исключительно из глаз главного героя, без каких то видео-вставок или разрыве во времени. Так же Гордон Фримен молчит на протяжении всей игры. Ну и конечно загадка серии номер один, таинственый человек в костюме с кейсом.\n\nПо части геймплея, игра нам предлагает куда больше разноообразия нежели первый HL. И если в первом, место действия в основном проходило на територрии научного комплекса в пустыне, где большую часть времени, игрок проводил в стенах лаборатории, то во второй части, разнообразие локаций на порядок выше. Захваченый, полуразрушенный город восточной европы, побережье, мрачный атмосферный городок Рейвенхольм, тюрьма, огромная Цитадель. Все эти места помимо всего прочего, красиво воссозданы, а в некоторых прекрасно передана атмосфера(Рейвенхольм).\n\nЕсли в первой части основными противника были инопланетные существа, в перемешку с солдатами, посланными на зачистку лаборатории, то во второй таковыми являются солдаты Альянса. Сражениям с зомби и другими существами уделено куда меньше времени. Тем не менее игра постоянно держит в напряжении, а качественно поданый геймплей и продуманный сюжет мотивируют играть не прерываясь, до самого конца.\n\nКроме основной геймплейной составляющей игры, а именно перестрелки с врагами и убийство мутантов, игра так же предлагает нам и другие развлечения. Часто встречаются не сложные, однако вполне продуманые логические задачки, нам дадут возможность покататся на багги по побережью и на воздушной подушке по каналам города.\n\nВ игре не много оружия, однако представленных экземпляров вполне хватает, для того чтобы устроить настоящий беспредел на улицах Сити 17. Хотя модели оружия другие, однако типы и виды остались такими же. Ломик, пистолет, дробовик, атомат, арбалет, базука и гранаты. Однако, ещё было добавлено устройство под названием Грави-пушка, которая полностью заменяет все функции ломика. Теперь один из символов Half-Life, стал самым бесполезным предметом в инвентаре Гордона.\n\nНесмотря на то, что большую часть игры прийдется ходить в одиночестве, и сражаться с врагами собственными силами, во второй части у нас будут союзники. Это некоторые повстанцы, Аликс и её Пёс, и даже Муравьиные львы. Сам же AI был намного лучше проработан. Как враги так и союзники вели себя вполне адекватно. Редко когда замечал баги или какие то проблемы с этим.\n\nОтличная игра, прекрасное продолжение серии, красивая графика, реалистичная физика, хорошо продуманный сюжет и яркие персонажи.\n\nОценка: 10/10","timestamp_created":1402759735,"timestamp_updated":1499375170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565481603145599365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10471086","author":{"steamid":"76561198094307757","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":84,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1394660800},"language":"english","review":"WHY ARE THERE PUZZLES?

A true classic in every way.  From the intensely immersive gameplay to the atmospheric and captivating world - Half Life 2 brings you into City 17 and renders it in a way that feels tangible.  Often times I found myself speaking for Gordon only to realize I was just muttering in sheer awe of the technical marvels presented for the time.  I can see roots of modern games like Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite and how they stemmed from this masterpiece.  10/10, 5 stars, two thumbs up and all of the praise I can give.
