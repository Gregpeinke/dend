But fans were really caught off guard by the ending of 2004's Half-Life 2, as Gordon and ally Alyx Vance were caught in a massive explosion. Rather than have us wait years and years for the outcome of that cliff-hanger, Valve has taken the series into episodic territory to get us answers more quickly. Half-Life 2: Episode One was the first in a new trilogy of episodes that are scheduled to be released over the course of the year. (You don't need to own Half-Life 2 to play Episode One, as it's a stand-alone product, though it would definitely help if you did.) And Episode One is a memorable romp through the Half-Life universe, with gameplay that's even more satisfying than that of Half-Life 2. The only downside is that, due to its episodic nature, it's over far too soon.\n\nUnfortunately, Valve's storytelling remains about as cryptic as ever. Rest assured, answers are finally given, but keep in mind that new questions are raised, as well. Episode One is about the escape from City 17. Though the quisling Dr. Breen was defeated in Half-Life 2, the Combine remain on Earth, cut off from their alien dimension. Now, with the Citadel reactor on overload, it's a battle to escape the ruins of the gutted Citadel and the city itself. Of course, that's easier said than done, and you'll once again be plunged along a tightly controlled and highly scripted ride filled with a fair share of ups and downs.\n\nHalf-Life has always been a mix of combat and puzzle-solving, but the formula feels honed to a razor's edge in Episode One, as Valve seems to have designed content that's geared toward Half-Life veterans. The puzzles and battles seem even more complex and challenging. In fact, the best encounters in the game require a mix of puzzle-solving and combat as you desperately fight to stay alive long enough to figure out what you need to do next.\n\nThere's a wonderful new team dynamic at work in Episode One, thanks to the fact that Alyx battles alongside you throughout most of the episode. After playing on your own throughout Half-Life and Half-Life 2, it's refreshing to have a companion by your side, and Valve takes advantage of this by throwing you into situations where you must rely on teamwork to survive. Alyx is a capable assistant (perhaps almost too capable, since it's pretty tough to kill her off, and she seemingly has unlimited ammo), and she's often the difference between victory and defeat in many encounters, as she'll cover your back while you're busy trying to sort out the puzzle.\n\nSpending so much time with Alyx has other upsides, as well. The flirtation between Alyx and Gordon continues even further, and while it's a bit strange that it's such a one-sided relationship (thanks to Gordon, again, never uttering a single word), you still get a feeling of warmth and affection. There's lots of humor, as well, as Episode One features some sharp and witty dialogue uttered by Alyx and other familiar faces. Barney and Alyx's robotic Dog are back, as well as Eli Vance (Alyx's father) and the ever-hilarious Dr. Kleiner. Valve's impressive facial animation is still incredible, and you really get the sense that you're interacting with believable characters in the game. Of course, it also helps that the voice acting remains top-notch. Robert Guillaume, Michelle Forbes, Merle Dandridge (Alyx), and the original voice cast remain the same.\n\nYour arsenal of weapons also remains unchanged. The versatile gravity gun gets heavy use through the episode, and it's invaluable to solving the many environmental puzzles in the game, but other than that, you're packing the same assortment of pistols, rifles, and grenades as before. It's also worth noting that there are no vehicle sequences in Episode One\n\nIn terms of opponents, you do get glimpses of challenging new foes that are coming up in future episodes, but for the most part, the enemies remain the same from Half-Life 2, including the head crabs, zombies, Combine soldiers, striders, and so on. The Combine troops do seem to have some new abilities, such as the ability to rappel down buildings right in front of you. They're also a bit smarter, as they seemed to utilize cover better than they did in Half-Life 2, but you don't really get the sense of squad coordination that was seen in the original Half-Life. The only memorable new opponent is the zombine, a Combine zombie, and these guys quickly become your first target when they appear on the scene, thanks to the fact that their favored tactic is to charge you with a live grenade in hand.\n\nVisually, Episode One introduced a lot of subtle improvements and enhancements in the Source engine, keeping it in line with video-card developments of its time. The high-dynamic range lighting technology makes a big difference, as the outdoor scenes look a lot better, while indoor scenes feature impressive shadowing and atmosphere at times. Some of the textures in the game have been increased considerably, notably on Alyx and the other main characters, and the game looks incredibly sharp.\n\nWhen you get down to it, the only major complaint about Episode One is that it's over so quickly. There are only four to six hours of gameplay, and veteran first-person shooter fans will definitely find themselves at the lower end of that range. Finally, the game does include a developer commentary system of sorts, similar to the one used in The Chronicles of Riddick, and that does provide some interesting insight into the development of the game (though the rehearsed nature of the developer dialogue makes it sound more like a lecture than a proper commentary track). But apart from that one unique feature, the only thing truly new in Episode One is the single-player story. Before you know it, you've escaped from City 17, the credits are rolling, and you're left wanting more.

community.\n\n[b]We remember:[/b]\n\nAt the end of Half-Life 2, Gordon Freeman made the lousy Dr. Breen hot as hell and the Combine Citadel just exploded with a gigantic explosion - when suddenly time stopped, the mysterious G-Man stepped out, praising Gordon for his work. and the game was over.\n\n[b]Episode 1 builds on these events.[/b]\nAfter a mysterious interlude with a video image of Dr. Breen, the G-Man, and a few Vortigons, Gordon, Alyx, and their robot dog, Dog, find themselves mysteriously outside the citadel. However, they are not out of danger - the reactor is on the verge of complete destruction, which would leave little more than a lump of atomic crumbs from the area. That must be prevented and a way out of City 17 must be found!\n\nAt the beginning, Episode 1 just does everything right: \nThe start is super cool, atmospheric, fast-paced, full of emotions - I rubbed my hands and was happy as a child. \nBut then it goes steadily downhill. \nMost of the time you romp around in night-black buildings, the use of flashlights almost reaches Doom 3 level - that actually doesn't have that much to do with HL2. The overwhelming \"How great!\" The feeling of the predecessor is almost completely missing here. In addition, the good part is very short even for an add-on - when it comes to three to four hours of playtime, unsightly memories of half-life expansions like Blue Shift creep into the light of day. \n\nLast but not least, I think it's silly to be pushed onto the next few parts with all those story question marks old and new - [b]hey guys, answering some of the many open questions really wouldn't have killed you![/b] \nBut episode 1 has so many good sides too. The setting is still ingenious, the mixture of struggle and quieter moments in which small puzzles have to be solved is right, the acoustics are a party for the ears. \n\n[b]For HL2 fans, episode 1 is an unavoidable must[/b], even if the cake no longer tastes as delicious as it used to. \n\n[b]Still well made and in the typical half-life style.[/b]\n\n[b]As always, those who rely on achievemts, they have a lot to do.

I love the developer's commentary and I especially love the fact that Alyx is seemingly with you throughout the entire game. I thought Alyx was one of the most likable parts of Half Life 2 and I wished I seen more of her through my first play-through. I was very pleased when I was able to see the other characters grow and see their relationship with Gordon flourish. I wished the Half Life 2 story arch would have came to a conclusion, but maybe we'll see the end within the next decade? lol","timestamp_created":1618017933,"timestamp_updated":1618017933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90030705","author":{"steamid":"76561198379095688","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":426,"last_played":1618006767},"language":"english","review":"this game series is my all time favorite game series! i really wish there was a half life 3 and i really wish Valve would make it!","timestamp_created":1618006839,"timestamp_updated":1618006839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90026819","author":{"steamid":"76561198202999986","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1586801708},"language":"turkish","review":"Ana oyunun gayet kaliteli olan yan oyunu.

Its definitely the weakest Valve game I've played, but that's like complaining that the decorations on your 8 tier wedding cake isn't quite up to snuff. Up until this point, Valves classic level design had been peerless. A true testament on how to do games right. If Lost Coast and Portal says anything about Valve, its that they focus test to a fault. While its still here and still \"good\", i can recall possibly one or two times where it feels like that focus testing maybe skimped a few rounds, and it didn't \"blow me away\" as much as 0 and 2 did. Focusing entirely on city 17 limits this game hard, and thinking back to it I cant recall individual chapters like I could with 0 and 2. When I think back to 0, I go \"Oh that part in 0! Where you're up on the coast driving along, and then ooh! The raid on Nova Prospekt! That was kick ass! And RAVENHOLM OH MY GOOOD!\" But when I think back to 1 all I remember is the opening and breaching the surface to hear Kleiner's speech, and that's not even mentioning the times when I had to look up a guide in a Valve game, which should NEVER happen! The fact that all I remember from HL2-1 is some minor story beats kinda leads into my point that, lore wise, all this really does is bridge episode 0 to the much much more consequential episode 2. I feel like a lot more of note could have happened, that might've given 1 much more merit. \n\nAt the end of the day, its really good. I really only criticized it so much because you don't need to consult me for reasons why Half Life is good. But I think those criticisms are even more important than when I reviewed 0 because of how much missed potential is here. I feel like it could have been so so much more. I could nitpick at 0 if i wanted to, but it does nothing because its fucking Half Life 2, no minute flaws can truly blemish the amazing adventure the game puts you through.
