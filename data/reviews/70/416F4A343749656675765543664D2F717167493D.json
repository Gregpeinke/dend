It's an important historical milestone, like star wars. Also like star wars this isn't the original version. the UI is different, most of the stuff that I remember causing me grief is still here, most of the stuff I liked is gone. This is the \"Special Edition\" of Half life, that retains many of the bugs of the original: invisible walls, janky physics that will get you stuck mid loading screen, jerky motion, dumb AI... However you do get some of the improvements of the modern era: widescreen resolution (that you could get in the original just as easily), simplified soulless UI, HD models that are less detailed than the originals. \n\nThe game is a fun romp, through Black Mesa. The people in charge of this project, particularly the level designers are clearly talented and excel at something that .... few modern games do well, environmental storytelling. It also has some non-environmental storytelling, and no unskippable cutscenes. Instead you have unskippable tedious sections. \"host_framerate 0.09\" bind that to a button, trust me. \n\nThe platforming is surprisingly good. At least not nearly as infuriating as in BMS. Except the launchpads trigger in a very janky way, are totally unreliable, and the cases where you would need them always have some time pressure which makes this doubly more infuriating. Obviously this could've been fixed years later... It wasn't but at least you have an M4 instead of an MP5. \n\nThe later half of the game: xen, is thankfully less than half of the game. It's tedious, but mercifully short and to the point. A virtue that BMS lacks. \n\nThe combat is highly reliant on level design. This is great in most cases, because the level design in the main half of the life (pardon the pun), is actually not bad. Despite the fact that marines are hitscanning grenade spamming gods, they can be cracked just like a puzzle. It's run think shoot. If that's your jam, I'd advise you to play Deus Ex, but this is an acceptable introduction to the genre of shooters where brain is as important as brawn. \n\nThis game isn't ideal, but not by any means terrible. You can't legally obtain the masterpiece that this version is based upon, but it is nearly as good as the old game. If you have disposable income and want this exact game because you want to experience **half life** this is the best legally available version. If not, and you simply want to try half life... you're better off without it. This game pioneered the genre of run think story driven shooters, but its execution is extremely rough. It has a remarkable atmosphere and some jank that you either love or hate. If you do, this version is doubly infuriating because that delicate nostalgia is tampered with... if not, you will feel that this game is about as polished as a brick wall, and you will feel cheated. This game's rough edges are atoned for by the retro atmosphere, despite its very modern formulaic approach. it is unfortunate, but it lacked the creative genius of Warren Specter, and the technological finesse of John Carmack. What it had instead, was much better, but has become so prolific that better, more polished implementations of this very formula suffuse the modern gaming markets. It's not at all terrible, but not a solid recommendation. It's still WAY better than Black Mesa Source, so I would encourage you to play this instead of that. \n\nP.S. On Linux, I would recommend using the native executable, for the fonts. The performance deficiency is barely noticeable, and while I did have tentative success running Brutal Half life, it crashed very frequently. I would advise not using Steam Play unlike Black Mesa

es un First Person Shooter extraordinario, y uno de los videojuegos mas destacados en la historia de la industria. Tomando en cuenta que es un juego del año 1998, técnicamente es impecable. \nLos gráficos del juego son muy buenos para la época, especialmente el diseño visual de los niveles y los enemigos. Los efectos visuales (explosiones, destellos, etc.) son de lo mejor que se podía encontrar a fines de los 90.\nEn relación al sonido, personalmente creo que es uno de los mejores aspectos del juego: Half-Life tiene una ambientación sonora extraordinaria, que te permite una inmersión profunda en cada nivel. Esto aplica tanto para los efectos de sonido como para la música (si bien gran parte del juego no tiene banda sonora, cuando ésta aparece, es espectacular).\nAdemás, el juego tiene una jugabilidad muy pulida, tanto del lado del protagonista como de los enemigos: cada arma exige una forma de moverse y disparar y cada enemigo tiene una rutina de ataque y movimiento propia. Pero lo mejor en relación a la jugabilidad es el diseño los niveles: cada nivel es enorme, y si bien se recorre de manera relativamente lineal, no resulta repetitivo en ningún momento.\nEn cuanto a la historia, si bien el juego casi no tiene momentos narrativos (escenas animadas donde nos expliquen la trama o textos dentro del juego donde podamos conocer la historia), la saga Half-Life tiene una historia atrapante dentro del género de la ciencia-ficción (recomiendo leer wikis para los que quieran saber más). Además hay pequeños detalles como graffitis en las paredes, breves diálogos con NPCs, elementos estéticos en algunos escenarios y simples efectos de sonido que le dan una gran ambientación al juego. Mas que contarnos una historia, Half-Life nos sumerge de lleno en el juego y nos sugiere lo que esta ocurriendo. Que mejor ejemplo de esto que el hecho que Gordon Freeman, el protagonista del juego, sea una leyenda en el mundo de los videojuegos a pesar de que no habla nunca en el juego.\nEste título es un clásico, uno de esos videojuegos que hicieron historia en la industria y por una muy buena razón.\nEn caso de que al iniciar el juego el puntero del mouse se reinicie al centro de la pantalla después de mover la cámara, se puede solucionar desde el menú Opciones, opción Mouse, y activando la opción \"Raw mouse input\".","timestamp_created":1604018961,"timestamp_updated":1617405385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78369950","author":{"steamid":"76561198845976263","num_games_owned":995,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":427,"last_played":1631712839},"language":"english","review":"Valve's best game ever!","timestamp_created":1604017850,"timestamp_updated":1604017850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78369722","author":{"steamid":"76561198074627395","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1629017997},"language":"spanish","review":"Buenaso","timestamp_created":1604017501,"timestamp_updated":1604017501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78369401","author":{"steamid":"76561198169746507","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2965,"last_played":1629318816},"language":"english","review":"She is the mother I never had, she is the sister everybody would want.

Всього в грі 19 глав.\n\nГра легко модифікується, завдяки чому на світ з'явилися модифікації, які варті вашої уваги.\n\nМаю вам зізнатись, спочатку я не знав, грати в неї чи ні, але спробувавши, я навіть пошкодував, що не зробив цього раніше.\n\nМоя оцінка грі - 10/10.","timestamp_created":1603997835,"timestamp_updated":1603998070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.594978451728820801","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78351520","author":{"steamid":"76561198974358639","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":110,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1660496779},"language":"english","review":"Bro it's Half-Life just buy it.","timestamp_created":1603994080,"timestamp_updated":1603994080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":177,"votes_funny":37,"weighted_vote_score":"0.910861372947692871","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78341802","author":{"steamid":"76561198445841885","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":642,"last_played":1603964941},"language":"russian","review":"короткая","timestamp_created":1603982630,"timestamp_updated":1603982630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78340578","author":{"steamid":"76561198354409012","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":1947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":452,"last_played":1652599463},"language":"spanish","review":"Mejor fps de la historia.","timestamp_created":1603981402,"timestamp_updated":1603981402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78338813","author":{"steamid":"76561198120223423","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1342,"last_played":1596790811},"language":"koreana","review":"98년도 게임을 20년이 넘는 지금 해도 재미있다? = 갓겜\n주인집 아저씨 불러다가 자취방 방구석에서 이어폰마이크로 녹음한것 같은 더빙도 단순한 밈을 넘어선 게임 감초 역할\n\n아쉬운점\n게임 내 지도 , 미니맵 , 순서, 공략 힌트 등 일절 없이 몸으로 부딪혀 가면서 하는 불편함\n요즘 게임처럼 어디로 가라, 뭘 눌러라 하나하나 다 표시되는 게임에 익숙한 사람들은 \n안하는걸 추천\n\n평점 7/10","timestamp_created":1603979167,"timestamp_updated":1603980356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78337276","author":{"steamid":"76561199000114541","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":874,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":874,"last_played":1590102073},"language":"english","review":"One of the most important and still amazing first person shooters, a legendary game that definitely has earned its reputation","timestamp_created":1603977101,"timestamp_updated":1603977101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47IefuvUCfM/qqgI="}
