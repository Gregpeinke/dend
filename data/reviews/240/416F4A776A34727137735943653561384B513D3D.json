Мне говорят: \"Пошли в контру! Поиграем!\". В  CS невозможно играть, в нее можно задрачиваться, именно задрачиваться! Вся суть игры отточить навыки, такие как: выпригивание из-за угла, стрельба в голову, быстрое переключение между оружием в нужный момент. Я научился этому за 5 часов игры, более она мне не интересна. Далее конечно идет следующий уровень: оттачивание командной игры. На этом уровне вам прийдется заучить примерно три сценария развития сюжета. Все! Уровень пройден! \nНет, конечно в игре есть и плюсы, несомненно вы сможете натренировать реакцию, но тут есть вещь гораздо полезнее, приятнее и  не на много, но интереснее: натольный теннис. А лчшим из шутеров, всегда была, есть и будет ArmA!\nДалее, когда вы уже увидели мое отншение к серии, я выскажусь именно об этой части игры, она является лучшей из всей серии, я играл в CS 1.6 с её графигой йи физикой, я играл в CS:GO с её глубоким уклоном в сторону MMO, и я ни смог найти в них ни одного плюса, который не перекрывался двумя минусами в сравнении с CS:S!

only having played this for 2 hours (At the time of writing this review), I don't regret my purchase of this game, especially as it was under £4 when I bought it! The graphics in my opinion are pretty nice, especially for a 2004 game, even today they look quite nice. The gameplay features Terrorist VS Counter-Terrorists, and when you select a team, you have 4 different models to chose from for each team (Such as SAS and Seal Team 6 for Counter-Terrorists) and there are no classes. Instead of classes, you earn money to spend on guns and equipment in the next round, so as long as you can afford it and hold it in your inventory (I don't think you can carry multiple Assault Rifles e.t.c) you can pretty much make your own class. Want to be a Sniper with Night Vision? Go for it! Want to be a Shotgunner or Light Machine Gunner with an armored vest and helmet? Go ahead! If you are the kind of person who likes to communicate with the team or you have friends to play with, then teamwork will most likely be successful. Team work is the main point of this game after all. I'm not the kind of person who communicates with people I don't know, and I haven't played this with any of my friends yet, so team work hasn't been great for me, but that doesn't matter, it should be good for the majority of people. My only problems with this game, the maps can be a little too closed sometimes, but that's probably just me, and the armor doesn't feel like it does much (I know it does, it just doesn't feel like it (Probably because I keep getting headshotted)).\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nAudio: 6/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nOverall: 8/10\nThis game is a classic!\n\nUnserious:\nI got flashed, fell out of a window and landed in front of an enemy who shot me in the head with a desert eagle!100/10","timestamp_created":1403980895,"timestamp_updated":1404154511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10913259","author":{"steamid":"76561197995238744","num_games_owned":575,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1450070121},"language":"english","review":"This should be obvious at this point, but Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has more content, tighter and more fair hitboxes, more balanced weapons, and better anti-cheat detection.","timestamp_created":1403978574,"timestamp_updated":1403978574,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10913158","author":{"steamid":"76561198058224953","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":128294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":95896,"last_played":1450629112},"language":"russian","review":"Обычная стрелялка, можно играть в компании и с друзьями","timestamp_created":1403978359,"timestamp_updated":1403978359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10913075","author":{"steamid":"76561198049440153","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24507,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23522,"last_played":1387908247},"language":"english","review":"yeds","timestamp_created":1403978192,"timestamp_updated":1403978192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10912647","author":{"steamid":"76561198086020942","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":233,"last_played":1406984737},"language":"russian","review":"На свое время ток и на ней, и сидел=) \n","timestamp_created":1403977437,"timestamp_updated":1403977437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10912549","author":{"steamid":"76561197977491913","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24018,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23952,"last_played":1547580116},"language":"english","review":"One of the greatest FPS games I have ever played.","timestamp_created":1403977252,"timestamp_updated":1403977252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509237885475158691","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10912367","author":{"steamid":"76561198027921679","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":21821,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21821,"last_played":1434233004},"language":"german","review":"Eines der Besten Spiele der Geschichte!

veo de malo a este juego, es la manera es que te mueves y disparas por los entornos, es mucho, mucho pero MUCHO muy probable que no llegues a disparar una sola bala cuando ya estas muerto, y tienes que esperar a que la ronda termine para reaparecer y es ETERNA.\n\nHay gente que le gusta esto, a mi no y casi me arrepiento de comprarlo, pero recorde que antes de comprarlo (cuando hace tiempo lo tenía pirata) jugaba en un mapa todo sin texturas pero ahí no habia tiempo de aparición ni límite de armas, sólo reaparición instantánea y armas \"infinitas\" sin tener que pagar el dinero que ganas matando, por suerte lo encontré (y ya con texturas :D) y creo que jugaré en ese mapa para siempre.\n\nConclusión:\nSi no tienen paciencia, no lo compren.\n\nACTUALIZACIÓN:\nAhora que he jugado más me he percatado de que el 95% de los jugadores son profesionales con más de 1000 horas jugadas que te matan con la Deagle a medio mapa de distancia, esto es Counter y sólo puedo decir: o practicas

I've heard of CS Source but I couldn't tell you from where. I logged in and started out on my first map cs_assault. Before you knew it, I had gave the guy behind the counter another $20 and played for 9 hours straight that day. I only stopped because they were closing. The next day at school, it was all I could think about and I couldn't leave school soon enough to give that guy behind the counter another $20 to play for another 8 hours. If you added those hours plus the hours I put when I finally got a CSS last Fall, I definitely had over 400 hours of this game logged. And I'm still not that great. There is someone always better than you in this game because 400+ hours is moderate to some of the people who play this game. Add the fact that this game is highly moddable, there's a reason this game is still in the gaming lexicon, mostly conscience.\n\nPC gamer/FPS fan must have. My number 1 game of all time (yes, I played Half Life 2, about 8 years after it was released and I still don't understand the big deal) \n\nIf this was the only game I could play for the rest of my life, I'd be ok with that.\n\n10/10.","timestamp_created":1403881095,"timestamp_updated":1403881095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10872545","author":{"steamid":"76561198044972107","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":233,"last_played":1432762388},"language":"english","review":"Fun.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was the first one I ever played, the campaign remains in my mind today even though I no longer have it (I think?). When I saw that Source was available with Garry's Mod for all but a shilling, I had to grab it and give it a test run. Safe to say, I haven't been disappointed.\n\nWith a complete graphical overhaul, I was paying close attention to the detail of the weapons and smaller geometries around the world in addition to the character texturing/meshes. Valve pulled it off, and they did it well. I played this game for hours with a friend, jumping from server to server experiencing what I had never done before. Playing online at such a young age during Condition Zero was just something I never did. In my own personal opinion, Source is better than even the more modern day Call of Duty's, and it is from the same category (First-Person Shooter). I even think the sounds got some looking after as they seem to be much clearer then they did back in 2004. However, all good things must come to an end as I stopped my CS experience here: Global Offensive just does not appeal to me, at all. Onto the pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n» Graphical overhaul has mentioned, a real step-up from Condition Zero.\n» Sound also seems to be a big factor. I noticed that even the running sounds were revamped for the release.\n» Animations were reworked as far as I can tell. One thing that stood out to me was the idle animation for the knife.\n» Many online gamemods, great fun to play!\n» Although this is a Valve product, it has great integration with Garry's Mod which is nice to see.\n\nCons:\n» Considering this game is ten years old (I can't believe it!) it's absolutely magnificent. I just wish there had been a campaign like CZ.\n\nMy rating for CSS is 8/10. I took into account the length the game has been released and some of the technical factors in regards to the game engine and blockages that may have come up. The only thing that stopped it reaching a nine was the no campaign.
