Loved every second of it, more of the same but from another perspective and got to view some of what had already been seen from another point of view. Shorter than Half-Life but in my opinion slightly better in terms of detail, a trend which continues with the next expansion also. As with Half-Life itself could not recommend more, first time players might find it dated now but enjoy it for what it was and for me still is.","timestamp_created":1645133125,"timestamp_updated":1645133125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110440696","author":{"steamid":"76561198408637853","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1654892737},"language":"english","review":"good game!","timestamp_created":1645121914,"timestamp_updated":1654105720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110437006","author":{"steamid":"76561198990986910","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1645114836},"language":"russian","review":"кайф","timestamp_created":1645118312,"timestamp_updated":1645118312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110427379","author":{"steamid":"76561199154225430","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":235,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":235,"last_played":1645024127},"language":"russian","review":"думаешь что хардкорщик включаешь хард и срёшся от каждого врага","timestamp_created":1645109289,"timestamp_updated":1645109289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110410289","author":{"steamid":"76561199140614678","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":289,"last_played":1645951255},"language":"english","review":"Half life + new weapons + more green men + race x = good time\n","timestamp_created":1645089098,"timestamp_updated":1645089098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110409442","author":{"steamid":"76561198909026470","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":442,"last_played":1644964432},"language":"russian","review":"[h1]\"Оперативная Халва\"[/h1]\n\n[i]Half-Life Opposing Force[/i] - первое официальное дополнение к Half-Life, разработчиками которого, являются Gearbox Software по заказу Valve. Игра вышла в 1999 году, спустя год, после выхода оригинала. Игра предлагает самостоятельный сюжет, дополняющий и расширяющий вселенную игр Half-Life. Вместо главного героя учёного-физика Гордона Фримена, мы играем за вояка капрала Адриан Шепард, по сути мы играем за противников нашего психопата с монтировкой. Таким образом, игроки получают возможность увидеть события оригинальной игры от лица иного персонажа.\n\n[h1][b]Сюжет[/b][/h1]\n\nГлавным героем является капрал Шепард (нет, это не тот Шепард из Mass Effect или Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, это совсем другой персонаж). Он был послан в исследовательский центр «Чёрная Меза» для уничтожения всех следов неудавшегося эксперимента. Не успел Шепард прилететь в Черную Мезу, он со своими боевыми товарищами попали по самый не балуй, благодаря злобных пришельцев. Сюжет происходить косвенно с оригинальным Half-Life, то есть под конец первой халвы вояки решили эвакуироваться с этой дыры, и потом жахнуть туда бомбой. Шепард не успевает на эвакуацию из-за нашего старого знакомого G-man, который тот закрыл путь к вертолёту. Это значит, что худощавый хрен положил глаз на капрала Шепарда. И теперь герою нужно обезвредить бомбу, убить страшную ebaku из портала и сварить из этого. В конечном итоге после того, как Шепард всё сделал, он попал в лапы G-man. Тот говорит, заинтересован способностью решать все проблемы, но при этом говорит, что капрал настолько упертый баран и это мешает нанимателям G-man, но тот уговорил своих нанимателей сохранить Шепарду жизнь, и оставляет в стазисе до следующей встречи. И самое интересное, что G-Man, по всей видимости, был заинтересован в действиях Шепарда ещё до начала Инцидента, о чём свидетельствуют записи в дневнике главного героя и его присутствие на тренировке в учебном лагере. Во время Инцидента он принимает более активное участие в жизни Шепарда, чем Фримена, направляя и мешая его продвижению по Чёрной Мезе. В определённый момент он спасает Шепарда из запертого помещения, затопляемого токсичными отходами. Позже, когда Шепард, разряжает термоядерную боеголовку, которую чёрные оперативники привезли для уничтожения Чёрной Мезы, G-Man активирует её вновь так, как его наниматели первоначально желали, чтобы комплекс был взорван. И на этом всё, даже немного обидно, ведь спустя 20-ти про Шепарда ничего неизвестно и вряд ли появится в новых серии.\n\n[h1][b]Графика и звук[/b][/h1]\n\nВсё такой же, что и в первой Half-Life\n\n[h1][b]Геймплей[/b][/h1]\n\nВсё такой же, что и в первой Half-Life, но зато добавили новых противников от пришельцев до черных оперативников. Помимо этого появились новые пушки как гаечный ключ, нож, и пару инопланетных. Вместо фонарика игроку даётся прибор ночного видения. И вместо стандартных союзников: учёный и охранник, нам дают военного медика и инженера. И этой игры тоже есть мультиплеер, который ни чем не отличается от оригинала. А так ничего нового.\n\n[h1][b]Итог[/b][/h1]\n\n[u]Подведем итоги этой игры:[/u]\n\n[u]Плюсы:[/u]\n-Тоже самое, что и в Half-Life, и курс молодого бойца\n\n[u]Минусы:[/u]\n-Игра короткая и нам нужно продолжение про капрала Шепарда\n\n8 из 10 ругательств Дуайта Т.
