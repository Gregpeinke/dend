Lovers of puzzles and mystery will love this game. \n\nPros:\n- Great gameplay mechanics\n- Mysterious and captivating story\n- Tutorials are actually part of the story, not just some extra levels added at the beginning\n- Great voice acting (and manipulation), art and attention to detail in objects and level design.\n- Difficulty of puzzles never makes you get stuck in one point without knowing what to do. It never interrupts your gaming experience.\n\nCons:\n- Short duration\n\nHighly recommended, even more when it is on sale.","timestamp_created":1405539646,"timestamp_updated":1405539646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11275908","author":{"steamid":"76561198028754825","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":668,"last_played":1405630390},"language":"italian","review":"Divertente, accattivante, ironico, sorprendente e mentalmente impegnativo.

Portal takes place at the heart of the Aperture Enrichment Center, where the test subject is united with her trusty companion cube and Handheld Portal Device in the name of science. There are 19 test chambers altogether.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1] While the story itself might be a bit bare, there is plenty food for thought, and suggestive twisted backstory regarding Aperture. It all begins in the Relaxation Vault, where the test subject first comes into contact with the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (further referred to as GLaDOS), and is then educated on how to use the portal gun. With GLaDOS as your guide, what could possibly go wrong? After all, nobody else is as familiar with the Aperture Laboratories as the artificial intelligence that oversees seemingly all of Aperture's scientific experiments. Much of the story is best left unsaid, so I put the rest in spoiler tags.\n\n[spoiler]It isn't long before the character will stumble over various forms of warnings, from an unseen individual, warning her about the facility... More importantly, her guide. With this in mind, the character dynamics shift, and her task becomes clear: She must escape a laboratory otherwise devoid of human life.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1] Covering the basics: A complete portal consists of both an exit and entrance. Throughout the game, the character will acquire two extremely important pieces of equipment, which will enable her to create a complete portal. Initially, she will not be able to make a portal by herself, which forces her to rely on various forms of equipment littering the early chambers of the facility on her journey to the first gun. Only when the blue gun is acquired, can she unlock the ability to make half of the portal for herself. Soon after, she will be in possession of both portals, which is where the real fun begins.\n\nWith both halves of the portal, the options become endless. The character could essentially jump or fall forever. Regardless, the game offers a lot of content for beginners and advanced players alike. Regardless, the game is highly addictive, and will leave the player with a desire for more. If this is your first puzzle game, don't give up! Once you get the hang of the game mechanics, clearing the game will be a cinch. I promise. \n\nThe theme provides a perfect balance between creepy and mysterious, leaving the player in suspense. Yet, the best feature is easily the dialogue of GLaDOS which sporadically plays through the game. \n\nI think my only complaint is that the game is so short, but not to worry, there's a sequel. =)\n\n[h1]Controls:[/h1] I found the controls to be a little bit tricky at first, but they were something that grew on me with a bit of practice. The game is compatible with the XBOX 360 controller, if you have it installed to your computer, however I stand by my initial statement: Default controls are a bit tricky, but something that the player will easily pick up with a little bit of patience. I can't really complain too much about the controls in Portal.\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1] Aesthetically, Portal felt a little bland to me, but the overall effect fits its story perfectly. Sleek, and defined, the visual appearance does its job. On a very rare occasion, you might run into small graphics glitches, but it is nothing to worry about.\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1] I, for one, really freaking love the voice of GLAdOS. The amount of humour that she presents to the game is astonishing on its own, and really distracted me from being able to give a solid opinion about the otherwise subtle sounds of Portal. \n\n[h1]Replay Value:[/h1] Definitely a game that can be played multiple times! Portal is genius, and if you don't love GLaDOS (or Portal) within a few hours, I myself will question your humanity... Not to mention there will be no cake for you!\n\n[b]“Thank you for helping us help you help us all.” -GLaDOS[/b]","timestamp_created":1404894209,"timestamp_updated":1432623518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577329516410827637","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11147071","author":{"steamid":"76561198059455136","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1407665966},"language":"english","review":"\"This was a triumph, I'm making a note here, huge success!\"    -Glados\n\"This game was a triumph, I'm making a note here, great game!\"    -Triforcekids\n\nEverything about this game is AMAZING! interesting puzzles, graphics, easter eggs ect.\n\n CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM\n\n\"I'm different\"    -???","timestamp_created":1404892769,"timestamp_updated":1404892769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511834323406219482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11147020","author":{"steamid":"76561198064155650","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":238,"last_played":1421238451},"language":"german","review":"Sehr geil, hatte ich blos schon nach 2std. durchgespielt :/\nMehr Level hätten dam Spiel gut getan, aber gott sei dank gibt es eine gute community","timestamp_created":1404892489,"timestamp_updated":1404892489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11145765","author":{"steamid":"76561198056588360","num_games_owned":457,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1362643200},"language":"english","review":"One of my all time favorite games.
