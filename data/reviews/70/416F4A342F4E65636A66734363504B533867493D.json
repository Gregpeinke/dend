Eu tinha jogado o Half-Life: Source, antes, mas com certeza esse é melhor. Os graficos antigos do jogo passa uma intimidade no player. A gameplay desse jogo é incrivel, não é só \"andar, atirar\", tem partes onde você precisa interagir no jogo, como apertar botões, ativar alavancas e etc... A unica coisa que é ruim nesse jogo, é o exercito, que é extremamente apelão e muito irritante (ou seja, a IA é mt boa). Tem partes no jogo que é quase impossivel de passar, e quando você passa você se sente tão confiante pra jogar mais. Com certeza, Half-Life é um dos melhores jogos que ja joguei, recomendo MUITO, MUITO. É um jogo obrigatorio pra qualquer usuario da Steam.","timestamp_created":1628475455,"timestamp_updated":1628475455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97203707","author":{"steamid":"76561198061721733","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":545,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1624640043},"language":"english","review":"One of those games you definitely NEED to play.
