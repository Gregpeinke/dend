And as little as you may care about gaming history and are much more engaged in the questionable political views and correlating low hygiene of gamers, Half Life is a milestone for Valve (read [i]God[/i]) as a company and the PC gaming industry as a whole. \n\nYou'd have to lose yourself on some obscure middle eastern forum about Arabic poetry to not find people joke about “HALF LIFE 3 CONFIRMED TROLOLOL” because of how much an infamous cliffhanger Half Life 2 ended on. Naturally, after witnessing such a display of comedic genius under every post under the sun for the past +16 years, I was intrigued. And so, I finally decided to play this game everyone called the best game ever made, because it was made by God himself. \n\nRight off the bat, I can't go on without talking about my main guy, G, surname Man. The G-Man is hands down the most mysterious character in the Half Life franchise, if not in all of gaming. His voice actor, Michael Shapiro, did an amazingly fantastic job, letting his enigmatic and slithering delivery of his lines give us the mental picture of an alien lizard wearing a person suit as to not let his unimaginable appearance break your mind. Only Freeman's voice actor would come close to such a performance. \n\nHalf Life's story doesn't have the most original plot but it is mysterious and fascinating enough that it keeps you interested and guessing and people are not waiting for a sequel to Half Life 2 because the cliffhanger at the end made it obvious that it would be a trilogy, but because the story is genuinely interesting. Though, while the story is more show than tell, I am still unsatisfied with the quantity of plot in this, especially considering that the story can be summed up in only a few sentences. Allow me to try: Earth has been invaded by a space dictator, so G-Man pulls you out of the limbo, a few years after the Black Mesa incident because his clients ordered the right man at the wrong place, and puts you on a path straight to the belly of the beast, the Combine Citadel. However, Gordon can't follow orders, gets distracted, talks to a hot girl and a bunch of non-story-related stuff happens (cue Nam flashbacks of the boat and car chapters) before he finally stands before the big bad guy, my psychiatrist. He destroys the building with energy balls that are conveniently spawning endlessly and -CLIFFHANGER-. The End. \n\nCertainly, anyone would be frustrated with this conclusion, if it were indeed the final chapter we would ever see, but my frustration with the lack of story content is more related to this game itself, which brings us to the gameplay. Half Life is most and foremost a shooter. This is not criticism, this is a statement and as little as I usually care about shooters, this game was pretty fun. Only close to the end did I realize that many weapons only store very little ammo and that I was saving them for no reason, but I still enjoyed myself emptying one SMG mag per person. The source engine is equally fun as it can be frustrating, when you're stuck on a single piece of plywood and are softlocked from proceeding in your xenophobic killing spree. Thankfully, Gabe invented the F5 button because he knew something like this could happen. Plunging from one shootout to another, the story is regrettably forgotten about, as most dialogue revolves around explaining you to go from A to B so that one day you may reach point Z, where all the story stuff is going on right now. In short, the story is awesome but there is not much plot. \n\nTo calm down and look at something pretty, let's look at the graphics. Truth be told, I don't care much about graphics - I don't care much about anything other than “How fun is it and how little effort does it demand”, but I was genuinely surprised by how much they still hold up to today's standards. Most of the environment is interactable and can be played around with, which opens up a lot of possibilities for the use of strategic methods against your enemies, like throwing barrels at them, or throwing explosive barrels at them.\n\nThis is all great fun until you reach the point, I just call the city chapter. Please imagine lots of cursing and cussing in this part, because Steam won't let me type it out, but I honestly hated the parts in the city near the end. They legit pit you against 5 or more giant alien turrets that fire $200 custom made cartridges at 10k rounds per minute while you have 3 missiles. I don't know how I made it out there alive, so my best guess is, the enemies took pity on me and just despawned after an hour or so. Anything after this chapter was great and better than anything before in the game, so I can't complain too much. \n\nAll of this high-octane action spectacle could be yours tooooo~! And all that for the price of less than 8€! I'm not even kidding. You have for sure seen the price before this review (if anyone ever reads this) and were probably as shocked as I was. If you have any interest in buying this game, I  wholeheartedly recommend it, especially when they are practically selling this game as cheap as they can. \nGood
