Im someone who hates replaying games this is probably one of the few games i have played hundreds of times hell i even play it on my laptop (cus its a laptop and not many new games play well on it). Id have to say i enjoyed this version more than source because you get an M16 with a grenade launcher and in source you have an MP5 with a grenade launcher i mean i have no issue but its that the MP5 is a staple in the universe now but it was an M16 originaly. Its like giving you a barrett M82 in the first game and in its reskin there like oh heres a rock and a string that does about the same damage its the asthetics man the astetichs the astteticis cant spell aesthetics.\n\nALSO TO ANY ONE WHO SAYS HALF LIFE 3 CONFEREMED LET IT BE KNOW you kill a little piece of me each time you say it Sticks and Stones may break my bones but false conformations of Half Life 3 will put me in a deep depression.\n\nMay contain HEADCRABS.\n\n","timestamp_created":1420340456,"timestamp_updated":1420340456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472972989082336426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13821467","author":{"steamid":"76561198159291350","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":853,"last_played":1530998245},"language":"english","review":"I love this game, a lot better then most FPS.\nBut to me the controls are a tiny bit wonky and slippery, other then that I love this game.\n","timestamp_created":1420340351,"timestamp_updated":1420340351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13819700","author":{"steamid":"76561198042093260","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1410906009},"language":"english","review":"The gold standard for FPS games, still very fun to play despite very aged graphics.

Though I really wouldn't recommend using the series as a guide or walkthrough.\n\nBefore Half-life, I gone ahead and played Half-life 2 and the following episodes of the series first. Why? I was still in High School and playing on an XBOX then XBOX360 on the orange box. Looking back at the predeceeding games weren't the first thing on my mind, and now I feel happy to say that I played Half-life. My expectations for the game's environment and focus was well met, and gave not much but some idea why the Gordon Freeman character in Half-life 2 is so idolized. Part of the idolization is from being a highly accommidated scientist, not only surviving the resonance cascade but resolving it, and what I suspect being the perfect lab rat for extreme scientific development. \n\nMy main question is, is the game too long? The sudden shift of that almost puzzle solving and master bulgary training suddenly turned into persistant gunfights, and a near impossible boss fight that the game will get you addicted enough to fight through. Some chapter became as short as I-here-at-point-a-and-out. I lost count of the number of chapters, but I know the Half-life 2 saga didn't have any break a 15 chapter limit. I enjoyed the game more for the puzzle-solving aspects that I felt made it different from yet-another-pray-and-shoot sort of gameplay. Not to forget an almost comical atmosphere provided by how well the game sell such an absurb chain of events.","timestamp_created":1420004202,"timestamp_updated":1420004202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13730699","author":{"steamid":"76561198078748841","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2779,"last_played":1429023141},"language":"russian","review":"Являясь шутером от первого лица, игра представляет игровой мир глазами главного героя. Игровой процесс не разделён на миссии или этапы, поэтому действие заключается в непрерывном передвижении по целостным локациям, лишь технически разделённым на карты (хотя в середине игры протагониста оглушают солдаты HECU, и он приходит в себя уже в другой локации). Все карты линейны и, как правило, предполагают единственный возможный путь для прохождения. Связанные сюжетом и месторасположением карты объединены в поименованные главы.\n\nБольшую часть времени, как и в любом другом шутере, игроку предстоит отстреливаться от врагов. Степень жизнеспособности игрока определяется показателем здоровья и уровнем зарядки защитного костюма. Оба показателя можно восполнить несколькими способами, например, подбирая разбросанные по карте батареи и аптечки, или пользуясь стационарными зарядными станциями. В любое время игроку доступны загрузки и сохранения.\n\nХарактерной особенностью геймплея Half-Life является постоянное взаимодействие игрока с окружающей средой. Например, игрок может пододвинуть ящик, чтобы забраться на нужную высоту, или набросать в воду лёгких бочек, чтобы перебраться на противоположный берег. На основе интерактивности окружения построено множество головоломок, которые могут потребовать от игрока сообразительности.\n\nДругое проявление интерактивности окружения — возможность использования стационарного оружия, такого как орудие танка или пулемёт. Другой пример использования нестандартного оружия — вызов авиаудара по противнику при помощи задания цели на электронной карте. В качестве транспортного средства выступает вагонетка, поездке на которой посвящена целая глава.\n\nОсобым элементом геймплея являются так называемые джамп-пазлы. Игроку приходилось прыгать по платформам, корректируя в полёте дальность и направление прыжка. Джамп-пазлы достигли своего апогея в главе «Зен», где игрок прыгает на огромные расстояния по летающим островкам мира чужих при уменьшенной гравитации с «модулем длинных прыжков» на костюме.\n10 из 10 Классика жанра.","timestamp_created":1420003600,"timestamp_updated":1420003600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13730198","author":{"steamid":"76561198028123844","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":937,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":499,"last_played":1476133335},"language":"english","review":"Classic game.
