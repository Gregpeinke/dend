Honestly, I don't see it.  I played all the way through, and I can see how the engine was groundbreaking for it's time.  It has the typical valve feel of very fluid motion while running around and I like that, but not too much else.\n\nThe game started out amazing - it got my heart and emotions going in the first ten minutes, but after that it just seemed to fall flat.  The ending is also very interesting but not enough for me to recommend the game.  Valve seems to have made the story very vague and people like it because it is mysterious.  Yes, if you start looking it up online, or spending your hours in the car thinking about the story, then maybe you can read between the lines, but for me, there wasn't enough there.  I'm sure people won't like me saying this, but it seems like just a dated shooter.  If you are not wild about this genre, I'd say skip it.","timestamp_created":1429120932,"timestamp_updated":1429120932,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.428937077522277832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15388839","author":{"steamid":"76561198131685239","num_games_owned":321,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":648,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1428882760},"language":"english","review":"Ok... I know this is gonna be hard for some fans to hear but for me personally I wasn't that intertained with HL2. I don't hate it, but I don't love it either. Like I feel to say this is a no for me is not totally right. More of a meh type game, I like the story but the game play was like \"woo.. :/ what do I do now? ... ._.\". Also I died alot because I suck at these type of sudo platformer/puzzle games so yes I got #rekt. X') Ehehe, anyways I would suggest it if you enjoyed a good puzzle/interative game if that makes sense. It's not a FPS title to me more of a story oriented platform/sandboxish run around until you figure out what do/where to go. Maybe HL3 will interest me more. who knows. That's if it ever comes out, but yeah I did like the first game a whole lot more.

I think that graphics is there, even for today ( not FC4, but hey, its been a long ago ). Story and gameplay  are good, and the latter has the nice balance between shooter, horror and puzzle-like elements. Also, the visual design of the envrionment and characters in the game is impressive and delivers good atmosphere. With achievements or without them, this game has high replay value. Some parts of the game are hard and I think it's good - to feel and to overcome the challenge.\n\nSo, yes, I'll recommend others to play Half-Life 2.\n\nAnd now it's the time for annoying things.\n\nFirstly I want to admit the sudden lags in some locations ( especially tunnels and semi-destroyed buildings ). Lag appears out of nowhere and ruins gameplay ( sometimes I was 'forced' to use grenades and rocket launcher instead of shooting weaponry because I wasn't able to aim at all ). I've played on 'very high' settings and game behaved smoothly for 95% of the time. In addition to that game glitches sometimes: I had to load back and replay some of the levels to make some buttons on them work ( rechecked - it's not my fault, they just won't press ). \n\nSecondly, in my opinion, some parts of the game are overdone. I'm talking about the vehicle driving element ( the buggy part - its feels too long sometimes ) and level called 'sandtraps' ( its simply annoying to use gravity gun for dragging and tossing wooden and metal plates for a 20 minutes with death punishment for any mistake ).\n\nAnd finally, the allied AI... The allied AI reminds me of Fallout 1, when you weren't able to pass through the door, when your ally is standing there. And there was no way to push him or make him go away - the only option for you is to shoot your buddy, thats it . Half-Life 2 has something like that. I've died several times because of my AI comrades willingly guarding my back and blocking my way to escape from enemy fire. Also, AI allies are simply suicidal - they will attack strider standing with SMG in the open area, they will bravely disarm landmines with their bodies in front of you, or even as much close to you as it is possible. It is very annoying from the start, but when you'll get used to it, it's becomes even funny. \n\nGood things: atmosphere, story, graphics, gameplay, design, challenge and replay value.\nBad things: sudden lag & glitches, some parts of the game are stretched, the allied AI is just dumb.","timestamp_created":1429085080,"timestamp_updated":1429085981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15369866","author":{"steamid":"76561198103231952","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1092,"last_played":1645938384},"language":"english","review":"Simply one of the best games i've ever played 9.5/10\n\nPros:\nwell written story\nawesome graphics \nwell programmed AI\ncons:\nThe guns i did not like the design of\nand the puzzle elements in the game although well designed were strangley complex and difficult","timestamp_created":1429070946,"timestamp_updated":1429070946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15369568","author":{"steamid":"76561198110677510","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1517584088},"language":"english","review":"The game still holds up in 2015.","timestamp_created":1429069104,"timestamp_updated":1429069104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15369503","author":{"steamid":"76561198050653609","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1621645498},"language":"english","review":"Do you not have this game?

The storyline is great, so are the characters, but the AI for some of the characters is a bit annoying at times but back in the day was probably quite amazing. The graphics are great for this title and its probably some of the best of its time, but today the graphics are dated. \n\nTHe Verdict\n\nBack in 2004 this game set so many standards of what a FPS should be and you'll definitely think this game is fun and enjoyable, but don't expect anything new. Overall Half-Life 2 is amazing, it's very well done, it has a great story, great characters, great weapons, and is definitely worth every penny. I recommend you buy Half-Life 2 and every other Half-Life game, since all of them are very enjoyable. For me, this game set a standard of what every FPS should have and the moment Half-Life 2: Episode 3 or Half-Life 3 or whatever the third installment will be called, I guarantee you that I will pre-order this game on the spot.","timestamp_created":1428943973,"timestamp_updated":1428944193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15334426","author":{"steamid":"76561198128788775","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":2482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":767,"last_played":1619399220},"language":"english","review":"O n e C r o w b a r , P l e a s e","timestamp_created":1428923074,"timestamp_updated":1468199659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15333519","author":{"steamid":"76561197980926660","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":1157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":993,"last_played":1550950332},"language":"english","review":"Still a solid game to play once in a while.","timestamp_created":1428915271,"timestamp_updated":1595673701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15332006","author":{"steamid":"76561198139332307","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1462015428},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 1 got Oppsing Force.

It is one of those experiences that sticks with you long after you've completed the game. When I first heard about Half-Life 2 back in 2004, I remember seeing gameplay of it and wishing I had a PC. About a year later the Xbox version came out and though it was playable, the graphics were severely downgraded and there were too many loading times. It wasn't until I played the game  through the Orange Box collection that I finally got the \"true\" experience of Half-Life 2 and since then my admiration for this game has only continued to increase. Even after 10 years, this game still has better gameplay, storytelling, characters, atmosphere, physics, and AI than most other FPSs out there. If you are a fan of first person shooters or just gaming in general, you need to play this game. Also, the expansions packs of Episode 1 and Episode 2 are extremely entertaining. It is just a shame that Valve hasn't given us HL3 because I really want to see this story get some closure.","timestamp_created":1428891604,"timestamp_updated":1428891604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15329898","author":{"steamid":"76561198158179208","num_games_owned":966,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":766,"last_played":1469544228},"language":"english","review":"   Half-Life 2 was amazing.

Not to mention frustrating. First of all, the parts where you have to ride around in vehicles are horrible. Those parts are long, boring, and frustrating due to the horrible controls. But the vehicle part of the game was only the first thing that made me hate it. \"\nThen on top of that you have annoying characters. If it were possible, I would have killed all of my allies within the first 5 seconds of meeting any one of them. And believe me, I tried. Alex is the worst by far. Everyone is useless and annoying. Seriously, every five minutes it's \"Oh, look, Freeman's here. He'll do all of our work for us because we're lazy/incompetent/useless.\" If I was Freeman, I'd just let everyone die. Or better yet, kill them all myself. The only thing that would get me to consider playing the sequels would be if I got to go on a murderous rampage killing all of my allies.\"\n\n\"You waste more ammo than anything. With any automatic weapon, it seems that at best 1/3 shots hit their mark. It's impossible to aim with them because instead of your spray pattern being affected by how long you hold the trigger, it follows some kind of pattern. Your first shot might hit its target. It might not. It's horribly frustrating.\"\n\n\"I bought the Orange Box back in January after hearing how great it was.

Steam конечно крут, но истории надо заканчивать [/h1]\n\nПонятно, что многие считают эту игру шедевром и другое мнение вряд ли что-то изменит... Но увы, с течением времени недостатки всё сильнее бросаются в глаза и захотелось бы сильнее заострить на них внимание. Может не слишком корректно будут описаны претензии, даже мнение по этой игре какое-то вымученное. Просто не зацепило... Прохождение было через силу, только предфинал немного разбавил скуку, а концовка как обычно с намёком \"продолжение следует...\"\n\n1) Тотальное отсутствие реиграбельности.Сейчас эта игра кажется довольно унылой. Не знаю, но даже в первый раз временами игра была довольно скучной и хотелось, чтобы очередная глава поскорее закончилась. Например, рейвенхольм или песчаные ловушки. Возможно это впечатление сложилось из-за тотально прямолинейного рельсового геймплея. А ведь тогда уже вышли вариативные GTA 3  с аддонами, Chronicles of Riddick (который действительно впечатлил некоторой нелинейностью). Ситуацию осложняет то, что после игры остаёшься сидеть с кучей вопросов, ответов на которые нет до сих пор. Из-за этой унылости было не слишком интересно проходить и эпизоды. Второй эпизод был пройден вообще в 2021-м году\n\n2) Эпизодические продолжения. Это одна из тех игр, как и Sin Episodes, к которой продолжения выходили в виде коротких эпизодов, которые опять же не дают ответов на многие вопросы мира Half-Life. Сидеть в дураках, в ожидании продолжения довольно неприятно... И это довольно подло, выдывать вымученные краткосрочные фрагменты в виде продолжений. В библиотеке занимает целую строку, а полноценной игрой не является. Это между прочим неприятная тенденция в целом в стиме.\n\n3) Загрузки между уровнями, которые находятся вообще в не очевидных моментах... Бывало так, что несёшься сквозь сюжет на заряженной лодке, играет драйвовый эмбиент, напряжение зашкаливает... А потом - БАЦ, строка загрузки ни с того ни с сего, писк и опять тихая гавань, как будто ничего и не было. Очень резко обрывается активный игровой момент. Это очень напрягающий недостаток;\n\n4) Эта история до сих пор не закончена. Уже десятилетиями....\n\n5) Тотальные скрипты. Эта игра ода триггерам, при запуске которых во время игры происходит какой-либо адриналиновый процесс, возрождение врагов, срабатывание механизмов. До этого момента мир игры мёртв. Вне поля зрения ничего существенного не проиходит. Из-за этого возникает ощущение безжизненности происходящего.\n\n6)Игра практически не развивает... Несмотря на то, что это история про физика-ядерщика, хоть и на побегушках, но действительно интересного материала на тему распада или полураспада здесь практически нет.\n\n7)Бестелесный и безголосый персонаж. Не понимаю желания разработчиков обезличить персонажа, чтобы игрок легче ассоциировал себя с ним... Как можно ассоциировать себя с тем, кто вообще не имеет признаков жизни??? Особенно на фоне хроник Риддика, где персонаж был более харизматичным. А ведь время выхода этих игр было практически одинаково, но хроники Риддика незаслуженно ушли в тень второго Полураспада... Временами было довольно абсурдно смотреть вниз и не видеть ног, рулить, плавать, залезать по лестнице без рук... Мда... И это типа шедевр с оценкой в 90 баллов... Хотя многие игры от первого лица сделаны с бестелесным персонажем.\n\n8) Отвратная физика любого из оружий и при этом маленькая убойность. Даже ракетницей нужно попасть 3!!! раза в винт. Да одного залпа должно быть достаточно. Пистолет это вообще пневматика и дальше по сюжету его хочется вообще выкинуть, чтобы вес не смущал. Реакции у врагов на выстрелы практически нет. Это при том, что в том же Риддике даже заточка была грозным оружием... ПАРШИВАЯ ЗАТОЧКА! Хотя приличную часть игры мы за Риддика всех ломали практически голыми руками. Мда... Притом, что у Фримена есть усиливающий костюм. В общем, удовольствия от стрельбы нет, хотя это вроде бы боевик. \n\nСейчас, по прошествии времени, культ вокруг этой игры уже начинает раздражать, раньше просто забавлял. Похоже, даже сами разработчики не знают, в какую сторону двигать историю. А заканчивать её не хочется, чтобы иметь возможность в будущем получить дивиденды с этой серии. Тут не говорится, что игра плохая, но увы она уже безнадёжно устарела и сами Valve ничего не делают для вдыхания в эту вселенную жизни. Им она стала просто неинтересна. Хотя если им она так не интересна, то можно было бы её с большим желанием поскорей закончить, чтобы отвязаться от назойливых фанатов. Хотя хотелось бы, чтобы всю историю переиздали но новом технологичном уровне в бесшовном мире, но Valve в эту сторону совсем не чешутся :(\n\n\nПритом, есть образчики игростроения и похуже, просто было бы лучше вместо лайка и дислайка сделать в обзорах оценочную систему. По моим меркам игра сейчас тянет на 6 баллов из 10 ввиду устаревшей механики геймплея, межуровневых загрузок, довольно неоднозачной физики, плохой проработки оружия ну и других мелочей, оставляющих неприятный осадок. Но сама атмосфера игры слишком многообещающая, чтобы проходить мимо и ставить крест на этой франшизе. Может у Valve присутствует страх в развитии игры с революционными мотивами. В любом случае игра не закончена сюжетно и геймплейно, поэтому в данный момент не рекомендую, чтобы не изводить себя потом лишними вопросами.","timestamp_created":1428686150,"timestamp_updated":1646460153,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536434650421142578","comment_count":33,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15293173","author":{"steamid":"76561198135449843","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":246,"playtime_forever":3301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2800,"last_played":1525588666},"language":"czech","review":":D","timestamp_created":1428683197,"timestamp_updated":1505759954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15292670","author":{"steamid":"76561198096083180","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":896,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":680,"last_played":1462985034},"language":"english","review":"The first minute I played this game I knew that it would be truly amazing, which it was, the gameplay is perfect and the story is very intriguing.

EVERYONE should play it! But, anyways, let's get to it.\n\nHalf-Life 2 dumps you into a dystopian society under the rule of a mysterious alien force known as the Combine. As it turns out, your character (the now-legendary HEV suit-wearing Ph.D Dr. Gordon Freeman) indirectly caused this to happen (see events of Half-Life 1 for details :).\n\nGameplay: 10/10 The game is extremely well designed, and though the graphics look a touch dated by today's standards, it is still a fantastic experience. The chase scenes where you are escaping a city via airboat through abandoned canals gets your heart racing, and while you're in the city, there are many small touches that help to emphasize the depressed nature of the beginning of the game. It was one of the most immersive gaming experiences I've had.\n\nStory: 9/10 To top off having good gameplay, the storyline is fantastic. While not the best I've ever seen (that title goes to The Ur-Quan Masters, aka Star Control II), it is still quite good. The dialogue is reasonably good, the voice acting is quite well done, and the animations to go along with it really make the story hit home. When a character is talking to you, they actually make eye contact with you. The lack of cutscenes helps a lot, as well, keeping you \"in your role\" throughout the storyline.\n\nCharacters: 9/10 The characters in the game are well-designed, with your companions having distinct personalities and behaviors. The only main character that I feel is the exception to this rule is Dr. Judith Mossman. I'm not entirely sure what to make of her, to be honest, not to mention that it's never really made clear why she's in the game in the first place. \n\nI also need to take a moment here to give one of the main reasons for my love of this game: Gordon Freeman is one of the most awesome ideas for a main character ever! Instead of choosing a soldier or ex-soldier (or perhaps a hired gun of some kind), Valve elected to go with a theoretical physicist with a Ph.D from MIT. The other bit of genius is this: since Dr. Freeman doesn't say anything, it allows the player to \"tailor\" his actions to create their own personal version of the protagonist. For example, in my playthrough, becuase of my playing style, Gordon Freeman is a calm, reserved, cautious man, always on alert for things to jump out at him and always trying to keep as many allies alive as possible, whereas when my friend plays as him, he's a maniac with a death wish who rushes into things and sprays bullets everywhere, lol.\n\nWeapons/In-Game Items: 7.5/10 This is really the only category in which the game comes a bit short in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, there's still plenty of weapons to choose from, ranging from pistols to assault rifles to RPG's, but I still feel like some more diversity would have been nice. The original Half-Life did an excellent job of this, giving you everything from experimental energy-based weapons to classic assault rifles to exotic alien weapons. Still, its not enough to really hold back the game. As far as other items go, there's not a whole lot to say. The Gravity Gun makes up quite a bit of diversity in and of itself, allowing you to make kills with various props within the game. I mean, okay, there's no fancy laser cannons or anything, but I killed a Combine soldier with a toilet, so that counts for something, right?\n\nAll in all, I give this game a very solid 9/10. This game is probably one of the most complete packages around in term of overall quality. It may not win in any one category over other games, but it does a good enough job with everything that it doesn't matter.

The sequel has nearly the same mechanics as Half-Life, including health-and-weapon systems and periodic physics puzzles, except with the newer Source Engine and improved graphics. The player also starts without items, slowly building up an arsenal over the course of the game. Despite the game's mainly linear nature, much effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting; many optional areas can be missed or avoided.A diverse set of enemies are present, which usually require being approached with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, like the Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors; some use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. At one point in the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers, and can send his team further from him or call them back; however, they can still die easily due to lack of damage protection. Squad members are indicated on the HUD (squad member icons with a cross sign are field medics).Many of the game's new features utilize its detailed physics simulation. Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles. Instead of button-based puzzles from Half-Life, environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems, revolving around the player's new ability to pick up, move, and place objects. Solutions involve objects' physical properties, such as shape, weight, and buoyancy. For example, in Chapter 3, Route Kanal, the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see-saw ramp to proceed over a wall. Alternatively, the player can use these to build a crude staircase, so sometimes, multiple approaches lead to the desired outcome.Part-way through the game, Gordon acquires the Gravity Gun, which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, as well as to manipulate larger and heavier objects than he is able to alone. These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and can also be used to great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense (e.g. a file cabinet) or a deadly projectile (e.g. a gasoline can or a buzzsaw blade).The game never separates the player with pre-rendered cutscenes or events; the story proceeds via exposition from other characters and in-world events, and ensures that the player controls Gordon for the entirety of the game. Much of the backstory to the game is simply alluded to, or told through the environment.\nSetting:\nHalf-Life 2 presents a dystopian alternate history of Earth, where the resources of the planet, including the human race itself, are being harvested by an oppressive multidimensional empire, known as the Combine. The game is set around the fictitious City 17, roughly 20 years after the events of its predecessor Half-Life.During Half-Life, the scientists, including Gordon Freeman, at the Black Mesa Research Facility, accidentally caused an inter-dimensional instability known as a resonance cascade and later as the \"Black Mesa Incident\", when an experiment on an alien crystal sample went wrong. Alien creatures, such as the Vortigaunts and headcrabs, from the borderworld of Xen, flooded into the facility. Gordon fought his way through them and the government cover-up response combat units, making it to the Facility's Lambda Complex. There, the Lambda scientists helped Gordon teleport to Xen, where Gordon destroyed a large alien entity keeping the rift open. Gordon was then suddenly extracted by the mysterious G-Man, who had been watching Gordon over the course of the game. Impressed with his ability to survive against all odds, the G-Man offered him a job before placing him into stasis, which Gordon had no option but to accept.Some time after the ending of Half-Life, the instability at Black Mesa had attracted the attention of the Combine empire, and they invaded Earth. Humanity surrendered at the conclusion of the resulting \"Seven Hour War\". City 17 became the home of the gigantic Combine Citadel, and Dr. Wallace Breen, the Administrator of Black Mesa who had negotiated the surrender, was appointed representative and Administrator to supervise the survivors on behalf of the Combine. Unable to breed due to a Combine suppression field, humanity matured. The Combine implemented a brutal police state of Civil Protection officers and Overwatch soldiers by recruiting and biologically assimilating humans and other species. Meanwhile an underground \"Lambda Resistance\" of humans and Vortigaunts, now working together, was formed, and saw Freeman as a savior who would lead them to freedom.\nPlot:\nGordon Freeman is brought out of stasis by the G-Man, who inserts him into a train arriving at City 17. After arriving at the station and eluding Combine forces, Gordon joins Lambda resistance members including Barney Calhoun, a former Black Mesa security guard now working undercover as a Combine CP officer, and Alyx Vance, the daughter of one of Gordon's former colleagues, Dr. Eli Vance. After a failed attempt to teleport to Eli's resistance base known as Black Mesa East from Dr. Kleiner's makeshift laboratory in City 17, Gordon, re-equipped with the HEV suit and a crowbar, is forced to progress on foot through the city's old canal system. After obtaining an airboat, he battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city.Gordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets another resistance scientist, Dr. Judith Mossman. Alyx introduces Gordon to her pet robot D0g and gives him a \"gravity gun\", an instrument which allows Gordon to pick up and move large objects with ease. Black Mesa East comes under Combine attack, and Eli and Mossman are taken to a Combine prison, Nova Prospekt. Separated from Alyx, Gordon takes a detour through the zombie-infested town of Ravenholm with help from its last survivor, Father Grigori. After making his way through the town and a mine, Gordon arrives at a Resistance outpost. He uses a customized dune buggy to travel a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt, encountering Combine patrols and assisting the Resistance in fending off raids.Gordon lays siege to Nova Prospekt by using alien \"pheropods\" to command the hordes of antlions that infest the coast. He reunites with Alyx in the prison and they locate Eli, but discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can stop her, she teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel. The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt.Reaching Kleiner's lab, Gordon and Alyx learn that they were caught in a \"slow teleport\", during which a week has passed. In their absence, the Resistance has mobilized against the Combine, turning City 17 into a battleground. During the fighting, Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel, as Gordon fights through the city with the aid of D0g and Barney to reach it. Inside the Citadel, he is caught in a Combine \"confiscation chamber\" that destroys all of his weapons except for the gravity gun, the energy enhancing its capabilities and turning it into a superior weapon.Eventually, Gordon is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office, where he and Dr. Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity. Dr. Breen begins to explain his.\n\nThe sequel to one of the best game ever .Cant wait for Half-Life 3 11/10","timestamp_created":1428592242,"timestamp_updated":1428771408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15278445","author":{"steamid":"76561198046041651","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1639786361},"language":"english","review":"Although this game may be 11 years old, I personally believe that it looks much better than most games made today, and with is great story continuing from Half Life, it has an amazing replay value!
