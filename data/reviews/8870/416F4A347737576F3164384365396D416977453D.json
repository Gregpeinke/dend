Also the writing is kinda odd in my opinion.\n\nBurial at Sea - Part 2 is better. The stealth is kind of underdeveloped, and it kind of felt like they forced the whole \"Elizabeth was the cause of Jack going to Rapture.\" thing.

Embark on the journey as you play Booker DeWitt, and your goal is to rescue elizabeth, mention in the beginning of the game as 'the girl'. Columbia, the opposite city of Rapture(the city in 1 and 2), is that columbia is all patriotic, shiny, beautiful and full of joy, and the city is in the sky, compare to the dark, chaotic and underwater city of Rapture. Personally, i love more Rapture because i find the city more interresting than Columbia, but i still love them both. The Dlc's in Bioshock Infinite, are called Burial At Sea, where Booker and Elizabeth goes to rapture, and i would recoomend those dlc's because they were fun. i RECOMMEND this game, and would strongly recommend the first ones Bioshock 1 and 2, and the Dlc's of Infinite. The game for me is a 9.5/10, the Bioshock franchise is among my favorite games in my collection.

作为fps游戏在枪械上中规中矩，没有特别的惊喜，但是该有的都有。射击手感蛮不错的，前期的战斗十分过瘾 但是游戏到了后期敌人的种类和场景的变化都不够丰富 战斗会显得冗长 有种强行拖时间的感觉，节奏把控不是很好。在加上难懂的剧情这一点是致命伤。\n  综上老羊阳的主观评分：\n  画面：10（有些小细节有待改善）\n  剧情：7（有深度但是太难懂）\n  游戏性：7（后期太冗长）\n  音乐：9

А в в Infinite мы попадаем в живописную Колумбиу на небесах.Как говорят сами HPS \"рай земной\". Игра может похвастаться живописными видами,отличным и запутанным сюжетом который частично связан с первыми двумя частями. хорошими и проработанными персонажами.И не куда не делся фирменный адом. Только если в первых частях мы кололи его то теперь мы его пьём (и название поменяли на соли) и их стало больше. Вообщем игра получилась шикарной, с красивой графикой и не высокими системными требованиями.
