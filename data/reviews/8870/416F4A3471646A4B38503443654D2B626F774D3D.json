Разумеется, все стало лучше-стрельба, отдача, перегрев, анимации, то, как враги реагируют на попадания, расчлененка в умеренных масштабах. Играется очень бодро и не надоедает до самых титров. Есть парочка новых абилок, которые связаны со следующим пунктом.\nЭлизабет. Ну просто главное украшение игры. Она центр всего, она восхитительный компаньон, наверное, лучший из всех, что были. по крайней мере в линейных сюжетных играх точно. Она потрясяюще прописана, и, что самое главное, она не вызывает людо-нарративный диссонанс. То,какая она в сюжете и то, какая во  время игры-один герой, один персонаж, один человек. Она настолько живая и интересная, что я могу расхваливать её практически вечно. \nНу и плавно переходим от Элизабет к непосредственно всему сюжету. И, ох ты, Боже мой, он прекрасен, он заставляет тебя включать голову, чтобы разобраться во всем и, поверьте, после первого прохождения вы не поймете даже половины всего того, что там происходит и как это все устроено. Я получил дикий кайф от всей истории(ДЛС обязательны к прохождению, благодаря им Инфинит имеет право называться 3 частью Биошока). Я думаю, кто-то может со мной не согласиться и это нормально. Но сюжет имеет такие твисты, такие завороты, а ДЛС все так связывает воедино-первую и третью части, что я просто не могу не впадать в Восторг от всего этого.(Лол, это вышло непроизвольно, сам не ожидал каламбура). \nВсе,что я хочу сказать, это: Будь любезен, пройди эту игру.","timestamp_created":1644676555,"timestamp_updated":1645272093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110060934","author":{"steamid":"76561198395392573","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1655504525},"language":"czech","review":"GG","timestamp_created":1644673869,"timestamp_updated":1644673869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110058673","author":{"steamid":"76561198829098142","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":574,"last_played":1644668311},"language":"schinese","review":"全流程不加dlc通关也就6、7小时的样子，因为老想把录像带搜集完多花好多时间，不愧是神作，13年就已经能做到这种程度了，9年之后来看这剧情也非常nice。","timestamp_created":1644671725,"timestamp_updated":1644671725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110058302","author":{"steamid":"76561199182832501","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":104,"last_played":1645447231},"language":"schinese","review":"tnnd,这就是第九艺术吗，太棒了，快买！","timestamp_created":1644671356,"timestamp_updated":1644671356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110055976","author":{"steamid":"76561199000368040","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1644667767},"language":"english","review":"Great

From my perspective, in terms of its setting and narrative, Infinite falls under the pulp category, akin to adventure movies from the middle of the 20th century. It sure contains the same exceeding amount of racism, reproduced to be deconstructed in the spirit of our era and, of course, presented from a completely different angle, mocking and poetic in equal measures.\n\nThe first and last puzzle, which insulted everyone's intelligence, is an irrelevant meme at this point. But looks like it still stings, causing a divide in the masses. Although, I'd be a huge snob if I actually held it against the game and not its fanboys. Who resort to praising it for showing portals as well as a bunch of flying buildings and then having quantum physics mentioned briefly. Instead of magic, it's particles! Referencing ideas isn't the same as implementing or exploring them. The claim lacks a follow-through.\n\nThe science of it all remains a hocus-pocus mumbo-jumbo. It's fine, but the predicament reflects on the world we live in today, where merely stating that physics is good because it lets us see the world beyond our observational capabilities wows people with boldness. Yet, despite being used as a carte blanche for pseudo-intellectual swagger, it's a good message, considering all the anti-vaxxers and flat-earthers skulking around. Alas, it isn't profound or delivered in any kind of mind-blowing way by a long mile.\n\n[h3]Artistry[/h3]\nLet's describe something that describes itself. Stylistically, compared to older installments, it's Baroque vs. Christian cheese all the way. Everything's baked-in, petrified, from lighting to geometry. The levels might as well have been pre-rendered, which is a fair price to pay for polish and gorgeous sights. The architecture is monumental! The city is blooming with striking colours, industrial hellscapes have their factory pipes smoking like guns, and the juxtaposition of luxury and poverty jumps you.\n\n[h3]Zack Comstock and the Fate of sᴉʇuɐʅʇⱯ[/h3]\n[quote]\"Just because this city flies doesn't mean it doesn't have its share of fools.\"[/quote]\nBioshock games always revolved around cults. They've shown the world that droves of gullible people don't even need tangible cult leaders and easily fall for mere virtual gobbledygook. Yet, reaching that height was an achievement on the writers' part. However multi-dimensional in his bigoted megalomania, Cumsock didn't come close to the meme status of his precursor. This is what you get when your idol is a racist coffin-dodger who grosses an entire nation out by endlessly preaching about his seed. Ew, gramps, shut it!\n\nOne of the biggest gripes I thought I'd have with the game was its heavy-handed anti-racist moral. I'm still not sure if they expected me to take it seriously or to burst into laughter due to the level of mustache-twirling overkill involved. Even the Irish aren't white enough for these brats! To top it, they jumpscare you with racist Chinese and Indian faces, which is just farcical. Yes, racist jumpscares are apparently a thing that exists. And... I loved this campy parody of religiously patriotic nonsense!\n\nThey ask you whether you want to help the freedom fighters while holding you by your suspenders over a concentration camp where prisoners wear cartoonishly striped uniforms. They don't hesitate to throw a child amputee your way. I dig the old reductio ad absurdum device, it's a plausible absurdity since real-world racism is grotesque by nature. And above all, Infinite draws a comprehensive picture of good intentions getting inevitably corrupted by allowing the bloodthirst of an overthrown dictatorship to persist in the new era.\n\n[h3]False Shepherd and the Lamb[/h3]\n[quote]\"Lets not call each other that.\"[/quote]\nBefore playing, I was a bit annoyed with all the Elizabeth-worshiping fans and their \"she said \"multiverse\", she's my waifu now\", but at the end of the day, she isn't a vehicle for some virtue signaling but a well-written and exceptionally well-animated person - lively, hopeful, and her facial expressions are priceless. Dewitt and Liza share the best story beats and engage in enjoyable banter during which he doesn't act like he's Liza's daddy and she ain't no sissy herself. For one, you don't have to protect her and she's actually indispensable in and out of combat.\n\nHe's an ex-military man, a slayer of the working class in an infinite amount of worlds, and its hero in another infinity. It isn't a question of whether he is a murderer, because of course he is! The past tortures him, and not because he killed people, but because he killed the wrong people. The game doesn't make a wet blanket out of Liza either, touching these subjects in a brief, yet meaningful way. Until it seizes to be an option, she throws to the side her own PTSD and the heavy burden of responsibility her powers infer for the greater good. Respectable.\n\n[h3]\"There's survival... and there's finding pleasure in the act.\"[/h3]\nA Bioshocker in me squirmed at first since it doesn't play like a Bioshock game. Wouldn't even call it a streamlined version. The maps are linear, the variety is lacking, and the 2-weapon carrying limit is stupid. Hell, even the audio logs are shorter than ever! It's barely a looter-shooter, more like a shooter with light elements of limited, yet rewarding loot-incentivized exploration. But I quickly forgave it for not being an immersive sim and a true successor.\n\nBecause what remains is a tight, high-feedback arena shooter. Although you now have a regenerating energy shield, on Hard, the game baptized me in Kool-Aid more often than its predecessors did. No stimpack on a hotkey to keep you going forever, just Liza's inconsistent handouts and what you find on the battlefield. Enemies aren't bullet sponges, but they produce copious amounts of damage, so getting distracted often means certain death. Their roster isn't that diverse, but where else could you witness a mecha Washington from a parallel dimension spinning a hurdy-gurdy minigun, huh?\n\nThe game could use extended environmental interactivity, and although sliding on rails and hanging on hooks was kinda fun for a while, the feature is underused. It all comes to abusing corners and the high ground, especially since the most Bioshock trait of them all, extremely sluggish movement, was carefully preserved for some reason. Killing egomaniacs is another distinctive, and this time more positive, property of the series. As always, you'll have to wade through their theme parks to have the gratification of putting them down for good. One of them even tried to give me a job. The audacity!!!\n\nAll weapons are fantastic and the meaty gunplay makes said killing fun. The game incentivizes weapon juggling by curbing your ammo capacity, but I didn't have to switch often anyway, it isn't exactly Halo. I liked blasting so much that I even enjoyed the shooting gallery mini-games at the beginning! Not as much when I had to repeat them after closing the game in a hurry. The checkpoints are weird and redoing exploration sucks. Finally, there are upgrades and equipment, but they're nothing special. When it came to Plasmids, or Vigors, I almost never used anything but the lovely head-popping lightning.\n\n[h3]End[/h3]\nI enjoyed Infinite as a creative action flick, which narrative doesn't provide any kind of subtlety, replacing it with heartfelt violence and camp. Although, good writing doesn't have to be subtle or sophisticated. To devise something over the top, emotional, and so transparent that not even the densest of dimwits could possibly miss the point is a feat of its own. The story is beautiful and touching, yet even if it was crap, disregarding the gratifying action would be silly.\n\nMy curator [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35305390-Big-Bad-Mutuh/?appid=262060]Big Bad Mutuh[/url]","timestamp_created":1644551316,"timestamp_updated":1644694453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":41,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592857420444488525","comment_count":24,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109957674","author":{"steamid":"76561198274776594","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1039,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":884,"last_played":1644680544},"language":"tchinese","review":"好玩","timestamp_created":1644547284,"timestamp_updated":1644547284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109957247","author":{"steamid":"76561198199898634","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":327,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1659945518},"language":"english","review":"第九艺术\n","timestamp_created":1644546607,"timestamp_updated":1644546607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109956636","author":{"steamid":"76561198027079173","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1012,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":768,"last_played":1644723041},"language":"english","review":"The whole series was interesting and I never got into it until this  year.

No Rapture, no Plasmids, no Little Sisters or Big Daddies and certainly the city is not under water. It brings a new look set in a new world with things familiar yet foreign enough to not be connected to what we know from first two games. Although Vigors act in the same way as Plasmids did they're less varied in elements with enemies less varied in their own elemental properties, that the majority of the game is simplified and most likely played with weapons only, even on 1999 difficulty. Story itself doesn't really get you personally involved with the female companion, making her just someone who's part of the job you're on a mission to do, until the very last part of the game where your own involvement to her is revealed, too little, too late. Songbird on the other hand is the one with the most personality yet it is a bird with no dialogue and its ending the most heartbreaking.\nThe new addition to the franchise that is a lot of fun to use is the Sky-Hook which is used to traverse certain parts of the city the current mission keeps you in, as well as a melee weapon which ends up being a bit redundant since the open parts of the city keep enemies far away from you, sniping you from the distance rather than engaging in close combat since the game is focused more on combat rather than stealth. Unfortunately with no way to go back to parts of the city explored previously Sky-Hook ends up being very limited in how and when it's used which is a real shame. The game would've benefited with having parts of the map connected by Sky-Hook travel system, allowing both returning to areas and more fun time spent on the rails. Overall it's a good game in the franchise, but it stands out so much with new things not used as much as they could've been that it makes it feel and play like a completely new franchise more focused on action than stealthy horror elements.\n\nBurial At Sea DLC sees us return to Rapture, as well as give us back Plasmids, limited in number and only ones with elemental properties, with Sky-Hook making a comeback too, although once again limited though for good reason. The stealth-horror is back, especially in Episode 2, and the open sky replaced once again with water and enclosed space, a welcomed change from the main game, and seeing the return of both Little Sisters and Big Daddies hitting right in the feels. The story makes a full circle back to the original game, tying everything up nicely with a fulfilling ending.\nThe only shaky part is Elizabeth's story which the game would've worked beautifully without, but it doesn't ruin it (much) to be counted as a negative. \nClash of the Clouds DLC however is a different beast altogether. As much fun as it is trying to get through the waves and get ribbons it's soon apparent it punishes more than it rewards. It's one thing to be challenging, but another to completely remove the entertaining aspect of doing the waves when there's no repeat option for a single wave to try and get the missing ribbon, making the achievement connected to them tedious and grinding too much that it ends up being a negative.\n\nOverall BioShock Infinite and its DLCs are a nice ending to the franchise which serve as its beginning as well, with such a unique story, characters and world one can't help but replay them all, all over again.","timestamp_created":1644506177,"timestamp_updated":1644506177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109927213","author":{"steamid":"76561198893803306","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":671,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":671,"last_played":1644501804},"language":"english","review":"Elizabeth is the greatest companion of all time \n","timestamp_created":1644505644,"timestamp_updated":1644505644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109927203","author":{"steamid":"76561199102210187","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1053,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":680,"last_played":1644866199},"language":"german","review":"Auch in 2022 hat dieses Spiel viel Unterhaltungswert und kann bestens gespielt werden.\nFür das Haupspiel habe ich ca. 11,3 Stunden Spielzeit gebaucht. \nGrafisch und inhaltlich finde ich es sehr gut gelungen und war wahrscheinlich seiner Zeit weit voraus.\nDie DLC's werde ich noch spielen und freue mich darauf.\n\n","timestamp_created":1644505636,"timestamp_updated":1644505636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109920117","author":{"steamid":"76561198317733072","num_games_owned":526,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":3667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3667,"last_played":1644489295},"language":"schinese","review":"+极富想象力、艺术般的场景与美术设计（天空之城、海底都市、蒸汽朋克、平行宇宙等要素共同打造出一个生动的反乌托邦世界）\n+主题丰富且深刻 发人深思 耐人寻味（涉及种族歧视、资本主义、战争与和平、宗教信仰等深刻的意识形态暗喻）\n+强调剧情驱动同时结合经典FPS玩法并辅以世界观特色的异能手段的战斗设计\n+出彩的角色塑造 尤其是女主角伊丽莎白的设计（无论从外表服装、面部表情、人设性格、互动设计等足以堪称行业一流水平，感叹在2013年就有这样的技术力，我相信玩过的玩家一定会对伊丽莎白有特别深刻的印象）\n\n-无法手动存档 只有自动存档（虽然游戏会在剧情章节处或重要进展处进行自动存档，但无法手动存档多少有点影响游戏体验）\n-FPS玩法部分中规中矩（即使是在各种奇妙异能的加持下，能够给射击体验增添的乐趣始终有限，导致后期更想跳过战斗看剧情）\n-剧情主旨暗喻较多较晦涩 可能理解起来有些困难 需要花时间体会 介意的玩家请谨慎游玩（DLC部分与前作联系尤为密切，如果您跟我一样直接从本作开始入坑生化奇兵系列可能会对DLC的剧情一头雾水，看样子得花时间云一下整个系列的解析）\n\n总评：文艺气质十足的一款奇幻叙事冒险游戏！玩过才懂得为什么是广为人叹的“第九艺术” ！以及我永远喜欢伊丽莎白！！\n个人评分：9/10","timestamp_created":1644497203,"timestamp_updated":1644497282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580399036407470703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109915484","author":{"steamid":"76561198053457450","num_games_owned":447,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":635,"last_played":1644487306},"language":"english","review":"So, this game was very formative experience for me a teenage gamer – it’s always been one of my favourites; but I did come with some trepidation; Nostalgia is a hell of a drug. \n\nOverall, it’s still holds up well. The performance is solid, no crashes and only a few bugs. \n\nIt’s a narrative shooter akin to Half Life 2, rather than an immersive sim; and I was surprised how well the combat aged – it has a tactile crunchy kick we’d later see in Titanfall and the new Wolfenstein games.  There might be too much, but that’s down to pacing rather than design. Its art design makes up for some dated texture work.\n\nThe plot is frankly fantastic and thematically complete in ways most games aren’t – Its emotional and visual storytelling is superb, the voice acting across the board is great (Courtnee Draper should’ve done more V.O work) and the game presents a richly nuanced correlation between abuse and American nationalism that has aged quite well. Hell, given the last 6 years, its almost prophetic at points. And that ending is fantastic; a tear-jerking conclusion that only got a few contenders. \n\nThough do not play the Burial at Sea DLC. It tries to add way too much to the point that it hurts the base endings impact. Many fans like myself refuse to see it as canon. \n\nGoing back to it; I can see imperfections more clearly now, but it’s still a great game and a good example of games as art. It is the rare type of game that has the energy and ambition of an Indie title while also having the AAA money to back it up; the type of game we rarely get.\n\n8/10\n\n","timestamp_created":1644490477,"timestamp_updated":1646212391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109914967","author":{"steamid":"76561199001758759","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1061,"last_played":1644488714},"language":"schinese","review":"经典+神作     谁会拒绝一个好看、会给你发钱、发子弹、发药水、敌人来了会自己躲、会帮你开锁、会提醒你有东西捡、探图跑得比你还快给你在前面带路的女儿呢","timestamp_created":1644489649,"timestamp_updated":1644489649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109911699","author":{"steamid":"76561198419277729","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1428,"last_played":1644484512},"language":"english","review":"After bioshock 1, play this.
