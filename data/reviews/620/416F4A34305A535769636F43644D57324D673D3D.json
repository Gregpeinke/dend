So here is my review for this game :\n\n1. FPS Game that doesn't have any blood in it (instead therer are blue and orange gel, oh of course water too)\n2. FPS Game that make the players have to think so much to just complete 1 LEVEL!\n3. FPS Game that has unlimited ammo! (Which everyone wanted to have in any FPS Game)\n4. FPS Game where you are the only human living in it.\n5. FPS Game that make a really great story and sometimes the story is depend on the player's choice\n6. FPS Game where you don't even know what time is it in there\n7. And lastly, FPS Game that have robots who can speak clearly and feel like human...\n\nSo, as I mentioned before, this game makes you think so damn much (maybe you will think harder than when you study), but as the result, you will become smarter and of course your IQ will be improved, but remember, after playing this game then you will be left behind because you are too focus on the game XD\n\n*PS : THIS GAME SHOULD BE RATE 100 out of 100!!!","timestamp_created":1417783322,"timestamp_updated":1417783322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13237460","author":{"steamid":"76561198093996611","num_games_owned":477,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1160,"last_played":1446689086},"language":"brazilian","review":"Ele buga seu cérebro e te transforma em um insano.
