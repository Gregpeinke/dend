Не интересно играть дальше. \n\nВ игре красивая музыка, стиль графики скрашивает ее недостатки но если в Fable 3 или же Dishonored это меня радовало, то тут же (может из-за того что в эту игру я играю позднее чем в две выше названные) тут это просто не вызывает ничего. Сюжет - слабый. Я хочу сказать, что если за 6 часов сюжет меня не зацепил, то не вижу смысла тратить больше времени на игру. Отличные игры, которые мне нравятся цепляют сразу, с первых минут и не отпускают до конца. Тут же вроде бы было все хорошо, на первых минутах но потом все резко уходит вниз. Хитрожопость разработчиков становится особенно ясна, когда начинают твориться фокусы в городе когда приходится зачищать одни и те же места из-за каких-то там разрывов, или когда мелкая Элизабет умудряется сбежать от главного героя - который пачками до этого выносил целые армии вооруженных до зубов врагов. Эти вот нестыковки критично повлияли на интерес игры. \n\nКороткие вставки роликов, в черно-белом стиле - радуют и вообще музыка, как и писалось очень хоршо вписывается в атмосферу, но это все. \n\nЧто касается вооружения то тут опять много чего не понравилось - всего два слота под оружие, при том что за все 6 часов мне вполне хватало и первого пистолета и первого автомата (конечно я их заменил но только чтобы хоть что-то было новенькое в игре) \n\nСолевая магия по графике и физике радует, но так как я не заметил, где писалось о том, что выпив одно я потеряю другое - то рано потерял магию ворон, а как вернуть так и не понял, пришлось пользоваться новыми штуками которые не так радовали, до появления шокера.\n\nСам мир - дешев. Объяснение дешевости мира как разорванные на облаках районы - не особо на меня повлияло, карты крохотны и если до лотереи хоть как-то можно было смотреть на обстановку, видеть, опять же, закрытые магазины, людей и представления, то после - стычки с врагами становятся все очевиднее и быстрее. Нет ощущения что мир живет.\n\nМожет для кого-то этот американский стим-панк на фоне духовного декаданса и радует, но мне он чужой. Все походит на сумасшедший дом, и полосатые флаги пестрящие там и сям - надоедают очень быстро. \n\nПопытка примазать сюда реально существовавшее агенство Пинкертона не соответствует тому характеру игры который вырисовывается, никакого детектива - просто шутер, с непонятными огрызками сюжета.\n\nВсе это за 6 часов. За эт овремя можно кино посмотреть и не одно, а Биошок Бесконечный - не смогли толком мне объяснить зачем мне спасать эту девочку, и почему я не связал ее и не увез сразу, а как-то неуверенно с ней мямлю, как ребенок. \n\nДругой аспект сюжета - меня всюду ждут, все обо мне знают - какого? WTF is going on?\n\nМожно списать все это на то что я не фанат шутеров. Но даже те же игры серии Серьезный Сэм - там шутер составляющая и то веселила больше чем тут, хотя и тут враги словно тупорылые монстры из \"Сэма\" несутся на встречу смерти. \n\nРад что купил эту игру на распродаже, а не платил за нее полную стоимость - но даже 150р она не стоит, без русской то озвучки.\n\nМожет кто-то скажет что 6 часов - мало, и сюжет раскрывается где-то через еще 15-20 часов игры, ну что сказать тут...Меня игра не убедила что мне стоит тратить на нее еще время.\n\nЗдоровенный отзыв написал ибо ожидал от игры большего, много больше чем получил.","timestamp_created":1395544557,"timestamp_updated":1395544975,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.431761056184768677","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9601944","author":{"steamid":"76561198076642923","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":177,"last_played":1488157851},"language":"english","review":"There are no titties to Fuck big enough describe the feeling of playing this game, I mean theres a chick, guns, enemies and even racists, why would you not like this.

However, I didn't feel that Columbia grabbed my attention as much as Rapture did. There was a lack of creepiness that the prior two games flaunted, and more difficult enemies were replaced with ever-constant waves of infantry, which felt almost over-done. The story was absolutely amazing, and the ending hits you like a punch to the face. Up to that point however, it all seemed a bit ambiguous, drawn out, and tedious.

Irrational Games has outdone themselves in their latest installment in their critically acclaimed FPS franchise. The first two entries in the series are not connected with Infinite, so you can hop right into Infinite with no prior BioShock experience. This review will have NO SPOILERS, so feel free to read all the way unil the end. From the opening seconds of the game, you will be immersed in an absolutely incredible atmosphere that is oozing with detail in every nook and cranny. The environments vary from crowded city plazas to abandoned museums, and from eerie manors to a comforting and cozy boardwalk. You will never feel as if you have been in the same area twice (unless forced to backtrack for mission purposes).  The gameplay is paced wonderfully, aside from a bit of tediousness in the middle of the game, which feels somewhat stretched. The gunplay is the usual fast-paced, adrenaline pumping combat that you have come to expect from a BioShock game. Whereas in the first two BioShocks you used gene-mutating substances called \"Plasmids\", they have now been replaced with \"Vigors\", and perform in the same way, and in addition, the player can set traps with these vigors by holding down the Fire Vigor button. The graphics in this game are absolutely jaw dropping. The lighting effects are top-notch, and there are some really awesome moments during combat where there are rounds whizzing past your face and can't help but admire the beauty of the battle. This game ran like a beauty on my rig. I maintained a steady framerate throughout the enitre campaign with only an occasional hiccup during some really intense firefights. The controls are easy to learn, and once you understand the basics of weapon-vigor combos, you will be shredding enemies with shotguns as they are being ripped apart by murderous crows that you have summoned from the palm of your hand. There is a variety of weapons at your disposal, and you can carry two at a time. Elizabeth, your AI companion throughout almost the entirety of the 12 hour campaign, is extremely capable of holding her own in firefights. She opens \"Tears\", windows to other dimensions from which she can pull objects into battle such as medical kits, ammo, turrets, cover, and more.The enemy AI is oblivious at times when they are idle, but once combat breaks out, they are smart, fast, and dangerous. Now, chances are that if you are playing a BioShock game, you will be expecting an incredible story-driven narrative. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. The story is executed incredibly well, and the writers for this game should be applauded for the work that they have put into this wonderful experience. The story keeps you guessing until the very end, and even after the credits roll, you will still be asking questions for many days after completion. You will be expecting a twist because it is a BioShock game, but believe me: you will not be ready. The voice acting is top-notch from both Troy Baker and Courtnee Draper, and without them, this game would definitely not be the mind-blowing experience that it was. Upon completion, the player will unlock a 1999 mode Difficulty, where they will be faced with much harder enemies, and this difficulty will force the player to think more tactically during enemy engagements. All in all, this game MUST be played by every FPS fan out there, regardless of whether or not you like BioShock.

Однозначно рекоммендую.","timestamp_created":1395524374,"timestamp_updated":1395524374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9599254","author":{"steamid":"76561198122942816","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":681,"last_played":1399522546},"language":"english","review":"this is one of the frist PC games i ever i played and i am surprised of the awsome graphics and the colors this game is a hybrid which means you can play on your keyboard or the remote....WARNING this game will sometimes get corrupt so just redownload it again \n","timestamp_created":1395524301,"timestamp_updated":1395524301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9599238","author":{"steamid":"76561198120749491","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":455,"last_played":1639009403},"language":"english","review":"Hands down best story mode I have ever played!
