Геймплей динамичный, как во многих знаменитых проектах. Атмосфера топовая: то ходишь изучаешь Колумбию снаружи и внутри, то попадаешь в пекло революции, то ещё что-то. Сюжет тоже топовый, особенно перемещение по реальностям и неожиданный финал что в infinite, что в эпизодах Burial at sea. Насчёт канона к Bioshock 1 и 2 - канон у неё есть. Весь канон заключается в событиях эпизодов Burial at seа. По хронологии Bioshock Infinite + Burial at sea идёт первым, потом идёт Bioshock 1, затем идёт Bioshock 2. Пройти данную часть стоит.

obsessively played this game as a teenager. Now, almost 9 years later, I decided to play it again on PC and it is STILL one of the most fun, unique, and beautiful games out there. I will admit, the story gets a bit confusing at times, but if you do follow along properly it is a good one that you WANT to know all the secrets and answers to. The combat is still incredibly fun, and actually one of the main reasons I wanted to replay this game (who doesn't love weapon animations and sound effects that feel SO satisfying?). Definitely one of the perks of the games combat is it's diversity; you have plenty of weapons and ability combinations to choose from, so it never starts feeling repetitive. Also, the graphics are stunning. They were impressive in 2013, and honestly are still just as impressive today. Even if you disagree with all my other points, if anything, you can't deny the atmosphere of the game is an excellent one. Definitely worth a play, especially if you can get it on sale.

Важно уточнить, игру проходите пж ток после того как прошли вообще все игры и не планируете играть во что-то ближайшие 2 месяца, ибо у этой игры отлично получается делать так чтобы у меня отпадало желание играть во что-то еще помимо Bioshock Infinite.\nЭто лучшая игра в которую я когда либо играл!","timestamp_created":1642813110,"timestamp_updated":1642813400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108497859","author":{"steamid":"76561199013177374","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1647826241},"language":"english","review":"it gud","timestamp_created":1642811220,"timestamp_updated":1642811220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108496638","author":{"steamid":"76561199224063477","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":466,"last_played":1652883536},"language":"brazilian","review":"muito bom","timestamp_created":1642809567,"timestamp_updated":1642809567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108495949","author":{"steamid":"76561198165762902","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":992,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":992,"last_played":1642602980},"language":"brazilian","review":";)","timestamp_created":1642808637,"timestamp_updated":1642808637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108494823","author":{"steamid":"76561199178731822","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":1579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":922,"last_played":1644833622},"language":"schinese","review":"我给你选的是夜莺，你相应的佩戴了一朵玫瑰\n玫瑰它葬在了无名之人旁\n最后我在经历洗礼\n无数个你拥簇在我的身旁\n恍惚的我\n又是在城市里上演了无数次\n跨维度旅行\n昏暗狭小的房间中\n一声“安娜”\n那是跨维度旅行的障碍","timestamp_created":1642807196,"timestamp_updated":1642807196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108494648","author":{"steamid":"76561198083721778","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":824,"last_played":1642806376},"language":"english","review":"This is a really nice game!\nHOWEVER, I soon realized that this did not have the same feeling the first two bioshock games.

It got a bit very complicated towards the end, which made me need to pause at times to figure out what was going on.\n\nI really enjoyed this game from start to finish.

It took a step in the right direction by changing up the location and coming up with a more original story that was crafted to be left up to interpretation. The setting of an overly patriotic version of America as a city in the sky named Columbia was a unique Bioshock take on steampunk, still remaining beautiful and graphically impressive and drew me in more so than Bioshock 2's weak premise. All of the science wizardry that you can expect from Bioshock is here with a new twist on it. The replacement plasmids are called Vicars and need salt to be used. You also have a selection of Civil War era type guns to use that are interesting, but feel more basic in comparison to the original game's weapons that had a visible change made to them with every upgrade you made. The story was captivating, dealing with time travel and parallel universes whilst having themes of racism and revolution. The characters in the game such as Comstock, The Lutece Twins, Elizabeth, and Booker are all memorable, living up to the standard of memorable characters set in Bioshock 1. The two-ish main features that I would say that they added in this game were Tears (as in tear paper not tears you cry) and the Skylines and sky-hook along with it. All of them provide a unique twist to the Bioshock formula and were fairly fleshed out. This game plays well, provides an entertaining story and engaging combat that all complement each other to make this a game that I would easily recommend albeit not as good as the original.","timestamp_created":1642806567,"timestamp_updated":1642806567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558641970157623291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108491432","author":{"steamid":"76561198157167725","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":677,"last_played":1642803091},"language":"spanish","review":"tremendo","timestamp_created":1642803103,"timestamp_updated":1642803103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108490130","author":{"steamid":"76561198414175334","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":613,"last_played":1642845497},"language":"turkish","review":"10 saat sürdü ve 2 günde bitirdim.\nArtılar+\nHikaye\nMekanik ve büyü\nMüzik\nGrafik\nAkıcılık\nVuruş hissi\n\nEksiler-\nBoss sayısı az\n","timestamp_created":1642801597,"timestamp_updated":1642801597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108489828","author":{"steamid":"76561198261795962","num_games_owned":565,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":68,"last_played":1643570900},"language":"schinese","review":" 天空之城太美了","timestamp_created":1642801244,"timestamp_updated":1642801244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108488625","author":{"steamid":"76561198116227512","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1062,"last_played":1647792952},"language":"polish","review":"gdzie kolumbia ?","timestamp_created":1642799929,"timestamp_updated":1642799929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108486737","author":{"steamid":"76561199084273420","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":101,"last_played":1645528541},"language":"russian","review":"Никогда не встречал такого полезного напарника, как Элизабет","timestamp_created":1642797903,"timestamp_updated":1642797903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108486158","author":{"steamid":"76561198069011324","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":733,"last_played":1642901715},"language":"russian","review":"Крутая игра с крутым сюжетом","timestamp_created":1642797302,"timestamp_updated":1642797302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108486116","author":{"steamid":"76561198281741336","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2337,"last_played":1642797115},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Слёт парика","timestamp_created":1642797270,"timestamp_updated":1642797270,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"108485725","author":{"steamid":"76561198255769223","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1136,"last_played":1642865904},"language":"russian","review":"Биошок инфинит плохая игра, но больше бы делали таких плохих игр. Я играл в неё в 2013 и что тогда, что сейчас я крайне доволен. \nПочему плохая игра, ну банально в игре нет тактики, незачем использовать плазмиды/энергетики, незачем качаться, по сути игру можно пройти тупо стреляя из одного ствола, а Элизабет будет по кд кидавать вам боеприпасы, соли и хп.\nЭто факт, прошёл всю игру со снайперкой, патроны на которую падают редко, но при этом опустащая боезапас, девчуля всё вам восполняет. На всех скриншотах после 4 часа хожу тупо с ней. \nКак по мне биошок инфинит это тот самый AAA артхаус, знаете типо как Death stranding, такие яркие, ни на что не похожие проекты с невероятным каким-то отношением не столько к геймплею, сколько к миру и истории.\nДаже сейчас эта игра выглядит невероятно.

Например: как люди помнят свою смерть из другой реальности? Ведь если задуматься кол-во альтернативных вселенных бесконечное множество и в бесконечном множестве вселенных будут умирать все. Значит все во вселенной должны чувствовать диссонанс и пускать кровь носиком, ибо тут ты жив, а в других бесконечных множествах реальностей, тебя например могла сбить машина.)\nОтноситься к этой игре нужно не как к шутану, я воспринимаю её как атмосферную бродилку, в таком случае она утянет вас с головой.
