You can read it [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198122235473/recommended/] right here [/url]. But to be honest, Portal, while still great, kind of pales in comparison to Portal 2. Two words: Holy crap. This game is amazing. I already have over 60 hours into it, and probably will end up putting in more. A much bigger game deserves a bigger review, so skip to the end for a TL;DR.\n\n[b] The Single Player [/b]\n\nThe single-player is much longer than the original Portal. It has tons of puzzles (over 100, if I remember correctly) and there is a great storyline if you follow it. You have to pay attention to some hidden stuff to get the full story, and I also recommend reading the free e-comic. The puzzles can definitely be challenging at times. Also, the campaign can be re-played plenty of times, if you so desire. There are Steam Achievements which may require a replay of some levels. Voice actors like Stephen Merchant and J.K. Simmons really help set the stage.\n\nNew mechanics really keep you coming back for more. As you play, there are new items and ideas to freshen up gameplay, so the levels aren't horribly repetitive. Plus, if you decide you're done with the Valve-created levels, you can download some new ones from the store page, as well as some other user-created levels (which I'll get to later.) An example of a mod for new levels would be Portal Stories: Mel, which is free to anyone who owns Portal 2.\n\nBut unlike Portal, this game doesn't stop there.\n\n[b] The Multiplayer [/b]\n\nWhether you have a friend with a copy of the game or you hop on with a random stranger, the multiplayer is very fun. There are different sets of levels to unlock as you progress through all-new puzzles with a buddy. New takes on the puzzles mean you can't work alone. I recommend getting a headset and talking through the in-game chat. If you can't do that, there is a text chat as well.\n\nPlenty of new puzzles challenge you yet again here. It takes some getting used to, as all the other puzzles you're used to playing let you fly solo. But it's great to scream at your friend as you challenge yourself with these new puzzles. GLaDOS is still in these levels too, so there's more dark humor to be had. But Portal 2 STILL doesn't stop there.\n\n[b] The Level Creator [/b]\n\nThat's right, there's a level creator/editor. While not all in-game mechanics can be found her, most of them can be, and it's a blast to come up with levels yourself. The editor takes some getting used to, but once you've figured it out it's just a matter of making and testing, making and testing, making and testing... (It's not called a testing facility for nothing, right?)\n\nPlus, you can publish your levels through Steam Workshop. You're not limited to just single-player levels, either. You can make levels for two people to test their noggins with. And if you're making your own levels, why not check out other people's puzzles, too? You can play them by downloading them through the Steam Workshop. Some levels are even in a series, where you may even get some kind of story out of it.\n\n[b] Other Details [/b]\n\nGraphics: They're decent enough. Definitely improved from the original, though. No need to install any graphical mods, unless you really want a different look.\nAchievements: There is over 50, but some require some replaying, as I mentioned earlier. If you really try, you can definitely snag yourself all of them. (I haven't.)\nController support: The store page says there is full controller support. I know it works with a 360 controller, and I would assume a Steam Controller works too, seeing as Valve made this game.\nCommunity support: Lots. Plenty of external mods, plus tons of the aforementioned levels made with the level creator.\nPrice: $20. Literally one of the best games I have ever played and it is $20!? If you don't have either game, grab the bundle, as it is 5 bucks cheaper.\n\n[b] TL;DR [/b] This game is amazing. I definitely recommend playing the first one, but this is better in almost every way. If you like puzzles, expect to be coming back a lot. I can't recommend this highly enough. At $20 (or $25 for both games) this is a steal.\n\nI hope this review was helpful to you in making your decision about whether or not to get this game. If it was, please upvote.

Используя портал-ган, игрок «выстреливает» по двум пригодным для создания портала поверхностям, создавая квантовую аномалию, позволяющую ему мгновенно перемещаться между двумя точками пространства или, если быть точным, связывать эти две точки пространства. Сама игра, как и серия подарила огромное число креатива на тему порталов. Ну а теперь поподробнее рассмотрим данную игру.\n[h1] Геймплей [/h1]\nНачать я решил именно с него, т.к он является главной составляющей всей серии. Что тут сказать, если судить объективно, вторая часть скорее всего объёмная модификация и игровой процесс меняет мало. Из нововведений гели — жидкости, меняющие поведение поверхностей, на которые они нанесены. Стоит отметить, что в игру добавили кооп-режим на двух человек, играть с другом интереснее и забавнее, чем одному. Про головоломки, они не очень сложные [spoiler]из известных мне трудных головоломок вспоминается только Q.U.B.E[/spoiler], но интересны и креативны в решении, в коопе мы с другом получили незабываемые впечатления. Игра не выглядит как технодемка [spoiler] коей являлась первая часть[/spoiler] и играется бодро. Пройти одиночную и кооп компании вместе можно за 12 часов, что является золотой серединой в данном случае, ибо играть больше было бы скучно, а меньше, ощущалась бы не полноценность. Вообще геймплей не сильно изменился после первой части, но остался таким же бодрым, в игру интересно играть.\n[h1] Сюжет [/h1]\nТут всё не так просто. Теперь нам дают узнать всю информацию о лабораториях нашей любимой кампании. Так же в сюжет входят драма, предательства, месть. Но главный козырь Portal - GLaDOS. Она является олицитворением всего, что происходит в игре. И не стоит забывать о её садистских и тролльных наклонностях. Ну если в целом, ГЛэДОС няшка[spoiler] хоть и робот-садист-тролль [/spoiler], и точно останется в наших сердцах надолго. Меня очень радует, что в игре по сути таковой, всего три главных персонажа: Уитли, ГЛэДОС и Челл[spoiler] которая у нас стеняша, либо молчалива после всего пиздеца с ней произошедшего [/spoiler]. И самое главное они все гармонируют и прекрасно вписываются, мне лично трудно представить 3 персонажей вокруг которых крутится такой сюжет. Стоит отметить озвучку - она хороша. ГЛэДОС и Уитли озвучены в нашем дубляже прекрасно [spoiler] что доказывает есть у нас хорошие дубляжисты, актёры и т.д., просто надо развивать данную специализацию у нас.[/spoiler]. Сюжет коопа прост, как пробка, преодолевание камер, но он так таковой не особо там нужен. Ибо не ради него я с другом играл в него. В итоге, хочется сказать, что сюжет в данной игре одновременно прост и хорош[spoiler] большего и не надо[/spoiler]. И концовка мне очень сильно понравилась.\n[h1] Графика [/h1]\nЕсли сравнивать с такими играми того времени, как Ведьмак 2, третья Батла и Crysis 2, то Portal 2 им проигрывает, но здесь прекрасно видно, что по сравнению с первой частью проделана хорошая работа в этом плане, ну и если быть честным у Вольве графонистыми были только игры серии Half-Life. Физика у объектов есть, разрушаемость объектов, хоть и заскриптованная, есть, так что графон здесь хоть и слаб, но не ужасен, да и в целом не замечается его слабость, ибо вам будет интересны более интересные вещи, чем рассматривание текстурок.\n[h1]Итог[/h1]\nВозможно я буду субъективен, но данная серия для меня играет более знаковое значение, чем серия Half-life. Думаю я показал в данном обзоре всю свою любовь и симпатию к данной серии[spoiler] возможно это и не так [/spoiler]. У игры есть мелкие косяки, но геймплей, сюжет и моя огромная симпатия к данной серии не дают мне повода к их перечислению. Игра оставила огромные и приятные впечатления. Думаю она справедливо занимает место в списке моих любимых игр. Моя оценка данной игре - 9/10. Строго рекомендую к покупке.\n[h1]P.S.[/h1]\nВсегда рад аргументированной критике и показу моих недостатков.
