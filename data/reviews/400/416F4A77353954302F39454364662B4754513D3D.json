This s not the typical puzzle game. There is just something about using portals to tele[port and make robots shoot themselvws that is not only fun but ultimately satisfying. If you have a fe extra bucks and want to buy a game that is not only different but FUN with a good yet short story, this is it. The challenges will sometmes require you to put down the game and come back later. I beat the main story in six hours but it felt a lot longer because I had to play iin 3 two hour sessions. I was a little disappoined that the game didn't go on longer, but then  I remembeed I had bouht Portal 2 as well! I suggest playing this game before the sequel despite the fact that more people are familiar with the 2nd installnent, this one is actually imho more story driven. It is a very linear franchise, a lot like Half-Life actually, but it is  not a failure in that regard. It totally works in this game and to be honest if you don't play the game over again and try to make new decisions when solving puzzles then you are playing it wrong! Yes, i said the game is linear, it is not a wander lust game BUT there are multiple ways to get passed each level and I give many kudos to the devs for that. Actually, Portal 2 was the first ValvE title I had ever played, on xbox 360 when it first came out. It was the game that introduced me to Pc gaming, ValvE and of course, STEAM. I haven't gone back since and with this last winter sale I decided to return the favor to steam by purchasing all of the classic ValvE titles. Honestly, any ValvE game is a winner, This is a company that makes fun, unique, classic challenging yet simple games. IMHO Dota2 is the weakest game on their roster and I still don't totally hate it. There is no reason Portal should not be in your library, most ValvE games run on ANY PC. The only real problem I did have with this game was the mouse sens settings. For some reason the mouse sensitivity and the mouse acceleration were reversed, but when I figured out what was going on I was able to fix it. Even though the first installment of Portal is very short it has bonus maps, community maps and decent replay value as far as story mode goes.
