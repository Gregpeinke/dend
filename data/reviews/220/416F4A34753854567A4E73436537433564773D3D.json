This game, along with it's predecessor Half-Life 1 are both regarded as one, if not the best PC games by various critics and gamers alike. It follows the story of Gordon Freeman, a former Black Mesa theoretical physicist.\n\n\n[h1] REVIEW [/h1]\n\nI bought this game with small expectation since it's a pretty old game, BUT, it managed to surpass those insultng expectation that i had before. Frankly honest, i have played more than a dozen other FPS games, yet none actually feels as complete as this game. It manages to gave the satisfaction of killing enemies i HATED like non others. It manages to got me agitated In the mere sight of a freaking headcrab! There are smart puzzles where you have to think about to get through, while being shooted at by dozens of enemies. I still remember that goosebump when i first got to [spoiler] Ravenholm [/spoiler] , a huge contrast of atmosphere compared to the areas before, or when i had an army of [spoiler] Antlion helping me invade Nova Prospekt [/spoiler] , after savagely trying to rip me into pieces just minutes ago, and also the last part with the new infused [spoiler] gravity gun mk.2 just tearing apart those combines! [/spoiler] AND DOG! THE MOST BADASS CHARACTER IN ANY FPS GAME! Shooting and killing enemies actually felt FANTASTIC. Oh, and those amazing physic aspect of the game! Other fps game, like Call of Duty or Battlefield (single player), pales in comparison. Yes i honestly got frustated many times (not even once in any other fps games, even on veteran) until i had to look up to some guides, but yeah it adds to the satisfaction every single time. OF COURSE it has some flaws in it. No game is perfect. I still can't comprehend WHY is there stupid [spoiler] driving [/spoiler] part in this game, it is very unnecessary and a bit dull. Apart from the [spoiler] Antlion [/spoiler] , the other companions are stupid and useless to say the least. That's all the flaws that i can think of.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\n-Physic based puzzle.\n-The atmosphere of the game is flawless (except for the [spoiler] driving [/spoiler] part)\n-Astoundingly FUN.\n-Good story.\n-Great pacing (once again, except for the (you know what) part.\n-DOG.\n-GRAVITY GUN.\n-Amazing level design (ONCE AGAIN, except for the (bzz) part.\n-Enemy design\n-Last but not least, old but gold. And silver. And diamond. And topaz. And.....\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\n-DR1V1N6 PART.\n-Every companions except Antlions.\n\n[h1] Worth it? [/h1]\n\nAbsolutely yes. You'll never see fps game the same way again. Old but gold.\n\n[h1] Score [/h1]\n\n9,5/10\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1493120787,"timestamp_updated":1493120787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31354536","author":{"steamid":"76561198095190363","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":3530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3264,"last_played":1657217346},"language":"turkish","review":"Söylenecek bir söz yok, her şey ortada..\n\n- Best HL Fan HerrWolf","timestamp_created":1493115727,"timestamp_updated":1549750932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31354248","author":{"steamid":"76561198182800689","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":2254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":1417,"last_played":1660159652},"language":"english","review":"This is the best game ever.\nIf you don't believe in the legends, play this game.","timestamp_created":1493114502,"timestamp_updated":1493114502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529684841632843018","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31353727","author":{"steamid":"76561198011187719","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":958,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":958,"last_played":1550880092},"language":"german","review":"GUT","timestamp_created":1493111889,"timestamp_updated":1493111889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31352409","author":{"steamid":"76561197989504597","num_games_owned":269,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":3402,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2836,"last_played":1617244327},"language":"english","review":"Half Life, the Firefly of video games. \n\nHow does the story end?
