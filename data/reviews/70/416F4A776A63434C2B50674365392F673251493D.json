Varying difficulty settings, a training room, Deathmatch, Fun to fight AI that'll make you really think. It's nowhere near half life 2's balance but its fun to learn, it's very much enjoyable, Then theres Xen. Xen is like you got a fancy new suit, and spaghetti sauce just fell on it. Xen is okay, it's not as good as the rest. But it ruins the pacing. Highly recommend this game. After you play the full series, you'll understand why we so desperately want a finale. The finale leaves you thirsting for more gun play, especially with your newest toy you got (The Gluon gun) So you can head out for deathmatch where all your shooting skills get put to the test against other players in servers with varying player counts. I wish good will to those who helped make this game. In conclusion, Half life is a really good experience, Half life 2 is on a whole nother level. The fast paced marine AI, THE SETPIECES, THE PERFECTLY TIMED MUSIC,GORDON FREEMAN, THE HEADCRABS, THE INTRIGUING PREMISE, THE G-MAN, THE CROWBAR.
