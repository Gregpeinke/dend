Third is the weapon roster which 99% are useless once you have the magnum (damage) and MP5/M4 (workhorse) other than those the weapons get out classed by these 2 or are just gimmick weapons that will only get you killed. Lastly the game has really nice set pieces but that's really all it has Half-Life now today has no substance the enemies are sponges the game has terrible pacing and the roster of enemies is VERY small, Once you hit Surface Tension you've pretty much seen all the game has to offer, because after that is the sections leading up to what EVERY half-life fan says is the worst part of the game \"ZEN\".

wasn't born when Half-Life came out. I didn't experience the hype surrounding this game or how it changed the industry but two weeks ago I decided that it was time for me to play this legendary masterpiece.\nAnd... yes I can DEFINITELY see why this was such a big deal. And for the first five hours of my playthrough I really had a lot of fun. So yeah, I think that this game deserves the hype and yes it is one of the most important game ever made. It's weird because I love this game. I love what this game has done to the gaming industry. But at the same time I think that the mechanics have aged very well. The story is still really good(I googled it:)) but the mechanics aren't. I was expecting that. I mean if the mechanics of an over 20 year old game would still hold up today there would be something seriously wrong with the modern standards for games. Because of this I don't blame this game for not holding up. In a lot of ways it's still great. The weapon and enemy variety is still great but the gunplay and the movement, oh god the movement, have aged very poorly. It's sad because these two are the things the ruin the whole experience. Everything else is still fine. Even the graphics are not too bad.\nSo in conclusion: I don't think that you should buy Half-Life in 2021. I've heard that the remake Black Mesa ist very good, so go play that game while still appreciating what this game has done for games.","timestamp_created":1636764329,"timestamp_updated":1636764329,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102675032","author":{"steamid":"76561198071805568","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":16,"playtime_at_review":1753,"last_played":1660378875},"language":"english","review":"a true gem , recommended <3","timestamp_created":1636757203,"timestamp_updated":1636757203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102673792","author":{"steamid":"76561198058588713","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":11,"playtime_at_review":409,"last_played":1660499972},"language":"english","review":"NO!

There’s no eye candy in Half-Life, but it has something most modern titles lack. Valve’s original hit has passion and original intent.\nHalf-Life is a first-person shooter that thinks outside the box. It mixes science fiction components with spine chiller and endurance awfulness for an entrancing tale about a puppet believing in his own freedom. \n\nYou play as an experimental scientist, Gordon Freeman. The situation is the puzzling, underground Black Mesa research center. Furthermore, the story is about you, getting away from the office, when crap hits the fan. \nUnder New Mexico's desert, Black Mesa is overseeing research with problematic morals. You're not a huge piece of it, however; you're simply a traveler. \nThe game begins with Gordon Freeman awakening on a train cart. The truck traversed the lab while foreboding music swirls all around. Voices from the speakers invite you to the exploration offices, which you get to see for around five minutes. \nThis fantastic arrangement then, at that point, inclines when Gordon Freeman takes part in a risky trial. An \"mishap\" opens up an entry to a different universe, permitting outsiders to slither into Black Mesa. \nYou, as Gordon Freeman, must escape to the surface.\nThe brilliance of Half-Life is its ongoing interaction, and I can't discuss the interactivity without further growing the story. Both go in hand with each other. \nThe game occurs during 18 episode, each bringing new interactivity mechanics, riddles, weapons, and difficulties. \nThere will never be a dull for a second or a monotonous fragment. The interactivity continues developing and hopping between elements of horror, science fiction, and all out action. \nThe game's visuals, albeit obsolete, were progressive when. It runs on the GoldSRC engine. Two or three years after its introduction, it developed into Source, which runs every one of Valve's games until 2013's DOTA. That incorporates several Counter Strikes games, the Left 4 Dead establishment, Portal 2, Team Fortress, Team Fortress 2, and so forth\n\nThere is no need for reviews for this game, you will always find someone talking about half life. Moreover counter strike games are just developed mods for this game, such is its greatness.","timestamp_created":1636562993,"timestamp_updated":1636562993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102541713","author":{"steamid":"76561198271395575","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":379,"last_played":1626716014},"language":"english","review":"meh its ok\n","timestamp_created":1636556410,"timestamp_updated":1636556410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483870983123779297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102541098","author":{"steamid":"76561199060756072","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1352,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1352,"last_played":1636489256},"language":"turkish","review":"Arkadaşlar oyun güzel fakat son boss çok zor trambolinler zıplatmıyor bug oluyor falan filan ben çok kızdım bu duruma ve kalan yerleri youtube'tan izleyerek bitirdim.
