Unfortunately, I have to say that I was largely disappointed. The graphics (and the design in general) are beautiful, but the environment and characters are horrendously stiff, and totally unbelievable (what's with everyone leaving around audiologs and ammo? And why no-one bothers while you run around, gun in your hand and possibly covered in blood?). Gameplay-wise, gIven the open-air nature of much of the levels, BSI it plays like  Doom on steroids - which in itself was a plus-one-dimension Space Invaders (enemies come at you in waves, you repel them, move forward). I did maybe 75% of the game without using plasmids once (so much that the game kept telling me to \"remember to use\" them). Apart from the final battle, the game is really not much of a challenge (haven't bothered with the 1999 mode since I beat it). The story is interesting, Booker DeWitt is an interesting character (never really dug Elizabeth though) and there are enough twists  to keep you interested throughout all the bo-ring pew pew pew gameplay. In sum: looks wonderful; feels stiff; spins a good yarn; boring and mindless to play.","timestamp_created":1387536205,"timestamp_updated":1387536205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8137455","author":{"steamid":"76561198085753629","num_games_owned":638,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":4542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":580,"last_played":1467063954},"language":"spanish","review":"buenos gráficos, increíble banda sonora, una aventura completamente innovada","timestamp_created":1387536075,"timestamp_updated":1387536075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8137204","author":{"steamid":"76561198013318485","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1232,"last_played":1386483690},"language":"english","review":"Great game, highly recomend.

A beautifully realised setting that satirises American exceptionalism with a far more subtle touch than the first game's criticism of Rand, Bioshock Infinite lures you in to Columbia subtly - before tackling racism, religion and historical whitewashing with an unashamed daring that all other games lack.  And then it goes further.\n\nAs a game, it doesn't _quite_ have anything to match Bioshock's first terrifying fight against a Big Daddy.

I was simply blown away by its beauty. \n\nOverall, this game was very enjoyable as an experience.

Bioshock infinite isn't perfect, in some instances the battles can drag on a bit and there was a section near the end that heavily annoyed me. But these flaws can be overlooked because of the incredible story. The plasmids system from the original Bioshock is replaced with vigors witch act in a simular way, they give power ups that do various other things in the game, these help break up the shooting sections a bit and also bring some new ways to do battle. The blade on the arm is very useful as it allows you to go on skylines which in turn help you get around more easily. Bioshock infinite is one of the best looking games I have ever seen, the environments are bright and colorful and the characters look great as well. The story is the best part of the game, this may be one of the best and most fascinating stories ever told in a video game. I was engaged the entire time I was playing and I won't spoil it, but yeah, I didn't see that coming. The story touches on themes such as racism and religion the characters are great, the protagonist is voiced this time, he is a guy names Booker DeWitt, and he has one mission, to get Elizabeth, Booker and Elizabeth both end up being great in the end and I won't spoil it, but yeah, Overall, Bioshock ininite is a great game and one that changed the way I look at things, and I will definitely play it again to see anything I might have missed. \n\n\nI give it a 9.8/10\n","timestamp_created":1387519994,"timestamp_updated":1387519994,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8133436","author":{"steamid":"76561198075474954","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1392,"last_played":1396088544},"language":"russian","review":"Шикарная игра с интересным сюжетом.

The game, however, sucks.\n\nLemmie explain. \nIn the original Bioshock, you had 7 weapons (8 if you include the Camera) that you can carry on you at any given time. This, coupled with the 3 types of ammo for nearly every weapon, allowed you to approach situations and adjust to them as they came. In addition to the interesting weapons, their upgrades were even more fascinating. The ability to freeze somebody by smacking them over the head, then shoot them with fire bullets? Why not?! The possibilites for an interesting combat experience were endless.\n\nBosses in the original also had depth, and were interesting characters. You knew them, you saw what they'd done, you'd heard their words, and agreed with why they must die for you to continue onwards. They also had a habbit for knowing when it was high time to fall over, meaning, after their primary mechanic was exploited, their minutes quickly became numbered, creating a fast paced, difficult, non mundane boss fighting experience. It wasn't just the bosses that died without a ridiculous amount of bullets being pumped into their face, regular enemies didn't take half a nuclear arsenal to bring down, and with good reason; they were just drug heads in t-shirts with the occasional power. Nothing more.\n\nMy apologies for ranting, but there's a point to this. The reason I mentioned the previous two things in those long drawn out excuses for paragraphs it to show what Infinite is lacking. You can hold a maximum of two weapons (the melee weapon now passively always being attached) and thus decreasing the possible methods of dealing with an issue by an exponentional amount. The upgrades for weapons in Infinite are also a joke, being the standard \"Reduced Recoil, Increase Damage, Increase Ammo Capacity\". That is boring. This is why I mark off the weapon system as terrible.\n\nThe second thing to complain about in this game is the combat sections (if they can even be called that). Interesting locations and cool locales taken thrown headfirst into a game of \"Who can be the biggest bullet sponge.\" The enemies act with a reckless disregard for their own safety and recieve no penalty for it because they can take more hits than an IS-2 tank. It's not interesting fighting enemies who can run up to you and tank all the damage and just punch you in the face. The mess of a combat system quickly becomes a chore when you realize who Ken Levine called in when the bosses all called in sick: Handymen, a dude on fire, and a Spooky Scary Ghost. The Handymen might quite possibly be the worst enemy I have ever faced in a game (besides of course the Lopers from Return to Castle Wolfenstein). They're not enemies so much as they're trucks that can fly. They take a ridiculous amount of punishment and just don't die after being hit in the \"Weak Spot\" at least 20 times by 12 guage slugs. You also need to fight them every 10 or so minutes, so you spend 1/3 of the game playing and about 2/3s fighting these fun champs, who quickly lose appeal after the first encounter. \n\nNow onto the good part: The story. Horrible combat aside, Bioshock Infinite is a must buy. The enviroments are diverse and feel real and full of life (until you start shooting but hey then it's full of Up-Till-Recently life), the big enemies/friends you encounter all feel like part of something much bigger than yourself, and the story itself and watching Columbia fall apart is absolutely golden and shouldn't be missed.\n\nAn 9/10 story coupled with 3/10 gameplay could easily total to a solid 7.5 game. Highly recommend.\n\n","timestamp_created":1387514891,"timestamp_updated":1387514891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577325761318206787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8132610","author":{"steamid":"76561198019907108","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1933,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1640470363},"language":"english","review":"Shite.

The feeling of living in a U.S. national socialist world is oppressive and in some ways makes you squirm at how plausible the politics seem. The game also makes you think about some theological questions such as the purpose of baptism and how it could be perverted.
