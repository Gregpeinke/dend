Nich viel aber trotzdem etwas. Ich weiß nicht wie die grafischen Verhältnisse bei Videospielen damals waren weil ich gerade mal 1 jahr alt war. Es steht aber fest, dass Half-Life einen großen Sprung gemacht hatte.\nSTORY:\nDie Story wird weniger erzählt als in Half-Life 2. Man spielt einfach und lässt die Sachen auf sich zukommen. Was aber nicht negativ ist, da man auch alleine interessante Dinge entdeckt und sich zu helfen weiß.\nSPIELZEIT:\nDie Spelzeit beträgt wie in Half-Life 2 etwa 12-15 Stunden. Sie wird durch das Nachdenken beim ersten Spielen beeinflusst. Außerdem ist ein Faktor ob man jede einzelne Kiste nach Nachschub durchsucht oder einfach weitergeht.\nCHARAKTERE:\nWie schon gesagt wird in Half-Life nicht ganz so viel geredet, was damals auch noch nicht so üblich war. Die hilflosen Wissenschaftler oder Sicherheitskräfte denen man unterwegs immer wieder begegnet sind enfach nur von der Situation überrascht und wissen selber nicht was sie tun. Manche schließen sich deshalb wohl freiwillig Gordon an. Dennoch kommt die meist hysterisch Sprechweise gut rüber und man kann diese nachvollziehen. Gordon selbst sagt übrigens kein einziges Wort.\nFAZIT:\nHalf-Life hat die Welt der Spiele damals sehr beeinflusst. Denn so ein Spielgeschehen gab es damsls noch nicht. Der Preis von 9,99€ ist völlig in Ordnung, auch dann noch wenn man bedenkt, dass das Spiel schon über 15 Jahre alt ist.

Při jednom z testů se bohužel otevře mezidimensionálí portál a z planety Xen na zem začne proudit příval podivných monster, která se ukáží velmi nebezpečná. Do toho všeho se tajnou vědeckou zkladnu Black Messa pokusí armáda obsadit a zavřít. A zavřít neznamená ve vojenském žargonu jen zavřít a zamknout. Znamená to rovněž zlikvidovat všechny svědky. A Gordon Freeman je svědek číslo jedna. A tak se během chvíle z průměrného vědce stane prvotřídní zabiják, který si potřebuje prorazit cestu přívaloem nepřátel z cizí i vlastní planety, aby jen napravil svojí chybu.[/i]\n\nNaprosto strhující příběh, který ve své době posunul chápání videoher jako nového žánru interaktivní a zároveň inteligentní zábavy. Tehdy ještě pod vydavatelstvím Sierra Studios prorazila na trh malá a začínající společnost Valve. Sierra Studios dnes již nefunguje, ale ze společnosti Valve se stal herní gigant stojící za projekty Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead a například herní portál Steam.\nHra ve své době prorazila [b]strhující 3D grafikou[/b], skvěle postaveným enginem (HalfLife) s úžasnou fyzikou a stejný úspěch se jí podařilo zopakovat is enginem nástupce hry, Half-Life 2, jehož engine ještě dnes fuguje v mnoha hrách jiných výrobců.\nNaprosto úžasné bylo i [b]audio zpracování[/b]. Hra měla naprosto úžasnou zvukovou stopu, jejíž OST se dokonce prodával na samostatných nosičích. Nehledě na možnost při hraní hry vložit do mechaniky vlastní hudební CD. Osvěžující byly i inteligentní dialogy, kterými tehdejší hry zrovna moc neoplývaly.\nNejtěžším kalibrem ale byl [b]skvěle sepsaný příběh[/b]. Hlavním hrdinou se nestal žádný bouchač, jako tomu bylo doposud. Nebyl to žádný voják, který byl na zabíjení vycvičený, ale obyčejný brýlatý a vzdělaný mladík. A paradoxní je, že aniž by ve hře pronesl jediné slovo, stal se ikonickou postavou.

This is the game that changed my life and helped develop my then changing tastes in gaming when I was 12 Years Old. Half-Life is still magnificent despite it's flaws. And there are plenty of flaws here from it's unreliable friendly AI that doesn't seem to work at all (Seems to be a common theme for Valve Games), keyboard drifting issues exclusive to these Gold Source Games, enemies that sometimes stand still and take all the gunfire for no reason, tedious moments like trying to throw grenades into sniper nests and having to waste 50 of them because they won't die and Xen of course is the weakest chunk of the game and the lack of ammo you get doesn't help at all.\n\nHOWEVER, underneath all the flaws is still one of the best games ever made. The graphics are extremely charming to this day but for newcomers PLEASE play with the HD Model Pack off as it ruins the aesthetics and sounds of the game and dates it even more horribly. The game is one of the most immersive ever made and you keep wanting to explore Black Mesa throughout the course of the game. It also has huge heaps of atmosphere that strengthen the immersion throughout. The gameplay is of course excellent thanks to it's seamless storytelling with everything happening in engine without FMV Cutscenes from the time. There are plenty of guns to try out and they all sound meaty and are fun to use to this day. The game also has some incredibly intelligent AI and because of this the game has pretty much a perfect difficulty curve if you play on Medium like I did for my replay. \n\nNot to mention the music is awesome. I love the game's soundtrack to this day and has plenty of great moments like when you first put on the Hazard Suit and when the end credits roll as this slappin techno dance tune plays you out. There are so many great moments in Half-Life that it's hard not to love it even with it's dated aspects and flaws.
