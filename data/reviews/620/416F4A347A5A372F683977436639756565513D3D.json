In this game difficulty is thinking strategically, several steps ahead and planning out exactly what to do, thinking outside the box, playing out all posibilities in your head.

It saddens me to see Valve step away from game development and move towards the development of their distribution system, Steam.\n\nMy guess is this. I don't think they meant for the Perpetual Testing Initiative to be anything that substantial; just an add-on meant to make community maps more accessible and to prolong the life of the game. Instead, without any sign of a new game coming, it seems the system will live up to its name; with any new Portal content bound to only ever come through the initiative. \n\nLet's pray we see Portal 3 sometime in the future.
