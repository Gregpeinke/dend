This is by far, the best single player campaign that I have played, both in terms of storyline and action. I am a FPS gamer through and through, and I have played from start to finish, several hundred over the years. Thought I am a super fan of the multiplayer games, I always love to take a break from the online mayhem just long enough to play what I hope to be a good single player campaign, and this game took the cake.\n\nTo be clear, I have owned all of the BioShocks (minus Infinite) in Steam for s number of years, but I never played them. I decided to give the first BioShock and try and played through the campaign on the hardest setting...I was hooked. After finishing that, I played though BioShock 2 on the same setting...AMAZING storyline. I purchased Infinite and started playing what is probably the best campaign that a game can offer. \n\nThe action is crazy (you have to wait fora it a bit from the start) and graphics are really good, considering when the game came out, and the story keeps you enthralled to the very end. JUST when you think you have the game figured out, guess again. I won't spoil the ending for you, but it's a complete and utter mixture of emotions to the point where I feel I need to go in the other room, sit down and just contemplate what the heck I just went through. Wow. just...wow.\n\nLooking for a great single player campaign and thinking about BioShock Infinite? Play it through in medium or hard and get ready for the experience of a lifetime. My favorite single player campaign has always been the very first Half Life. Sure, there are a thousand games out now with everything better than HL, but that was the first campaign where the enemy seemed semi smart! While HL will always hold a place in my heart, this game has blown my mind.\n\nSimply amazing.\n\n-W/B\n","timestamp_created":1500001486,"timestamp_updated":1500001486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33526992","author":{"steamid":"76561198392979453","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1596423053},"language":"tchinese","review":"游戏拥有深度的剧情，配乐也很棒。","timestamp_created":1500001316,"timestamp_updated":1500001316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33526215","author":{"steamid":"76561198210071884","num_games_owned":877,"num_reviews":121,"playtime_forever":1311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":448,"last_played":1561281782},"language":"schinese","review":"无限简直就是FPS界的神作！傻白简直是太萌了！虽然结局有点悲伤，但是，你们要以这只是演员演出来的心态去想！不然求生之路2里为什么有傻白在演？（雾）","timestamp_created":1499997796,"timestamp_updated":1499997796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540572822093963623","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33525334","author":{"steamid":"76561198138943107","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1182,"last_played":1631764572},"language":"english","review":"77/10
