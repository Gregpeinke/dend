Es então que a enviada dos deuses, 2K games, desce do paraíso para nos entregar mais uma obra brilhante da saga [u]Bioshock[/u].[/h1]\n\nSeguindo a linha de seus antecessores, Bioshock Infinite tem seu principal destaque em sua trama. Uma história complexa, desenvolvida em torno de uma civilização futurista, repleta de reviravoltas épicas, personagens bem construídos e suas relações exploradas do início ao fim. Mesmo sendo um jogo num contexto bem diferente dos 2 primeiros, é fantástico a forma como o rumo das coisas apresentam claramente uma ligação entre toda a saga.\n\nO jogo apresenta um storytelling muito bem contado e interpretativo, sendo possível se perder na história ao não prestar atenção nos mínimos detalhes. Apesar disso, nada é entregue de mão beijada e de forma racional \"jogue e saiba a história toda\". Para compreender bioshock como um todo, é necessário se aprofundar em cada momento e ir ligando o quebra-cabeça. Principalmente no que diz respeito a ligação do Infinite com os outros 2 jogos.\n\nIrei dispensar comentários do gameplay, por se tratar de algo esperado em jogos do gênero.\n\nOs aspectos visuais e sonoros do game formam um casal perfeito para criar uma atmosfera imersiva e surreal. Seguindo uma linha retro, com uma forte influência steampunk. Infinite retoma objetos, trajes, estilo musical, todos derivados do sec XX. Muitos aspectos visuais e sonoros podem ser considerados uma obra de arte e longe de estarem ultrapassados por uns bons anos. Ressaltando que todo esse conjunto trabalha em completa harmonia com o clima, ambientação e roteiro desenvolvido pelo game.\n\nHá muito o que se dizer, mas Infinite é um jogo indispensável para a saga bioshock. Sendo um prato cheio para os amantes de histórias, não necessariamente jogos. Independente de ser um shooter.\n\n[h1]O jogo constantemente se encontra em promoção durante as sales. Valendo 100% a compra da saga completa ou do Infinite + Season Pass ([b]Sim, COMPRE O PASSE, AS DLC'S SÃO DE EXTREMA IMPORTÂNCIA[/b]).[/h1]","timestamp_created":1511829877,"timestamp_updated":1511830010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606634914875030518","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37838283","author":{"steamid":"76561198320666854","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":254,"last_played":1645669763},"language":"brazilian","review":"Uma historia digna de um best seller combinada com uma gameplay fluida","timestamp_created":1511829464,"timestamp_updated":1514782964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37838217","author":{"steamid":"76561198038044255","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1408,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1408,"last_played":1448850717},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the best games ever.

You enter a room or area, kill the enemies inside, and move on. Really the only diversity in the gameplay is the vigors (powers that you can use to help you in combat). The problem with the vigors however is that by the time you unlock them all, you'll already be maybe an hour from completing the game, so whats the point? There are only a few guns in the game, and just like the vigors, you will start to get them way too late in the game to actually use them. For example, i finally found a burst gun when i had maybe 2 hours of gameplay left, and i couldnt even use it because i didnt have enough time to upgrade it to the point of being useful. For an fps however, i think the combat is alright i guess.\n-Environment:\nThe world of Bioshock Infinite is a beautiful, floating version of an early 20th century city in America. There are some cool views, lots of stores and other buildings to go into, and the colors certainly make it stand out from the environment in other games. However, there is an extreme lack of character to it per se. There isnt really anything to make the player WANT to explore the environment. Its pretty weak.\n-Story: \nThe story is pretty predictable, i was able to predict the ending when i was halfway through the game, and it sort of has a hard time getting the player to be deeply invested. The first half of the game goes by extremely slowly, and mainly consists of going from place to place, being confused for the sake of being confused, and trying to figure out what the heck is with the creepy twins that teleport from place to place. Near the second half of the game however, it is almost too much information, as if the devs were trying to rush it along just to get it over with. Its a pretty cliche story, and relies a bit too much on shock value.\n-Overall:\nOverall i think the game is fun for a while, but it is definetely not memorable. The best thing about it is the soundtrack and the characters, who are excellently voiced by the way. I wouldnt recommend it for the price that its still going at, especially when you can finish it in under 10 hours.
