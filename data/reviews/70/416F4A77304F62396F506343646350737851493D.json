La majorité des jeux rétro qui essayaient de donner une touche réaliste au graphisme du jeu finissait par malheureusement vieillir super mal. Cependant ce que j’ai remarqué avec Half-Life est que pour une raison ou une autre, ils ont un certain charme. Pour expliquer brièvement, le style d’art à bien retenu sa forme, même si la lumière est un peu débitable. Le jeu est créé d’une manière pour que les graphismes ne soient pas en premier plan, donc même si on disait un jeu de PS1 ce n’est pas trop un problème, même si ça reste un peu moche.\n\n\nDeuxièmement, l’ambiance.\nL’ambiance du jeu est mise en place d’une façon pour nous rappeler qu’on est en danger dans la facilité Black Mesa. La musique du jeu, même si présente ne commence pas a révéler trop les éléments comme un Dark Souls ou l’on entend de la musique assez glauque avant chaque combat. Plusieurs zones du jeu sont peu éclairées et silencieuses, pour ne pas casser l’ambiance. De plus, nous sommes seuls la majorité du temps, occasionnellement tombants sur quelques extraterrestres. Seule chose pour nous sauver d’une solitude complète est l’apparition occasionnel de personnages secondaires, comme les scientifiques, gardes, etc. Ça nous immersent bien dans le jeu.\n\nFinalement, le gameplay.\nDans ce point Half-Life est très innovant. De nos jours cela ne s’applique plus, mais lorsque Half-Life 1 est sorti il était révolutionnaire, car le format de FPS n’était pas trop répandu. Bien sûr, il y avait des jeux comme Doom, mais la différence entre doom et half-life est que Doom est un jeu qui se passe de niveau en niveau, assez linéaire, et même si half-life est assez linéaire il nécessite des fois de retourner en arrière pour aller activer quelque chose, il y a des salles bonus des personnages a rencontré et un combat en 3D assez innovante comparée à la 2D des Dooms de l’époque. Même par nos standards d’aujourd’hui, Half-Life est un jeu assez plaisant à jouer.\n\nEn gros, je recommande définitivement ce jeu. \nP-S Désolé si ce n’est pas une super bonne évaluation, c’est la première que je fais de ce format donc je me pratique encore.","timestamp_created":1611777085,"timestamp_updated":1611777085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85459180","author":{"steamid":"76561198125913175","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1616796332},"language":"spanish","review":"sin comentarios jaja","timestamp_created":1611776990,"timestamp_updated":1611776990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85457878","author":{"steamid":"76561199045312830","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":4711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3173,"playtime_at_review":703,"last_played":1660328361},"language":"turkish","review":"FG","timestamp_created":1611775309,"timestamp_updated":1611775309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85456575","author":{"steamid":"76561198820257177","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":8344,"playtime_last_two_weeks":92,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1660442734},"language":"english","review":"very good","timestamp_created":1611773648,"timestamp_updated":1611773648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85455006","author":{"steamid":"76561198121607500","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":120,"last_played":1613674427},"language":"english","review":"Actually played this game when I was 7 and it gave me nightmares lol\n\nPlaying 10 yrs later and it's like reliving my nightmare, still the best","timestamp_created":1611771715,"timestamp_updated":1611771715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85454127","author":{"steamid":"76561198256679063","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":824,"last_played":1635718560},"language":"english","review":"A classic for anyone who owns a computer.
