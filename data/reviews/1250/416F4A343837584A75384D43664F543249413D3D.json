The game has 7 classes. Demolitions, Sharpshooter, Commando, Firebug, Field Medic, Support Specialist, and Bezerker. Each class takes a while to level up (A while meaning that it could take a month grinding out a class to the max level of 6.) so if you're a completionist then you can take the time to grind out your classes if thats your thing. The achievement hunters will have a couple hundred achievements to get. Some like the Hell on Earth achievements (Max difficulty achievements) can take a very long time to get due to how difficulty Hell on Earth can be. \n\nSimply put, Killing Floor might have a dead playerbase, but if you gather up some friends there's lots of fun to be had.\n\n\n\nAlso.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLODESAMONE.","timestamp_created":1389507065,"timestamp_updated":1460925721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506337583065032959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8673198","author":{"steamid":"76561198041862854","num_games_owned":874,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":21964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13093,"last_played":1606518925},"language":"english","review":"tired of left for dead, shooting all the zombies with 1 clip and knocking them all down? this game give you a challenge and the zombies plan against you. really recommended","timestamp_created":1389500255,"timestamp_updated":1389500255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8672918","author":{"steamid":"76561198037619835","num_games_owned":342,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":38893,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22466,"last_played":1648864407},"language":"english","review":"FUCK GOOD","timestamp_created":1389498490,"timestamp_updated":1389498490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8672707","author":{"steamid":"76561197978575301","num_games_owned":319,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":19064,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18635,"last_played":1407557370},"language":"english","review":"Many laughs to be had when playing killing floor, Out of all the games ive played on steam this is the one that can keep you entertained doing the same thing, the best thing about KF is the idea that you can jump in at any level of experience and just mess around survive or die its a great game and I hope to see a killing floor 2 in the future\n\nYou can easily forget the hours when playing this with friends and the community itself is great.\n\nHighly recommend it to all players hardcore or casual KF has something for all","timestamp_created":1389497006,"timestamp_updated":1389497006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8671198","author":{"steamid":"76561198043524956","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":24557,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9880,"last_played":1645013162},"language":"russian","review":"Уже прочитывая название сея творения, мы можем представить себе, что может таиться в данном контенте. Разработчики-энтузиасты из [b]Tripwire Interactive[/b] некогда разрабатывали модификацию игры на основе движка [i]Unreal Engine 2004[/i] (для нынешних времён, двигло весьма старое, а дело-таки было в далёком 2005-м) и немного затянули с выходом проекта. В 2008-м году мне попался диск (хоть и пиратский, признаю, был ещё тогда маслёнком-нищебродом, но не суть) с данной игрой, и решил попробовать. Спустя трое суток, я понял, что в этой игре есть что-то своё, неповторимое.\n\nСюжетную линию я не стану расписывать во всех деталях: в лабораториях [i]Horzine Biotech[/i], где учёные, под руководством Кевина Кламели, сумели-таки разработать методику клонирования людей, произошла авария, в ходе которой толпы клонов-машин убийц выбрались на свободу, угрожая всему Лондону и их окресностям настоящим апокалипсисом. Вы - один из смельчаков (солдат, медик, Ди-Джей, священник, стимпанк, агент и др.), который истребляет толпы мутантов-зомби на локации. Ничего сверхгениального или выделяющегося, на первый взгляд, нет.\n\nОднако, разработчики нас всё больше удивляют: видов и сортов противника достаточно прилично - это и обычные голопопые зомби-кастраторы, арахниды (скачущие, как блохи, и кидающиеся на всё живое буквально изо всех щелей), и вопящие во всю глотку сирены, и невидимые сталкеры, и стреляющие плазмой монстры, и бронированные лютые монстры с вертящимися отбойниками-дробилками на руках... А в конце - сам отец-создатель этой нежити - Патриарх, со встроенными пулемётной турелью и ракетницей и способностью регенерировать и исчезать для внезапной атаки с тыла. Воистину лютый босс на харде или выше. К тому же, наличие достаточно огромного выбора оружия порадует многих.\n\nСама по себе игра выглядит, как стандартный survival horror: мы выживаем на локации ряд нарастающих волн, периодически между волнами пополняясь боеприпасами и оружием у торгаша (да, торгаш боится светиться во время волн), в конце волн появляется последняя волна - босс Патриарх и периодическое нашествие мутантов. Достаточно просто и логично. К тому же, в игре присутствует система прокачки перков, которые позволяют использовать специальные навыки для каждого класса: более эффективные убийства определённым классом оружия, возможность видеть невидимых сталкеров на расстоянии, возможность видеть уровень хп, более частые эффекты slow-motion (в игре это называется Z.e.d.-Time). К тому же, в игру добавили режим Objective Mode, где мы выполняем задания, что-то типа сюжетного прохождения, что весьма интересно.\n\nМинусов в игре как таковых нету, разве что, устаревшая технология движка Unreal огорчает \"сержантов Графоуни\", хотя, на мой взгляд, это только дополняет игре некой брутальности. К тому же, когда в игре столько мяса и крови (а именно дохрена), кто вообще замечает такие мелочи, как графон? К тому же, в игре предусмотрена функция \"песочницы\" - Вы можете сами создавать условия игры - количество мутантов за волну, количество волн, виды монстров, появление торгаша и многое другое.\n\nИгра достойна похвал. Она одновременно проста и сложна. Она не напоминает любую другую игру про зомби, но умудряется строить в наших головах ассоциации с этими играми. В общем, для любителей мяса и дикой сложности (Ад на Земле), посвящается.","timestamp_created":1389488090,"timestamp_updated":1389512470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.625629067420959473","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8670997","author":{"steamid":"76561198007187624","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":8838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6455,"last_played":1597466472},"language":"french","review":"sait comme zombi nazi","timestamp_created":1389487034,"timestamp_updated":1440764583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8670933","author":{"steamid":"76561197998846818","num_games_owned":428,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3395,"last_played":1406945896},"language":"english","review":"Classic example of gameplay over graphics.","timestamp_created":1389486663,"timestamp_updated":1389486663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8669871","author":{"steamid":"76561197991752858","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":24546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24451,"last_played":1386720754},"language":"spanish","review":"Empezó como un juego excelente.

First of all, unlike Zombies, Killing Floor has several difficulty settings, which is a blessing for me, because there's a difficulty setting that's just right for whatever mood I'm in. May it be just wanting to kick back and relax, or wanting more of a challenge, there's a difficulty for all of that. \nSecond, there are different types of enemies in Killing Floor, unlike in Zombies. There's a mutated man with a scythe for an arm that tries to slice you,  a pudgy acidic-vomit spewing kind, one that crawls on all fours, and a witch looking thing that screams at you and causes damage. Don't forget your common and generic weak, cannon fodder kind.\n\nYou can actually win at Killing Floor, unlike in zombies. A full length match is 10 rounds. Inbetween these rounds you visit a store that opens up everytime a round is finished, and buy guns and all sorts of armaments there. The match leads up to a boss fight at the last round, where your entire team must work together and concentrate their fire on the boss in order to win the match.\nTeamwork is an essential in Killing Floor. Don't expect to be a one man army, going in guns blazing, decimating everything that moves by yourself. You can do all that in Killing Floor,  just not by yourself. Stick with your team, watch each other's backs, and everything will be just fine.\n\nAll in all, Killing Floor is a fast-paced survival-horror game that is great fun with friends. I recommend Killing Floor to anyone who likes pure adrenaline fueled co-op action and fun, or to anyone who's played Call of Duty Zombies, and felt they wanted something more.","timestamp_created":1389473633,"timestamp_updated":1389473660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8667953","author":{"steamid":"76561198079906270","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":8387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7417,"last_played":1603987253},"language":"english","review":"This game is great.

I ran into it because a group of friends had starting playing together and asking me to join. The game was around $20, so I gave it a shot. And boy did I really had some fun times. Gameplay wise, it's a co-op game where a group of people get ready in a map, and try to outlast horde after horde. With easy to hard zombies lurking towards you in bunches. The first horde waves aren't too bad, but it slowly wears you down. Finishing all the way was always fun, and difficult. It was a challenge, running around, to and fro, to the shop to buy ammo, armor, and guns, and then back to your safe-spot. The game is using the the legendary Unreal2 engine, which looks great but is quite dated. It still looks and runs well. Overall, this game is a great co-op piece that is slightly underproduced. It can be glitchy, but nothing that takes away from the fun.

Do not be mistaken, if you're looking for a L4D-ish kind of game, this isn't like it at all. Yes it has zombies, but that's the only thing.\n\nPerk system is good overall, and will prove useful to explore each one of them and use the one that best suits your gameplay, berseker is good for you if you like to go into the mass of zombies and chop them up with knifes, axe, swords and such. If you're more keen in sniping away heads, sharpshooter is for you.\n\nDifficulty setting is pretty balanced, each difficulty can be differentiated from one another easily.\n\nThe only con I can find to the game is being a little too repetitive because it has no campaign whatsoever (though, the description of each map makes up a decent story) and it's always the same: survive waves, kill the patriarch.\n\nOther than that, the best coop game available right now. 9/10","timestamp_created":1389312639,"timestamp_updated":1389312639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8638456","author":{"steamid":"76561198041442925","num_games_owned":673,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":6479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3324,"last_played":1533534749},"language":"english","review":"Great game even better if you have friends who know what it means to work as a team. though at the momment mac users like my self are having some problems opening the game but they are attempting to fix it.","timestamp_created":1389307215,"timestamp_updated":1389307215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8638051","author":{"steamid":"76561198055340220","num_games_owned":302,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1857,"last_played":1601534762},"language":"english","review":"Its a wonderful game and if your looking for stupid fun then get this game","timestamp_created":1389305277,"timestamp_updated":1389305277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8635572","author":{"steamid":"76561198013452273","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":39431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30770,"last_played":1648466748},"language":"japanese","review":"最初は鬼畜ゲーだったが、慣れると楽しい。　\nPerkという職種の様な物が７つあり決まった武器を使用すると強化され\nレベルを上げる事でより強力になるのでやり込める。\n\nSteam導入したらこれ買えば楽しめるだろう。\nえらい安くなる時あるからその時買うのお勧め！","timestamp_created":1389294238,"timestamp_updated":1389294238,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601036727428436279","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8635176","author":{"steamid":"76561197998217025","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15953,"last_played":1654370537},"language":"english","review":"Wonderful game.","timestamp_created":1389292298,"timestamp_updated":1389292298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8634606","author":{"steamid":"76561198084895311","num_games_owned":722,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":653,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":653,"last_played":1540221143},"language":"russian","review":"С днем рождения дед.","timestamp_created":1389288865,"timestamp_updated":1557877791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8631884","author":{"steamid":"76561198043689008","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":5556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2407,"last_played":1558362774},"language":"english","review":"Ruined my life.
