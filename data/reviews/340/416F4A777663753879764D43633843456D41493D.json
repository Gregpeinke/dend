Actually, although this is a very technical subject, the developer's commentary that comes with it, is more than worthwhile listening to. It gives quite some insight into how this mini-level was constructed, and even into how HDR lighting actually works. It's not easy to talk about something as complex as this is an easily understandable manner. Fascinating stuff, and for the die-hard Vavle-fans: you even get Gabe Newell's words at the beginning of the commentary ;-).\n\nAfter playing it through for a second time recently - after having left it aside for over five years - I felt amazed by how lively most of the graphics and - of course - the lighting still look today - a full nine (!!!) years after this level was published. Especially the little Byzantine church, part of the monastery on top of the cliffs, still feels amazing and oozes atmosphere. Valve did a wonderful job with the lighting inside the church, even letting dimmed light through the stained-glass windows. At the same time, it also made me a bit sad, because, well, how long has it been since we got the latest Half-Life content? Oh well, who knows....\n\nSince this one comes for free in the Orange Box and the Half Life 2-complete package, I guess most of you who played Half-Life 2 at some point, have this in your game collection. If you haven't tried it yet, by all means do so, but be advised: it's very good, but also very short ;-).\n\nOverall rating: 8/10\n","timestamp_created":1596637172,"timestamp_updated":1596637172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73812986","author":{"steamid":"76561198309650404","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":17,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1595279553},"language":"english","review":"This is literally Valve flexing their engine and level design","timestamp_created":1596632932,"timestamp_updated":1596632932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73811701","author":{"steamid":"76561198404911381","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":26,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1596630987},"language":"russian","review":"прикольно, но коротко","timestamp_created":1596630908,"timestamp_updated":1596630908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480769246816635132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73805977","author":{"steamid":"76561198392777992","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":166,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110,"last_played":1601978852},"language":"english","review":"its half life 2 but with very good pacing and structure packed into 10 minutes\n+ its free anyways lol","timestamp_created":1596621526,"timestamp_updated":1596621526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73777158","author":{"steamid":"76561198150842663","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":26,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26,"last_played":1563403587},"language":"english","review":"I found the coast","timestamp_created":1596580065,"timestamp_updated":1596580065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73773941","author":{"steamid":"76561198191746828","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":81,"playtime_forever":32,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1596570148},"language":"english","review":"Half Life Lost Coast is more fun Half Life Gameplay.

This is such a tight 20-30 minute play-through. There's none of the clunkyness or the too-long sections of HL2, just pure fun through and through. Lost Coast is mostly devoid of story elements, but for such a short run-time, that isn't missed. The setting is one of the prettiest in the franchise, and the map offers a great deal of fun altercations and combine attacks that make you strategize a little and think on your toes, too. The optional dev commentary elevates the whole experience, and makes me appreciate the map design and visual artistry in all the HL2 games a bunch more. 10/10","timestamp_created":1596032794,"timestamp_updated":1596032794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73429213","author":{"steamid":"76561198060423911","num_games_owned":810,"num_reviews":116,"playtime_forever":53,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1595957988},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Коротенькі пів-місії вирвані із контексту гри.\nЧим цікаво?\n- Ну, це все таки \"Half-Life 2\".\n- Тут поліпшена графіка довколишнього середовища (що не використовувалося у грі).\n- І тут є цікаві коментарі розробників.\n\nБагато часу не забирає, тож рекомендую, по типу \"а чому б і ні\".","timestamp_created":1595962814,"timestamp_updated":1595962916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73412542","author":{"steamid":"76561198983955541","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":20,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1595937202},"language":"russian","review":"Слишком затянуто, а вообще у меня лост кост вообще не тянет","timestamp_created":1595937370,"timestamp_updated":1595937370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73409539","author":{"steamid":"76561199037628654","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":96,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":96,"last_played":1595931658},"language":"english","review":"Very cool, and interesting!
