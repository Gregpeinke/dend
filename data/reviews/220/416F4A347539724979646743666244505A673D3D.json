С самого начала игроку без очевидных туториалов рассказывают, как играть. К примеру, чтобы сбежать из комнаты, куда Вас отводит Барни, Вы учитесь подбирать и бросать объекты. К первому снайперу Вы подходите со спины, так что получаете возможность подорвать его лежащей рядом гранатой, не вступая в настоящий бой. Когда в Рейвенхольме игрок извлекает лезвие из стены с помощью гравипушки, в этот момент в поле зрения появляется зомби. Игрок инстинктивно нажимает на кнопку, и - тыдыщь! - разрезает гада пополам. Все! Всего за 10 секунд Valve научила игрока, что циркулярные пилы прекрасно помогают против зомби.\n\nValve самыми разными способами помогает игроку разгадывать головоломки. Но при этом никогда не подсказывает в традиционном смысле этого слова и готового решения тоже не дает.\n\nЕсли Вы настоящий ценитель хороших игр, будьте уверены - Half-Life Вас точно не разочарует!\n\nHALF-LIFE 3 - I WANT TO BELIEVE!","timestamp_created":1479939168,"timestamp_updated":1575143007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.564710021018981934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26914588","author":{"steamid":"76561198078768205","num_games_owned":537,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1292,"last_played":1372439594},"language":"german","review":"Mein erstes Spiel auf Steam.

With gameplay, story, and level design all top notch, graphics that were among the best for it's time and still beautiful today, the premiere of source engine, not to mention the mods. Half-Life 2 is every bit as briliant and groundbraking as the original, if not more so.\nFirst and foremost there's the story. Set about twenty years after the events of Half-Life and the entire Black Mesa fiasco, the diabolical combine has complete controll over Earth after a bloodsoaked take-over lasting less than a day. Players enter this world, specifically the dystopian City 17 as Dr. Gordon Freeman. After spending the time between games in cryostasis Freeman is revived by the G-Man in a ploy to overthrow the combine oppressors, and restore Earth's freedom. \nG-Man is still a shadowy and clandestine figure who's exact goals, motivations, and mysterious \"Employers\" are largely unknown. \nThe entire cast is truley memorable, perticularly Alyx as a well written charactor and well programmed A.I. companion. Barney, Eli, and Kleiner are also great charactors and their history with Black Mesa adds a sense of long lost brotherhood that's hard to create. And than there's Breen, the dispicable silver-tounged sellout who surrendered on humanty's behalf to the Combine and now acts as Head Administrator of the human race and basically ruler of Earth under the strict rule of the Combine himself.\nLife under the Combine rule is miserable, everyone is monitered, the police force: Civil Protection has unquestionable authority, and the land outside the walls of City 17 is infested by the alien beasts that escaped onto earth durring the invasion in the first game. All told City 17 is one of the bleakest settings in any game, and the inspirations from other dystopian fiction perticularly Nineteen Eighty-Four and The Prisoner are used well with the original aspects of the horrific future the game depicts. In the interest of not spoiling too much I'll leave it at that for the story.\nThe story for myself as well as many fans is the focus, however the gameplay is every bit as good. Every gun feals unique and never once did I think \"There's already the SMG why have the assault rifle?\", the consistent well spaced progression of weapons is well balenced making sure to give the player a new toy every hour or two. The shooting mechanics are basic: Fire, alternate fire, reload. But the actual act of aiming and shooting was better than most if not all of it's time and is still largely unmatched today. The lack of iron sights may bother some more modernly trained shooter fans but I often forgot about it entirely, it is rather anoying however to not have dedicated buttons for \"melee attack\" and \"throw granade\" and to have to manualy switch to the crowbar and granades when the're needed.\nThe level design and variety is also commendable, the settings look like real places that real architects would design, (at least the human built locations do, the alien built structures are apropriately strange and unsettling) yet function well in firefights and exploration with places to take cover and open spaces for more direct action, as well as several hidden caches of ammo and health to find. Throughout the course of the fifteen hours or so the story takes to complete Freeman will fight through urban areas of City 17 to underground catacombs, coastline, small towns, and more with every environment adding new ideas and often new enemies to the mix. The progression of enemies like weapons is well balanced to always keep things interesting, and the variety ranging from humanoids armed with rifles to giant burrowing insects to zombie-like headcrab hosts is impresive, with each type requiring different tactics to defeat.\nThe driving segments are long and can get repetitive, especialy the since the game uses the outdated \"one analoge stick is accelerate and steer and the other is camera controll\" scheme. It didn't bother me much but I feel it's worth mentioning.\nThe music is also worth mentioning, but for it's brilliance. The score composed by Kelly Bailey is a perfect ballence of action and horror with undertones of constant tension \"Triage At Dawn\" to me at least stands out even among the incredible soundtrack.\nThe Graphics as well are truely a wonder today, back in 2004 it was almost impossible to beieve the game actualy looked this good. Facial animations were groundbraking, the detail in the environment was sunning, and the character design for both enemies and allies was very creative and well designed.\nThe bottom line is this: Half-Life 2 is still among the top ranks for shooters or games in general. Updates to the graphics and physics in the Source engine have improved the game, and the modding community have kept the game alive long after most games are forgotten. Even though the story is still incomplete and Half-Life 3 is still just a daydream I can think of few games that have shocked and excited me more.\n10/10","timestamp_created":1479938058,"timestamp_updated":1479938058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26907094","author":{"steamid":"76561198029109894","num_games_owned":606,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":248,"last_played":1478892009},"language":"russian","review":"Отличный боевик , Ждем с нетерпением 3 часть","timestamp_created":1479938036,"timestamp_updated":1479938036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26906928","author":{"steamid":"76561198048992910","num_games_owned":499,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":658,"last_played":1493158266},"language":"spanish","review":"Me recomendaron este juego y me lo compré.
