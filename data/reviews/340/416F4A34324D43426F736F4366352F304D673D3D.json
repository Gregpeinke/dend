За основу проекта была взята некогда часть главы \"Шоссе 17\", которая так и не попала в финальную версию игры Half-Life 2. В результате в 2005 году было создано \"затерянное побережье\" - живописный уровень с текстурами высокого разрешения, качественными моделями, продуманным дизайном, лучшим освещением и большим количеством отражающих поверхностей.\n\nВ центре всего проекта стоит технология High Dynamic Range. HDR симулирует адаптацию человеческого глаза к меняющимся условиям освещения. При переходе из темноты на свет или с яркого света во тьму, глазам требуется некоторое время чтоб привыкнуть, в течении которого картинка будет казаться либо яркой и слепящей, либо слишком тёмной. Благодаря той же технологии можно заметить эффект рефракции, когда лучи света проходят сквозь витражи в монастыре, преломляются и на пол отбрасываются цветные блики. HDR сделал возможным то, что свет не только отражается от предметов в глаза наблюдателя, но и способен попадать на другие предметы, отражаясь уже от них. Всё это позволило сделать игровое пространство более реалистичным и живым.\n\nНе стоит забывать, что Half-Life 2: Lost Coast - это ещё и первая игра Valve со встроенными комментариями разработчиков. Очень увлекательно попасть \"за кулисы\" и узнать о проделанной работе, используемых приёмах, задумках, что так и не были реализованы.\n\nЭта карта действительно интересный игровой опыт, и по сей день она выглядит удивительно красиво.\n","timestamp_created":1421059209,"timestamp_updated":1421059209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":81,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.832724630832672119","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13939038","author":{"steamid":"76561198105708875","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":61,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1615119749},"language":"russian","review":"очегь хорошее дополнение\nно покупать только его не советую лучше купить valve pack  так вы потратите меньше денег","timestamp_created":1420969890,"timestamp_updated":1420969890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241358757019043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13932839","author":{"steamid":"76561198203127840","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":32,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1420828461},"language":"russian","review":"Lost Coast ,выпущенный для демонстрации игры в HDR, порадует фанатов вселенной HL.","timestamp_created":1420932050,"timestamp_updated":1420932050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13923398","author":{"steamid":"76561198030356647","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":904,"last_played":1440952923},"language":"russian","review":"Говно\n","timestamp_created":1420893129,"timestamp_updated":1420893129,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.408314764499664307","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13920559","author":{"steamid":"76561198118298832","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":58,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1488018089},"language":"english","review":"So so short you can complet the entire game in less than 5mins\nI got it free with half life 2 but to buy half life 2: lost coast is £20 what a rip of","timestamp_created":1420875770,"timestamp_updated":1420875770,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456510633230209351","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13916528","author":{"steamid":"76561198153817932","num_games_owned":289,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":32,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1420703490},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую для фанатов Half-Life 2.

Yeah, I understand. With everyone patiently awaiting the arrival of the highly sought after 'Half Life 3', some of us are forced to take more drastic measures in getting our 'Half Life' fix. We're forced to replay the original 'Half Life' games, yep all three of them, even 'Opposing Force'. We're forced to replay 'Half Life 2', yep every episode, and eventually, when there's nothing 'Half Life' related left to play, we must play through this early tech demo of a removed section of 'Half Life 2' redesigned to showcase Valve's HDR lighting.\n\nBut in all seriousness, 'Lost Coast' is a twenty minute demo where you basically walk around admiring the world's surroundings. And when I say admiring, I mean admiring. Seriously, I must have taken in the scenery for over an hour while walking through this demo. And I especially loved the area with the staircase where you get to see Valve's fancy new lighting software and how it mimics what the eye sees in real life. It really is quite impressive, and still is, seeing as how I played through this demo in 2015; 10 years after it's initial release.\n\nYou also get the chance to fight some bad guys, solve a very simplistic puzzle that honestly took me way too long to solve, and shoot down a black helicopter (yep, those black helicopters) with a rocket launcher. The real reason however to play through this demo is to get a chance to hear from the developers themselves with the added in commentary.
