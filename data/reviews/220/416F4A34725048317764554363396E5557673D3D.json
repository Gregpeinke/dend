Life 2 [2004 | Valve / Valve] ★ 94/100 ★\n\nHalf-Life 2 ist halt einfach Half-Life 2. 2004 erschienen und ZACK ein Riesenerfolg. Ich konnte anfänglich nicht nachvollziehen, warum dieses Spiel denn so in den Himmel gelobt wurde. Aber schon nach der Ankunft in City 17 wurde es mir klar: Die Atmosphäre die Half-Life 2 besitzt ist wirklich unübertroffen gut. Klar, Protagonist Gordon Freeman macht während der 8-stündigen Kampagne nicht einmal den Mund auf und steht nur wortkarg rum, aber durch seine Augen sieht man diese futuristische Welt in einem Blickwinkel, den man nicht in Worte fassen kann. \n\nDie Shootermechanik, die Charaktere, die Schauplätze und insbesondere die Physik harmonieren perfekt miteinander und bieten somit eine gerade zu makellose Spielerfahrung. Dass ich die Kampagne am Stück durchgespielt habe, spricht wohl klar dafür, dass Valve weiß, wie man eine richtig gute Langzeitmotivation erzeugt. \n\nHalf-Life 2 ist deshalb auch meiner Meinung nach ein zeitloser Klassiker, den jeder PC-, ja sogar Konsolenspieler mal gespielt haben muss. Eine Steambibliothek ohne Half-Life 2? Das kommt für mich nicht infrage. Und auch für den Preis von 4,99 bzw. 9,99€ sollte man durchaus den Kauf in Erwägung ziehen oder sich Half-Life 2 wenigstens mal als Let's Play anschauen. \n\nAls Fazit kann ich nur sagen: Herrausragendes Spiel, absoluter Pflichtkauf für jeden auf Steam.\n\n##################### #\n#SINGLEPLAYER EMPFEHLUNG# \n##################### #\n\n####################\n#   SHOOTER EMPFEHLUNG    #

You've heard everything good about this game so I'm not going to bother writing it out, you've heard it all before, and for the most part it's very true. The game is still great and it stands the test of time but it has very clear problems to anyone who has played it more than once. And in here lies the problem. \n\nPlaying this game for the first time is amazing. But for some reason, revisiting it is a chore. You can't help but stop and take a break in between each chapter. You'd be hard pressed to play the whole game through a fourth, fifth, or sixth time. I'm not quite sure why this is, but part of me suspects it's chapters like black mesa east, and the ridiculous amounts of dialogue in between segments. The only dialogue I'd ever want to hear more than one time is the final monologue Dr. Breen gives gordon, alyx and eli when they're in the citadel. \n\nThere are parts of this game that are a total regression from the first Half-Life game. For example, Gordon is roped into this \"legendary hero\" archetype and as a result you don't have the liberty to go about situations differently than the game wants you to. This is a huge contrast to Half-Life 1 where you could murder or save any scientist or security guard you wished with the same amount of incentives to do so as there is to keep them alive. As a result Half-Life 1 is much more replayable than it's sequel. \n\nThe weapons are also not very great, none of them feel very satisfying to use aside from the shotgun, crossbow, and gravity gun. The addition of the gravity gun is great, and it deserves a place in gaming history, but it's not enough. In Half-Life 1, you not only had most of the same weapons, but you had more. Half-Life 2 lacks any kind of interesting alien-esque armaments. They're all more fun to use too and never get replaced by another weapon, they all serve their own purpose. The pistol is good at range, and an effective headcrab killer. the revolver is good for taking out heavy targets at a distance. The shotgun is useful for heavy targets up close. Things of that nature.\n\nIn Half-Life 2, on the other hand, the pistol quickly gets replaced by the smg, which quickly gets replaced with the AR2 pulse rifle, (with the exception of firing off grenades). You'll quickly find the weapons limiting, especially if you forget about the gravity gun which I am guilty of myself. \n\nThese are just some negative things about Half-Life 2 that you should know before buying it-- and yes, you should buy it. It's a terrific game it's just got some flaws I feel like most people don't address. On that matter, buy Half-Life one as well, it's a much better game.","timestamp_created":1466826555,"timestamp_updated":1549919779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460643678903579712","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23777521","author":{"steamid":"76561198203270258","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2480,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":378,"last_played":1658421684},"language":"english","review":"3 words.

Go ahead, you won't regret it.","timestamp_created":1466802296,"timestamp_updated":1466802296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23769171","author":{"steamid":"76561198138003441","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1598202592},"language":"german","review":"Suppa Duppa Game","timestamp_created":1466801714,"timestamp_updated":1466801714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464725643396377563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23768663","author":{"steamid":"76561198288366615","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":990,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":922,"last_played":1475946131},"language":"english","review":"Great game.","timestamp_created":1466800666,"timestamp_updated":1466800666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23768498","author":{"steamid":"76561198167554007","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":638,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":281,"last_played":1615396255},"language":"russian","review":"шикардос игра.Это легенда","timestamp_created":1466800359,"timestamp_updated":1474893270,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23768120","author":{"steamid":"76561197995859812","num_games_owned":345,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":10138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8810,"last_played":1545016614},"language":"english","review":"Part 2 of the greatest FPS of all time.","timestamp_created":1466799529,"timestamp_updated":1466799529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23767691","author":{"steamid":"76561198260960885","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":596,"last_played":1527273043},"language":"english","review":"My favorite part is where you can smash the boxes.","timestamp_created":1466798615,"timestamp_updated":1499014004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23767179","author":{"steamid":"76561198120301911","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":2716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":653,"last_played":1647834366},"language":"english","review":"it's pretty good","timestamp_created":1466797365,"timestamp_updated":1466797365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532362461090087891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23767072","author":{"steamid":"76561198207537632","num_games_owned":378,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1311,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1647904060},"language":"polish","review":"Nie to samo co klasyczna jedynka ale polecam bo tak.","timestamp_created":1466797174,"timestamp_updated":1466797174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23766987","author":{"steamid":"76561198171120754","num_games_owned":410,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1118,"last_played":1495723996},"language":"schinese","review":"G胖快把HL3吐出来！","timestamp_created":1466796997,"timestamp_updated":1466796997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23766419","author":{"steamid":"76561198119140602","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1985,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1506,"last_played":1474300572},"language":"english","review":"Simply a masterpiece","timestamp_created":1466795789,"timestamp_updated":1466795789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rPH1wdUCc9nUWg=="}
