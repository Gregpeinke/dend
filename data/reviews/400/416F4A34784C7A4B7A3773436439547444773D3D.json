I'm sure everyone who regularly uses Steam owns this one, if not played it at least once. Simply put, it's a part of this site's DNA by now. So well-weathered by now that most people today have probably forgotten it once was subjected to endless annoying memes about dishonest pastries and a song about a computer gloating that they're not dead.\n\nSo I'll just run through some things I like about the game, I'm sure you don't need a set-up to what the story is or what the gameplay's about.\n\n- the way it integrates FPS mechanics minus shooting with puzzle-solving. It's executed fluidly, controls are tight and puzzles that make you think outside the box without being aggravating.\n\n- the general tone of the game. The scrawlings on the wall in the red-rusted back areas are both hilarious and disturbing (too bad part of the humor of at least one of the walls is the ever over-quoted \"THE CAKE IS A LIE.\" I really envy people who got to play this game around when it came out). GLaDoS as a kind of parody of Shodan of System Shock fame (not sure if that was the inspiration but I'd be surprised if nobody on the team ever played those games) has some funny lines of her own, especially in the second half of the game where you're in \"survival mode\" for lack of a better term.\n\n- the portal gun. Well, of course, the game revolves entirely around it, no way would I recommend this game if I found it subpar! This ties in back to my comments about how well-designed the puzzles are, but just the mechanic itself... whoever came up with it is a genius. That they were able to implement something that seems so complicated to program so flawlessly also shows the remarkable talent of the team behind the game. It's so straightforward yet offers a remarkable number of possibilities for making it through levels if you're clever enough (and indeed it would seem to be a speed runner's wet dream).\n\n- post-game challenges. If you want to test your mettle even further, the game offers two modes with different challenges for segments of certain levels. Advanced maps involve more difficult alterations of certain areas, which might include, say, having portal-proof walls in places you relied entirely on during the normal game. They definitely are hard, but I managed to finish all of them, so if you like the game and want more of it, that's the way to go. Challenge maps involve you completing segments either with as few portals possible, within an allotted time limited, and with fewest steps taken. Getting bronze medals on these are hard enough, gold medals are near-impossible if you ask me. But if you want a challenge, you got it there!\n\n- the soundtrack. No, I'm not talking about \"Still Alive\" (which still is a good song even if the Internet sort of killed that one) but the ambient music that plays occasionally throughout. Some very haunting sounds that fit the environments, and lend well to its balancing act of comedy and something more serious.\n\nOverall, a very positive verdict. Now is it one of my absolute favorite games? To that I'd have to say, no. This is the only game so far that Yahtzee has called \"perfect\" in that he could not think of a single flaw in the game (he recanted that with his Portal 2 review, where the \"flaw\" he found was the game's meme-loving fanbase). And indeed this is a game that one would be hard-pressed to find fault with. It is a game very singularly focused on what it does, cuts the fat, and with not a bug or programming error to be found, QA'd to perfection. In the end though, it is still a linear puzzle game, albeit a clever one, that's short and is what it is. My absolute favorite games are abundant in flaws, but \"greatness\" and \"perfection\" are two distinct concepts in my view. Don't take this as a knock on the game, in fact if you haven't played it already DO SO NOW. It's just that, I agree it's a game without a speck on it, but it doesn't quite move or engage me in the way that games riddled with flaws but make up for it with far more amazing content have. So, I guess you could call that a flaw in itself?
