While not revolutionary in any sense compared to the the first title, it's still a darn good Half Life game that manages to pack a punch in such a short time. Instead of playing as Gordon Freeman, you are Corporal Shepard, a US Marine sent in to quell the Xen invasion and silence the cries of the SCIENCE TEAM. But before orders can be relayed, your helicopter is shot down leaving you to experience the chaos firsthand through the eyes of the marines. Other than shifting up the perspective and giving you a new campaign the game also adds new NPC's, but more importantly several new enemy and weapon types. The minor changes that this expansion adds give it enough spice to make it worth a purchase if you enjoyed Half Life 1. And the same kind of atmospheric storytelling present in the first game adds more to the value, especially for those who enjoy the lore.

I consider this game to be better than blue shift no doubt, opposing force does some things better than HL1 with the weapons and the enemies, such as race X's enemies which are new to this game, same goes for the weapons. in opposing force we get new weapons like a desert eagle which comes with a laser sight, combat knife, an M249 saw mg, and then there is the alien weapons like a spore launcher, shock roach, barnacle tongue. it's (imo) a shame that those bad-ass alien weapons are only in use from chapter 8 to 12. this game also features rope climbing mechanics which can be fussy at times but it hasn't bothered me when i played through this game. I also wanna mention the soldier medic in this game, you have to hold E for like 5 secs for him to heal you, your kinda dumb if you don't know that because the game can get harder if you haven't made use of him. but in the end, opposing force has it's flaws and great game overall, i'm sure you'll enjoy this game.","timestamp_created":1657736737,"timestamp_updated":1657736737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118744854","author":{"steamid":"76561198096899037","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1657651760},"language":"english","review":"Good sidestory of Half Life,i now understand why Opposing Force fans are kind of sad that there is not anything released about its story.","timestamp_created":1657715652,"timestamp_updated":1657715652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118740827","author":{"steamid":"76561198154395780","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":691,"last_played":1647838045},"language":"english","review":"Free my man","timestamp_created":1657708865,"timestamp_updated":1657708865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118734554","author":{"steamid":"76561198195881339","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1916,"playtime_last_two_weeks":25,"playtime_at_review":196,"last_played":1659675370},"language":"english","review":"my force was opposed","timestamp_created":1657696637,"timestamp_updated":1657696637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":30,"votes_funny":14,"weighted_vote_score":"0.741367995738983154","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118728500","author":{"steamid":"76561199151592344","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":90,"playtime_at_review":537,"last_played":1660492251},"language":"english","review":"iss gewd","timestamp_created":1657684135,"timestamp_updated":1657684135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118723243","author":{"steamid":"76561198140081867","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":539,"last_played":1657671249},"language":"english","review":"otis","timestamp_created":1657674553,"timestamp_updated":1657674553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118715428","author":{"steamid":"76561198829007907","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1659149967},"language":"english","review":"Something about being upset that Adrian Shepherd isn't in another game","timestamp_created":1657661577,"timestamp_updated":1657661577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118713605","author":{"steamid":"76561199170952372","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1657658494},"language":"english","review":"in Half-Life: Opposing Force, you follow Shepard and his way out of Black Mesa once things turn sideways.

It's still inferior to the base game but I still had fun. The game was overall much more difficult than Half-Life and Blue Shift but more so towards the end. The rope physics were janky but they were cool to have. I was hoping for a story that wasn't this basic and more focused on the evil side but this game did humanize the villains a lot more. It's great for its gameplay but it lacks in its story. There were also some bugs and issues but it was smooth for the most part.

[spoiler] Oyunda onu bir sahnede görüyoruz. G-Man ise arada bir karşımıza çıkıyor. Bu arada Gordon Freeman'ı oyunun sonunda durduramıyoruz ki bunu beklemiyordum ben de zaten. [/spoiler] Blue Shift oyununun aksine bu oyunda hissizlik yok. Yani düşman canlılarla savaşırken asker olduğumuz hissi geçiyor bize gayet de bu oyunda. 7,2 saatte bitirmemin sebebi bulmacalar haricinde zorlanmam. Yeni yaratıklar eklenmiş ve bunlar beni gerçekten zorladı. Bölümlerde ne yapmam gerektiğini anlamadığım ve çözümlere baktığım zamanlar oldu. Fakat Blue Shift'teki kadar hüsrana uğramadım bulmacaları ve çözümlerini görünce. Bu açıdan buradaki bulmacaları daha çok beğendim ve daha mantıklı olduklarını düşünüyorum. Hem de bir oraya bir buraya koşuşturmaca daha az var.\n\nOyuna yeni silahlar da eklenmiş ve bunları kullanmak gerçekten keyifli. Bunun yanında fenerimiz yerine yeşil gösteren gözlük eklenmiş: Sanırım bu, gece görüş gözlüğü olsa gerek. Şarjlı tabii ki. İpe de tırmanabiliyoruz çeşitli yerlerde. Hatta tırmanmamız gerekiyor.\n\nOyunun sonu beklediğim gibi bitmedi -[spoiler] Oyunun sonunda Gordon'ın çabalamaya devam ettiği bir sahne konulabilirdi. [/spoiler]- ama oyunun [b] başarılı [/b] olduğunu düşünüyorum. Ben beğendim genel olarak.\n\nŞimdi bu oyunda hata var mı? Evet, var. [b] Hemen hataların çözümüne geçelim: [/b] İlk hata olan fare hareketinde bozulmayı çözebilmek için Options seçeneğinden Raw Mouse Input kutucuğunu işaretlemeniz gerekiyor. Mouse Sensivity ayarını da ben 6.0 yapmıştım, daha normal oluyor oynanış. İkinci hata olan oyun içi yükleme kısımlarında bizi bekletiyor oyun fakat beklettikten sonra oyun devam edince hareket edemiyoruz. Bunun çözümü de yükleme kısımları gelmeden önce sürekli zıplamak. Bunu yaparsanız beklettikten sonra hareket edebiliyorsunuz.\n\nBlue Shift'i oynadıktan sonra bu çok iyi geldi, seviye atladım gibi hissediyorum. O neydi öyle ya? Tamam, bunda da hatalar var da bunlar, oyunun güzelliğinden dolayı çok göze batmıyor. Ayrıca alt yazı da yok, Türkçe dil desteği de yok. Bunu da söyleyeyim şimdiden. Sadece seslendirme var İngilizce olarak. Bu açıdan zorluk yaşatabiliyor.\n\nHalf-Life 1 Anthology isimli paketle satın almanızı öneririm bu oyunu.\n\nHer oyunu çıktığı zamana göre değerlendirmem gerekirse benim bu oyuna puanım 7/10'dur. Half Life evrenine hiç başlamadıysanız bile denenebilir.
