It features everyone's favorite four-eyed mute: Gordon Freeman. The Earth has been taken over by rouge Combine Harvesters and now playing as Gordon Freeman, armed only with a crowbar and his lunchbox, must go and blow shit up alongside his antagonist, Alyx Vance. \n\nHalf-Life 2 is also known as Half-Life: Quarter Life (because a second half-life is technically equal to half of the first, thus 1/2/2=1/4), a \"super 1337\" first-person shooter game that is a sequel, oddly enough, to the game \"Half-Life 3\". \n\nBecause of this unusual order of game titles in this series, many hardcore gamers committed suicide, believing that time and space has reversed, and that they will eventually turn back into sperms. Thus, the release date of this game, November 16, 2004, is forever known as the infamous \"Day of Holy Crap, Time is Going Backwards, Kill Yourself Before it is Too Late-day.\" Unfortunately, for the game's developers, Ugly Spigot, the fan base for Half-Life 2 was sharply reduced by 95%. Some may argue that this tragic incident was a result of improper product advertising, but others believe that this event was an example of Natural Selection (not the mod, of course.) The labs are currently pointing to a massive harpooning of the fans. \n\nAnyway its an ok game and ill give it half a thumb up","timestamp_created":1416360595,"timestamp_updated":1416360595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12999711","author":{"steamid":"76561198086412375","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1224,"last_played":1560731851},"language":"english","review":"Brah.

Помню, впервые узнал,увидел,поиграл в HL2 у своих друзей. Помню, как сейчас,проходили по очереди миссию за миссией. Помню, какими были круглые глаза от всего происходящего на экране...это было нечто,это было изумительно...Я понимаю, ей сейчас никого не удивишь,но по тем временам это было впечатляюще.
