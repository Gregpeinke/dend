Both it's style and artwork are phenomenal, and I found myself enjoying the scenery for multiple minutes at a time. \nHowever, this is the best part of the game in my opinion. The game's story seemed very interesting at the beginning, and i liked how mysterious everything was. Sadly a partial explanation was given very quickly, which in my opinion should be distributed throughout the story a bit better. In contrast, characters are written exceptionally well, especially Booker and Elizabeth, who feel like real people. Sadly, the game tries to tackle more storylines than it can finish, resulting in many abandoned opportunities. The ending wasn't my favourite either. While i didn't hate it, i found myself wondering \"wow, is this really it? the big finale to this story?\".\nNow the gameplay - its ok. I haven't played many shooters (spent 4 years on minecraft and league...), and i didnt find this one to be bad, but rather average. I dislike the fact only 2 guns can be held at a time, and some feel like they were only added to be \"a bit extra\". I only used 2 guns for most of the playthrough, since the non-upgraded ones feel useless. The vigor system is cool, but not balanced very well. Tears also add an additional element to your strategy. Sadly, fights get repetitive quickly. While I still enjoyed a good amount of fights, many felt like the exact same thing.\n\nOverall, the game is still fun and enjoyable, but has its flaws. While I bought this game with a discount, I still believe it is worth its full price.\n7,5 / 10","timestamp_created":1633209359,"timestamp_updated":1633344025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100393482","author":{"steamid":"76561198098973107","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":894,"last_played":1651487032},"language":"schinese","review":"梦幻的哥伦比亚城美轮美奂，无数时间线无尽可能性。游玩时看到的是布克和伊丽莎白。回味的时候倒是想起瑞克和莫蒂。","timestamp_created":1633206803,"timestamp_updated":1633206803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100393020","author":{"steamid":"76561198113818913","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1201,"last_played":1635272448},"language":"czech","review":"Oproti dvěma starším dílům je v mnoha ohledech odlišný, avšak vytěžil z toho jen to dobré.

Man, what a journey. It was all worth it; even if I disagree with a few changes.\n\nIt is a little unfair to compare the tone of the fist two games against this one, since they had to come up with something different and let's face it, submarine, gentically-altered junkies in a fallen, utopic society are THOUGH to beat; replacing it with racial tensions leaves Infinite feeling a little crude. I changed my mind as I saw the story develop and what the revolution could and would mean if given their way; when I was falling in love with the complexity of the story... the DLC ruined it for me. Now instead of two warring factions struggling to fight for what they thought was right in an interestingly fleshed out story of very human characters, there are now a paragon of all good and a cartoonish villain. Man, what a waste.\n\nThat aside, the game is far more linear than its predecessors which makes the 'scavenging around' experience feel a little less meaningful. The atmosphere is less terrifying although the variety of enemies and weapon is much larger; and I'm not sure about the replacement of genetic tonics with simple pieces of equipment you can change on the fly.\n\nThat's all the bad. The story is for the most part, masterfully written and displayed, although they definitely strayed away from the 'show, don't tell' the first Bioshock had. Elizabeth is one of the best supporting characters I've seen as far as I've seen. She's not annoying or needs protection, and actually helps out in meaningful and lore-friendly ways, it is a little weird see her leap 15 feet up or from the air like she was human-bird hybrid. \n\nIt's a worthy addition to the franchise although not the best of the trilogy.
