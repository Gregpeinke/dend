Recensire un gioco come Bioshock Infinite ed essere chiari ed esastivi non è certo una cosa facile, dato la beltà del capitolo d'origine. Ci proverò comunque. \nBioshock Infinte è, come dissi anche per Portal 2, vera e propria arte videoludica.\nCi troviamo stavolta a Columbia, una surreale e utopica città volante gestita da un certo Padre Comstok, un estremista e antisemita republicano. Il compito del portagonista è quello di recuperare una ragazza e riportarla a New York per annulare un debito di gioco con un fantomatico creditore.\nIl titolo offre una delle sceneggiature più intense ed articolate mai viste in videogioco, la quale viene supportata dal gameplay  classico della serie, quindi una garanzia per tutti gli amanti della saga.\nIl comparto tecnico è di grande fattura, così come la qualità delle scelte artistiche di Columbia, che incanta il giocatore, trasportandolo nell'epoca dei primi anni del 900 americano\nIn conclusione posso dire di avere giocato al degno erede del primo Bioshock, il quale riesce in più di qualche circostanza, ad essere superiore al suo glorioso predecessore.

Environments looks beautiful and rich with detail, sound design is also commendable. The actual GAMEPLAY and story is lackluster to say the least. \n\nThe gameplay doesn't really improve upon the first two Bioshock games. Two guns only, plasmids are back for some reason, standard stuff. Nothing mindblowing and really worth talking about at length. The constant \"ambushed\" gunplay scenarios do get a bit boring after a while. \n\nThe plot is the most lauded feature of this game, most reviewers can't stop talking about it. I'm all for sweeping and engaging storylines that make you want to finish the game to see how it all ends, but.. everything the game sets up toward the finale comes crumbling down in what is probably the most painfully obvious plothole ridden hyper pretentious ending I have ever encountered. It just does not make any sense.\n\nThis is the last time I get hyped over a game like this. Mind you, I played Bioshock 1 multiple times because I was trying very hard to 'get' why people call it a masterpiece. I thought I was playing the game wrong, I wasn't.\n\nDon't think I hate this game, I had decent fun while playing. It is certainly not a bad game. You might adore this game or not, it depends.

I hated Bioshock 2 for being a pointless sequel to a game that didn't need a sequel, and I was sceptical of Infinite when I started it.\n\nSo, Bioshock Infinite, then.\n\nTo get the obvious out of the way, this game looks and sounds AMAZING. The visuals alone are well above par, the animation for the chatacters, the level of environmental detail and all of the special effects are top-notch. If you are looking for a pretty game, this is definitely one.\n\nHowever, there is a but: the story of the game, the characters (especially the protagonist) and the premise of the game itself are illogical and, to be blunt, stupid as hell. To give you an example from very early in the game: posters are depicting a \"false shepherd\" as an evil to be rooted and destroyed on sight, and this false shepherd is identified by a tattoo on the hand of the shepherd. The protagonist has an identical tattoo to the images, and remarks on this. However, it never crosses his mind to cover the tattoo up or hide it. There are dozens of situations like these in which I could see a trap coming miles away, but the story demanded that I play my part oblivious to the signs, which is incredibly annoying.\n\nAdd to this the fact that the story is a convoluted mess with very little sense to be had in any of the character's motivations and reasons, and you might find yourself disliking the game for it's story as much as I did.\n\nThe gameplay could be called \"standard\" nowadays. The skyrails are a cool little system, but they are poorly utilized in gameplay, as are the rifts that allow you to spawn objects into the game. As a matter of fact, I found myself accidentally materializing objects while trying to fight enemies, so these opportunities have a bad habit of becoming hindrances during fights.\n\nOh, the fights? Enemies come your way and you shoot them. I played  through 90% of the game with the sniper rifle and the carbine, and almost never found myself needing other weapons. There are several special powers (tonics) for you to use, but most of these are simply callbacks to the Bioshock games and serve no true in-game purpose in Infinite. (In fact, the tonics are a pretty big inconsistency in the game's story for most of the time)\n\nAll in all, if you can look past the dumb characters, convoluted plot and pretty basic gameplay with surprisingly little freedom, you might enjoy Infinite. I have to admit I sure didn't.\n\nPlaytime: 10+ hours (single playthrough)\n\nRatings (1-10)\nVisual: 10\nAudio: 10\nStory: 4\nGameplay: 6\nOverall: 8","timestamp_created":1387267950,"timestamp_updated":1387273334,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.449438214302062988","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8076484","author":{"steamid":"76561197995746579","num_games_owned":1918,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":993,"last_played":1603937286},"language":"english","review":"This game was nothing short of brilliant.

The visual design, the story, the graphics, the soundtrack, dialogue/voice acting, the atmosphere are all 10/10.  As a cinematic experience, it's unforgettable and top notch.  When I started playing it, I remember reading that a lot of people saw the game as a huge anti-Mormon/LDS experience & that came back.  The game takes place in 1912, in the floating city of Columbia.  Post Civil War America is a growing super power, heavy themes of racism, worker oppression, big business, anti-foreigner & religious revivalism are going on with some elements of Greek mythology like the first 2 Bioshocks.  The main villain is 1/2 Joseph Smith & 1/2 Brigham Young.\n\nThe actual gameplay is solid, nothing spectacular or amazing.  I played through on 1999 mode and barely used the vigors which is supposed to be a big draw in the Bioshock world.  I used Shock Jockey for stun, but everything else is basically worthless.  Then you get to the final boss fight & HAVE to use a lot of vigors, so my build made it really hard.  I like the damage numbers & critical strikes popping up on enemies like in Borderlands to see how much HP they have though.  1999 mode wasn't really that hard except for about 2 parts.  There is a recycled boss fight 3 times and a lot of Handyman (read: Big Daddy) fights, the gameplay didn't innovate much and was as long as it was for the sake of story, not because they had that many gameplay ideas.\n\nFor the Season Pass, Clash in the Clouds is just a boring challenge map DLC.  It's just waves of enemies & blue ribbon challenges.  Only play it if you care about achievements.  Burial at Sea is a 2 hour story campaign that ties into the main game, but takes you to 1958 Rapture, just before the events of Bioshock 1.  It actually adds a lot to the story & is very worth playing.  As of now, I know they're coming out with Burial at Sea part 2, but I don't know if anything else is coming for it or not.\n\nOf the 3 Bioshocks, Infinite definitely has the best story & art design, but Bioshock 2 was the most fun for me.  I can appreciate Infinite tying into the previous stories in a unique way & the DLC adds to the story more.\n\nFinal Verdict: 8.5/10  Definitely worth playing through, but just a bit over rated for average gameplay.","timestamp_created":1387224327,"timestamp_updated":1387228799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572427034378051758","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8070249","author":{"steamid":"76561198025490115","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":396,"last_played":1494607020},"language":"brazilian","review":"Otimo Jogo , Otima Historia , Otimo Gameplayer Esse Jogo E OTIMO Em Tudu :)","timestamp_created":1387224197,"timestamp_updated":1387224197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8069722","author":{"steamid":"76561198067378577","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":884,"last_played":1416884106},"language":"english","review":"this game is great, fun, and has an awesome storyline to it, it never gets boring.","timestamp_created":1387221606,"timestamp_updated":1387221606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8069350","author":{"steamid":"76561197970776078","num_games_owned":398,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":625,"last_played":1387147161},"language":"italian","review":"\"Bioshock Infinite è una bella storia da giocare prima di andare a letto.\" \n(cit. Keyazzo)\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nIl terzo capitolo della saga cambia location. Abbandonate scafandro e abissi marini e gettatevi liberi e affascinati nel cielo di Columbia, una delle città virtuali più belle mai costruite. \nImpersonerete Booker DeWitt, carismatico protagonista assoldato da chissà chi per salvare una ragazza.\nHo deciso di organizzare in punti la recensione del titolo, per rendere più semplice l'analisi del tutto, enfatizzando i vari clichè onnipresenti nei videogame: GAMEPLAY-STORIA-GRAFICA-AUDIO-LONGEVITA', quindi iniziamo.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIl gameplay, il cavallo di battaglia della serie, non delude neanche in questo episodio. Un misto di FPS e GDR con possibilità di utilizzare i Vigor (poteri) e le armi con il semplice uso dei tasti destro e sinistro del mouse, gestione di upgrade sia delle armi che dei poteri la fanno, come sempe, da padroni con l'aggiunta del vestiario (piccoli oggetti sparsi per i mondi sotto forma di pacco) che danno bonus permanenti su testa, corpo, gambe e scarpe, come ogni gdr che si rispetti proprone.\nIntelligenza artificiale abbastanza nella norma, con nemici che, purtroppo a volte si buttano un pò troppo in mezzo alla ressa senza curarsi della propria incolumità. Comunque sia a livello difficile la sfida è ben alta e a meno di non essersi equipaggiati per bene, con pochi colpi messi a segno, giacerete per terra in una pozza di sangue.\nPossibilità nel gioco di compiere delle scelte, se influenzeranno o meno il gioco sta a voi scoprirlo.\n\nSTORIA\nUna storia ricca di temi e significati. Religione, razzismo, patriottismo e fisica teorica sono solo alcuni dei temi trattati nella storia, ove senza svelare nulla, Booker si ritroverà a dover rintracciare una ragazza del nome Elisabeth.\nPer il resto, ogni parola sarebbe spoiler, quindi giocatevelo voi! L'unico mio consiglio è di giocarlo con calma. Ispezionate ogni anfratto, ascoltate ogni dialogo, darete quella marcia in più alla godibilità del titolo. \nCome si dice? La storia è importante.\n\nGRAFICA\nIl gioco sprizza maestosità da ogni pixel! Un'opera d'arte su monitor, a meno che si possa usufruire del pieno comparto grafico, grazie alle ultime, potenti, schede video su mercato, anche se tecnicamente un pò arretrata.\nCurato sotto ogni piccolo particolare, Bioshock Infinite vi metterà davanti a una città curata e viva, con la possibilità di goderne appieno grazie alle opzioni video adeguatamente scalabili. \nC'è da dire che l'Unreal Engine ha permesso di uniformare la grafica del titolo su diverse piattaforme, facendo probavilmente abbassare lo standard per la versione pc, che resta comunque estremamente elevato e piacevole.\nAd alcuni potrebbe non piacere lo stile \"fumettoso\" dei personaggi, ma essendo uno stile riproposto ben da 3 capitoli del gioco da Irrational Games non credo ci siano problemi alcuni.\n\nAUDIO\nIl comparto audio è molto curato, con una delle colonne sonore più suggestive che abbia ultimamente udito in un viodeogame. Non discostandosi dal canone qualitativo della serie, forse addirittura superandolo, Bioshock Infinite propone un variegato e magnifico insieme di brani di diverse tipologie, dal ghospel da chiesa americana, a grandi brani dell'epoca.\nMolto ben recitato anche il doppiaggio italiano che si fa ben apprezzare.\n\nLONGEVITA'\nIl gioco si aggira intorno alle 8 ore di gioco a livello difficile, gustandolo in ogni piccolo particolare e cercando ogni oggetto in ogni angolo sperduto dei livelli.\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nPRO\n-Trama convolgente e ben studiata\n- Level design e città di Columbia affascinanti \n- Location diversa che stacca un pò dall'onnipresente mare dei primi due\n\nCONTRO\n- Graficamente appagante ma tecnicamente datato\n- A volte dispersivo se non preso con la dovuta \"calma\"\n- Nemici a volte ancora troppo stupidi\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nUn gioco da avere assolutamente nella propria collezione, giocatelo, divertitevi e fermatevi a ragionare su quello che questa storia ha da insegnarvi. \n\nSta a voi poi imparare.","timestamp_created":1387219374,"timestamp_updated":1387219489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8069305","author":{"steamid":"76561198008236475","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1443,"last_played":1417357718},"language":"english","review":"Great story.

Based on what I'd heard of the series, I was expecting a quirky first person shooter with some intersting mechanics and a 'spellcasting' system. \n\nThis is prettyy much what I got. The combat is fluid and mostly fun - a little repetitive towards the end as the game seems to be trying to avoid the old Half-Life paradigm of 'the guns you get at the end of the best', so you end up using essentially the same gear througout. So far, so 'meh, it was on sale anyway'.\n\nBut what I also got was one of the best and most affecting plots that's I've come across in a very, very long time. It contrives to effortlessly lead you to invest emotionally in the young girl that you're escorting through the nightmare of religious zealotry that is Columbia - Elizabeth. Elizabeth is what makes the game, for me. Wonderfully voiced and presented, her character is developed over the course of the game as she goes from being the means to the end to being the end itself. She's also (unusually for a FPS sidekick) really handy in a fight. Not that she does any fighting - she tends to hide at the first signs of gunfire. Rather she throws ammo, health and other supplies to you at critical junctures. No more escort mission nonsense here.\n\nThe story is beautifully told and, unusually for a FPS, the player is not entirely the protagonist. As you delve deeper into the plot (and your own character's past), you realise that the writers behind BioShock: Infinite have had the courage to tackle an intellectually demanding narrative - there are guides on the internet which seek to explain the meaning behind the final scene.

You instantly find youself at home in very steampunk, 1912 sky city that is absolutely gorgeous. I run a pretty sorry rig with 4 gb of ram and 512 VRAM but was still able to play with no lag once I toned down the graphics settings. Even with dummed down visuals, the experience as a whole is still breathtaking. I would reccommend this game to anyone looking for a good story in an innovative first person shooter. This game builds even further on the mechanics established in Bioshocks one and two without the player needing any knowledge about them. New mechanics that seem gimicks at first will shock you in how well they're implimented. I will suck up tothis game even more based on the fact that it is doing incredibly well in what a lot of other shooters today are failing miserably at. Innovation. In 2007 Bioshock rattled the standers for shooters with the introduction of plasmids and gene tonics. Infinite takes it another step further with weapons that can be upgraded more frequently and different types of upgrades all together. The characters in this game are yet another point that meets all expectations. Booker DeWitt, Elizibeth, and all others are very misterious and if nothing else compells you to finish the game, these characters will. In conclusion, I would reccommend this game to anyone looking for something refreshing. Very little competition for a story and gameplay combo like this.

But that's it... there's not a lot to say about the rest: the relation with Elizabeth was the only reason I finished the game. Problem is: just like the rest of the series, the good aspects are only  a nice dress for a linear shooting experience. Story and gameplay don't even try to reconcile and there's nothing substantial about the backstory and its \"philosophy\". It's just a convoluted excuse to blow heads off with guns and magic: the gameplay has been dumbed down for the casual crowd when compared to Bioshock 1 & 2. There's no survival or rpg-lite element. Just... shooting. The story does not make any kind of sense, but that's a given for the Bioshock series.
