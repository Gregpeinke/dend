Im Gegensatz zum legendären Meilenstein ist das hier allerdings nur ein winziges Mehrspieler-Spielchen, das wohl vor allem für den schnellen Spaß auf LAN-Parties gedacht war.\n\nIn den kleinen Arenen bewegen wir uns von einer runden Plattform zur anderen. Dabei springen wir gar nicht selber, sondern müssen nur über Pfeilsymbole gehen. Wir versuchen, unsere Gegner mit Diskuswürfen von den Plattformen zu schubsen. Fällt man in die Tiefe spawnt man nach kurzer Zeit erneut. \n\nEin Diskus kann an einer gelben Fläche abprallen (daher wohl auch der Name Ricochet). Mitglieder des gegnerischen Teams mit solchen Bandenwürfen zu treffen, ist besonders elegant. \n\nInspiriert wurde das Ganze wohl von dem Film \"Tron\" in dem es ja eine ähnliche Kampfarena gab. Eigentlich auch ein recht spaßiges Spielprinzip, das allerdings kaum Variationen bietet. Lediglich ein paar Variationen des Diskus können wir aufsammeln.\n\nEin noch viel größeres Problem ist aber, daß es niemand mehr spielt. In Worten: Niemand. Und einen Single-Player gibt es nicht. Wir können also nur selber einen Server erstellen und uns dann in unsere Arena stellen. Nicht wirklich Lebenssinn stiftend.\n\nAuch für eine Partie unter Freunden, mit denen man sich verabreden müßte, taugt das Spiel nur bedingt.

На этот раз нам предстоит играть за персонажей, которые перемещаются по летающим в воздухе платформам и кидают друг в друга смертельно опасные диски. Эти диски попадая в противника отталкивают его с платформы, упав с которой он падает в пропасть и умерает, также есть супер выстрел, который отрубает противнику голову, но требует долгой перезарядки. Уровни зачастую имеют ограждения сталкиваясь с которыми диски получают эффект рикошета и улетают в другую сторону. Карт в игре очень мало, и реально интересных набрать можно от силы две штуки. Онлайн в игре нет и на субботний вечер не было не одного игрока. Зато зайдя на любой сервер и побегав пару минут, есть вероятность все таки увидеть какого нибудь игрока. Стилистика игры кстати сильно напоминает \"Трон\". В эту игру можно спокойно играть вдвоем со своим другом, благо для этого есть режим дуэлей, где сражение происходит 1на1 до первой смерти. В целом мне понравилось. Да - игра однообразна, графика устарела, карт почти нет, онлайна нет, но в ней есть какая-то изюминка. Больше часа сражений пролетели почти незаметно и я решил, что обязательно в нее вернусь снова и может даже не один раз.","timestamp_created":1589557423,"timestamp_updated":1589557423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69153109","author":{"steamid":"76561198043573836","num_games_owned":342,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1589512178},"language":"english","review":"Litertally cant look around with my mouse i can only look left n right with arrow keys ITS  A SIN reminds me of the day with browser games 10/10","timestamp_created":1589512227,"timestamp_updated":1589512227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69121265","author":{"steamid":"76561198148196479","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":51,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":51,"last_played":1589406434},"language":"english","review":"Game was rushed by Valve, its pretty bad.\nCommunity is dead (like 5 people playing).\nGenerally just dont buy this unless you want it for memes since its pretty cheap.\nAlso this is probably the only serious review of Ricochet in existance.\n\n3/10","timestamp_created":1589465839,"timestamp_updated":1589465839,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469202905893325806","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69114095","author":{"steamid":"76561198842987054","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":94,"last_played":1626552246},"language":"english","review":"more epic frisbi game","timestamp_created":1589455595,"timestamp_updated":1589455595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69049181","author":{"steamid":"76561198146863711","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1642387067},"language":"latam","review":"los mejores 25 minutos de mi vida\nedit: Entro Gabe Newell, lo mate y se desconecto ayuda tengo miedo","timestamp_created":1589349644,"timestamp_updated":1611796033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69017423","author":{"steamid":"76561198816000677","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":16,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1631015098},"language":"english","review":"WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","timestamp_created":1589298834,"timestamp_updated":1589298834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68997697","author":{"steamid":"76561198189755819","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1589270360},"language":"schinese","review":"三分钟之内不闪退算我输","timestamp_created":1589270411,"timestamp_updated":1589270411,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.41394883394241333","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68936273","author":{"steamid":"76561198095823948","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":20,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1628563813},"language":"english","review":"rikochert 3?
