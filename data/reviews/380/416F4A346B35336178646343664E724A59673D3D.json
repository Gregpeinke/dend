Не такая атмосферная как вторя часть, и представляет собой намного меньше уровней, однако за продолжение сюжета можно стерпеть все. Стало намного больше сентиментальностей, обнимашек с Алекс, ну и все таком духе.\n\n8 катаний на поезде из 10","timestamp_created":1475953395,"timestamp_updated":1553865508,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541087925434112549","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25923547","author":{"steamid":"76561198100162896","num_games_owned":912,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1435487343},"language":"russian","review":"[h1] Хорошо тебе, у тебя костюм… Ну и гадость эта вода! А он не растягивается на двоих? [/h1]\n\n\nHalf-Life 2 стал настоящей вехой в мире компьютерных шутеров, игра получила массу призов, высочайших рейтингов и признании миллионной армии фанатов. На очереди первое продолжение Episode One. Игра начинается там, где Half-Life 2 закончился грандиозным взрывом, робот пёс раскапывает полу живого доктора Фримена и который вновь встречает свою подругу Алекс. Не секрет, что многие остались несколько разочарованы финалом второй части, ведь он оставлял больше вопрос, чем ответов. Эпизод первый конечно же раскроет некоторые секреты, но не ждите большой жирной точки, ведь впереди нас ещё ждёт не одно продолжение . Разумеется никаких графических откровений, движок остался прежним, хотя авторы достаточно серьёзно его приукрасили, игра выглядит на порядок наряднее, новые эффекты освещения радует глаз, скажу больше, ни смотря на возраст этот движок в состоянии выдавать отличную картинку и не требует особо навороченных машин для её качественной выдачи. Первый эпизод по прежнему в высшей лиги) Несколько менее радует тот факт, что новых противников и нового оружия практически не прибавилось, зоопарк в основном прежний) и продолжительность игры всего в несколько часов гймплея. В прочим переживать по этому поводу тоже не стоит, ибо уровни красивые, геймплей азартный и динамичный, игра не очень пресная и пролетается легко, на одном дыхании. Не стоит таким образом рассчитывать на полноценное продолжение, это эпизод, что и подчёркнуто в названии, просто хороший и крепкий аддон, первый в новой серии. \n\nИз минусов можно выделить глупых противников .\n\nМоя оценка 9 Грави-пушек из 10","timestamp_created":1475927957,"timestamp_updated":1475927957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.67053532600402832","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25896383","author":{"steamid":"76561198020125851","num_games_owned":15058,"num_reviews":825,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1475803796},"language":"english","review":"[h1]The Aftermath of Half-Life 2 / Expansion[/h1]\nhttps://youtu.be/n5SwnaxClaU\n+ This is essentially a stand-alone expansion to Half-Life 2 that starts off at the same moment that Half-Life 2 ended.
