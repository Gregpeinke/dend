(can't really review this without making comparisons between the two)  Blue Shift has good quality level design, polished and plays much smoother than the all too often unbalanced OF.  However as many reviews of the game state, BS is very short, easily completed on Hard Mode first try in less than 3 hours, forgettable ending, no new enemies or weapons.  Honestly I may play through OF again to see if I get a different impression but BS is just a much better quality experience.  I love games (classic ones for sure) that are difficult, which is the main issue with BS (it is not), while striving to do something new OF was just unbalanced and awkward, left to either run by enemies/exploit bad AI or tediously battle through with the tiny bits of ammo on the extremely inconsistently balanced weapons.  What Blue Shift lacks, OF's attempts to cover that feel like a constant fumble.  Whereas Blue Shift didn't introduce anything new and was very short, it still plays much better than OF.

The Expansion is really fun you use the same weapons from Half Life but HEV suit and armor is replaced with Security Guard Armor and shows new levels inside Black Mesa that you couldn't explore as Gordon from Half Life. Overall I give it an 9/10 for playing another character during Half Life and the levels and dialogue.","timestamp_created":1607467832,"timestamp_updated":1607468119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.461538463830947876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81861301","author":{"steamid":"76561198813469133","num_games_owned":503,"num_reviews":223,"playtime_forever":101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":1607469291},"language":"russian","review":"Топ!","timestamp_created":1607465769,"timestamp_updated":1607465769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81857506","author":{"steamid":"76561198836576449","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":141,"playtime_forever":331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1615523840},"language":"english","review":"ok, so maybe its not as much of a nightmare as i though it to be. my only reason for changing this review is frozen vortigaunt.","timestamp_created":1607460162,"timestamp_updated":1615358969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81853290","author":{"steamid":"76561198872054135","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1607456890},"language":"english","review":"about that beer","timestamp_created":1607454669,"timestamp_updated":1607454669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81846894","author":{"steamid":"76561197979391235","num_games_owned":627,"num_reviews":1037,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1607401413},"language":"english","review":"yes!","timestamp_created":1607446692,"timestamp_updated":1607446692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81840925","author":{"steamid":"76561199098383101","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":226,"last_played":1607117136},"language":"english","review":"Superior game.","timestamp_created":1607439667,"timestamp_updated":1612818463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81830980","author":{"steamid":"76561198084742870","num_games_owned":292,"num_reviews":214,"playtime_forever":150,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":150,"last_played":1566001134},"language":"english","review":"[b]8.0[/b]","timestamp_created":1607426305,"timestamp_updated":1630796155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81823561","author":{"steamid":"76561198150877757","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":784,"last_played":1650060473},"language":"english","review":"it was working before now it does not work???\n\nwhen i launched it, i could never close it. and the tab for the game never showed up. \n\ni remeber playing a little of the intro before, not sure how i was able to actually get INTO the game. game was really fun doe ngl","timestamp_created":1607413048,"timestamp_updated":1607413048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81815880","author":{"steamid":"76561198040832154","num_games_owned":519,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":184,"last_played":1607397594},"language":"english","review":"Another perspective into half life world.","timestamp_created":1607397642,"timestamp_updated":1607397642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81796197","author":{"steamid":"76561198042138956","num_games_owned":544,"num_reviews":137,"playtime_forever":220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1607365981},"language":"english","review":"Great addition to Half-Life.
