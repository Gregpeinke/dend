Nonostante gli anni che ha questo gioco vi posso assicurare che riuscirà a colpirvi e a prendervi dall'inizio alla fine. Se state cercando un gioco con una trama complessa, ben studiato ma anche divertente, questo gioco fa per voi, se invece ci volete anche un po di grafica vi consiglio il seguito (Half-Life 2). L'unica vera differenza che ho notato fra i due, apparte la grafica, è la difficoltà, il primo è molto più difficile anche giocato in semplice, non che il 2 sia banale.

While previous FPSs had focused more on providing players with concentrated experiences of fast-paced gameplay, Half-Life took players on a journey, placing them in the midst of a variety of events and scenarios, and offering a mix of shooting, platforming and puzzle gameplay. Perhaps most uniquely, Half-Life eschewed cut-scenes, instead unveiling it's story while the player is in control, helping to maintain a sense of immersion. It also places the player in large, continuous environments and essentially all takes place continuously in the day of a single person, again, features which faciliated a sense of immersion. Half-Lifes original take on game design changed the FPS genre irrevocably, and now it is uncommon to find an FPS in which there is not at least some attempt to create a sense of story and setting. Series such as Halo, Call of Duty and BIoshock all owe much to this game.\n        Despite its incontestable historical significance, Half-Life is definitely a bit dated to the contemporary gamer. Like so many late 90s 3D games, it's graphics look chunky. It also doesn't control as smoothly as a contemporary FPS, making sections of the game with platforming challenges a bit annoying. Developers have since accepted that platforming in a first-person perspective is difficult to get right. It's hard to tell exactly where you're standing in Half-Life, meaning sometimes you might fall off a ledge even if your trying to be careful. Shooting is also not quite as smooth as a contemporary FPS, though it holds up fairly well. The brown gun site is a bit frustrating to work with as it tends to blend in to the environment of the game, making it hard to see exactly where you're shooting.\n        Many of the game's original strengths are also still evident. Interesting enemies, creative environmental designs, and of course, the game's unique sense of continuity. One can certainly see why Half-Life was such a game-changer back in the day, even though the gameplay feels coarse by current standards. Half-Life presents an interesting setting, especially in the final levels of the game, which are by far the most bizarre and beautiful.\n        If you are interested in the history of videogames, you should definitely try this game. If your looking for a fun FPS, you might be better off with something more recent. If your willing to forgive what's dated about the game and overlook some of it's flaws though, Half-Life still offers a journey worth taking.\n","timestamp_created":1410191823,"timestamp_updated":1410191823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12021891","author":{"steamid":"76561198024515775","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1455,"last_played":1409331549},"language":"english","review":"I played this a long time ago.

Well, for me, it has to be the visual world that captures the core of our imaginations. And with this little gem called Half-Life, it comes as no exception that this game continues to boggle the mind and leave gamers alike wondering. There is more heart, creativity and scientific ingenuity there is in this one title than there is in most series and is arguably Valve's greatest achievement. With over 50 game awards, it's a strong justification. Half-Life isn't just one of the greatest FPS' games of all time. Half-Life isn't literally one of the best purchases you can ever get on Steam. Half-Life is quite simply, one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nWhen compared to certain FPS' games in the past and todays time, which both heavily rely on long-winded cutscenes to present the main narrative of the game, Half-Life annihilates this often compulsed aspect, by detailing the plotlines that keeps the player still in control of the first-person viewpoint, leaving the cutscenes rolling while you still have full access to the gameplay and character controllability. For summarization, You will see through the eyes of Gordon Freeman at all times.\n\nThe game is a perpetual maze; leaving the player to work at tasks that involve being locked into battle and overall puzzle solving to advance through the many challenges that wait up ahead. Most of the time, the story illuminates the puzzles by the actions to proceed, such as maze scenarios and building boxes to use as staircases. Although Half-Life has short-lived loading screens from time to time after leaving a certain area for a new one, the game has no levels. But, to make up for this traditional concept, the game is split into a number of mind-boggling chapters filled with rich story and easy adaptability.\n\nTo start off with this game's story, you're none other than Gordon Freeman. A young man who holds a Ph.D in theoretical physics who starts his daily grind back at the Black Mesa Research Facility; a fictional complex that is stranded in a remote desert located in the suburbs of New Mexico. Arriving late for work yet again, you take the tram system around the Black Mesa Research Facility and at this point, objectives that his game has fulfilled such as breath-taking visuals and movie quality animation begins to blossom. The tram sequence at the beginning of the game can only be summed up in one word; Incredible. It's as if the things that come flying at you from every angle and position, almost reminiscent of watching an action-packed movie, along with the credits of the producer's names proudly fading in and out on the corner of the screen.\n\nAs you make your first step in the heavily secured facility, you're constantly reminded that you put on your Hazardous Environmental suit, or the H.E.V suit for short. While all things are hunky-dory, those things soon turn to the worst very soon. After a failed experiment, involving a collision between a rare intergalactic specimen from another dimension with an Anti-Mass Spectrometer, the Black Mesa facility falls in ruins, meaning you are one of the only key survivors of the infamous ''Black Mesa Incident''. And with this, alien life-forms from the dimension of ''Xen'' are pulled from their dimension into ours and are running amok the ruined facility, along with the Army that storm the place after the gone, haywired facility's emergency call has been echoed. This of course doesn't make things any easier and you soon find yourself battling both the aliens and the military.\n\nWhile there isn't exactly much to complain about, I would admit that guiding the chickened-out scientists and professors around the facility can be quite a pain now and again due to some seldom poor AI programming, as well as the alien life-form, Vortigaunt, from which you would have to wait and be patient for them to wreck down wooden doors in front of you, as you are not capable of doing that yourself. (You do start off with a crowbar, right?) As well as I'm probably not the only one who made the same mistake by killing them through a small opening, before they did in fact begin to tear down the doors. But then again, this is where the used scripted intermissions started to show, so that's an added bonus to the magnitude of the game.\n\nFor the long run, I've had fun and joy both reviewing this amazing game and playing this amazing game. If you haven't play Half-Life or even worse, not familiar with Half-Life, it's still a big compulsory  recommendation from me.","timestamp_created":1408390212,"timestamp_updated":1445790555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":198,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.873092472553253174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11767245","author":{"steamid":"76561198065462845","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":3656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3308,"last_played":1643327073},"language":"english","review":"headcrabs 10/10","timestamp_created":1408372337,"timestamp_updated":1408372337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497287511825561523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11767228","author":{"steamid":"76561198060167219","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2000,"last_played":1430261111},"language":"english","review":"tenattaten","timestamp_created":1408372259,"timestamp_updated":1408372259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11760464","author":{"steamid":"76561198070043684","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":16764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":930,"last_played":1620691242},"language":"english","review":"Sexy game.","timestamp_created":1408322150,"timestamp_updated":1408322150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11751223","author":{"steamid":"76561197961161199","num_games_owned":461,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":1753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1752,"last_played":1527422472},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games of all time.

Именно игра, которая получила название, которое впало в душу многим геймерам - Half-Life, именно она стала прорывом в истории игр, ведь она и по сей день сводит с ума всех геймеров планеты, позже ставшая классикой своего жанра. Глубокий сюжет, приличная графика по тем временам, разнообразие врагов, огромные локации - всё это сделало из обычной игры настоящее произведение искусcтва в истории игровой индустрии. Даже на уровне сложности легко, всё было не так то просто, ничто не давало расслабиться геймерам, и на это есть причины: огромное количество врагов, места где главному герою нужно \"изловчиться\", места где надо напрячь свои извилины (при условии если они имеются, хотя бы одна). Именно продолжение ЭТОЙ серии игр многие ждут и по сей день. Данная игра набрала тысячи фанатов по всей планете, привела Valve к успеху, и именно она дала начало другим великолемным играм, кто играл в эту великую игру поймёт о чём я повествую, ну а кто не играл, чтож...

You could have called it School Simulator based on the way the physics and heavy scripted sequences play out, because its all the same shit over and over and over and over and over and over and beginning and over and middle and end and thesis statement and supporting evidence and over and introduction and conclusions. That's how I feel when I play That 70s Show: The Video Game. However the one thing that makes this game stand apart from the other god awful shit-faced genre we've come to know as \"dunkstin checks in baddadum baddadum dunkstin checks in\", is in-game Youtube Browser and Video Downloader. It makes stealing other youtuber's content for reupload easier than ever before! Like, I have NO IDEA how I ever would have made it to the point in my youtube career I am at now without this game. Anyways, I guess this game is OKAY if you compare it to LoL or Wolfenstein 3D, but what it comes down to, is Fozilla Mirefox is a better game and it comes with a Twitch stealer that can rebroadcast other peoples twitch streams so that you can get the revenue.
