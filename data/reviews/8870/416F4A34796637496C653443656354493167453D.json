I felt like some f*cking dude was putting a gun to my head forcing to finish the game because it had Bioshock in the title and that means im entitiled to f*cking play this saggy dogs testes. I loved the original Bioshock and the second a little less but i still did. but infinite is speical It takes you to the flying city of colombia and for starters what the F*CK, Colombia why the fuck colombia and its flying. fucking RAPTUReEmakes more sense than this dog shit and Rapture is like 2000 meters under the f*cking water. Ok lets get to the stuff that matters, NPCs. Bioshock had almost no interaction with characters that are you know not fucking insane thats what made it fun. So once you see Andrew Ryan your like holy shit a fucking person thats awesome. Same with the second game. But this doesnt happen in this as*f*ck you have to deal with this \"big titty bimble f*ck\"- Videogamedunkey the whole intire time. I was told i would like her however I just ended up hating her has I player. Ok next topic the Bioshock title. It has nothing to do with Rapture. Spoilers kinda so skip this part, The only part is at the end and thats still gay. Once i did get to that Rapture part I nutted out of my mouth and Dick because I was slowly dieing by this sh*t game and seeing Rapture gave me some sort of hope. This game should be called A*sf*ck infinite because it f*cks you in the as* infinitley, Original Bio had its times when it would ass fuck you by blocking a pass but thats f*cking rare compared to this game every fucking mission some shit that goes wrong and you get have to do a mission to do that mission and so on. Another thing to add. The plot makes no fucking sense throughout the game i felt like I was never progressing because the enemies never got harder also it just sucked. I had no motivation to pay attetieon to the story. And the story is confussing with this multi universe shit. If you kill the dude you killed him alright great. Another spoilers than at the end I was left confussed because It seemed as Elizibith turned out to be my daughter and that gave me 10 pounds of guilt because I nutted to her once. I mean holy shit there is so much porn for this freak. Ok my fingers are getting tired and I got school tommorow so ima stop here. I shouldnt waste my time reviewing this shit game.

А такая она по многим причинам и в основном из за смены места действия игры. Из глубин города Восторг мы поднимаемся наверно в самый красивый игровой город Колумбия. Из за такой смены действий игры многим она не понравилась (в основном главным фанатам за рубежом) у нас же игра получила восторженные отзывы от критиков! Что касается меня, мне игра очень понравилась и лично моё мнение это наверно самая лучшая часть серии. Почему? Ответ прост! Самый запутанный и из за этого интересный сюжет и что самое главное (лично для меня в этой игре) так это очаровательная спутница Элизабет которая покорила не только моё сердце, но и сердца многих игроков)!! Геймплей игры отходит от канона. Если действие предыдущих игр серии происходило в закрытых помещениях города Восторг, уровни BioShock Infinite чаще представляют собой открытые пространства, что придаёт игровому процессу большую динамичность. Теперь вы не сможете носить с собой целую гору оружия и всё что вы можете взять так это 2 пушки. Препарат Адам так и остался только изменены способности и теперь процесс приёма Адама идёт не через шприц как это было в предыдущих играх серии, а просто принимаете его как напиток. Одно из самых главных новвоведений в игре магнитный крюк и порталы Элизабет с помощью которых игровой процесс становится ещё интересней и динамичный. Графика и оптимизация игры прост она высоте из за чего игра тянет с высокой графикой даже на калькуляторах! И осталось ответить на вопрос стоит ли брать игру в 2019 году? Я отвечу что стоит, учитывая цену игры по скидке и просто незабываемые эмоции от процесса прохождения + советую купить DLC к игре, так вы сможете полностью понять сюжет и связь между всеми сериями игры.
