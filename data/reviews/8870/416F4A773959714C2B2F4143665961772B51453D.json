Я думал, что лицензия будет без косяков (хотя бы почти), как тут все пишут в обзорах.\n\nЯ ошибался.\n\nСо всеми частями возникли нехилые проблемы, от локализации до невероятных багов. Так как тут должен быть обзор только на Infinite, то напишу только про него.\nДа, восторженные отзывы можете почитать где-нибудь ещё, но не здесь. Игра действительно классная. Я прошёл около половины, и в один прекрасный день она просто перестала запускаться.

Gawd dayum. This game is a trip. I had actually tried to play it a couple years ago, but didn't get into it. I randomly decided to play all 3 Bioshocks. 1 and 2 were amazing games, but felt older. They felt a little more clunky, though not as much as other similar games (Lookin' at you Metro 1/2). This game though... Oof. \n\nThe graphics are stunning. Quite so. Gorgeous effects, lighting, textures, you name it. It also ran really well on my mid-range system, only dropping frames enough to notice it a few times, and it was never enough to make me lower the settings. \nThe story is... odd. It starts and for most of the game is quite simple to follow, then it gets... different. Odd, and a little confusing. It ends on a sort of cliff hanger-y weird note. The last hour of the game is a whirlwind. \nThe gameplay is fantastic. I played on Hard, as I do with every game, and this game was definitely harder than Bioshock 1 & 2. Bioshock 1 was honestly pretty easy once you get used to how it plays. Bioshock 2 was in my opinion, a little easier yet, -except- for fighting Big Sisters. This one offers a smoother, more fluid experience. You do more damage, but you also take more damage. That said, most of the enemies in this game need to swarm you to really put a hurting on you. Except those big stupid ass robo-monkey things. \n\nThis game has set the Bioshock franchise up for endless possibilities, and I hope they take advantage of it. The -only- thing I wish is that the game was longer. \n\nEasily a 9/10 game.","timestamp_created":1584735383,"timestamp_updated":1584735383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65421368","author":{"steamid":"76561198280627571","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":472,"last_played":1584735239},"language":"russian","review":"Концовка просто рвет ебало","timestamp_created":1584734970,"timestamp_updated":1584734970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65420512","author":{"steamid":"76561198961914823","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1584739833},"language":"russian","review":"Концовка пушка!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1584734106,"timestamp_updated":1584734106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65420460","author":{"steamid":"76561198041241577","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":266,"last_played":1586521733},"language":"english","review":"rippa game,  hard to find a good story shooter. most importantly its unique, not another massproduced generic game.\nI've played all of the Bioshocks, and so far this is very enjoyable despite the change in atmosphere","timestamp_created":1584734052,"timestamp_updated":1584734052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65419358","author":{"steamid":"76561198311148725","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":865,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":865,"last_played":1584731633},"language":"german","review":"Eine der besten Geschichten, die ich je in einem Videospiel gesehen habe.
