Игра больше выглядит сырой, чем она на самом деле, потому что мы привыкли называть сырыми Beta-версии продуктов, а Portal малость самую отшлифована от Beta-набросков. Если вы присмотритесь к детищам Valve в момент развития плода, вы обнаружите: все они толком мрачные, с вкраплениями крипоты, что ли. Вальвовская игра в порталы сохранила ту жесткую интригу, местами пугающее окружение и легкий привкус неизданного когда-либо. Я старался максимально донести, какую ценность представляет Portal в библиотеке разработчика и в коллекции любого уважающего себя нёрда, но я почти уверен, что мой язык не понятен и, коль так, вам остается только прочувствовать это на себе. Переигрывая Portal вновь, мне видится все тот же \"сырой\" некий кусок, но мои куриные мозги на сей раз приводят к тому, что данная игра и должна такой быть. Будь она не сырой, она была бы не такой самобытной, что сказалось бы на восприятии минимум.\n\nА еще тут оперная певица в конце поет НЕоперу.

Esta engine caracteriza-se por adequar-se a todas as qualidades de hardware, o que significa que tanto utilizadores de computadores mais limitados como de máquinas poderosas conseguem desfrutar das experiências criadas com a mesma.\n\nIsto não quer dizer que os visuais sejam de má qualidade, muito pelo contrário.

Isto obriga o jogador a aprender uma nova e impressionante maneira de pensar (a famosa expressão \"think with portals\"). Ensinar isto aos jogadores é o que o Portal faz magnificamente; o jogo é uma demonstração do mais elevado nível de design de tutoriais.\n\nOs puzzles são desafiantes, mas são ensinados ao jogador os conhecimentos necessários para os resolver e o jogo requer mais reflexão e exercício do cérebro que a maioria.\n\nQuanto à duração, o jogo é bastante curto, tendo-me levado cerca de 4 horas para completar, mas divertido o suficiente para jogar mais algumas vezes. Existem tambem mapas de bónus mais desafiantes.

While it released quietly in 2007, I am hard-pressed to think of a game that deserves tons of attention as this one should. A brilliant puzzle game, with dark humor and challenging ideas. I would definitely recommend this game to people searching for a challenge. The end level is especially difficult [spoiler](GLaDOS begins a neurotoxin countdown as you rush to destroy her with cores)[/spoiler] and the game is a bit short as well, but it is absolutely worth the measly 10 bucks. If you've got some extra Steam credit, this a definite reccomendation.","timestamp_created":1473624271,"timestamp_updated":1473624271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25468317","author":{"steamid":"76561198061824645","num_games_owned":328,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":354,"last_played":1414245643},"language":"english","review":"Everyone knows this game is good.\n\nIt can be finished in an afternoon, but if you get it for a good price it'll be one of those games you finish and sit back with a grin on your face.

Initially, I didn’t like it very much. I found it a bit boring and I felt locked up in this environment, unable to explore. Only after my third attempt to get back to the game I realized I was approaching it with the wrong perspective. I changed my attitude and decided to roleplay the character. It became a puzzle, horror, comedy world for me and I love it. The visuals are great for its time, the physics are well implemented and the puzzles were just hard enough to push me to beat them all. It took me less than ten hours to complete the game, but I enjoyed my frustration, discovery and success moments equally. I’m looking forward for the sequel.","timestamp_created":1473611595,"timestamp_updated":1473611595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602638483047485352","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25465083","author":{"steamid":"76561198069949533","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2264,"last_played":1633551770},"language":"english","review":"I find this game good for speed running.
