If you're trying to experience all HL games like I am then sure go for it. But if you enjoyed HL and think this will be as good then you'll probably be upset. While it does feature a lot of elements from HL such as physics puzzles, winding corridors, and military ambushes it lacks in story as 90% of it is just Barney trying to escape Black Mesa with a detour of going into Xen. It does also feature a lot of bugs, one you'll probably run into is when the game refuses to load when going down the elevator to pick up the power cell. There are also some broken scripted events here and there but they can be fixed by just reloading your game.\n\nIf you are looking for a good expansion to Half Life then I recommend Opposing Force.

Si los vimos en Opposing Force, ¿por qué aquí no? Y si con todo lo que ofreció el primer juego salía un nudo que realmente no daba para más, yo no hubiera descartado artillería ni tipos malos que estaban presentes en éste. Así, tal vez hubiera sido algo más chungo de pasárselo (Blue Shift), independientemente de la dificultad escogida y no hubiera dado tanto la sensación de escasez de contenido.\n\nSin embargo, pocos son los jugadores que he visto (y no quiero decir que nos los haya) que miren más allá de pegar tiros, cumplir objetivos y resguardar aliados para luego exigir más contenido con tal de prolongar dicha rutina y finalmente decidir si saldría a cuenta rascarse un poco el bolsillo. Creo que no se le da importancia que debería a lo importante que resulta Blue Shift a la hora de hablar de los inicios de Black Mesa como centro de investigación (su punto fuerte por excelencia) y si nos ponemos pragmáticos, a que gracias a él, hemos obtenido importantes actualizaciones gráficas en los tres primeros títulos (sin tener en cuenta Decay, ya que salió exclusiva y oficialmente para PlayStation 2), al ser el que trajo consigo el pack en alta definición. Si hay algo que adoro de los videojuegos, es la oportunidad de investigar sobre todo lo que los envuelve dentro de una crónica y me congratula que Blue Shift no sea una excepción: en varias ocasiones, se encuentra maquinaria inservible de aspecto realmente anticuado o tirada de cualquier manera en los almacenes de las instalaciones y por si esto fuera poco, el desenlace de este juego tiene lugar en unos laboratorios de teletransporte también muy deteriorados por vejez, lo que me induce a interpretarlo como que termina donde empezó absolutamente todo.\n\nEs evidente que Half-Life es mucho más que \"toma un arma y que te diviertas\", pero por ser un juego que alude a la historia de los laboratorios que marcarían el inicio de un lore tan fascinante con repetida frecuencia, que esconda numerosos Easter Eggs en súmamente pocos capítulos, que el número de hostilidades en cada sección no sea precisamente bajo a proporción de su lacónica duración y obligue al jugador a dosificar la munición por muy debiluchos que X dificultad haga a los enemigos y en el que aparecen rostros familiares como el DR. Freeman, G-Man y Gina Cross, entre muchos otros pros que merece la pena puntualizar que superan en número a sus contras, Half-Life: Blue Shift es mi favorito de toda la serie.\n\n¡RECOMENDADO PARA LOS MÁS DEVOTOS AL MUNDILLO DE HALF-LIFE Y A LOS AMANTES DE LOS SHOOTERS QUE COMPARTAN MI PUNTO DE VISTA SOBRE LO QUE CONOCEMOS POR \"JUGAR A UN VIDEOJUEGO\"!","timestamp_created":1591048444,"timestamp_updated":1591048444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508294165134429932","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70159543","author":{"steamid":"76561197989815082","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1483,"last_played":1591872993},"language":"english","review":"great love it","timestamp_created":1591038547,"timestamp_updated":1591038547,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509493708610534668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70159360","author":{"steamid":"76561198111248070","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1654636680},"language":"english","review":"5/5","timestamp_created":1591038279,"timestamp_updated":1591038279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70146272","author":{"steamid":"76561198845344519","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":105,"playtime_forever":117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":117,"last_played":1591018932},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1591019005,"timestamp_updated":1591019005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70122268","author":{"steamid":"76561198201709110","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":152,"last_played":1499625154},"language":"spanish","review":"Buena expansión de hl1 donde manejas a un guardia de Black Mesa y tendrás que escapar de los laboratorios infectados de zombies y aliens para poder vivir.
