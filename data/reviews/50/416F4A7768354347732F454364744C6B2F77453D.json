Of course we have some weapons coming back from Half Life; like the 9mm pistol; or how about the shotgun.

The only problems I have with the game is some features that aren't really told to the player; Like how you could climb up robes and cords n' such. I'm not sure if they talked about this in the Boot camp, but whatever.

Obviously it's recommended that you play Half-Life before playing this expansion. New weapons and monsters are introduced as you fight your way through Black Mesa during the incident infamously started by Gordon Freeman. Of course, the game is old and doesn't hold up graphically, but the gameplay is still pretty tight. It feels more like a corridor shoot-em-up than a continuation of any story, as it's told from a different perspective of an event we already know about.\n\n[h1]My Full Review[/h1]\nI recommend this game overall to any active or soon to be Half-Life fans. If you're looking to learn something new about the story, this isn't it. This expansion is more dedicated to the gun play than anything else. The puzzles aren't too hard to figure out, and the environments aren't anything you haven't really seen in Half-Life. The encounters are quite brutal and a lot of trial and error is involved.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThere are plenty of new weapons to use as you make your way through the game. With more weapons comes a LOT of enemies per level. You'll spend a lot of time using cover and peeking to get shots off on some of the tough enemies, as they tend to sponge a lot of damage and hit hard.\n\nPuzzles are present, however they aren't too difficult. I suggest learning how to crouch jump if you're not familiar, because there are a lot of areas that assume you'd know how to do this. There are some sections that aren't immediately obvious as to what you should do either, so keep an eye on all of your options on how to traverse a situation.\n\nThe game is obviously old and you'll notice parts that are rough around the edges, most notably when interacting with ropes, the grapple hook, physics interactions, and the AI. My biggest issue was the boss fight. After fighting your way to the end, the boss fight is laughably easy and kind of boring.\n\n[h1]Story / Plot[/h1]\nYou're playing in the perspective of Adrian Shepard, a US Marine Corporal who's assigned to the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit. You don't receive the full briefing of your upcoming mission and end up running through Black Mesa during the infamous incident started by Gordon Freeman from Half-Life.\n\nThe gameplay doesn't translate to the story very well, as it's as simple as, \"Adrian fights his way out of Black Mesa.\" You'll see plenty of easter eggs and nods to the first Half-Life to help indicate the timeline of events. Otherwise, there's not much to say about this game for the story. You'll be playing Half-Life: Opposing Force for the gameplay more than anything. If you're not interested in more Half-Life gameplay as much as more story, I suggest just looking up a synopsis on YouTube.\n\n[h1]Graphics / Audio[/h1]\nFor a game initially released in 1999, it's understandable that the graphics and audio aren't going to hold up to standards found in 2020. With that aside, the graphics are still quite interesting as they were in Half-Life. I did find it pretty obvious as to which assets were added in Half-Life: Opposing Force, because they had a different feel about them that didn't quite match Half-Life in some ways. The graphics overall hold a fantastic grungy sci-fi aesthetic and work perfectly for the game.\n\nThe audio is... not good. It absolutely doesn't hold up in any way. The sounds are definitely nostalgic and worked well for the time, but the voices sound strangely robotic and the guns are obnoxious. There's also a moment towards the end in a storage facility where boxes are moving on a rail, and the sound gets so loud that all other sounds distorted unpleasantly. Audio isn't the strong suit in this game, or any of the original Half-Life games.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nPick this game up if you really enjoyed the gameplay found in Half-Life. If you're looking for additional story material, there's not much here that warrants the playtime. Expect the old age of this game to provide some rough moments, but take time to appreciate the craft of the past. Half-Life was no easy feat, and even today, it still shows.\n\n[h1]Please Rate This Review[/h1]\nI spend a lot of time breaking down game design and development from a critical consumer's perspective.
