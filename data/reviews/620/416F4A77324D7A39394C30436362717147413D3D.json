It's got everything you need in a game without smothering you with nonsense.\n\nYou play as Chell, our wonderful mute protagonist from the first Portal game. After who knows how long in extended relaxation, you're awakened by Wheatley, a personality construct in charge of the Relaxation Wing. He needs your help to escape the facility, saying you're the only human left who can help him. You embark on an adventure through the decaying remains of Aperture to help with his poorly planned escape. However, due to Wheatley's incompetence, you accidentally wake up GLaDOS, the homicidal super A.I. that hunted you down in the last game. And she's not the least bit happy to see you. Friends become enemies, enemies become reluctant allies, and you literally climb your way out of the past by solving puzzles with the amazing physics defying portal device to escape the facility and keep it from exploding.\n\nWhile some may find this game short, it's actually pretty relaxed in how it functions. There is no one way to complete a puzzle. There is the way the guides tell you, and then there is a thousand other possibilities. Anything is possible in the halls of Aperture Science. No matter how insane it sounds. There really can't be a lot said for the gameplay. Enter portal, exit portal is all there really is. But the way it's expanded is brilliant. How you solve a puzzle can be an adventure in itself. Especially when you discover the Rat Dens...\n\nThe best part of this game is the story. There has always been more to Aperture Science and GLaDOS than meets the eye. Now, you get to learn her tragic history while also learning about the origins of the company itself. It's both funny and sad at the same time. You find yourself sympathizing with the insane computer that tried to kill you in the first game and in a round about way, help her find peace.\n\nFriends ask me if I hope for a Portal 3. Honestly, I don't. Why? Because this game gave Chell the perfect ending to her story. And that's where it needs to stay. \n\nThe voice acting...oh, how can I talk about this game without talking about the voice acting? Of course, Ellen McLain once again gives a knock-out performance as GLaDOS. This time, she's joined by British comedian Stephen Merchant voicing Wheatley, and J.K. Simmons voicing the prerecorded messages of Cave Johnson (the founder of Aperture Science). Also, legendary voice actor Dee Bradley Baker doing the voices (or sounds, rather) for Atlas and P-Body, the co-op bots.\n\nI didn't do a good job reviewing the game before. I really only put one sentence because I wanted the Steam achievement. But coming back years later, I should have done this game more justice. This is a game you will remember for a very long time. You will find yourself revisiting this game and remembering why you loved it so much. This game means a lot to me and it will continue to do so for years to come.","timestamp_created":1365816729,"timestamp_updated":1653001259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5047997","author":{"steamid":"76561198044518553","num_games_owned":760,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1632,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1199,"last_played":1576531075},"language":"english","review":"Amazing gameplay, really beautiful graphics!
