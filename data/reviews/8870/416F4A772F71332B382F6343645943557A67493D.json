Şahsen sevmediğim bir hikaye tipi barındırıyor. Çoklu evren mantıklı senaryoları ne beyaz perdede ne oyunlarda beğenmişimdir. Bana kafa karıştırıcı olmasından öte hiç ilgi çekici gelmiyor da. Yani ben bir evrende marangozken başka birinde asker diğerinde terörist diğerinde kahraman olabiliyorum ve bu sonsuza kadar gidiyor. Eee? Dahası, hikaye anlatımı bence berbat.

Savaş sırasında canınız, merminiz azalırsa bunları sağlıyor ve diğer evrenlerden size yardımı dokunabilecek araç gereç yaratabiliyor. En iyi yanı onu korumak zorunda değilsiniz. Genel olarak oyun önünüze geleni öldürmekten ibaret. Yani fazla bir şey beklemeyin. Özel güçleriniz de çok özel hissettirmiyor doğrusu. Bütün oyun boyunca onları hiç kullanmasanız bile değişen bir şey olmaz. Öyle ki ben onların varlığını bile unutup uzun süre kullanmadığım için oyun bana “güçlerini kullan” diye uyarı veriyordu. Aslında bu çok büyük bir eksi. Peki neden tavsiye ediyorum? Şöyle ki; ben çok oyun oynayan biriyim. Açık dünya, rpg, şu bu… Bu tarz çerezlik oyunları bazen araya sıkıştırmak hoşuma gidiyor.

it's a Bioshock game, it only has loose ties to the first two (and even then only at the very end) so you don't need to have played them.  If you have played the first two, then consider that this game is quite different than the first two so if you didn't like them, you might like Infinite.  Or if you liked the first two, you might not like this one. I personally think all three are okay, but i find Infinite to easily be the worst of the three.\n\nThe villain is the same, holier \"I'm the greatest and you are nothing\" kind as the first two though this one has a religious and racist bent to them.  Also, it seems it wouldn't be a Bioshock game without having some sort of twist/revelation.  Not everything needs to have some big twist/revelation and after the first two Bioshock games (three if you count Minerva's Den DLC for Bioshock 2), I was just waiting for the twist (at this point, the biggest twist for me would be no twist.\n\nYou have your Plasmids (called Vigors now) and for the most part I didn't enjoy them like the other Bioshocks.  Sure, using Possession to control enemies or get more money was fun as were things like sending crows after everyone, but nothing excited me like the interactivity of the plasmids in the prior games.  Sure, you had a fire plasmid and oil spills, but unlike combat in the prior games where you were mostly in small rooms or corridors where it was easy to use the environment (i.e. shock the water or fire on oil), combat in Infinite took place in a lot of open areas where it was just simpler to shoot someone.  Also, you no longer had tonics to find/buy, instead you find gear (clothes) to equip for boosts.  You can find them easily, but what you get is completely random so you have to know what you want and be prepared to save/reload to get it.\n\nWhich brings my two big issues: saving, map and combat.  You can no longer save whenever you want, instead it's a checkpoint system only.  This is a pain for those of us with limited time as you never know when a good spot to quit is.  I've had to redo several fights just because of this.  Worse, if you do things for achievements (i.e. look at viewers), you might forget that you have to do it again.  Second, the map of the first two games (which I liked as I could easily see where I was and where I've been so I could find all secrets) is gone - so you pretty much have to remember what you did (particularly when looking for vox codes/keys for chests and where to use them).  Combat now has mostly been reduced to: go to a large area, fight group of enemies (with some okay tactical options to move around), move to the next area and repeat.  Honestly, looking back, the corridors of the prior games were probably mindless in comparison, but at least I found it fun.\n\nAlso, I found the default key bindings to be terrible for me and not very intuitive.  The mouse sensitivity sucked and no matter how much I played with it, I couldn't find a comfortable level. \n\nThe only real positive i have is that the game ran fine for me on Linux with no crashes or any need for Proton.\n\nOverall, I can't really recommend the game.  However, the game is old enough and cheap enough that you can give it a try - I know I seem to be in the minority that didn't care for it (or I should say I don't regret my time playing, but I wouldn't return to it).","timestamp_created":1614543487,"timestamp_updated":1614543710,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525619387626647949","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87628564","author":{"steamid":"76561199087456956","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1616895841},"language":"latam","review":"Más bueno que el pan, lo tenía pirata y es tan bueno que me compre toda la saga y los DLC una, joyita","timestamp_created":1614541785,"timestamp_updated":1614541785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87627212","author":{"steamid":"76561198865213815","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":598,"last_played":1614547903},"language":"spanish","review":"Haber me compre el pack que venian todos los bioshock y mi favorito es este de los 3 porque, porque esta boenardo la verdad buena historia, buenos logros un juego algo desafiante pero no tanto y muy buen shoter recomendado","timestamp_created":1614540128,"timestamp_updated":1614540128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87625922","author":{"steamid":"76561198098135851","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":5113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3016,"last_played":1658008558},"language":"english","review":"A different kind of Bioshock but it impressively completes the series.
