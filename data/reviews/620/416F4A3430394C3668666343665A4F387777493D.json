The mechanics are simple and easy to learn in of themselves, but it's the way you combine them which creates the complexity in these test chambers. I played Portal 2 before Portal 1, and I had absolutely no problem comprehending the story and learning the mechanics, many of which aren't in the original game. I would say it's completely fine to play the second one before the first, but playing them in order provides a richer experience in which you really get to appreciate the details and story of the game. \n\nStory\n------\nI'm not going to reveal any spoilers here, but I will say that it is much more in-depth than the first one. It feels like the flesh and meat of the story as a whole, while the first game was more of an introduction/exposition. So much of the backstory behind the forming of Aperture is revealed, and the few characters that exist are developed so much more. The humor is just as excellent as in Portal 1, yet actually above and beyond, keeping the atmosphere light while not turning it into a comedy show. GLaDOS' voice lines and insults are very entertaining, and worth listening to. There is also a lot of visual storytelling that takes place through this game, showing how Aperture has deteriorated over the years. Probably the best story I've ever experienced. \n\nAtmosphere/Graphics\n-----------------------\nThe atmosphere is one of my favorite parts about this game. You explore through the ruins of Aperture Laboratories, seeing the overgrowth that has taken over the facility and the ruins of machinery, but still noticing how the facility is keeping itself alive by a hair. Even though this game was made in 2011, it still holds up amazingly today, and the experience is not tarnished a single bit by its age. The characters also have extreme depth and charm to them which really makes you care about them, especially for being robots, and in GLaDOS' case, only having an eye and head movement to express emotion. Portal 2's voice acting is also excellent with an incredible cast of voice actors who really fit the characters they are expressing. In case you're wondering, GLaDOS does get an improvement in her voice, having much more emotion and life. Chell's voice actor was amazing as well. Between the massive sense of scale and the creaking, groaning sounds of aging metal in the background, this game makes an amazingly immersive and awe-inspiring atmosphere that truly engrosses you in this mechanical world. \n\nGameplay\n-----------\nThis game eases you into the puzzles, gradually increasing the difficulty over time. There are a few challenging puzzles that I got stuck on for a while, but that's probably just my minuscule IQ at work. Overall, the puzzles themselves are very enjoyable and it feels amazing when everything finally settles into place and clicks in. And no experience in games at all is required in this, because it mainly uses very simple mechanics and controls that are easy to learn. But I do wish, however, that some puzzles were a little easier or there were a few less, as some parts dragged on slightly.\n\nCo-op\n-------\nCo-op is the more light-hearted side of Portal 2, focused mainly on gameplay, but it still does include some story. There are six main courses of test chambers, and a free dlc which takes place after the main courses are finished. GLaDOS remains just as sarcastically insulting and charming, and the two robots you play as, ATLAS and P-body, both have their own surprisingly alive and distinct personalities which are expressed solely through the eight different gestures you can perform, which are unlocked as you progress. I had a blast playing through this with my friend, and we got to mess around with each other a ton, which is always a plus in my books.\n\nPrice\n-----\nI would recommend buying this on a sale, as you can get Portal 1 and 2 in a bundle for only $3. However, the regular price is still a fair one, and it's not a bad choice to get it at full price.\n\nConclusion\n------------\nThis has been one of the only games that have truly struck a chord with me and made me THINK during and after I played it. It has an incredible atmosphere, fun and engaging gameplay, and a story and characters who make you laugh, feel sad or happy, and make you forget you're playing a game about fictional, sentient robots. It's definitely a must-see experience, and I think everyone who has at least some interest in games, storytelling, or problem-solving should give this game a try.\n\nRating: 10/10","timestamp_created":1610851188,"timestamp_updated":1610851188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84824879","author":{"steamid":"76561198826907613","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1650769376},"language":"english","review":"suimcide","timestamp_created":1610850154,"timestamp_updated":1610850154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84824821","author":{"steamid":"76561198163464707","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":768,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":768,"last_played":1533159850},"language":"english","review":"Nothing equates to the story or history of Portal, I remember when the first game came out and every youtube channel was playing it. \nI don't like platform games at all, I find them redundant and annoying at best.

Le centre de recherche duquel vous essayez de vous échapper a été construit dans le but d'exploiter une nouvelle technologie indispensable pour vaincre les extraterrestres.\n\nGraphismes: Il n'y a pas photo. Ils sont de meilleure qualité que Portal 1. Le moteur graphique a été optimisé c'est évident. Les textures sont sympa et la physique est réaliste.\n\nGameplay: Il est le même que son prédecesseur. A l'aide de votre fusil à portails vous pourrez vous transporter n'importe ou à condition d'avoir les surfaces adéquates bien sûr.\n\nDurée de vie: Gros plus par rapport à Portal 1 qui avait une faible durée de vie.\nIci, comptez 10 h pour finir la campagne solo, 10 h pour finir la campagne coop, car oui il y a bien une deuxiéme campagne totalement différente et destinée à être jouée avec un ami et enfin comptez 10h de plus pour finir tous les succés.\n30h au total donc.\n\nDifficulté: L'essence de Portal repose sur la reflexion et la résolution des puzzles. Donc tout dépendra de votre capacité à faire fonctionner vos méninges.\n\nPrix: Gros gros point positif!\nSeulement 2 euros en soldes. Autant dire qu'il ne coute rien!\n\nEn résumé, Portal 2 est la suite de Portal 1 sur tous les niveaux. \nPlus long, de meilleure facture, Valve a vraiment fait un gros travail. Merci à eux.\nAu vu du prix, achetez le les yeux fermés!","timestamp_created":1610826196,"timestamp_updated":1610826196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84807263","author":{"steamid":"76561198393685660","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":725,"last_played":1612540838},"language":"english","review":"game good. play it. if you've played it play it again.","timestamp_created":1610825846,"timestamp_updated":1610825846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84807237","author":{"steamid":"76561198798934402","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1759,"last_played":1610897225},"language":"english","review":"this game is too good","timestamp_created":1610825801,"timestamp_updated":1610825801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84806783","author":{"steamid":"76561198981550688","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1627321500},"language":"turkish","review":"SARRIYOOOOOO\n","timestamp_created":1610825264,"timestamp_updated":1610825264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84806770","author":{"steamid":"76561198817061254","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1406,"last_played":1655570454},"language":"brazilian","review":"Na minha opinião, esse é o melhor jogo de puzzle já feito.
