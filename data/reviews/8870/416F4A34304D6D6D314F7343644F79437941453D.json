The story follows many of the strengths of the original Bioshock, but goes even deeper than before. All too often games that deal in quantum physics and science fiction get lost plot holes and contrivances, but Bioshock Infinite welcomes speculation and the more you think about what's happening the more you respect all the details the writers added to the story. While there aren't too many permanent characters throughout the game, Elizabeth is easily one of the best written female characters in gaming. I couldn't possibly list half the things I loved about this game without spoiling it, but this is a game I could recommend to anyone.\n \nComing back to the actual mechanics of the game, the graphics are phenomenal. They run well on mid-range cards and rely on beautiful art design and animation to make Columbia one of the most beautiful venues in video games yet. The music is appropriate, but the rest of the sound design (in Bioshock fashion) is excellent, and many of the audio logs are simply chilling. Voice acting is for the most part top-notch. \n\nIf I have a complaint about Bioshock infinite, it's in the combat. Enemy AI is fairly basic and enemy variety is a bit wanting. The vigors are nice, but not as varied or powerful as before. That being said, the setting is much more open and diverse than the previous games. Still, truth be told, I preferred the original game's combat a little bit. Nonetheless, while this isn't a \"flawless\" game, it is a masterpiece, and it will be looked back on as an important step in gaming. It shows that there are still developers out there who look to their game as a piece of art and are willing to push boundaries.","timestamp_created":1561927443,"timestamp_updated":1561927443,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52598008","author":{"steamid":"76561198168311093","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7246,"last_played":1561927064},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo otimo,um dos melhores em primeira pessoa!","timestamp_created":1561927256,"timestamp_updated":1561927256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52595369","author":{"steamid":"76561198059341330","num_games_owned":397,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1672,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":914,"last_played":1632770803},"language":"german","review":"Still a very nice game in 2019!!","timestamp_created":1561926900,"timestamp_updated":1561926900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570932447910308838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52594681","author":{"steamid":"76561197969196544","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1567198461},"language":"english","review":"Awesome, you'll love if you loved bioshock","timestamp_created":1561926814,"timestamp_updated":1561926814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52589944","author":{"steamid":"76561197986040266","num_games_owned":275,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1364886000},"language":"english","review":"It just bullet sponge the game with a story that has more holes then Swiss cheese","timestamp_created":1561926220,"timestamp_updated":1561926220,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467836260795593262","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52586450","author":{"steamid":"76561198000112714","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1697,"last_played":1581539271},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite games ever.
