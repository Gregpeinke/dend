Хоть по строению она довольно таки простая (пара реплик, комната с головоломкой), она сделана качественно.\n[h1]Плюсы[/h1]\n1) [b]Уровни[/b], по стилистике они практически одинаковы, однако большинство уровней заставляют реально задуматься, о решении.\n2) [b]Юмор[/b]: он здесь присутствует, и довольно таки неплохой. Правда в [b]сиквеле[/b], его достаточно больше.\n3) [b]Сюжет[/b]: Он интересен, и сделан не на отвяжись.\n4) [b]Геймплей[/b]: Как по мне является [b]эталоном[/b] всех головоломок.\n5) [b]Локализация[/b]: сделано довольно таки добротно (кроме озвучки).\n6) [b]Саундтрек[/b]: атмосферный, напрягающий.\n[h1]Минусы[/h1]\n1) [b]Озвучка русской локализации[/b]: Она не такая ужасная как в Mass Effect 1, но и одновременно не шоколад. Сейчас поясню:\nЯ буду придираться не к голосу актрисы, которую обработали. Проблема другая. [b]Интонация[/b] - она озвучена с головы до ног, вся [b]одной[/b] интонацией.  Троллинг в сторону Челл не такой убедительный, модули озвучены также как и Гладос, что становиться не понятно, кто-что из них хочет сказать, когда Гладос, и модуль (тортика или любопытства) говорят параллельно друг с другом. В общем, хотите услышать нормальную озвучку ? Переводите в настройках игры озвучку на английскую, включайте субтитры и играете.\n[h1] Итог[/h1]\nPortal 1 - вообще является технодемкой, а не полной игрой. Поэтому она короткая.\n[h1]Оценка[/h1]\n9/10 - за короткость игры, и ужасную озвучку.","timestamp_created":1388412484,"timestamp_updated":1566639747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504727602005004883","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8427643","author":{"steamid":"76561198115305019","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":443,"last_played":1527404318},"language":"english","review":"Score: 10.0\n\nGreat puzzle game, the idea is original and even though it doesn't look the best, let's be honest, they spent way more time doing the physics for a brand new idea than desining pretty textures.","timestamp_created":1388411829,"timestamp_updated":1388411829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8427612","author":{"steamid":"76561198023007646","num_games_owned":570,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":280,"last_played":1388661045},"language":"russian","review":"Охрененная игрушка!!!

The story is that you play the role of a test subject, Chell, trapped in an abandoned building known as Apature Science. A mysterious voice instructs you to go through several test chambers with the use of a portal gun, a device that can shoot portals in order to teleport one place to another. So it all relies on your skill and brain power in order to escape Apature alive, while enjoying some cake for your victory... maybe. As the name states, the game is all about portals. Wether it be using portals to get to a higher area, or to get a weighted cube to hold down a switch, it's always fun to just mess around with the portal gun. There are 19 Levels and most of the puzzles are pretty easy, so it's a short game. There are also advanced maps and time trials that'll keep ya busy if you think the game is too easy. While it's sequel is much more popular, it's predecessor is still fun to play.","timestamp_created":1388348754,"timestamp_updated":1388348754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.717234373092651367","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8406637","author":{"steamid":"76561198084025501","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1388348178},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра","timestamp_created":1388348421,"timestamp_updated":1388348421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8406006","author":{"steamid":"76561198099991911","num_games_owned":1535,"num_reviews":107,"playtime_forever":153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":153,"last_played":1388346204},"language":"english","review":"simply wonderful.. smart, humorous, intense and great fun!!!!","timestamp_created":1388347218,"timestamp_updated":1388347218,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497942358255386353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8404461","author":{"steamid":"76561198097544600","num_games_owned":701,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1388343879},"language":"english","review":"This is a 'must have'.","timestamp_created":1388344125,"timestamp_updated":1388344125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8404430","author":{"steamid":"76561198087625250","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":94,"last_played":1400956155},"language":"english","review":"Bought the portal bundle, (Valve got scammed).","timestamp_created":1388344073,"timestamp_updated":1388344073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5189095139503479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8402759","author":{"steamid":"76561198119577017","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":466,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":446,"last_played":1388255519},"language":"english","review":"Finally got to play it and it was well worth the wait!","timestamp_created":1388341004,"timestamp_updated":1388341004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8400859","author":{"steamid":"76561198079435099","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1496847766},"language":"russian","review":"nice game)","timestamp_created":1388336167,"timestamp_updated":1388336167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8399788","author":{"steamid":"76561198060835558","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":531,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":442,"last_played":1392542420},"language":"english","review":"Hurts your brain BUT it is challenging and satisfying at the same time.
