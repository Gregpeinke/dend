Nonostante sia un gioco del 2004, la grafica e gli effetti speciali (distruzioni, esplosioni ecc...) risultano piacevoli e coinvolgenti. La storia è bella e non lascia l'amaro in bocca in nessun capitolo del gioco. Il livello dell'Anticittadino è un capolavoro assoluto (vedrete quando ci giocherete). I personaggi principali sono molto carismatici, in particolare Alyx che risulta essere un'ottima spalla per tutta l'esperienza di gioco (un vero piacere). La colonna sonora non è all'altezza del gioco e non ho apprezzato il doppiaggio in italiano che risulta veramente pessimo (forse il peggiore della storia). Le uniche voci gradevoli sono quelle di Alyx, di suo padre e del professore. Nonostante questo, il gioco è consigliato al 100 % e l'acquisto è d'obbligo. Spero che esca Half life 3. \n\nVoto: 9","timestamp_created":1335792697,"timestamp_updated":1389071379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4086969","author":{"steamid":"76561198031836096","num_games_owned":480,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":713,"last_played":1568695504},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the best Valve Games yet very good game play and the story line is alright the best thing about this game is the nonstop action in this game I died alot cause i get stuck or i have low health u always need to heal yourself alot thats the best way to stay alive i give this game 10/10 for its awesomeness","timestamp_created":1335720018,"timestamp_updated":1335720018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5635098","author":{"steamid":"76561198053282055","num_games_owned":325,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":2681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1531,"last_played":1435604662},"language":"english","review":"Amazing and creative story.","timestamp_created":1335645607,"timestamp_updated":1335645607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1711201","author":{"steamid":"76561197996809346","num_games_owned":809,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":390,"last_played":1610283127},"language":"english","review":"Nothing to say, go for it !","timestamp_created":1335636318,"timestamp_updated":1335636318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6258328","author":{"steamid":"76561198062312989","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1726,"last_played":1616443838},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Одна з найкращих ігор 2004 року.

I suspect this was never much of a game to satiate hardcore FPS fans, but for the rest of us the blend of action, 3D and physics puzzle solving — and above all, really, really good narrative, voice acting, and general execution — is a potent, addictive mix, and one that continues to age very well, I'd say.\n\nThe cleverly fleshed-out story arc, character development, truly inspired sound design, and solid game mechanics are the product and driver of the game's greatest asset — heaps of heart. Gordon Freeman may never utter a single audible word or offer any dialogue choices, but by focusing on where it can *really* deliver the goods,  HL2 creates a far more compelling, immersive experience than many a \"sandbox\" can but dream of.","timestamp_created":1333333352,"timestamp_updated":1333333352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3516383","author":{"steamid":"76561198024048879","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2842,"last_played":1628955372},"language":"english","review":"\"...\"   -Gordan Freeman","timestamp_created":1333244003,"timestamp_updated":1333244003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4571261","author":{"steamid":"76561198039195513","num_games_owned":649,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1587880150},"language":"english","review":"1 word can describe this game...

Das beste am Spiel ist aber ganz klar die Gravity Gun. Einfach eine einzigartige Waffe, die auch dank der  Source Enigne  viel Spaß machen. Und das Level gegen Ende des Spiels mit der großen Schlacht gegen die Stryder ist einfach genial und das ganz ohne Cutscense. Die Story des ehemaligen Black Mesa Forscher Gordan Freeman wird dazu spannend weitergeführt und mit tollen neuen Charakteren wie Alxy Vance oder Barney, der jetzt mehr als einen Satz sagt, erweitert.
