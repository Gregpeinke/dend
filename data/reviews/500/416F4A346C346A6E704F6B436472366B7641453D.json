4 Dead[/b] é uma salvação para todos os males que atormentam sua mente, e sempre que você estiver com vontade de encher o seu patrão de p0rr@d@, ou espancar alguém, Left 4 Dead nunca vai te deixar na mão.\n\nEste é um jogo que não tem grandes apresentações, a fórmula não podia ser mais simples, são 4 sobreviventes que escapam a uma epidemia mundial. \n[i]Francis[/i], [i]Bill[/i], [i]Zoey[/i] e [i]Louis[/i] vão percorrer as ruas infestadas por zumbis e infectados sedentos por sangue, mas apesar de se poder escolher um dos 4 para jogar, não existem diferenças entre eles em termos de jogabilidade, habilidades especiais ou características únicas.\n\nO objetivo do jogo é bem simples e perfeito, escolher sua arma e matar tudo que se mexer na sua frente até alguém ir te salvar, tão simples como isso: fazer os zumbis comerem balas.\n\nA escuridão do L4D esconde muitos perigos, desde [i]bruxas[/i] más que choram e te matam fácil, fácil, [i]Smokers[/i] com línguas gigantes para te arrastar até à morte, [i]Hunters[/i] muito perigosos mesmo a longas distâncias, uns gordinhos fedorentos, os [i]Boomers[/i], que vomitam sobre você atraindo uma “horda” de zumbis para cima de você(ai o bicho pega), e até uns [i]Tanks[/i] quase indestrutíveis que nos fazem lembrar o nosso amigo Hulk, se alguma vez o encontrarem fujam hahahaha, escondam-se pois este menino não é para brincadeiras.\n\nOs efeitos sonoros e os gráficos são fenomenais, o som dos disparos, o som dos zumbis, a própria música, o som dos monstros, é muito louco, é de se encantar. É arrepiante quando ouvimos uma [i]bruxa[/i] chorando e vindo desenfreada até você, os seus gritos criam um desespero incontrolável, e depois você é morto (hahaha).\nSangue por todo lado, paredes com frases horripilantes, zumbis mortos pelo chão. O sangue voando quando você estoura a cabeça dos zumbis, é tudo lindo.\n\nLeft 4 Dead é pura Adrenalina, seja no modo [i]Singleplayer[/i], [i]Campanha Online[/i] ou no seu fenomenal co-op [i]Multiplayer[/i], esse jogo é como uma droga, depois de se jogar a primeira vez nunca mais você vai parar de jogar. Quem adora FPSs de pura ação onde não existe um momento para descansar este é seu jogo amigo.\n\nÉ um ótimo jogo para jogar com os amigos, recomendo muito. 10/10. \nMesmo assim você ainda está na dúvida, assisti o trailer ai, hahaha e se apaixone pela arte que estourar os miolos de zumbis.","timestamp_created":1553099592,"timestamp_updated":1553099706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600912213325500488","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49655232","author":{"steamid":"76561198445432256","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":13748,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":1523,"last_played":1659717848},"language":"schinese","review":"玩不腻","timestamp_created":1553048390,"timestamp_updated":1553048390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49653201","author":{"steamid":"76561198393266916","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":573,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":527,"last_played":1559979229},"language":"english","review":"Fun game to play either alone or with friends!

Man muss sich nicht extra dafür Zeit nehmen. Es ist zwar ein wenig in die Jahre gekommen, aber es soll bzw. brauch ja auch nicht das Wochenende oder den Feierabend ausfüllen. Man bekommt das, was man erwartet: Zombies wegballern. Und obwohl es aufgrund seines Alters nicht vergleichbar anspruchsvoll wie aktuelle Titel ist, sollte man die Schwierigkeit nie unterschätzen. Besonders hart können gemoddete Server sein. Hier brandet einem oftmals ununterbrochen oder in Wellen der untote Mob entgegen. Außerdem bietet dieses Spiel einige Modis wie Überleben an, bei dem man so lange wie möglich gegen Zombiewellen durchhalten muss. Es gibt für dieses Spiel sehr sehr viele benutzererstellte Maps, die man sich in seinen Steampfad kopieren muss. Da viele Spieler solche Maps benutzen, muss man auf solchen auch nie lang \"allein\", also mit der KI zocken. Oder man holt sich Kumpels dazu.

This game proved to be very successful as the better known sequel Left 4 Dead 2, came out a year later.\n\nStarting with gameplay. You and three other players/bots take control of the four playable survivors, fighting your way though multiple campaigns, from safehouse to the recuse. To protect yourself and others from the horde, there is a good selection of weapons, throwables, and healing items. Obviously, the main enemies are the near endless amount of infected. While they are weak, their main threat comes from the sheer amount of them. As, well with the Common Infected, there are Special Infected with special traits that usually require teamwork to defeat. To handle the infected, the Left 4 Dead games feature a \"Director\" which controls items and spawns in the Common and Special Infected, as well as the Tank and Witch encounters, two more powerful Special Infected. This system makes each campaign different the next time you play it as items and zombies will be in different places. Also Included are other gamemode besides the standard campaign, such as Singleplayer and Versus, to shake up the gameplay. \n\nHowever, compared to its sequel, there are some things lacking. First, there are every few weapons, which could get boring as you will be using the same group of weapons over and over again. Second is that, pretty much everything from this game was ported to Left 4 Dead 2, rendering little point to play the original.\n\nOverall, Left 4 Dead is a great game to play with friends, with cooperative gameplay and a bunch of infected to kill. Unfortunately, due to the fact the campaigns were ported to the sequel, there is very little reason to play this game. But it still holds up its gameplay elements and is still enjoyable to play. Now excuse me, I need to grab some pills.","timestamp_created":1552231090,"timestamp_updated":1552250903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49476564","author":{"steamid":"76561198840148873","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":89,"last_played":1539957316},"language":"schinese","review":"I like to fight zombies just like I like to play pornographic games.","timestamp_created":1552207230,"timestamp_updated":1552207230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49471511","author":{"steamid":"76561198435125953","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1511797519},"language":"spanish","review":"Jugabilidad, coorporativo, solo, campañas, sonidos, todo excelente, recomendado 100%.","timestamp_created":1552186378,"timestamp_updated":1552186378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49466299","author":{"steamid":"76561198403546896","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":92,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48,"last_played":1590186864},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito legal","timestamp_created":1552163893,"timestamp_updated":1552163893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49465247","author":{"steamid":"76561198154794966","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":469,"last_played":1633033443},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyunu hikaye için alacaksanız yanaşmayın, çünkü ortada sunulan herhangi bir hikayesi yok.\nArkadaşlarınızla ve çevirimiçi severler için birebir.\nÜzerinize yığınla zombi geliyor, Hunter'lar Bomber'lar gibi özel zombi türleri de mevcut durumda.\n4 kişinin oynandığı bu oyunda yardımlaşma çok önemli, ilerlemeniz için birbirinize ihtiyacınız var.\nKısacası oyunu tavsiye edebilirim fakat bir yerden sonra aynı şeyleri yapmak belki canınızı sıkabilir.","timestamp_created":1552160462,"timestamp_updated":1552160462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49464064","author":{"steamid":"76561198804819800","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":132,"last_played":1562573611},"language":"russian","review":"Ностальгая...","timestamp_created":1552156485,"timestamp_updated":1552156485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49455984","author":{"steamid":"76561198809213398","num_games_owned":452,"num_reviews":214,"playtime_forever":633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1552133766},"language":"english","review":"pure action. as you guess multiplayer is almost dead.","timestamp_created":1552134556,"timestamp_updated":1552134556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49449899","author":{"steamid":"76561198258480938","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1675,"last_played":1589829358},"language":"spanish","review":"se ven los piesitos mmmmmmmm","timestamp_created":1552114473,"timestamp_updated":1657041312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49445712","author":{"steamid":"76561198209102317","num_games_owned":318,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1552162347},"language":"spanish","review":"Me canse de juagarlo con amigos trasnochando en los callejones de un mundo apocalitico plagado de zombies y ahora con steamworkshop.

I say that because I feel like Left 4 Dead 2 upgrades on this game in almost every single way imaginable, so technically I wouldn’t recommend it because I would just recommend Left 4 Dead 2 instead.\n\nThe infected in this game don’t punish camping strategies as much as the Spitter does. Even though the Spitter is one infected that has to wait through the spawn cycle to come around, there’s always a voice in the player’s head scaring them from going into a cramped closet to hold out a horde because they know a spitter may be spawn nearby and will mean either a lot of damage or even death.\n\nThere are more guns in L4D2, each of them feeling different enough that players will have their own personal favorites based on what nuanced differences there are between guns, while still maintaining the obvious differences between different classes of weapons like shotguns and assault rifles.\n\nThe atmosphere is one of the things that brought up most often as being superior to the sequel, but I have to say I disagree. Horror games are at their most atmospheric when you have very little to defend yourself with. The first Resident Evil games excell at this because you’re constantly scrounging around for any bullet or herb you can find. That’s why Resident Evil V was such a disappointment for many fans, as it retained that “survivalist” gameplay while changing to atmosphere to an over the top action movie. Lack of resources and defense options is a very consistent element in horror games, which is why games like Amnesia or Outlast provide you pretty much no defense against the monsters other than running and hiding. \n\nLeft 4 Dead is not a game where resources are lacking. Health is spawned on a regular basis, often times in areas that are completely in your way, but even more plentiful if you spend a bit of time looking. Each individual character carries enough ammo to make a hardened military vet green with envy, and you’ll typically come across full loaded guns or ammo piles every few minutes. Pipe bombs and molotovs are plentiful, you tear through the infected without much issue, they common infected are so plentiful that they’re somewhat oversaturated and keep each individual infected from seeming like a legitimate threat. To bring up Resident Evil again, one zombie could do a good chunk of damage on its own, so each one you saw was an enemy that needed to be taken seriously. The commons in this game are so useless on their own that they’re really scary. Overwhelming in large numbers? Sure. But not scary. All of these things make the horror element the first game is going for irrelevant at best, and contrasting to the gameplay at worst. This is a problem  L4d2 doesn’t suffer from because it embraces the action packed gameplay. The characters take the situation less seriously, there are more explosives, the settings are more bright and colorful, they have a finale in which you play extremely loud rock music with ridiculously dumb lyrics for god’s sake. The second game knows exactly what it is, where I always felt the first game couldn’t come to terms with the fact that it wasn’t scary.\n\n\nLeft 4 dead 2 now has all of the Left 4 Dead 1 maps as part of their standard campaigns. Though the Left 4 Dead 2 infected weren’t balanced around Left 4 Dead 1 maps, I’m almost tempted to laugh in the face of anyone that considers that an issue because of how poorly Left 4 Dead Versus mode is balanced in the first place.\n\nWith all of that said, there are two things this game does better than the first one.\n\nFirst off, lighting tanks on fire makes them run faster than survivors. It’s always an internal debate on whether to light a tank on fire in this game because it could do more harm to the survivors than good. In Left 4 Dead 2, the decision is almost always to throw the molotov at him, as long as it won’t block off your only escape route.\n\nSecond, the map design in the first one is better. I mentioned I enjoy the settings in the sequel more, and that’s still true, but Left 4 Dead 1 had occasional “point of no return” where survivors would drop down into an area with no way to backtrack. These were always crucial attacking points for infected in versus mode, as they’d almost always manage a kill on a survivor if they could catch them alone in this area.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 has these as well.\n\nOh boy, does it have them.\n\nThat gimmick was used somewhat sparingly in the first game, but is done to death in Left 4 Dead 2. Almost every chapter seems to contain one of these points of no return. This is made worse by the fact that, in Versus, both teams tanks spawn in slightly different areas. One could spawn after the point of no return, cornering the survivors and killing them will little effort, while the other one spawns before it, so the survivors have the open room to backtrack and kite the tank. Again, Versus wasn’t balanced to being with, but this element makes Left 4 Dead 2 versus almost bad. Because of how often this “point of no return” is used, you’ll probably be seeing this issue very commonly. I don’t play versus that much, and even I’ve seen this happen more times than I’m comfortable with.\n\nEven not considering the newer special infected and guns, Left 4 Dead 1 wasn’t perfectly transferred to the second game. The first one had a bit more of a counter strike mod feeling, whereas the second one really feels like it’s own game. I actually don’t consider this a place where Left 4 Dead 2 is superior. It’s a matter of personal preference which game feels better to play. So, despite everything I’ve said, there are reasons that purchasing this game as opposed to playing the same maps in the sequel make sense, but that is an incredibly niche factor that only a few people would even care about.\n\n\n\nSo, again, do I recommend the game? I guess between recommending it and not recommending it, I’d say I do, as it’s a great game, but I feel like in almost every way that matters, the sequel outshines it, and has made it little more than a redundant purchase these days. .\n","timestamp_created":1552027007,"timestamp_updated":1552095292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49421965","author":{"steamid":"76561198445652155","num_games_owned":644,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":827,"last_played":1554169637},"language":"english","review":"Can't find a good server to play online now, but you can still have fun playing with your friends or with AI bots.\n\nMaybe join some steam groups for modded servers where you can play versus with bots without being shut down.\n\nBut I highly recommend to buy Left 4 Dead 2 instead of Left 4 Dead for it contains all the maps, characters with improved graphics, addons, more game modes, weapons, zombie types, etc.","timestamp_created":1552012916,"timestamp_updated":1552094501,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49420413","author":{"steamid":"76561198391117164","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":248,"last_played":1622793740},"language":"english","review":"\n\nHello There","timestamp_created":1552004530,"timestamp_updated":1622680664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49420035","author":{"steamid":"76561198830345386","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":416,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":371,"last_played":1546319612},"language":"spanish","review":"ola ke thal¿","timestamp_created":1552002180,"timestamp_updated":1552002180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49416400","author":{"steamid":"76561198371220764","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1533205553},"language":"turkish","review":"Güzel bir oyun ama Left 4 Dead 2 oynamayı tercih ediyorum","timestamp_created":1551983641,"timestamp_updated":1578314151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583593130111694336","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49411713","author":{"steamid":"76561198210673620","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":25,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1499764800},"language":"schinese","review":"1拿来当收藏了，主要和朋友一起玩2，求求你出3吧！","timestamp_created":1551965230,"timestamp_updated":1551965230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49406011","author":{"steamid":"76561198889346787","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":141,"last_played":1556972762},"language":"russian","review":"качаем играем с друзьями 2 часть поинтереснее","timestamp_created":1551934397,"timestamp_updated":1551934397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49405433","author":{"steamid":"76561197971262630","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1552012144},"language":"english","review":"I revived my Half-Life game after many years and noticed Left 4 Dead in the bundle.
