Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was developed by Valve the same time that Half-Life 2 was being developed, Lost Coast was released on steam in 2005.\n\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b] Some people might be asking “Atratzu, why are you reviewing this? It's not even a full game, it's a demo”. My answer is... I dunno... It's a game in my library and I want to review every game I've played.\nThere's not much to the story, you meet an old man [i](the fisherman)[/i] who takes you up a flight of stairs to unlock a gate to let you up to the chapel. Then you get ambushed by the Combine and need to demonstrate the amazing Half-Life 2 source engine to those jerks and kick their butts.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] Keep in mind that this game came out in 2005. Today and in the future a Technical demo like this might seem silly, but at the time it was dazzling 3D graphics to onlookers.\nThe controls are the same as Half-Life 2... First person view, different types of weapons can be found and switched between using the scroll wheel or 1-2-3-4-5-etc, pew pew.\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b] This game has the hardest achievements out of any video game I've ever played. They're broken down into one category: unforgivingly difficult. Beat the whole game in extreme-FUBAR-murder-death-mode. Play for 1,000 hours. Reach notorious hidden objectives, slay the hidden spider queen, and many more.\n\nActually, there aren't any achievements in the game.\n\n[b]Price:[/b] Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is priced at $39.99, for the stand alone game, it's crazy, isn't it? Imagine how much fun you could have with a game from 2005 for $39.99? I think that's a solid price, I think Valve could get away with charging an extra hundred dollars for the game and it would still be worth it.\n\nActually, it's part of a bundle with 9 other games within the “Buy Half-Life Complete”.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] To quickly recap, the story was short and not really relevant, since this was taken out of Half-Life 2 (this was supposed to be a section of Highway 17). The Gameplay was identical to Half-Life 2 because it was basically a town in Half-Life. The Achievements were non-existent. The price is non-existent because it comes in a bundle with other games.\n“Should you get this game?” That question is irrelevant, “Should you buy and play the Half-Life Games?” Heck yes.","timestamp_created":1439337467,"timestamp_updated":1439337467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.699025094509124756","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17494667","author":{"steamid":"76561198119763195","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":19,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1434165408},"language":"english","review":"this dlc or addon is 10 minutes long its fucking great","timestamp_created":1439328683,"timestamp_updated":1439328683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17493197","author":{"steamid":"76561198196670669","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":46,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1645654146},"language":"english","review":"*NORMAL VERSION* this game is by far the prettiest of all of them. altough i dont recommend to buy it at full, you should wait for it to be on sale.\n*MY VERSION* why the hell is the game so expesive? why is it so damn pretty? whats the story?

Изначально этот уровень планировался в составе оригинальной [b]Half – Life 2[/b], но в связи с жесткими ограничениями по срокам попал «под нож», однако не был забыт и обрел вторую жизнь в виде технической демонстрации для мощных на тот момент компьютеров. Таким образом это никак нельзя назвать игрой, это скорее интерактивное погружение в мир разработки компьютерных игр. Окунемся?\n\n[h1]«ЗА»[/h1]\n- Бесплатность.\n- Уровень выполнен на высочайшем техническом уровне (такая вот тавтология). Тогда, в 2005, от этих новомодных эффектов отпадала челюсть, а скриншоты из храма Святой Ольги заполонили страницы всех игровых сайтов. \n- Отдельно отмечу очень красивый HDR, и особенно – в храме.\n- Наличие режима комментариев. Если вас можно чем – то заинтересовать помимо ежедневных матчей в [b]Dota[/b], то возможно это для вас – на первый взгляд спорная идея обернулась колоссальным успехом – стало возможным, не покидая игру, взглянуть на нее с точки зрения разработчика. Конечно, людям с «пользовательским» складом ума это ни к чему, но «технари» и просто те кто любят знать, как работает то или иное устройство, которым мы пользуемся – эти категории игроков будут в восторге. Именно благодаря успеху [b]Lost Coast[/b] мы получили систему комментариев в последующих играх от Valve.\n\n[h1]«ПРОТИВ»[/h1]\n- После долгих – долгих раздумий что же можно записать этому продукту в минусы я наскреб 3 минуса. Первый это то что если рыбака на побережье каким – то чудом убьют, то игра вылетит, т.к. он не имеет анимации смерти. Второй – все же уровень маловат, красот хочется побольше, да и перестрелки тут неуместны и отвлекают. Третий – это то что вместо [b]Half – Life 3[/b] ребята из Valve делают техно – демки…Хотя…Стойте…Три минуса…РЕБЯТА, [b]HALF – LIFE 3[/b] ПОДТВЕРЖДЕН!!!\n- Если отбросить шутки, то минусов банально нет.\n\n[h1]Резюме[/h1]\nАмбициозная демонстрация Valve того, какими могут быть игры, если создавать их без оглядки на мощности компьютеров. Ну в рамках 2005 года конечно. Однозначно рекомендую всем. В обычном режиме делать тут абсолютно нечего, а вот режим комментариев способен увлечь на полчасика. Все лучше чем [b]Dota[/b].
