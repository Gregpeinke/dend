Valve created many successful franchises like left 4 dead for an example. Now its 2018 and does half life live up to its massive following? Ill review the game in a pro/ con style and end with my conclusion.\n\nPro:\n     The artistic quality of the game is pretty fair. Things like gun models, enemies, and some of the locations look really cool. I do enjoy the shotgun design because it reminds me of 007 nightfire's spaz shotgun. The enemies really do pop out and are very noticible in the world which is nice ins a somewhat creepy atmosphere that the game has in few occassions.\n\n     The music is great. Now there is not much music which is kinda disappointing but the game was made in 1998 so not much to expect. The moments that has music is a breath of fresh air in the game's favor. It made moments really exciting like the fight on the dessert cliff side.\n\nCon:\n     The level design is most of the time's confusing. Often times the player will be left fumbling around to find out where to go and how to get there. The game does not use subtle cues to guide the player along the way leaving many moments of wondering around. This happend more times than necessary which really killed the mode of the game for me.\n\n      The game is brutally difficult. Normally games have difficulties like easy normal and hard. This game is not exception but the issue is that it is brutal all around. Easy mode will still kick the player's butt in many locations which for me was far more annoying than it should. I dont mind a challenge but this was just far beyond challenging to just tedium.\n\n     The story is existant? That is a question that will be asked by the player through the entire game. Who are we and why are we doing this? Through the entire game I did not understand anything of the story which mind you not all games need a story but this game probably had a story but there is no real clear understanding on things. What organization are we? The military's purpose for slaughtering scientist? Nothing made much sense and really leaves me to not care about anything in the game but the problem is I really want to understand all of what's going on.\n\n    First person platforming puzzles are the worst. The game holds heavy enphasis on puzzle platforming at moments of the game. It is not enjoyable especially since Gordan Freeman feels like he is skating on the floor constantly with how fast he moves. Yes he has a walking mode if shift is pressed but still does not make puzzle platforming anymore tollerable. There are moments when jumping with speed causes the character to loose all that speed while in mid air. That happend a few times over death traps which was not fun.\n\n    The bugs are so real in this game. Not that they are too bad since the autosave features are there to help but when it happens it is the worst feeling in the world to redo a section again for a level. I got hit by 2 bugs that messed up my enjoyment for the game. The moments were not spawning inside the map after the moment when Freeman gets captured and getting stuck in a pipe in the level surface tension (i think). Still not the worst bug experience I have ever had but still running into bugs are the worst and I just decided to activate noclip to bypass these problems. Also another bug that happens if you turn both of the valves before the water rises in some water power plant area. If you do that the the water will rise only 1 level instead of two which makes progressing impossible and the only thing to do is revert to a previous autosave.\n\nConclusion:\n    Half-life is a good game at it's core but I did not enjoy as much as I was hoping from the first of the series maybe the second game plays better and was the game to create this massive following. The brutal  difficulty and the many moments of confusion really left me with a sour taste towards this game. I can not recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1522629249,"timestamp_updated":1522629249,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.38360285758972168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41215412","author":{"steamid":"76561198188964367","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1639512224},"language":"bulgarian","review":"Still haven't finished it...

Within the first hour, i was completely hooked\n\nHalf-Life was the game that sparked my love for video games AND video games design, it is truly one of a kind game, Gordon Freeman, a silent protagonist in a suit, fights his way through hell on earth (and on xen). It probably would've looked really silly if it wasn't [b] SO GOD DAMN WELL MADE. [/b]\n\n[u] Story [/u]\nThe story of Half Life is a one-of-a-kind one, a special one that is so unrealistic, and yet, believeable. The main part of playing that role is the there are NO CUTSCENES, Gordon Freeman interacts with the science team that reveals just how BAD the situation is. You live through the story with Gordon's eyes, YOUR eyes. This isn't a story following the protagonist, this a story [b] FROM [/b] the protagonist.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nIf this is the first time you play the game, you might think the graphics are \"meh\" or unrealistic, however, classic gamers will see the beauty of its graphic design. Back in 1998, these graphics were the BEST and truly beautiful. Even now, i find myself admiring unrealistic pixels on my screen.\n\n[u] Soundtrack/Sound design [/u]\nI find the Sound design of the game really alluring, the gunshots, electricity, the noises that the aliens make, even the occasional chatter between the marines. I also think that the soundtrack of this game is glamorous. The \"Cavern Ambiance\" really sends a chill down my spine and \"Klaxon Beat\" makes me really hyped up, but i love \"Drums and Riffs\" the most.\n\n[u] Level Design [/u]\nThere is not much to say from me about the Level Design. It truly is original, i didn't see something like that back in 2006, which made me really impressed. The more you explore, you will finds rooms that you wouldn't normally find, and the things you would find there would help you later on, ranging from additional ammo to a new weapon.\n\n[u] Gameplay [/u]\nNow the gameplay of Half-Life is what made the game so god damn exquisite. You get to fight aliens that are invading the world, US Marines, Giant tentacles, Armoured mini gorillas and a GIANT FETUS, [b] HOLY FU**ING SH*T! [/b] \nThe game starts slow and easy. In the first 20 minutes or so you will find the game not that interesting. Until all hell breaks loose of course! You will have to fight your way through aliens and US Marines to get to surface, and the a giant fetus god at the end.(seriously, how did they came up with that?)\n\n[u] Last few words [/u]\nHalf-Life is my best-of-all-time game. As i said, it sparked my interest in the video games and got me addicted to it.

And I must honestly say that the hype is deserved. However, the game is not without its flaws.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics is not the reason why you would want to play this game. It's a game from 1998 and it shows. There are some HD mods that can improve the textures, however buttons and other interactable objects still have no depth and look like they have been painted on the walls.\n\nStory\n\nThe story is where this game shines out the most. Not as much for what it tells - there are only a few important things going on in the game - but for how it is revealed. The story is revealed bit by bit through observations and short interactions with NPCs. The protagonist is silent. There are no books, no logs and almost no cutscenes. The story is the experience itself.\nHowever, the game does not take itself seriously. There are elements of comedy in some scenes and NPC lines. And for me that is a flaw, because it doesn't fit the overall crisis situation.\n\nLevel design\n\nThe game offers a seamless transition between the levels. They are built in a way that almost always the player intuitively knows where to go and what to do. It is accomplished without any mission logs or map markers. In some situations there is more than one way to go, but no matter which way you chose you reach the intended destination. Furthermore, the level design complements the story.\nThis is some master level level design.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game starts slowly and for about first 15 minutes there's not much going on. But then the pace becomes faster and you face increasingly harder situations with a good balance between shooting and puzzle solving. However, there are some points in the game, when, if you don't have the right type of ammo, you are screwed. Multiple reloads or cheats are required to get past those bottleneck situations.\n\nThe endgame is particularly punishing, and also confusing. There's a lot of platform jumping, multiple enemy spawns and very hard boss fights. I'd say even too hard for easy difficulty.\n\nOther notes\n-It doesn't feel like the protagonist is walking, but more like sliding. A single press of a movement button takes you quite far. It's just too sensitive. For that reason I experienced quite a lot of problems with ladders and moving platforms, and fall damage was the most frequent type of damage that I took.\n- The grenade throwing is very inaccurate and covers only a short distance.\n- Shotguns and assault rifles have spray patterns.\n- Crouch jumping is a thing.\n- The soundtrack is amazing and available as extra content within the game files.\n\nFinal words\n\nUnless for the annoying endgame that tested my patience, HL would have been one of my favourite games. But, nevertheless, I still think it's a good game and worth playing. Even in 2018.\n\nMy overall rating: 8/10","timestamp_created":1522214789,"timestamp_updated":1522214789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597401082515716553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41100155","author":{"steamid":"76561198060176572","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":575,"last_played":1559599177},"language":"english","review":"Dustforce truly is a work of art. I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level. \n\nAnother thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.\n\nOverall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:\n\n10/10\nBUY THIS GAME","timestamp_created":1522210129,"timestamp_updated":1522210129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41099433","author":{"steamid":"76561198278127344","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1089,"last_played":1600867702},"language":"brazilian","review":"FPS classico, um dos melhores da sua geração.","timestamp_created":1522206620,"timestamp_updated":1522206620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41099401","author":{"steamid":"76561198454190106","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":41,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1651616980},"language":"turkish","review":"Verdiği zevkin yeri hala ayrı.

It certainly hasn't aged quite like a fine wine - I encountered many bugs and glitches that really slowed my progress at some parts, and some of the old gameplay design is pretty questionable with 20 years of hindsight (all the jumping and platforming is certainly not much fun)\n\nBut despite that I think that it can't be questioned that Half Life is still a masterpiece that I think anyone should experience at least once. It is the game that revolutionised FPS's and re-defined what video game story can be. The shooting is still solid after 20 years, the action set pieces are well paced alongside moments of quiet and suspense. It is  genuinly quite un-nerving at time with the odd jump-startle (I'm not ashamed to admit that Ichthyosaur's absolutely terrify me). The story has some subtle deeper bits that require a bit more attention to pick up on, and all of it is told without cutscenes. It might have taken me 15 hours (well, including at least 1 entire restart of the game) but it was well worth it in the end. Now all I need to do is play Episode 1 and 2 and then I can finally join in the endless depression that is Half Life's unsolved cliffhanger.","timestamp_created":1522202791,"timestamp_updated":1522414731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41096002","author":{"steamid":"76561198255759523","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1511629505},"language":"english","review":"meh 7/10","timestamp_created":1522191187,"timestamp_updated":1522191187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41095926","author":{"steamid":"76561198119649015","num_games_owned":324,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":564,"last_played":1501202611},"language":"english","review":"took me 10 hours to beat a game twice as old as i am\n10/10 would reccomend","timestamp_created":1522190906,"timestamp_updated":1522190906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41094174","author":{"steamid":"76561197997832441","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1123,"last_played":1521994462},"language":"english","review":"Not much to say about the game.
