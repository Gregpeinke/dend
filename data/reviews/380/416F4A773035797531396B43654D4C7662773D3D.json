The negative is that paying €7 to experience the next 4 hours of the story feels a little cheap, like it should have been included in the base game.\n\nFor better or worse, Episode one is a necessary but very short component to Half-Life 2 and a welcome addition to those who crave more of it. 8/10","timestamp_created":1487552752,"timestamp_updated":1487703314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30047632","author":{"steamid":"76561198121971215","num_games_owned":719,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1542297062},"language":"polish","review":"Bardzo krótki epizod jeżeli ktoś się postara to można go ukończyć w 2h.

Kto więc nie grał wcześniej w Half-Life 2 przed grą w Ep1 powinien nadrobić braki :) Jedną ze zmian, która dość szybko rzuca się w oczy w Ep1 jest wykorzystanie przez Valve nieco nowszej wersji silnika Source niż w Half-Life 2. Przekłada się to oczywiście na trochę ładniejszą oprawę graficzną. Poza tym Ep1 kontynuuje dobre tradycje Half-Life 2 i jest to również bardzo porządna gra tyle, że znacznie krótsza.

Feeling more like a tacked on epilogue, Episode 1 feels like it acts merely to connect the end of the core game to the next major part of the story. What does stand out about this game is the character interaction. The improvement of NPC intelligence means that your companion throughout the entire episode is actually effective in gameplay, not to mention keeping you company in the darker, lonelier parts of the episode. This is what I feel this game was to be, however, a smaller scope character driven adventure. For this I can applauded the game because there are some parts of the story that truly make you care as if your companion were real flesh and blood.\n\n[b]Full review below if you want to check it out:[/b]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne5qIlE8D9k","timestamp_created":1487284631,"timestamp_updated":1487284631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29966788","author":{"steamid":"76561198108610617","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1487265298},"language":"french","review":"Half Life episode one, vraiment, les half life sont la base de tous les jeux du genre, les affrontements, les énigmes, les armes, l'histoire.

Garfield upon the latter's assassination. At the outset, Arthur struggled to overcome a slightly negative reputation, which stemmed from his early career in politics as part of New York's Republican political machine. He succeeded by embracing the cause of civil service reform. His advocacy for, and subsequent enforcement of, the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act was the centerpiece of his administration.\n\nArthur was born in Fairfield, Vermont, grew up in upstate New York, and practiced law in New York City. He served as quartermaster general in the New York Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, he devoted more time to Republican politics and quickly rose in the political machine run by New York Senator Roscoe Conkling. Appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to the lucrative and politically powerful post of Collector of the Port of New York in 1871, Arthur was an important supporter of Conkling and the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party. In 1878, the new president, Rutherford B. Hayes, fired Arthur as part of a plan to reform the federal patronage system in New York. When Garfield won the Republican nomination for president in 1880, Arthur, an eastern Stalwart, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket.\n\nAfter just half a year as vice president, Arthur found himself in the executive mansion due to the assassination of his predecessor. To the surprise of reformers, Arthur took up the cause of reform, though it had once led to his expulsion from office. He signed the Pendleton Act into law and strongly enforced its provisions. He gained praise for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive. He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy, but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus, which had been accumulating since the end of the Civil War.\n\nSuffering from poor health, Arthur made only a limited effort to secure the Republican Party's nomination in 1884; he retired at the close of his term. Journalist Alexander McClure later wrote, \"No man ever entered the Presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted as Chester Alan Arthur, and no one ever retired ... more generally respected, alike by political friend and foe.\"[3] Although his failing health and political temperament combined to make his administration less active than a modern presidency, he earned praise among contemporaries for his solid performance in office. The New York World summed up Arthur's presidency at his death in 1886: \"No duty was neglected in his administration, and no adventurous project alarmed the nation.\"[4] Mark Twain wrote of him, \"[I]t would be hard indeed to better President Arthur's administration.\"[5] Over the 20th and 21st centuries, however, Arthur's reputation mostly faded among the public.","timestamp_created":1484944107,"timestamp_updated":1484944107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29380660","author":{"steamid":"76561198070726032","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":518,"last_played":1455148005},"language":"french","review":"Le titre à vraiment le cul entre deux chaises entre le simple add-on et la suite : d'un côté, il utilise le même moteur graphique, s'arrête juste après Half Life 2, coute très peu cher (durant les soldes Steam il est à 1 € 50) est beaucoup plus cours et utilise le même moteur graphique.

De plus, deux autres succès sont aussi en lien avec cet objet, nous forçant à envoyer des voitures sur des fourmillions ou nous faisant cramer un maximum de \"crabhead zombies.\" Là encore, il y a une dimension \"originalité ludique\" où l'on sent que les développeurs testent d'autres formes de gameplay. \n\nLe scénario, s'il est peu épais permet quand même d'allonger l'univers et reste relativement cohérent.
