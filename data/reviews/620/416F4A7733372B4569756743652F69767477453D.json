It is - as far as I am concerned - the pinnacle of first-person puzzling. It takes everything that worked well in the first portal game and analyses it harshly under the interrogation lamp of the entire professional experience amassed by Valve at this point. I think that is why Valve makes such great games. Not just because of their raw skill but their willingness to sit down and analyse their past achievements and build on them. There is no better example of this then Portal 2.\n\nA big worry looking at the potential of Portal 2 is how it will avoid growing stale. Portal 1's length is perfect; it needs to be short because, in all honesty, the Portal mechanic gets boring soon after you have mastered it (as so much of the workshop content attests to). How would Portal 2, which promised a longer experience with more puzzles but using the same core mechanic, hold up after the first few puzzles? Surely they were trying to squeeze too much out of Portal's success.\n\nValve solved this problem in two ways: Firstly, by introducing necessary new mechanics; and, secondly, by deepening the story and character arcs. Note that this is almost the exact same thing that Half-Life 2 does to combat gameplay fatigue between it and its predecessor. \n\nLet's start with the first thing: new mechanics. Up until you first defeat GLaDOS the game plays almost exactly the same as Portal 1. This is, of course, intentional and many of the first levels of Portal 2 are Portal levels in reverse. This uses Portal to effectively teach the player the mechanics. The exception to this is the light-bridges, and lasers. But these aren't really that new. Light-bridges replace moving platforms which were very slow, they act to speed up gameplay through the first levels and to stop experienced players getting bored; lasers replace the orbs of energy which were carried over from Half-Life 2 into Portal, these once again act to speed up gameplay as an instant version of the old mechanic. Both lasers and light-bridges are arguably just new skins on Portal 1 gameplay but they still serve an important role in making Portal 2 feel fresh. \n\nOnce you have defeated GLaDOS you are through back into the depths of Aperture Science and introduced to the next gameplay innovation: gels. Gels are amazing and completely redevelop the gameplay. This might seem like hyperbole for what is only one mechanic but it is not. Gels change the game. Quite a big bit of the original Portal mechanic is managing portals, remembering where they are so you know where you are going to be shooting out of or shooting one somewhere you won't be able to reach later in the puzzle without backtracking so you can get resources from there when you need them. Gels develop this even more.  You now need to manage which gels you have where and where you have portals so you can access them. It is not particularly complex nor particularly deep but then again neither is the portal mechanic and so far that is all we've had. Plus a lot of work clearly went into making the gels feel fun. the way the slosh about is very satisfying and painting walls with them does it for me every time.\n\nNow onto story and characters. Portal 2 takes the atmosphere and humour from Portal and does it better in almost every way. The banter from Wheatley is perfect and the eventual friendship with GLaDOS is very satisfying as far as characters go. The story is also excellent while the twist is not particularly surprising it is still effective for splitting up gameplay and adds new depth to the story.  Learning about GLaDOS' history and relationship with Aperture, however, steals the show. It is always a risky move to humanise your villain, whether in film, TV, or books. Whose to say that your villain really is that interesting past their maniacal laugh and mustache-twirling menace. Lucky GLaDOS is perhaps one of the best-written characters in gaming. She works as a human just as much as a robot and making her dependant on me to survive makes her even more endearing. When it finally came to the end of the game I felt genuinely sad. Reflecting on my journey I wasn't so sure I did want to leave Aperture now, especially if it is as bad as GLaDOS hinted at in Portal 1.

Portal Two is, to put it simply, on par with any movie ever made. Whilst playing you can't help but feel the care that has gone into this game, it's got more polish than the Mr Sheen factory. From start to finish the game oozes classy dialogue, helped along by sublime voice acting from a notable cast such as J.k Simmons (Cave Johnson), Stephen Merchant (Wheatley), and the returning Ellen Mclain (Glados). With so much talent at hand you might think it difficult for valve to keep the balance in check but they have managed incredibly. No one character outshines any other and all three get their moments in the spotlight, showcasing Erik Wolfpaw and Chet Faliszek's hilarious script. The gameplay itsself begins similarly to the first but soon takes some exciting twists as many new tricks are introduced and some brilliant new setplays are thrown at the player. One of the main criticisms with the prequel was samey level design and monotone colours; this has been righted, and how! Some of the views to be found in Portal 2 are breathtaking and the updated source engine never fails to do the game justice. Length-wise the singleplayer campaign is much, much longer than the original (took me about 6 hours, whereas I can do the original in 35 minutes). Having just completed the game let me tell you I feel very much that I got my monies worth and I haven't even started the co-op yet. To be honest I feel perhaps I should have waited to write this review as I'm still stunned from the ending and feel pretty speechless. I must say, however, that the naysayers bringing the overall user score down are simply either trolling or haven't got the game. This game is near perfect. I say near because I've finished it and the only downside I can see is that the game had an end at all, such was the amount of fun I had beating the tests. This is simply a must buy for anybody who owns a PC, PS3 or Xbox 360. It's funny, charming, shocking, scary at times, and the ending is downright insane. I could continue but I'm exhausting my list of superlatives. Valve have struck gold again, this is simply genius. Best game ever.","timestamp_created":1546603310,"timestamp_updated":1546603310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536694347858428955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48094107","author":{"steamid":"76561198813932012","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":14866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3503,"last_played":1651846319},"language":"russian","review":" Класс :D Прикольно играть с друзьями,в дополнительных испытаниях в MP(MultiPlayer) очень сложные","timestamp_created":1546603279,"timestamp_updated":1546603279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48093512","author":{"steamid":"76561198059449986","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1603515972},"language":"english","review":"One of the best puzzle games ever","timestamp_created":1546601192,"timestamp_updated":1546601192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48093473","author":{"steamid":"76561198017092889","num_games_owned":286,"num_reviews":177,"playtime_forever":346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1546551007},"language":"russian","review":"События игры PORTAL 2 начинаются . . . а вот непонятно через сколько времени после событий первой части. Ибо по пробуждении весь научный комплекс выглядит как после масштабной войны, либо нехилого такого взрыва. Нас встречает модуль по имени Уитли, который будет сопровождать нас в игре как очень болтливый друг. Свой экскурсией он даёт увидеть полную ж[strike]оп[/strike]у комплексу и необходимость убраться оттуда поскорее.\n\n[i]Мне крайне нравится идея единого мира игр PORTAL и серии игр HALF-LIFE, позже игра косвенно и при этом много даёт это понять. Много отсылок, много предметов и одна реплика о том, что корпорация APERTURE и корпорация BLACK MESA конкурируют. В одном из эпизодов это будет озвучено. Также, в одной из локаций самого нижнего уровня комплекса есть потайной проход к сухому доку. В свою очередь показывающий один спасательный круг с названием корабля, который был там ранее – BOREALIS. Этот корабль упоминается и демонстрируется мельком во втором эпизоде второго HALF-LIFE.  \nИз этого следует, что события, на мой взгляд, могут происходить через довольно большой промежуток времени после события второй части игры HALF-LIFE, а то и вовсе после второго эпизода второй же части игры про очкарика с монтировкой.[/i]\n\nДалее головокружительное предположение появилось у меня на протяжении игры ([u]ВНИМАНИЕ. СПОЙЛЕРЫ[/u]): \n[spoiler]в одном из локаций старого уровня научного комплекса увидел кабинет, где заброшена научная выставка с названием «Приведи свою дочь на работу». Несколько стендов с картофелинами и электроникой, либо иными прибамбасами. В одном из стендов, где картофелина нехило проросла, увидел исполнительницу данной работы, в которой же имя подозрительно схоже с именем главной героини. В тех же локациях воспроизводя старые записи основателя и непосредственно директора компании APERTURE по громкоговорителю непроизвольно одновременно со вставленным в запись женским голосом отвечает мужскому, т.е. одну и ту же фразу. Подтверждение того, что она была ранее человеком увидел картину, где сидит мужчина и стоит женщина (картина с подписью «Cave Johnson»), на что ГЛэДОС твердит, что она «кажется знает этих людей». Уже после по сюжет мы узнаём, что сама ГЛэДОС являлась ранее человеком по имени Кэролайн, помощницей Кейва Джонсона.\nЯ всё к тому, что, по-моему, ГЛэДОС (Кэролайн) ¬– это мать, либо более далёкий предок главной героини обеих частей (при учёте того, что героиня приёмная). НО-О-О-О-О это сугубо моё предположение, не обращайте внимание.[/spoiler]\n\nВ это игре шикарно всё, от построения комнат до атмосферного ВСЕГО научного комплекса, от прекрасного сюжета до харизматичных персонажей. Про персонажей я не вру. Хоть они и искусственный интеллект (не считая главную героиню Чилл), но слушая их они кажутся живыми. Даже монотонная ГЛэДОС своей саркастичностью, циничностью, наглостью и некой своей чернотой характера в целом выглядит и воспринимается живой. К этим персонажам и сопереживаешь, и ненавидишь. Они забаляют и придают некий окрас к происходящему. \n\nЭто показатель уровня проработки игры разработчиками.\n________\nСоветую помимо одиночно сюжетки опробовать совместную игру (не связан с одиночным сюжетом). Весело, задорно и главное интересно.\n________\n[h1][10] «Cake dispensary» из [10][/h1]","timestamp_created":1546601100,"timestamp_updated":1546601115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48093203","author":{"steamid":"76561198407092017","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1090,"last_played":1537222499},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game!

For each course, the default level is the last one so make sure to scroll back. We didn't realize these things, so the first level we played and beat was the final level of Course 1. We have also never played Portal 1 so we had to figure things out ourselves while working through that level.\n\nMinor complaint is that the game doesn't let you play Steam Workshop levels using local splitscreen co-op. Good thing you can get around this using console commands.","timestamp_created":1546545330,"timestamp_updated":1546545330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48077778","author":{"steamid":"76561198253586752","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":501,"last_played":1579484345},"language":"spanish","review":"awantiiiiah","timestamp_created":1546543275,"timestamp_updated":1546543275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48077611","author":{"steamid":"76561198402002066","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1657663078},"language":"russian","review":"ачё)","timestamp_created":1546542839,"timestamp_updated":1576850730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56081080436706543","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48077522","author":{"steamid":"76561198286101742","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":901,"last_played":1640292217},"language":"english","review":"Amazing experience both singleplayer and co-op\n10/10 would cake again","timestamp_created":1546542644,"timestamp_updated":1546542644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"48077176","author":{"steamid":"76561198056249095","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":191,"last_played":1599308594},"language":"spanish","review":"Ahora que me lo he pasado, así muy brevemente:\nEs el primer juego de puzzles que juego, y he de decir que me han parecido bastante sencillos, pero no tengo nada con qué comparar.\nLa historia bueno, ahí está.\nEl desarrollo y avance del juego están entretenido, aunque la parte media, cuando bajas al subsuelo, me ha parecido bastante tediosa y aburrida sinceramente.\nPero los personajes, ay.

Среди множества нововведений геймплея в Portal 2 присутствует кооперативный режим для прохождения двумя игроками. Действие игры происходит спустя некоторое время после событий Portal в разрушенной и заброшенной Лаборатории исследования природы порталов (Aperture Science) и фокусируется на дальнейшем противостоянии всё той же главной героини, подопытной девушки Челл, и маниакального суперкомпьютера GLaDOS.
