I was scared of everything. I moved very slowly, cautiously, and ran from place to place, looking for the safest and shortest path to the next saferoom. When I finally finished a campaign and got to watch the ending cutscene roll, it felt like a real achievement.\n\nThen I tried joining my first multi-player campaign and discovered a whole new world. Having someone running along with me, giving me helpful advice, and us all generally looking after each other as a team was a great experience. This is a game where good team-based gameplay is rewarded, and where people who go rushing off alone commonly end up getting themselves killed. Left 4 Dead feels like it was built for cooperative gameplay, from the ground up. There's safety in numbers, and when you're the last one standing and trying to survive on your own, you'll really feel just how alone you are in a hostile world where pretty much everything is out to kill you.\n\nThe game can be played in both single and multi-player. Up to four players control one each of four survivors as they all attempt to move from one safe area to the next. Any survivors not being controlled by a human player will be automatically taken over by the survivor bot AI. As they move through the levels in the campaigns, the survivors will encounter various enemies, including hordes of common zombies and some rarer 'special' infected. These special infected come with unique abilities that make good teamplay essential, as their attacks can disorient and even render lone survivors helpless.\n\nLevel Design:\nLevels are premade and static, meaning they never change from game to game. After playing the same campaign enough times, you'll end up memorizing the most efficient routes through the levels. Item spawns are also preplaced, so if you find a bottle of pills behind a dumpster in a certain alleyway, then that's what you can expect to find in that location in all future games you play. There is some variation in the fact that items won't always spawn where they're available to be spawned, but that's it.\n\nAt certain points throughout the game, you'll encounter various events that trigger attacks from hordes of zombies, or even spawn 'boss' infected, which helps break the monotony of simply going from point A to point B. Otherwise, the meat of the campaign mode consists of moving from one location to the next while shooting zombies and finding items. There are six campaigns; most of them have a total of five maps. In each campaign, there is constant visible evidence of the decay of society and the collapse of civilization through wrecked buildings, vehicles, piles of dead bodies, and more.\n\nGame Modes:\nBesides campaign, 'versus' and 'survival' game modes are also available. In versus mode, up to eight players can join a single game session. Versus mode is basically a campaign where there are two teams of human players - one team controls the survivors, and the other spawns as special infected. The survivor team must attempt to make it as far as they can before being killed, while the infected team attempts to stop them as quickly as possible. Once the survivors have been killed or make it to safety, the teams switch roles, and the map is played again. This rotation continues until the entire campaign has been completed, at which stage, points are tallied up to determine the winner.\n\nIn survival mode, the survivors are trapped in certain areas found throughout the campaigns, and must hold out as long as possible against relentless waves of enemies that get more difficult as the game progresses. Gold, silver, and bronze 'medals' are awarded for lasting ten, seven, and four minutes respectively.\n\nSound:\nMusic in Left 4 Dead adds not only atmosphere, but is also dynamic in that it changes depending on the situation. Impending horde attacks are met with the sound of intense drumming, the presence of an attacking 'Tank' (boss infected) comes with its own 'epic' theme, unique 'terror' music plays while being strangled by a 'Smoker' special infected, and so on. Leaving the music in this game on can actually help the player maintain situational awareness.\n\nSurvivors also call out and comment on things they see throughout the game, and the voice acting is generally good. Players can make the character they're controlling say certain things with the press of a button for quick communication in case they can't or don't want to type messages or use a microphone.\n\nAI:\nThe survivor bot AI does an adequate job of keeping together and shooting enemies, but has a habit of running directly into the player's line of fire. I also noticed frequent pathfinding issues, causing bots to get stuck before 'warping' to the player's location. Sometimes, fellow survivor bots also take an inordinate amount of time to rescue other survivors from the clutches of special infected if there is even a minimal amount of zombies occupying their attention. Incapacitated survivor bots also have the uncanny ability to close doors, which is not something the player can do.\n\nThe infected AI is very accurate and effective, and often 'cheats'. Hunters are able to claw survivors while in mid leap and even after getting shoved away, and Boomers instantly hit survivors once they get within range, before even completing their swiping animation, There is also some kind of oddity with hitboxes involving rocks thrown by Tanks, which allows Tanks to hit survivors round the corners of buildings.\n\nPacing/Networking:\nGame sessions can be hosted on dedicated servers or locally via a player's computer. The game runs very well on a slow connection - on a connection that had a maximum transfer rate of 8.5kb/s, I've managed to maintain a ping between 50-70 on a dedicated server within the same country. Depending on how quickly players rush through a campaign, game sessions can last anywhere from 11 minutes on the shortest campaign, to up to roughly an hour for a standard one.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Great multiplayer functionality (netcode, built-in voice comms)\n+ Quick drop-in, drop-out ability\n+ Maps have decent atmosphere and varied settings\n+ Great mod and add-on support\n\nThe Bad:\n- 'Cheating' infected AI\n- Linear maps\n- Weapon variety is somewhat lacking\n- AI has slight pathfinding issues\n- Survivor bot AI can be annoyingly incompetent\n\nConclusion:\nLeft 4 Dead is a game best played with good, human teammates. Survivor bots will suffice in the beginning, but as your skill increases, you'll quickly see just how deficient bots are. Linear maps limit replayability, but this may be offset by the fact that so much community-made content has been released and is readily available for download - www.gamemaps.com/l4d\n\nWhat's the point of getting this game when Left 4 Dead 2 has everything the original has, and more? The gameplay in the original Left 4 Dead feels different compared to the sequel. In Left 4 Dead 2, there is more of a focus on rushing through hordes while under continuous attack. In Left 4 Dead, the focus is more on waiting the horde out while staying in a defensible location. The maps that were ported over to Left 4 Dead 2 from the original game have also been modified to reflect this.\n\nIf you've got no one to play with and are just looking for a server to join, at this stage, you may have difficulty finding games online, depending on where you live. The game's lifespan can be significantly extended if custom add-ons come into play, and the game can also be tweaked using various command-line startup options. I found a lot of entertainment and cheap humour in watching the bots play campaign and survival by themselves while I spectated.","timestamp_created":1638185942,"timestamp_updated":1638185942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104684796","author":{"steamid":"76561198874099058","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":499,"last_played":1644772340},"language":"russian","review":"Как

The inherent repetitive nature of a zombie shooter is not my favourite type of game to play but i still had a blast revisiting these classic campaigns. \n8/10 (Great)","timestamp_created":1638033998,"timestamp_updated":1638033998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.736271381378173828","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104388094","author":{"steamid":"76561198081731354","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":471,"last_played":1607038759},"language":"english","review":"An epic co-op game, great for fun.","timestamp_created":1638033652,"timestamp_updated":1638033652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104385455","author":{"steamid":"76561198446497593","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":200559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":764,"playtime_at_review":178768,"last_played":1660573910},"language":"latam","review":"d","timestamp_created":1638032732,"timestamp_updated":1638032732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104372110","author":{"steamid":"76561198799797238","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":457,"last_played":1627047521},"language":"russian","review":"Что 1-ая часть, что 2-ая, обе очень хороши.
