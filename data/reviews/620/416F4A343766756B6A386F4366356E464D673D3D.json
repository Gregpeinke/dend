The Story is absolutely great. It is also funny at some points and little details like that makes the games even better than it already is. At first you can find it hard to solve all these tests when you think you can't even make one. But in the end you CAN do it. Levels are perfect. It does not require a high IQ and when you get used to it you can play very fluently afterwards. Though it can get a little difficult at some points. Because it requires momentum too. And creativity, a lot. But I think Co-op is the best part of the game because even when you play a football or a racing game, it is twice as fun while playing with a friend. And if you do that in Portal 2 the fun is in the extreme level. What they say: \"Two brains are bigger than one\" This game delivers it perfectly in all the ways that you can think of in a game. I sincerely thank Valve Inc. for developing this game, it was pretty fun. I usually played this game offline so it might not show the time I spent on this game exactly. I give this game 9.5/10.

Using a Portal Gun,  could be handy in real life - one whole at whome and the other at work - walk through the hole and be instantly at work - no commuting no traffic no cyclists, anyway back to the game. Using the portal gun - Red / Blue / Grey gel switch and cube - find your way through the maze of puzzle rooms - over bottomless pits. I thoroughly enjoy this would be happy to see a Portal 3!","timestamp_created":1417862246,"timestamp_updated":1417862246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13249344","author":{"steamid":"76561198165119391","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103,"last_played":1564706537},"language":"english","review":"I've been avoiding this game for some reason, why I have no idea!!!

Только ты подумаешь что любые головоломки тебе по плечу, а эта игра уже выдаёт тебе следующий уровень, в котором ты застрянешь. Отличная графика радует уже который год! Помню, с выходом Orange Box'а   эта игра поражала!(и продолжает поражать.) Вот, спустя несколько лет я открыл для себя co-op режим. Восторг!\nP.S.- считаю эту игру достойной звания игры десятилетия, наравне с HL2, а может даже более достойной.","timestamp_created":1417852215,"timestamp_updated":1417852215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542483627796173096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47fukj8oCf5nFMg=="}
