levine了。\n\n剧情我就不说了，说了会影响体验。epic来的新人建议先从无限入手，如果能忍受大便一般的设计手感的话可以再玩一代和二代，最后再玩三代的dlc海葬两部曲。\n\n另外，玩之前最好一点剧透都不要看，但玩完了请务必要看解析，生化奇兵值得你一帧一帧地\n\n汉化补丁我放在这了，不晓得epic版本能不能用：https://m.3dmgame.com/dl/patch/30362.html\n\n最后，真心祝愿你们也能遇上属于自己的伊丽莎白。","timestamp_created":1653577093,"timestamp_updated":1653577093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559729993343353271","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116036749","author":{"steamid":"76561198062864345","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":794,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":520,"last_played":1653671471},"language":"german","review":"Liebe","timestamp_created":1653569889,"timestamp_updated":1653569889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116036654","author":{"steamid":"76561198841047683","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":443,"last_played":1653569477},"language":"schinese","review":"7小时快速过剧情，游玩过程错过无数细节，甚至在结局之前有点受够了传统RPG的玩法，但是结局真的让人眼前一亮，二刷补一补细节但是有生之年应该不会二刷了。没有人能拒绝一个随时能补充状态的伊丽莎白！伊丽莎白永远的白月光！","timestamp_created":1653569724,"timestamp_updated":1653569724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116032753","author":{"steamid":"76561198376971331","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":545,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1653560573},"language":"tchinese","review":"10分神作","timestamp_created":1653562688,"timestamp_updated":1653562688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116025281","author":{"steamid":"76561198321104715","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":591,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":591,"last_played":1653538107},"language":"english","review":"I

Gave the Bioshock series updated mechanics, a new setting, and a new philosophical critique without losing itself. Instead of a thought experiment critiquing the philosophies of Ayn Rand, this is a serious look at one logical extreme of American civic religion, while also incorporating and highlights a historical racial tensions (e.g. the Irish) that are unknown or forgotten by many Americans. Honestly the story has so many levels I can't cover them all in a review. This game has a very thought provoking story, I would say particularly so for an American audience, since the culture highlighted is so American, but also clearly morally problematic.

Ken Levine, the games’ director, takes the player on a journey across time and space, and concludes that historically there are “constants and variables.” White people along with their sense of nationalism and religion are always the prime movers of the Cycle of Oppression, while Jews and people of color are their victims. The latter may periodically engage in immoral behavior, but it is always in response to past oppression inflicted on them. BioShock Infinite uses a meta-design to attack the player both directly and indirectly, stating essentially that even if the player believes himself to be a good person who consciously adheres to the tenets of the new-age religion of egalitarianism, evil still resides within him waiting to be unleashed. He is in fact the very thing, he believes to be fighting against. In brief, BioShock Infinite conveys the message that the White male gamer’s only path to redemption is death.\"         \n-AmericanKrogan\n\nCalls for genocide of white Christians.
