While this is entirely subjective, in my opinion the best game ever is a game that has no flaws what so ever. And it is not a subjective opinion when I say that Portal has no flaws what so ever. So if you go by my standards for deciding what the best game ever is, then Portal certainly meets the requirements. \n\nBefore I get into the review I'm going to disqualify a few of the common criticisms I've heard about the game and explain why they are invalid. If you aren't interested in me ranting because you already know that I'm right then skip to the actual review part.\n\n#1 - \"It's too short\" ... Ok it's only 3-4 hours long but that's so it doesn't over stay it's welcome and narrows the gap between you and the fantastic ending. Besides, what kind of criticism is that? You can criticize a game for being too drawn out, which can make even the most enjoyable experience down right boring. But declaring a 3-4 hour game as too short is not a reasonable criticism when you only payed 10 bucks for it (most of the time you can buy it for much less than that during Steam sales) And if you're still hungry for more of the raw gameplay after the campaign, there are alternate versions of some of the levels and 3 types of challenge modes for each of the levels which brings the total game completion time to around 8 hours. I'd say that's about right for a $10 game. I mean, I've played games with the same amount of content that are double the price.\n\n#2 - \"It has no replay value\" ... Ok going to stop you there, name one puzzle game that has any replay value (and isn't randomly generated like Tetris). Of course you can't because once you solve the puzzles you know the answers and therefore won't have the satisfaction of solving it again because you already know how. Stop me if that sounds like a simple observation, but apparently it didn't cross the mind of the moron who came up with that criticism.\n\n\n\nThe Actual Review Part:\n\nPortal is a unique, first person, physics puzzle game in which you are equipped with a gun that you can shoot portals from. You can only shoot two portals at a time and as you probably guessed when you go through one portal you come out the other. The only puzzle you are tasked with is navigating increasingly elaborate obstacle courses by shooting and jumping through portals. Did I mention the courses occasionally have death traps as well?\n\nWhen asked about what Portal does right it's tempting to just say \"everything\" and be done with it. But I think the reason it's flawless is because it took a unique and original game concept then ironed it out to perfection. The entire game is focused on perfecting it's central mechanics, the portals and portal gun.\n\nThe strongest evidence for this is the fact that the entire narrative is just a framing device to hide the fact that the game is 90% tutorial. The developers knew that the very concept of portals would blow people's mind so they made the level design tight. Almost every detail in each level's design is there to reinforce and help you understand the mechanics.\n\nEverything from the first time a portal opens to the last test chamber is there to further your understanding of how portals work. What's amazing is how the game effectively teaches you these mechanics by only using it's stellar level design and it's genius environmental design. Which speaking of environmental design, the look and feel of the environments fit the narrative perfectly so nothing ever feels out of place. What's cool is how the game's brilliant and subtle use of lighting and audio cues are so naturally placed within the environment it helps subconsciously guide you through the game without ever breaking immersion or switching the tone of the game. And by the way the tone of Portal is perfect and not a single detail in it's narrative or environmental design seems out of place. On top of that, it's excellent yet subtle environmental storytelling gives the narrative a bit of depth and the absolutely hilarious comments from the game's antagonist, Glados the evil AI is just the icing on the cake.","timestamp_created":1460425404,"timestamp_updated":1460425464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22364454","author":{"steamid":"76561198141346842","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3872,"last_played":1415321252},"language":"english","review":"An amazing game!","timestamp_created":1460416483,"timestamp_updated":1460416483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22360747","author":{"steamid":"76561197971088522","num_games_owned":972,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1460399416},"language":"english","review":"Portal is an amazing game.
