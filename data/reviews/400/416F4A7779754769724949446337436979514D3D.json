Most of the games that i like are because i played them as a kid with my brothers or something, but this is just a good game. It isnt very long but i think that makes it even better. I cant say I beat it in a day because i beat it in 3 hours. Its just funny in its own kind of way, like it feels as though the puzzles are just distractions from crazy robot lady. Also the end credits song is like really good.","timestamp_created":1659497367,"timestamp_updated":1659497367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119971940","author":{"steamid":"76561199143625065","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":207,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1660303809},"language":"english","review":"amazing game","timestamp_created":1659496164,"timestamp_updated":1659496164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119970152","author":{"steamid":"76561198316407310","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1659317601},"language":"english","review":"Love this game!","timestamp_created":1659493186,"timestamp_updated":1659493186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119967115","author":{"steamid":"76561198074504812","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":493,"playtime_at_review":722,"last_played":1659419414},"language":"english","review":"I absolutely loved this game!

Neste caso, o jogador toma posse de uma arma que dispara portais, onde um você pode entrar para sair pelo outro, e vice versa (isso é melhor compreendido ao jogar o jogo). Essa mecânica é relativamente simples de ser dominada, porém eles souberam diversificá-la tão bem que é como os desenvolvedores estivessem realmente experimentando sua própria tecnologia, já que muitas fases exigem algumas manobras com portais e também o uso de física e velocidade. Assim, Portal é uma excelente escolha caso aprecie um bom jogo de puzzle com uma boa história, fora isso que ele é praticamente obrigatório na sua biblioteca caso seja um fã de jogos da Valve.\nTenha um bom dia, tarde ou noite.","timestamp_created":1659403137,"timestamp_updated":1659403205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119911819","author":{"steamid":"76561198866432210","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":11,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1659402284},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1659401566,"timestamp_updated":1659401566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119908552","author":{"steamid":"76561199084879910","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":317,"playtime_at_review":1730,"last_played":1659835522},"language":"english","review":"Portal is the highest ranked game on Steam. \nSo... why are you even bothering to read the reviews? You already know that pretty much everybody here agrees the game is great.\nIt would be easier to just list the things I don't like. So I will do just that.\n\n1) The challenge runs.\nAfter beating the main game, a series of bonus maps are unlocked. These consist of advanced maps, which are just levels from the latter half of the game edited to be harder, and challenge runs, which are these same levels but you're limited in terms of either the number of portals you can place, the number of steps you can take, or the amount of time you can take.\nNow, the limited portals run is great, as it adds another layer of puzzles on top of this puzzle game. Some great new game+ content! The timed run is a bit challenging and a bit annoying, but it's still a perfectly reasonable challenge to add. But the steps run, why is that in the game? It requires that you find the perfect route throughout the level, and not once make a mistake. Also, the step counter is super broken, I could do the same movement, but get numbers ranging from 2 to 5 steps. HOW!??!\n\n2) Test chamber 18 is a bit annoying.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThose are the only two issues I had with this game!\n\nSo what are you waiting for?
