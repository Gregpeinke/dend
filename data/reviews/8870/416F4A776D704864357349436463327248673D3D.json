It is very good, but the battles aren't quite as enjoyable as Bioshock, but considering how high that game set the bar, it's definitely a level of greatness I wouldn't expect a company to do more than once. It is possible, but this game is a hair less memorable and ultimately as important as Bioshock, depite the \"epic\" storytelling and twist ending. I'm still not quite sure whether or not the twist was properly foreshadowed. Also, the bosses are not difficult. Moreover, the game is too easy when compared to Bioshock and especially System Shock 2. I suggest playing on Hard, nothing less. 1999 mode is as insanely difficult as ever, but that's a given. This game had a big impact on me and my understanding of first-person shooters. It's worth playing, even if you didn't play Bioshock.

When we played our ataristation 360s with sticks and leaves, we never thought video games would come as far as they did. Well, now here it is: Bioshock Infinite 3-D 2: Electric Slide.\n\nThe 2D perspective of the game is rather disappointing, in an age that’s grown used to conventions such as the Virtual Boy and 64 bit power of the Atari Jaguar, but I digress. It fits the mood of the game well enough and really pulls you in to the world of Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nThe characters are all stick figures, which is fine for racing games, but not here. The voice acting is equally inexcusable, mostly consisting of a 12 year old yelling into a microphone about that time he got pantsed in gym class. Total laziness.\n\nOverall, I recommend it, but only if you buy the codpiece and 3D glasses that come sold separately. It’s a game for the whole family, but don’t let kids play it.\n\n7.51/10","timestamp_created":1386470060,"timestamp_updated":1386470060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7962771","author":{"steamid":"76561197995895256","num_games_owned":381,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1465,"last_played":1482879176},"language":"english","review":"What I liked the most in Bioshock was the interaction with Elizabeth. There is something happening from the beginning and towards the end you really have a connection with this NPC. Not a lot of games achieve that.\n\nOn the story side, it's good but not that good. A lot can be predicted and the ending feels a little bit too much; an explanation more than anything else. Why not explain using scenes and dialogues during the game instead of keeping eveything for the end? I understand that they want a \"wow!\" effect but I think this could have been done differently.\n\nThe combat mechanics are nothing new (except for the sky-lines fights maybe) and become very repetitive at times. I sometime wished for less combat and more story. Especially the fights against the Handyman... did not like those at all. The wepons are also not really interesting and I did not find myself liking one more than the others.\n\nOn the visual side of things, it looks great. The environments are gorgeous and diverse. The sound effects are also top notch.\n\nIn the end, this is a good game but with little to no replay value.

Bioshock Infinite is the perfect example of games that do nothing very well and getting rewarded for it.\nYou make choices that have no bearing on anything. Gun upgrades are practically useless as ammo depletion necessitates using underpowered ones you haven't upgraded yet. Elizabeth has no actual presence during gameplay. Lockpicking and finding secrets are obnoxiously easy, even on the touted \"90s mode\" you'll end up with more lockpicks than there are even doors to unlock.

Infelizmente Rapture não é mais o lugar onde a história se passa. Ao invés disso temos Colúmbia. Columbia é o oposto de Rapture. Impossível não comparar. É bem iluminada, enquanto a outra é obscura. Está cituada nas núvens, enquanto a outra está cituada em baixo da água. É absolutamente religiosa, enquanto a outra é completamente avessa à religião. Seus cidadãos não têm muita noção de individualidade, enquanto os cidadãos de Rapture são tão individualistas que de degeneram no egoísmo.\n\nNo entanto, Infinity deixa claro que o objetivo dos produtores é proporcionar uma reflexão moral. O jogo não tem um enredo menos filosófico e profundo que os primeiros. Desta vez o intuito não é mostrar qual é a degeneração do egoísmo, e sim qual é a degenaração da coletividade. Infinity fala sobre uma sociedade que acredita cegamente em seu lider, que segue e pratica fielmente todas as suas excentricidades como se fossem os próprios mandamentos divinos.\n\nA história é muito boa! Quase tão emocionante e envolvente como a do segundo jogo. Está cheia de reviravoltas e assim como o primeiro tem um final bem surpreendente. A jogabilidade é a mesma, apesar de que os poderes que vc tem são diferentes. E na minha opinião eles são menos úteis, o que me fez jogar Infinity como um jogo de tiro mais convencional. Isso além do fato do jogo ser mais voltado pro fps. Mais inimigos na tela atirando em vc.\n\nEu apenas lamento pelo fato da história não se passar em Rapture. Mas o jogo tem uma DLC (que eu ainda não joguei) que se passa em Rapture no período pré guerra civil.

Но далеко не всегда за навороченностью стоит расчет. Люди боятся показаться недостаточно умными. Люди, считающие себя творческими, — особенно. Авторы учебников — вдвойне. Дизайнеры — втройне. Для маскировки используется заумь. Чем непонятнее выразился, тем лучше — никто не обвинит в отсутствии оригинальности. Если бы миром заведовал среднестатистический дизайнер, то на дорогах вместо белых полос разметки были бы виньетки в стиле хохломы, палеха и гжели. Красиво ведь.\"(Артемий Лебедев)\n\nПо поводу геймплея:\n Заявка была на невероятно крутой геймплей, авторы грозились невероятным экшеном, где у тебя нет шансов отсиживаться в бою где-нибудь в углу. У меня спокойно получалось отсиживаться с револьвером в углах, и укладывать всех ваншотами в голову. Даже патроны искать не нужно, всё принесёт Элизабет. Разве что от Handyman'ов приходилось уныло \"укатываться\". Столько сил вложили в геймплей, а геймплей-то и не нужен. Абсолютно уродский приём с \"другими измерениями\", когда нельзя спокойно провести курсором по экрану, чтобы не быть ослеплённым мразными вспышками.\n\nПлюсы не изменились с прошлых частей, а минусов прескорбных добавилось.\n","timestamp_created":1386432041,"timestamp_updated":1386432041,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":55,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486125975847244263","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7954483","author":{"steamid":"76561198002632178","num_games_owned":627,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1462,"last_played":1393533003},"language":"english","review":"Good shooter and story, but little replay value ;/","timestamp_created":1386430694,"timestamp_updated":1386430694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7954261","author":{"steamid":"76561198112621214","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1638559143},"language":"dutch","review":"Best game ever made!+","timestamp_created":1386429647,"timestamp_updated":1386429647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7954223","author":{"steamid":"76561198015914606","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1124,"last_played":1575199592},"language":"italian","review":"Gioco e storia assolutamente fantastici, un altro capolavoro della Irrational Games :D","timestamp_created":1386429503,"timestamp_updated":1386429503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7954072","author":{"steamid":"76561198016108144","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":551,"last_played":1498263415},"language":"brazilian","review":"Since the original Bioshock..one of the best game series ever !!!!","timestamp_created":1386428714,"timestamp_updated":1386428714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7953966","author":{"steamid":"76561198055637618","num_games_owned":347,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":4030,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1374,"last_played":1447448198},"language":"polish","review":"IMO one of best games ever. :)","timestamp_created":1386428256,"timestamp_updated":1386428256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50285792350769043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7953830","author":{"steamid":"76561197992332811","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":951,"last_played":1364799600},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game, a must play.","timestamp_created":1386427555,"timestamp_updated":1386427555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7953621","author":{"steamid":"76561198029914763","num_games_owned":605,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":578,"last_played":1451256154},"language":"english","review":"Amazing, the city of Columbia is just astonishing and the multiple ways to fight gives good variation to it.
