The gravity gun is, of course, one of the most prevalent of these concepts.\n\nStuff like that just made it stand out. I didn't feel like I was just mowing down enemies; I was strategizing; and before things got stale some cool new thing was added to the mix.\n\nBeyond the gameplay though, it's also got a really incredible world. From City 17, to the long stretches of coast, to the zombie-infested Ravenholm--\nA lot of care and thought was put into the design of this game's world, and it shows.\nIt's a place I can actually just explore around and admire. The fact that they never take you out of first person during the events of the game for things like cutscenes makes it even better--I actually feel like I'm surviving through the events of this world!\n\nCool story, cool world, well-written characters, and constantly refreshed gameplay--it's basically everything I look for in game.\n\nWhy hasn't the sequel come out again?\n","timestamp_created":1427603190,"timestamp_updated":1427603190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15102731","author":{"steamid":"76561198131953034","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":120515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":456,"last_played":1585507521},"language":"english","review":"What makes Half Life 2 an outstanding sequel, is that it improves on the foundations laid by its incredible predecessor. It features an engaging and well written plot,  interesting characters, balanced gameplay, great level design, tough AI, groundbreaking physics, unique weapons (Gravity Gun), impressive graphics that have aged rather well, fantastic sound effects, and a sense accomplishment when progressing through the game. However, its biggest strength, is that it is fun and makes you continue through the story.

Игра-легенда. Она покорила сердца многих и даже сейчас остаётся в них. Так же, как и в моём. Первая часть игры была моей первой игрой на компьютере из шутеров её я проходил долго исследуя каждый уголок, потом когда я узнал что вышла вторая часть побежал в магазин покупать и не мог не как не нарадоваться. Вторую часть я прошёл раз 20 уже знаю все пасхалки все закоулки, и даже сейчас я продолжаю играть в неё. Так всё же что такое Half-Life это игра на все времена и в неё должен сыграть каждый достойный геймер. Так же в игре присутствует невообразимая атмосфера и великолепный сюжет с неожиданной концовкой во 2 эпизоде. Что ещё вам сказать…хмм…точно, а ну-ка бегом покупать игру!!! и обязательно пройдите все части если вы не проходили (думаю таких людей уже почти не осталось кто не слышал это слово \"Half-Life\" ). И мой вам совет начните с первой части этой игры.\nИГРЕ Я СТАВЛЮ 10/10","timestamp_created":1427479502,"timestamp_updated":1427479647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503744602203369141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15078294","author":{"steamid":"76561198083339825","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1034,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":769,"last_played":1610447185},"language":"czech","review":"Super hra best hra ever","timestamp_created":1427478911,"timestamp_updated":1427478911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15077028","author":{"steamid":"76561197999089228","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1673,"last_played":1465247309},"language":"french","review":"HEHEHEHEEE....\n\nBAH EVIDEMMENT!","timestamp_created":1427473140,"timestamp_updated":1427473140,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15076239","author":{"steamid":"76561198142695208","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1,"last_played":1574658779},"language":"english","review":"Played through this game three times.\n\nSteam says I've played for 42 minutes.\n\nSteam's timers are not very good.\n\nThis game is very good.","timestamp_created":1427469630,"timestamp_updated":1427469630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15075899","author":{"steamid":"76561197993650434","num_games_owned":1330,"num_reviews":192,"playtime_forever":1508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":991,"last_played":1561813079},"language":"russian","review":"[spoiler]Этот обзор содержит в себе скрытый код, если вам удастся его расшифровать, вы узнаете дату выхода HL3.[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1427467865,"timestamp_updated":1427467865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uuHtrcwCe6PBOQ=="}
