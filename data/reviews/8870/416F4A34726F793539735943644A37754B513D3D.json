Because it was on sale and I thought it would be neat to see if I could mod it a bit like some other games. Turned out there aren't many mods out there, mostly SweetFX.\n\nSo, I ran it and put max settings on, and when it loaded for the first time. Man. It almost looked like a whole bew game. The visuals are so ncie to look at that I don't think it even needs a mod.\n\nSo, thats the superficial stuff out off the way - what about gameplay and story?\nThe gameplay is relatively standard with RB-Wep RT-Shoot LB-Choose Ordinance LT-Use Ordinance\nBut - there are upgrades for both weapons and ordinances(Vigors) - and you can combine them both too, Pretty nifty to have some good combinations going. It feels good to control, and might I add so much smoother than the console. I think the console version may have been 30fps which is why it gelt laggy back then and not as nice. Feels pretty smooth on my PC, and is enjoyable gameplay for sure.\n\nThe Story - I don't want to give anything away. Let's just say - it is VERY engaging, has plenty of twists and can make you feel touched at times, if you're a human, at least. If you do not feel touched at one point - you are a robot.\nThe story is just amazing. I'd say it almost does for FPS what FF7 does for JRPGs.\n\nThis will be in my top 20 for a looong time.

BSI certainly gave me many feels during its ending. \n\nThe plot misses the opportunity to develop on some great themes that it establishes (racial exceptionalism, the acceptability of violence as a means to justice, struggle for power) which may leave the world feeling slightly emptier than it could have been. The game also does little to give you (Booker) a reason to hate the antagonist, Comstock, aside from supposed wrongdoings he commits in the name of exceptionalism. Until Comstock personally screws you over (which does happen), you would have to imagine a personal reason to fight Comstock.\n\nDespite the shortcomings of the plot's developments, if one is willing to personally invest oneself and plant oneself in Booker's shoes, one can still find that BSI manages to elicit a good deal of emotions (sort of like playing an RPG and creating a character with a backstory for yourself). While some gripe that the constant addition of new ideas were disorienting (e.g. the sudden revelation that quantum mechanics had a big part to play in BSI), I found myself itching to discover more to answer those question marks.\n\nAnother gripe some people have is with Elizabeth. They claim that Elizabeth is nothing more than an ammo/health dispenser and offers little in terms of character development. While Elizabeth's character does fill a well-worn trope, her mechanics in game do make her feel different from the countless hordes of companions in many other games. Most companions are followers: literally in that they often trail behind as you venture forth and figuratively in the way they are most often secondary to the player character. Even in Dragon Age: Origins (which I loved), hailed for its awesome character development, the companions' character does not extend beyond dialogue and in combat you often control their actions (which makes sense for a party based RPG). \n\nWhat Elizabeth brings to the table is a companion who feels more human during the actual gameplay. Instead of being a second gun who works independently of you in a gun fight, she augments the player's combat abilities as a support that seemingly has a mind of her own, often providing you with aid when you least expect it (e.g. when you are getting pummeled and have resigned yourself to death). A simple touch of providing her with AI to run in front of you to where you intend to go further strengthens her human-ness. Admittedly, she could do with a more outstanding personality and it would have been great if BSI expanded upon the times she expressed revulsion at Booker's tendency for violence. \n\nThe shooting tends to mellow after a while. Some complain about the dragginess of combat and how long a firefight takes but personally most fights went by relatively quickly for me when utilising headshots with the carbine. Admittedly sticking to the same weapon grows stale and there were little incentive for me to move away from the ammo efficiency and pinpoint deadliness provided by the carbine - aside from trying out the crazier weapons for kicks. Drawn out firefights could have been more interesting if there was gunfire flying everywhere, but hey, this isn't a war simulator. Similarly to firearms, the vigors have a clear hierachy of value and a handful are just simply more useful in straight up combat situations. Nevertheless, the small set of weapons and vigors I found useful were still a blast to use. \n\nPerhaps it was because of my choice to experience the plot like a traditional RPG, putting myself into Booker's shoes and filling in the details in his character myself. Whatever the case, the ending and its out-of-the blue nature inflicted buckets of feels upon me which persisted for some time (which is hard to elaborate on without spoiling everything). And thus if you decide to take BSI for a ride, I would highly recommend avoiding expecting the game to provide a fully fleshed out character and instead be Booker himself. The Booker that BSI provides is an excellent template and the player doed not need to do much to fill in the blanks. The ride is enjoyable, Columbia is beautiful and you would be missing out on a great experience if you let shortcomings in the plot stop you from seeing the plot at all.","timestamp_created":1404144902,"timestamp_updated":1404144902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10977972","author":{"steamid":"76561198108496758","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1125,"last_played":1631480017},"language":"english","review":"Well this is the most fun i have had in an FPS in a long time!!!","timestamp_created":1404144626,"timestamp_updated":1404144626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10977873","author":{"steamid":"76561198001777280","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1399,"last_played":1609728768},"language":"english","review":"goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood","timestamp_created":1404144353,"timestamp_updated":1404144353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10977842","author":{"steamid":"76561198116720763","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1807,"last_played":1530221740},"language":"english","review":"A truly remarkable game.

I'd recommend this game to anyone I met who enjoyed First Person Shooters. \n9.5/10","timestamp_created":1404144279,"timestamp_updated":1404144279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10977366","author":{"steamid":"76561197961424089","num_games_owned":710,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":907,"last_played":1533978562},"language":"english","review":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS754wsiMbo\nWorth it.","timestamp_created":1404143072,"timestamp_updated":1404143072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490040302276611328","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10977303","author":{"steamid":"76561198094376490","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1517605217},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомедную!\n\n\n        BioShock Infinite является духовным наследником первого BioShock, в этот раз Кен Левин дал нам возможность побывать в летающем городе Колумбия - это красочный и \"живой\" город , который интересно исследовать. Но наши приключения начнутся с уже знакомого нам места...\n        Пару слов скажу о сюжете , он правда гениален и не заставит вас скучать и даже заставит задуматься. И так , наш герой Букер Деввит (детектив) получает задание достать одну девушку, по имени Элизабет , из города Колумбия. Вокруг этих двух героев и будет развиваться сюжет.\n        Так же в этой игре затронута религиозная тематика , если вы не ярый фанатик , то эта игра заставит вас задуматься о нашем бытие.\n        Геймплей в этой игре весьма забавен и прост , экшена  хватает и самое главное то, что на фоне летающего города все выглядит очень круто.\n        По моему это одна из лучших игр 2013 года , я постарался не спойлерить и рекомендую всем ценителям сюжета в играх пройти ее.","timestamp_created":1404142931,"timestamp_updated":1404146054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61832815408706665","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10977302","author":{"steamid":"76561197993742020","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":637,"last_played":1409413556},"language":"french","review":"Du grand bioshock dont il est difficile de se lasser !\nDe l'action, de la réflexion et le tout avec des graphismes toujours bluffant!
