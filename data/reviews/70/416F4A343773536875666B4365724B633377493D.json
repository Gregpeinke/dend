Graphics are not amazing, but they have their charm and I'm sure they were very cutting edge when this game released back in 1998. Movement can feel great and then feel not so great. It's a mixed bag. Some of the design in this game can also prove to be frustrating. I had to turn on god mode a few times due to not having enough health and some parts being near impossible to go through without taking damage. Plus that final level is a just a barrage of enemies which proves very difficult, even on easier difficulties. I'm sure some of this was due to me being bad, but there were a lot of parts were enemy design and placement felt cheap.\n\nHowever, this game has a lot of things that have aged very well. The music is fantastic and is always used very appropriately. There are also so many really cool set pieces. Every area I went through was not only well designed (level wise) but was also super memorable. The puzzles were also very well done and I was able to figure them out without the game ever spelling it out for you. The story is also simplistic, but very interesting and always had me intrigued. Plus it helps that the character of The G-Man is not only very menacing but is like the only one in the game to have decent voice acting. Lastly, the gun play still feels so rewarding and fun to play with a lot of cool weapons at your hands. \n\nSo, it's definitely NOT a perfect game. But if you give the game a shot, I'm sure you will find a lot to love here.","timestamp_created":1621190970,"timestamp_updated":1621385837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92116327","author":{"steamid":"76561198157354234","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1640376056},"language":"spanish","review":"ta
