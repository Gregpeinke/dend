The idea of the game is that you are a test subject, who is completing a run through various chambers with the help of a portal gun. \n\nThe whole game is extremely entertaining and proves that you don't need Action, Horror or whatever. Just give people something to experiment and some puzzles to figure out and they are going to have a great time. Graphics are of course from 2007, but nothing really to complain about. The voice acting of Glados is excellent and very funny and the credits song is just amazing.\n\nThe story is unfortunately only about 4 hours long (A lot of people are claiming to beat it in around 2 hours, did they speed-run ?) , but with the advanced bonus maps and the challenge maps you can probably add a little bit to that. Nevertheless I enjoyed myself extremely and this game is a clear recommendation to every gamer. You shouldn`t miss it out.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1481053037,"timestamp_updated":1531620987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28224248","author":{"steamid":"76561198120003242","num_games_owned":333,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1555529722},"language":"french","review":"J'ai pris un énorme plaisir à y jouer.","timestamp_created":1481051743,"timestamp_updated":1481051743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28223141","author":{"steamid":"76561198030769950","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1436564137},"language":"english","review":"Great game","timestamp_created":1481047497,"timestamp_updated":1481047497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28222557","author":{"steamid":"76561198257225438","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1657458862},"language":"danish","review":"MEEEEGA GODT SPIL","timestamp_created":1481045196,"timestamp_updated":1481045196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466666668653488159","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28221335","author":{"steamid":"76561198200327686","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1016,"last_played":1619804746},"language":"brazilian","review":"Como posso explicar sobre esse jogo?
