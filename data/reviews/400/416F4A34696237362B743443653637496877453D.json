Back when I was in middle school one of my friends had introduced me to it and I decided to get it for myself and buy the orange box. I remember playing this back on my early 2000's desktop computer that could barely run Tf2 at the time. I remember specific levles, like the one with the mulitple platforms that make you use momentum to keep climbing higher and higher. I also remember really enjoying the game on a whole even though it was rather short. Going back through the game for the second time many years later it still holds up well and gave almost the exact same feelings as before. The levels really do a good job of ramping up difficulty in a way that is not too abrupt but also not too slow. The gameplay is smooth and allows for tons of cool tricks with the portal gun. The story is minimal at first but really ramps up near the end. The atmosphere is just how I remember it too, it really gives off a sort of eerie vibe. This is especially true in the end portion of the game. As you play through each test chamber you get a increasing sense of dread and lonelyness, these feelings are only amplified even more by the minimal soundtrack, and the  sometimes overly creepy chambers and notes left by ratman. When I played this game the first time as a kid  Iwould always be creeped out by the ratman portions. I have fond memories of talking with friends at school about how you can find the ratman, or how if you go to certain parts of the map you can hear his voice, I would spend many times trying these rumors out on my own. I guess the only complaint about this game is its playtime, but even that is negated by the advanced levels and challenges you can do afterwards. I had never tried them as a kid but now I have gone through and completed each advanced level, and they are indeed much harder. I especially hated the one with the turrets in the cages. Overall, Portal is an instant classic for me, it is a wonderful start to their series with plenty of fun puzzles and unique gameplay coupled with an interesting story that always leaves me wanting more.","timestamp_created":1508035844,"timestamp_updated":1508035844,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35731789","author":{"steamid":"76561198426420547","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1270,"last_played":1601409840},"language":"russian","review":"9/10 Отличная игра!","timestamp_created":1508022534,"timestamp_updated":1508022534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35728319","author":{"steamid":"76561198113467987","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1498915120},"language":"russian","review":"/","timestamp_created":1508011783,"timestamp_updated":1508011783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35724571","author":{"steamid":"76561198063333331","num_games_owned":438,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":167,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":167,"last_played":1480429170},"language":"english","review":"Great story, i love the hell out of GLAD0S, it took me 2 hours to complete.

Игра отводится за девушку Челл, которая оказывается втянута  ГЛэДОС в прохождение различных головоломок в тестовых камерах. Для прохождения тестов Челл использует портальную пушку для создания порталов, которые помогают быстро перемещаться или достигать труднодоступных мест.\n\nЗдесь и нестандартный геймплей, интересные уровни, хороший саундтрек. Сама игра не сложная в прохождении  и продолжительность составляет около 2 часов, но если вы хотите выдавить все соки из игры, то проходите игру с получением всех достижений,  тогда вас точно заставят попотеть.  \n\nДаже спустя  10 лет игра не перестает меня удивлять, поэтому она обязательна к прохождению. Она придется по вкусу всем игрокам серии Half-Life, потому что в игре много пересечений с событиями оригинальной игры, так и просто любителям головоломок. \n\n[i]10 из 10 кусочков тортика[/i]","timestamp_created":1507364303,"timestamp_updated":1655319370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.646263241767883301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ib76+t4Ce67IhwE="}
