Either you like it or you hate it.\n\n[b]One shouldn't forget that the game is from 1998 / 1999 and is therefore one of the really old games.[/b]\nDue to the age, it is of course absolutely not comparable with current games, even if they are retro games. Whether they are created from scratch and with a retro look, or are simply technically polished, a Half-Life will always play differently than \"younger\" games.\n\nI'm a total Half Life fan. It's no secret and I don't make any of it.\nThis is probably due to my age and the fact that I played the game for hours after it was released. I even have the packaging with CD-ROM somewhere (if anyone else knows 😉)\n\nAs far as I know, [b]Opposing Force is one of the first add-ons[/b] for half-Life.\n[b]The story[/b] about Black Mesa and the planet Xen [b]is (almost) the same here[/b], but this time you don't experience the events from Gordon Freeman's point of view, but as [b]soldier Adrian Shephard whose job it is to hunt down scientist Gordon Freeman.[/b]\n\nAt the beginning of the story you are on your own as usual, but this changes as the game progresses. \nWith their different abilities, the scattered soldiers form a team that can act together from now on, as long as the AI plays along. \nUnfortunately, it happens every now and then that you run into a room full of aliens alone and the AI comrades-in-arms are standing around somewhere else.\nNevertheless, the presence of the teammates pays off because you have the option, for example, to always have a medic on the team or another team member who welds open locked doors.\n\n[b]In terms of action, the add-on is in no way inferior to the main game.[/b]\n\nOnly for younger or new Half-Life players there may be an issue (as mentioned in my [url= https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/70/]Half-Life review[/url]) that the game feels or plays \"weird\".\n\n[b]In my opinion, the add-on is a must-have for die-hard fans.[/b]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]MY PROS AND CONS (FROM 1999):[/b]\n\n✅ absolutely gripping story\n✅ Great level design\n✅ breathtaking atmosphere\n✅ Pure excitement\n\n❌ basically too old\n\n[hr][/hr][b]
