Pretty much anyone who plays this game nowadays are spawn point campers that'll put mines on every spawn point possible and Muslims that make fun of you and crack a 911 joke at any given time. This game can still be good if the spawn points couldn't be camped. Not to mention barley anymore plays it so it definitely isn't worth buying.","timestamp_created":1416080757,"timestamp_updated":1498671110,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.451463222503662109","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12939526","author":{"steamid":"76561198076151054","num_games_owned":941,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":124,"last_played":1414609862},"language":"english","review":"Fun multiplayer with the half life 2 maps.

Has Fps action + the ability to \"sprint\" with the games physics allows it to be a fast-er point and click shooter if not the fastest and the props/objects effecting it even more make it unique requiring good senses, reflex, smart reactions, coordination with just about everything to play at a decent potential. Where else can you Yoyo a grenade to keep it from 'cooking' it's fuse out before propelling it on it's last fuse reset that you can time for distance and height in coordination with how fast you are moving and your target's speed and the force of the 'gravity gun' you use to propel it with, no where else but hl2dm. Has different kinds of unique weapons like the gravity gun propelling a object to a person to kill them with, or propelling that object against another object to move that away from a distance. And to block a path with many objects or stack objects to reach a platform. Also the crossbow is an example of unique weapons with how it fires in a arch and hard to aim with even with it's scope but can kill a player instantly and with correct positioning can bounce of the floor walls ceiling terrian etc. and with enough practice can be well aimed to kill a player half the map away behind 2 corridors and a room. That is a taste of the Uniqueness of this game, after overlooking it's default multiplayer team vs team worth, there is it's booming in vast unique options to how to play the game with it's community's modded creations, there is co-op themed maps where you can fight with teammates against hordes of aliens, zombies, monsters and cyborgs getting points with the ability to use them to unlock server abilities to costumize your character with a deferent apearence, both in model skin and size, lights that glow on your model, lights that follow your model and more, then there is puzzle maps where you may enter 1 of 12 parts of the map at a time with your team or individualy and complete tasks like finding the exit in a labyrinth or placing and freezing a pile of crates to build a terrian leading to a exit floating high above in the sky or surfing on long slides without falling into abyss to reach a exit or jumping over ditches, climbing and avoiding obstacles in a temple like area to reach another exit to collect all exits and unlock the last portion of the map to complete it. Then there is Roleplay... a blend of multiplayer fps combat with gta style like the need to Purchase weapons or health or armor. Earning money by the minute with the wage given by your level or killing others for their pocket money, then saving that money to invest in a faster method of earning money like growing drugs to sell or printing money both to us on getting more guns or to purchase a home to hide in and to keep your drugs or printer safe, from other players or other players playing as Cops... who may not only steal your illegal possessions but will also place you in jail for some time so that they too may earn the points they need to progress faster and easier in that server. You may also invest in a home to hide from all players and keep your possessions safe, and to meet with your group of friends to prepare for a war against another gang, or to meet with your gang to prepare for a war against the police in alliance with other gangs for fun or for an event to earn more $. Also events are constant and include situations where a monster is spawned in the map similar to the any/many of the ones found in co-op maps that drop money on death. Another situation would be looking all over the map to find an object or player hiden with more $ $ $ that is given to the winner that finds it first. Or when admins just decide the server is full enough for a mass money drop in the middle of the map including weapons and item drops. There are also many more mods but I just thought to name a few of the ones that have me so adicted to this game. This game is worth the very low ticket price for all the fun is has to offer and is very much Alive, if not so is still rich with creativity you never know what's next.

puedes jugar un poco fluido.Los mapas son muy buenos y entretenidos las armas son muy buenas,los mapas personalizados hacen mejor este juego.Pero hay problemas los jugadores abusan brutalmente de los trucos no dejando jugar a gente que juega limpiamente,ademas esa es una de las razones por la cual este juego cayo algo bajo pero aun sigue en pie,No solo eso los jugadores abusan de la velocidad de correr y el lanzacohetes y algunas veces las granadas o el lanzagranadas tambien la ballesta consume casi toda la vida si tienes energia en el traje y en el caso de no ocurrira una muerte instantanea (Es normal que ocurra ya que en la anterior entrega ocurria lo mismo)Pero es muy abusada y el revolver tambien haciendo que la pistola la palanca,el subfusil y el fusil de asalto AR2 y algo de la escopeta no sean tan utilizados.Pero al fin y al cabo un buen juego sin duda alguna es un buen juego lo recomiendo.\n\nNt:Ten cuidado en algunos servidores ya que habra jugadores que pocas veces causaran problemas al entrar al servidor haciendo que tengas dificultades al empezar a jugar.","timestamp_created":1413557997,"timestamp_updated":1516426801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12505236","author":{"steamid":"76561198129909491","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1518601078},"language":"english","review":"need
