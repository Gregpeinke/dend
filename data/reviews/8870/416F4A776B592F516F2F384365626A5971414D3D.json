Bioshock returns with Infinite's new, but old, spin on the series.  Infinite takes place decades before Rapture and the original Bioshock but, *Spoiler Alert, perhaps there's a connection to the original two.   Infinite is a much lighter, brighter game.  Being located high in the clouds certainly paints a more well lit, open environment which is definitely creates a strong contrast to the originals.  The graphics, even in 2022, are still impressive.  Environments are well laid out with multiple paths.  The world is very well developed and the characters populating it are very entertaining and intriguing.  The only knock I'll give the game is with the ever growing number of 4K+ displays, Bioshocks menus are microscopic being originally designed for 1080p screens - get ready to lean in and read once in a while :P\n\nGameplay has definitely been sped up making it a more action packed prequel - the rails you travel along throughout the game are especially fast and add to some creative combat.  \n\nFor some, these changes could welcomed as the stealth, puzzlers that proceeded it could be seen as tired and overused.  That's where this game might get knocked by fans of the originals.  Gone are the \"hacking\" of turrets, picking of locks/systems, and upgrades of plasmids.  Yes, Infinite has SALT (aka Plasmids) and weapon upgrades but they're a lot easier to achieve and less of a necessity to survive - additionally, the weapon upgrades do not add any cosmetic changes to the weapons or projectiles.  Infinite allows for \"outfit\" upgrades that can give you offensive, defensive, or ammo/health perks but they're not as creative as Bioshock 1 & 2's passive systems - always loved equpping \"electric skin\" and let's the splicers get the first jab to then be electricfied by my passive defense system. One could argue that Infinite, being a prequel, wouldn't have the same level of sophistication as it's an origin story.\n\nInfinite is definitely a new chapter to the Bioshock series which could be considered innovative.  Booker, and Elizabeth are your protagonists.  Booker is the character you play for the main game as well as Burial at Sea Episode One.  Elizabeth is a support character for BI and B@S but becomes your primary character in Episode two which returns you to Rapture and a similar play style to the original.  Both characters are likable and definitely create a really intriguing story that ends well, or does it?   The presence of Elizabeth as an NPC in the first two chapters can cause some people to be skeptical.  An NPC side sounds gimmicky but her presence never hindered gameplay and most certainly drives the story since no one really knows who this mystery girl is.\n\nOverall, Infinite was a good game.  It's not as deep as Bioshock 1 or 2 but a worthy entry to the series.  If you kindly have 15 hrs to commit to the main game and the two episodes, I recommend picking up this title.","timestamp_created":1646436926,"timestamp_updated":1646436926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"111551017","author":{"steamid":"76561198124973860","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2131,"last_played":1646416703},"language":"english","review":"Cool story, awesome ending, fun gameplay.

bir sanat tasarımı. İnanılmaz bir serinin en güzeli dediğimiz o nadide oyun. \n\nSen dostum, evet sen. Utanma ve gel buraya çünkü oyun olarak sana mükemmel bir deneyim sunmaya hazır bu güzel oyun. Öncelikle hikayesi harika. Ve nasıl desem öyle harika öyle güzel bir apokalitik dünya sunuluyor ki, apışım kalıyorsunuz. Şunu söylemem lazım, oyunu oynarken loruna dikkat edin hikayesini anlamaya çalışın. Zira diğer oyunlarının süpyancı robotlarının aksine burada keyif alıp merak edeceğiniz güzel bir şeyler var. \n\nSanırım fazla övdüm hikayeyi. Mekaniklere gelecek olursak kesinlikle kendini oynatıyor. İkinci karekter olarak yanımızda bulunan güzeller güzeli tatlı mı tatlı elizabeth oyunda size her anlamda yardım edecek. Tabi fazlası zarar ;) Onunla ilerlediğiniz çoğu zaman yardımına ihtiyac duyduğunuz bir karakter. Saf fps olarak kalmayıp içine büyü dinamiklerini katmasıyla acayip keyif vermekte.\n\nPeki bu oyunda kötü ne var? \n\nÖncelikle oyun eski arkadaslar. Teması ve sanat tasarımı sayesinde bu o kadar göze batmasa da bunu kabul ederek oynamalısnız. ikinci olay ise kesinlikle bir yerden sonra büyü ve skillerden bir kaçı dışında diğerlerini kullanmıyorsnuız bile.\nBaşka bir olay ise yaşayan bu güzelim şehirde gerçekten yaşayan bu şehirde mapler biraz kısıtlı. Şöyle ki alanlar geniş fakat ne kadarı dolu derseniz ara geçişler dediğimiz yerlerde baya boşluk var. Ama dert etmeyin çünkü oyunun size nefes aldırdığı yerlerde ise hikaye ile beraber sizin ilginizi çeken ve sizi sıkıntıdan çıkaran onlarca şeyle karşılaşacaksınız.\n\nSon olarak oyun 49 lira eder mi açıkcası bence eder. Fakat oyun eski olduığu için sanırım 20 lira civarında indirim ile alırsanız sizin için daha tatlı olacaktır.\n\nCanınızı yerim, gözlerinizden öperim. Okuduğunuz için de teşekkür ederim. \n\nSeviliyorsun Booker DeWitt press to F for respect.","timestamp_created":1646167882,"timestamp_updated":1646167882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.573943674564361572","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkY/Qo/8CebjYqAM="}
