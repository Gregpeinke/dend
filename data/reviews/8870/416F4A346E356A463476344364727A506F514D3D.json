Can't kill Elisabeth (and I sure wanted to kill that stupid bitch, especially after betraying me!) Another ONE environment game. Being in the skies for an entire game isn't any more interesting than being underwater for an entire game. You can only hold two weapons, and are thus always short of ammo. Once again, all the story is told via voice recordings instead of using the npcs in the game. SHOW DON'T TELL YOU IDIOTS!!! Elisabeth really isn't an interesting character. Supposed to have been in a tower all her life, but still knows everything about the real world – wut!? Half of the game is spent looking for her as she constantly gets kidnapped, runs away, etc. World is completely static once again – there are no destructable objects whatsoever. Duke Nukem 3D was already able to do it in 1996 you incompetent nimwits! NPCs completely ignore your presence when you come at them with weapons. Earlier, before I had weapons, they did in fact look at me and sometimes even talk to me LOL. Literally THOUSANDS of searchable containers but only maybe 10% of them actually hold items you need at the point you search em. And in this game, you can't even refill your health or mana (or \"salt\", whatever that is) with a key command WTF! Instead Elisabeth (who is not with you half of the time) sometimes tosses you shit when she feels like it. Normal mode is way too easy. I'm halfway through the game and haven't died a single time. Then again, you can jump off ledges, only to respawn at the point where you jumped instead of falling to your death! Oh, the big one: no free saving. That alone is reason enough for a thumb down. Fucking console port, and not even that is a valid reason as consoles had harddrives at that point in time. Voxophone recordings don't have subtitles and are often really hard to understand. I'm supposed (or more likely forced) to help the \"good\" \"anarchist\" black underground fighters against the evil white man. Fucking hell, at least they kept that PC shit out of the first two games (except for Minerva's Den). There's a bug with scrolling the voxophone transcriptions that makes the text disappear til you click again, though that's no biggie. I don't like ANY of the people in this game. NONE OF EM, and that includes the utter blank of a protagonist. I've never heard one guy talk so much and say so little! Which leads to another problem: just like with the first 2 games, you are nothing but a passenger. You can't make ANY choices other than choosing to either kill or not kill a few people during your playthrough. When at the same time, you kill hundreds of human enemies (of a whooping idk 3 different types) without a second thought. Cognitive dissonance much? Have the creators of these games really not played Deus Ex or even the lesser DX Human Revolutions?! You're not even given the option of using a non-lethal weapon in this one. I can't see the point of the skyrails, all using them does is to make me dizzy. I'm only at the halfway point of this game now, but seriously this is enough for a big fat thumb down. I bought this heavily discounted, and it's got a decent number of achievements, so don't ask why I bought this – it still fulfills its purpose. But as a RPG(-like) shooter, this fails epically just like the other two games.\nPS: Elisabeth, with her HUGE anime eyes, is just so unbelievably UGLY. What an uncanny valley failure. And how old is she supposed to be anyway?!?! Before you find her, there's literally a growth chart for her, putting her at 190 cm at age 20, but when you find her, she's an entire head smaller than Booker (btw stupidest first name ever), who is 6'1\". So she's like 14? It's completely impossible to tell from her looks, since like I said above she just doesn't look human!\n\nEDIT: after playing almost to the end, I'm gonna give this game two awards: worst story ever, and worst characters ever (it just barely missed worst setting ever). The story of this utter DRECK can be summed up by BLA BLA BLA blala prophet blalagbl balblbalablb tear BLAAA. That's the noises the utterly UNBEARABLE characters (seriously the worst two characters I've ever experienced out of shonen garbage lilke e.g. Naruto) make. Sometimes those seem to resemble human words, but alas, there is nothing nothing NOTHING here that resembles even a spark of human creativity. This is for video games what Serial Experiment Lain did for anime, the epitome of creative nihilism. In other words, nothing makes any sense, nothing means anything, nothing has any value or redeeming quality. I couldn't come up with worse story or characters even if I tried. In fact you, dear reader, couldn't either. The fact the characters (usually the girl) keeps blaming you for choices THE GAME DIDN'T LET YOU MAKE (oh and you can't even decide to NOT do something like e.g. comfort the girl, the game will not let you proceed until you press f, even if it's the last thing you the players actually want to do in that situation!) is just beyond insulting, it's in fact something I deem a crime against all humanity, and the writers of the game should be punished as such (and obviously there is only one punishment for a crime againt humanity). Oh and the primary antagonists weren't any better, with their ultra-fundamentalist and quite stereotypical ways (the religious tyrant, the black white-hating stupid bitch (I don't even consider her an anarchist, she just was an unbelievably hateful bitch) and the greedy \"capitalist\" (do have a look at the Columbia after the revolution for a world where capitalism doesn't exist, by the way, lefties...).\n\nThe final twist of this game is still ahead of me, because the (I assume) last battle is one of the worst abominations in game design I've experienced in my life: your ship got a life counter, and you are bombarded by enemies periodically, but there's no way to tell whether you're doing anything right. AT ALL. Of course, that's something I've already experienced in some other games, so it's just a temporary annoyance. The above, though, will stand for all eternity as some of the most negative potential humankind ever managed to achieve. As so often, the only way to win Bioshlock Infinishit (that's what it indeed is)... is not to play it. Oh and there's no doubt in my mind that final twist will make everything worse and more nonsensical than before LOL.\n\nAs for me, if I actually play it again to pick up the remainder of the easy to get achievements, I, just like with Bioshlock 2, will turn off the voices and subs so I never have to experience even a glimpse of any of the writing of this terrible terrible game.\n\nPS: I often found it rather hard to figure out where enemies who already were shooting me were, which isn't helped by the fact you don't have a minimap (or indeed a map of any kind). That wasn't a problem in the first 2 games, and lead to many of my deaths in the last third (after very few deaths in the first two thirds).\n\nPPS: Oh, and another thing: the 4 first gears (more like pieces of gear) I found... were the same I used til the end of the game. This aspect, just like the vigors, is TERRIBLE even for the low low standards of this game. 5% increase to light radius would beat in usefulness literally 95% of the gears I found!!!\n\nPPPS: I have to add: what keeps this from being worst game of all time is the decent shooting mechanics. Going for headshots is mostly rewarding. Of course, in the end it all blends together with hordes of identical enemies that could be taken straight out of Serious Sam.\n\nPPPPS: I could go on and on and on with this but no more room. Anyway, the direction key: it's really poorly implemented. The visual info stays for less than a second (!), which means you have to spam it. Then, it keeps changing its mind which direction it wants to send you too. And one time, it plain sent me around in circles. I'm not kidding.","timestamp_created":1644191769,"timestamp_updated":1644374121,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.321806669235229492","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109681573","author":{"steamid":"76561198026115878","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":1174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1174,"last_played":1395599864},"language":"english","review":"Gameplay is great if you can get through the stupid story and not hold it against the rest of the game.","timestamp_created":1644189322,"timestamp_updated":1644189322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109680437","author":{"steamid":"76561199167514832","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":744,"last_played":1644187816},"language":"spanish","review":"El creador estaba más fumado que los de la coca adulterada, god","timestamp_created":1644187961,"timestamp_updated":1644187961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109678377","author":{"steamid":"76561198147606106","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":995,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":964,"last_played":1654700700},"language":"schinese","review":"[h1] “Booker, are you afraid of God? ” [/h1]\n\n[i] 比起虚无缥缈的神，我更惧怕你。\n惧怕与你的相逢，惧怕与你的别离。\n惧怕情感的扎根，惧怕情感的抽离。\n惧怕你出现在命运的每一个节点，惧怕你在命运的每一个节点凋零。\n神明如此遥远，而你触手可及。 [/i]\n\n[h1] “No, I'm afraid of you. ” [/h1]","timestamp_created":1644185564,"timestamp_updated":1644185673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109677972","author":{"steamid":"76561198245013418","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1014,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1014,"last_played":1623701610},"language":"english","review":"[h1] INFINITE [/h1]\n\n                                               [h2] The Legacy [/h2]\nBioShock Infinite is the 3rd installment in the brilliant BioShock franchise, developed by the legendary team of developers behind many influential RPG/shooter hybrids of the past.\n\n                                              [h2] The City In The Sky [/h2]\nRight off the bat the game teases you with themes and symbolism from prior games before sending you to the heavens, to the city in the sky; Columbia. \n\nWhile not as interesting as the underwater stronghold of capitalism that was Rapture, the religious plot points and commentary presented during our protagonist's stay in Columbia still gives the player plenty of food for thought. The symbolism ,however, doesn't end there.

Being released in a time when games were too afraid to let the players off to do their own thing it is far more linear than previous entries, perhaps [b] too [/b] linear as most of the play area consists of corridors and the occasional slightly larger battle arena. Gone are the branching paths, secret areas,the more sophisticated puzzles or medkit and \"mana\" syringe stockpile of BioShock 1 & 2. Sure you have locked doors that require a new type of resource, lockpicks, to unlock but at the same time there is very little need for exploration if you are already full on both health and salts.  On the other hand though, Infinite still provides an incredible amount of options in combat (despite its 2 weapon limit) with returning and even entirely new powers and weapons and especially with the addition of the skyhook, allowing you to perform crazy stunts straight out of a John Woo film. \n\n                                                     [h2] Infinite Possibilities [/h2]\nOverall, BioShock Infinite is one of the best first person shooters released in recent years, retaining much of what made the last 2 games great, providing tons of insight into the universe for existing fans but at the same time also allowing for newcomers of the series to hop on and enjoy the ride.","timestamp_created":1644185083,"timestamp_updated":1644185262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109677057","author":{"steamid":"76561199226848212","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1644939676},"language":"english","review":"absolutely you must play this game to see mankind utopia is a nonsense","timestamp_created":1644184078,"timestamp_updated":1644184078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109674116","author":{"steamid":"76561199090824833","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1030,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":474,"last_played":1649111664},"language":"english","review":"i havent finished it yet and ihave no intentions to, this game gets boring after fighting in arenas and arenas all over again with no unique thing happening. the lore is probably good but hot damn the gameplay is stale, repetitive and boring","timestamp_created":1644181055,"timestamp_updated":1644181055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496363610029220581","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109667430","author":{"steamid":"76561197985132041","num_games_owned":427,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":810,"last_played":1613530991},"language":"english","review":"Soft game with poor mechanics and outdated textures.

Playing on hard wasnt difficut just annoying. the story is decent but nothing like 1 and 2 .. its basically with that universe set in mind with out being in the universe. If you just want to play through for the story it is interesting but i suggest playing on normal difficulty because i felt like i was just running around looking for ammo the whole time even with elizabeths help. I dont think the bioshock games are good fun shooters they are more about the story and using ur plasmas but inifinite just felt like it fell short in every aspect compaired to 1 and 2. Loosing the horror vibe and failing short of being a good shooter with a worse story than 1 and 2 makes it by fare the worse in the trilogy","timestamp_created":1643995443,"timestamp_updated":1643995443,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109490651","author":{"steamid":"76561199045858006","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1651445708},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo lindo e gostoso.","timestamp_created":1643995296,"timestamp_updated":1643995296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109490150","author":{"steamid":"76561198315304976","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":943,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":923,"last_played":1644169471},"language":"schinese","review":"到枪匠那关就开始卡顿，试过了网上能找到所有办法都无法解决，卡顿就算了，我也能忍受着玩下去，结果到了找三个缝隙那里直接银行的场景都不加载了。我机器是CPUI5 显卡3060 系统WIN10，网上有很多说WIN10会遇到很多问题，毕竟是2013年的老游戏了，制作组的更新也没针对WIN10做优化。","timestamp_created":1643994890,"timestamp_updated":1643994890,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109489577","author":{"steamid":"76561198835935494","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":546,"last_played":1643994392},"language":"russian","review":"бля это кайф, надо пройти и все\n\n\n10 разломов из 10","timestamp_created":1643994444,"timestamp_updated":1643994444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109488926","author":{"steamid":"76561198062192054","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":948,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":948,"last_played":1643913762},"language":"german","review":"Hammer geile Story!","timestamp_created":1643993947,"timestamp_updated":1643993947,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109484116","author":{"steamid":"76561198205238219","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1194,"last_played":1643988223},"language":"schinese","review":"从第一代到无限玩到最后真的是百感交集。高高在上的哥伦比亚天空，深不见底的销魂城，都是双手触及不到的乌托邦世界，但从中经历一轮才知道这一切都根本不存在。只有为了女儿赴汤蹈火上百次的布克和放弃神力挽救莎莉自由的伊丽莎白让我们明白，美好的生活就在自己手中，就在自己脚下。","timestamp_created":1643990111,"timestamp_updated":1643990111,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109480207","author":{"steamid":"76561198181876602","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":236,"last_played":1645186772},"language":"schinese","review":"[h1]掉san模拟器[/h1]","timestamp_created":1643986806,"timestamp_updated":1644249176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109478110","author":{"steamid":"76561198241563232","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":458,"last_played":1645615868},"language":"schinese","review":"永远的经典佳作！！！！","timestamp_created":1643985083,"timestamp_updated":1643985083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109476806","author":{"steamid":"76561198101049851","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1424,"last_played":1525480096},"language":"english","review":"Great","timestamp_created":1643983979,"timestamp_updated":1643983979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n5jF4v4CdrzPoQM="}
