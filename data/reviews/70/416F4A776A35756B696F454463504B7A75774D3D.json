It's still a good game, arguably a great one, by modern standards, but the fact that its influence is so vast and powerful means that most of modern games employ its techniques, and as such, most of the \"surprises\" in this game are staples of modern FPS design. Its shadow is greater than itself, and in parts, the game has turned into a history lesson more than anything.\n\n[h1]They're waiting for you, Gordon... in the test chamber.[/h1]\n\"What makes a good game?\"\nThis is the question that crawls in my mind when I sit to review this game. Should one take its historic context? Its lineage, its influence? Or should one just take its state as-is and review it like any other game of the present era?\n\nHere's what I think: if you have any interest in the history of first-person-shooters, this game is a MUST. Its influence is one of the most reverberating of its time and its shadow looms over many classics of today, such as Counter-Strike, TF2 and Borderlands. Not only that, but for its era, it had a lot of impressive features such as dynamic storytelling and robust enemy AI.\n\nOn the other hand... well, look, it's not a bad game, not even by modern standards. Its pacing works well, its enemy roster is creative enough and the gunplay feels pretty good. But other than that, when played today, Half-Life is not that good. I mean, it's good, but it's not unmissable.\n\nDue to the amount of influence it has, if you have played any modern shooter campaign, you kind of already played Half-Life in a way. Not only that, but its story, while somewhat mysterious and arguably intriguing, is still way too basic and non-specific to genuinely wow anyone. It has some great setpieces, and it also has some pretty boring sections. It's, you know, a normal game.\n\nSo... yeah, I do feel it gets a bit overrated at times, but not in the sense that it \"was never that great to begin with\", just that it has... aged. It was great, and now, well... it's just good.","timestamp_created":1654047777,"timestamp_updated":1654047777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116314000","author":{"steamid":"76561198112189754","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2199,"last_played":1656212297},"language":"english","review":"\"yore

Everywhere becomes a labyrinth filled with countless enemies you're never equipped with quite enough ammo for, all the while it starts making you utilize the antiquated movement system to make complex maneuvers while getting attacked on all sides.
