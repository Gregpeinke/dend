The video game that started the modern generation on first-person shooters and revamped the gaming history into a new era. Originally released in November 2004, the game won multiple game of the year awards and branched gameplay mechanics, including physics and the state-of-the-art game engine that look realistic during its release date. Many people are aware on the game’s popularity and everlasting legacy including various jokes on the awaiting sequel (for many years), but the question remains: Why is this game popular?\n\nThe game takes place after the events from Half-Life. You play as Gordon Freeman, the silent protagonist who got a Ph.D. on theoretical physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and knows how to use weapons very effectively; a strange paradox for a character with such features yet highly popular and well-recognized. You are sent to City 17 by the G-Man, a mysterious person or a phenomenon with a mysterious and ambiguous agenda, to overthrow Wallace Breen and the alien oppressors, the Combine. The setting and lore in the Half-Life universe is simply the best, taking some influence from George Orwell’s 1984 or other famous dystopian novels to set the story in tone. Gordon’s influence and previous actions will spark oppressed citizens in City 17 to take arms and revolt against the Combine. From City 17 to the prison at Nova Prospekt, each setting is unique, bleak, but beautifully designed, the game simply defined what a video game should be. \n\nEach NPCs and major characters such as Doctor Issac Kleiner, Barney Calhoun, and other characters interact realistically among each other and to you. In regards to Alyx Vance, your ally and companion, Valve spawned the concept of AI teammates and became a true asset in your journey to rally up the oppressed citizens. Besides good character developments, the best attribute for Half-Life 2 was physic interactions and the game engine. The game engine is Source, which feature high-dynamic range rendering, facial animations, and “realistic physics”; the first game that had such a feature like this. \n\nAre there criticisms for the game? I believe so, but to be honest, I couldn’t find any legitimate criticisms for the game. If one criticism has to be addressed, then the problem is the loading sections. Yes, those tedious loading that interrupted the “flow” in the middle of a long level or after finishing a series of firefights against Civil Protection or Combine forces. These loading or “checkpoints” really halt the immersion in the game. However, this is very common on all Half-Life games and I hope that Valve would address this (if they are working on the sequel…). \n\nHalf-Life 2 is pure gold, shining flawlessly on the test of time. With great graphical fidelity at its time, voice acting and realistic AI interaction from your allies and enemies, this game is a rare exception of genuine perfection and grand role model for other game developers to pursue their own game designs. The only thing Half-Life 2 (and its episodes) is a full fledge sequel. Besides many jokes, anxieties, and waning patience for Valve to announce the sequel, the game should be in every PC gamer’s Steam library. No exception. Half-Life 2 is simply the best; a grand overture that started and defined the modern gaming industry in the present time. \n","timestamp_created":1465102807,"timestamp_updated":1465102807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":62,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.787954270839691162","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23392245","author":{"steamid":"76561198135120842","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":645,"last_played":1473063722},"language":"english","review":"how can you hate this game?","timestamp_created":1465095857,"timestamp_updated":1465095857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23391755","author":{"steamid":"76561198034979883","num_games_owned":617,"num_reviews":153,"playtime_forever":1364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":449,"last_played":1653630521},"language":"english","review":"What killed it for me about this game was the fact that you couldn't save Lazlo.
