Seriously how can anyone not like this. \n\nBesically, the story goes like this:\n\nYou play as Chell, a silent but determined test subject who is trapped in Aperture Science. The facility is run by a psychotic AI named GLaDOS(Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) who makes Chell go through some deadly tests involving a gun that shoots portals(the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or as I like to call it \"ASHPoD\"). They're easy as first, but as you progress they get harder. During testing, GLaDOS promises Chell things like cake and grief counseling. However, after Chell discovers some graffitti revealing the AI's true intentions, Chell is skeptical of this so called \"reward\". After dodging adorable but deadly turrets, flinging through portals, and incinerating a cute box, you finally make it to the last test chamber. I would tell you what happens after that, but I don't want to spoil the surprise. \n\nPortal has a great storyling, great characters, great graphics, and amazing gameplay.

De la pose des portails à l'utilisation des cubes en passant par le jeu des plateformes, un ingénieux mélange de ce qui fait aujourd'hui un bon plateformer (et hier qui était révolutionnaire) donne l'un des meilleurs jeux du millieu de la décennie 2000'.\n\nEnsuite les personnages, l'histoire et l'ambiance (quoique bien moins développés par rapport au deuxième opus) nous permettent une immersion importante dans ce centre de sciences sans fin, entre les dédales des machineries et une gladOS plus puissante que jamais, on accroche !\n\nEt pour finir les musiques et les graphismes, assez sympa pour l'époque, jouant sur l'industrialisme et la modernité du titre pour faire disparaître les \"Imperfections\" de la nature (idée a prendre avec des pincettes bien sûr) et ne laisser que des murs blancs maussades qur lesquels trônent les caméras de surveillance.\n\nVoilà tout pour cette agréable expériance, qui nous a tous marqués, notamment grâce a son immersion et son ingéniosité de gameplay cité précedemment. Oui, sa durée de vie faible en fera frémir certains, qui préfèreront se ruer sur le second titre, plus complet, moderne, beau, possédant un mode multijoueur et plus supporté par les mods (création de maps et d'aventures), mais ce premier opus reste, et restera encore à travers l'histoire du jeu vidéo une excellante surprise de la part de Valve et pionnier d'une nouvelle ère d'énigmes et de plateformes.

It has an excellent antagonist in the form of an A.I. called GLaDOS.\n\nPortal is a memorable experience and if you liked Half-Life you should pick up this Valve product, as well.\n\nOh, you didn't like Half-Life? Then, please go and have a cake. :)\n\nPS: I'm not sure why I have zero hours logged for this game. Probably because the logging system was introduced after I completed Portal.

And I have to say - it's pretty darn brilliant.  It's one of those few games where the mere act of playing it seems to make you smarter.  At one point I had to view a 'Lets Play' to proceed, but this was only about 20 minutes from the end, and it turns out it's simply because I missed something.\n\nThe game shows you the strategies to solve puzzles gracefully and effectively, and by the end, when it all goes off the rails, you'll be using these almost as a survival method.  And with this gradual increase in complexity, the game is always a head-scratcher, but never frustrating.  The closest the game gets to frustrating is when you find yourself failing at the loop jump repeatedly.  For the most part, if you fail at anything, it only takes you a minute or so to get back to where you were to try again.  And that makes it one of the very few games that's very challenging but only more and more addictive simply because of this fact.  Playing it literally makes you feel like a genius, solving puzzle after puzzle.\n\nTo add, this game has an interesting low-key musical score (with a brilliant song at the end), polished minimalist graphics and a well written computer that manages to be both silly and an engaging villain.  There are some performance issues, from regular screen tearing to occasional freezing, but I've never experienced a crash or anything like that, so there are just nitpicks.\n\nOverall, having never played this game until its legendary status was so established that references to it are almost out of style, I must say that it passed this near Retro-Review with flying colors.  I might not give it a full 10/10, but I do think a 9/10 would be slightly too low.  Maybe like a 9.3/10 or something.
