No entanto, não deixa de ser uma expansão legal em alguns aspectos.\nA campanha é rápida, com uma história que, embora não aprofunde grandemente a franquia, traz um novo ponto de vista que é bem interessante. Há discussões se é realmente canônico, eu prefiro acreditar que seja.\nDe qualquer forma, Blue Shift serve para conhecer melhor o nosso amigo Barney Calhoun, que depois volta no segundo jogo, além de matar a saudade se você tiver zerado Half Life e ainda quiser mais. Recomendo também a expansão Opposing Force, que é ainda melhor.","timestamp_created":1627961823,"timestamp_updated":1628214601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96845243","author":{"steamid":"76561198018690084","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110,"last_played":1656043616},"language":"english","review":"Hey I know this one, its a classic!","timestamp_created":1627956896,"timestamp_updated":1627956896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96843336","author":{"steamid":"76561198804383231","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":333,"last_played":1627953266},"language":"spanish","review":"Neutral ending","timestamp_created":1627953691,"timestamp_updated":1627953691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96840876","author":{"steamid":"76561199194293791","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":358,"last_played":1628037750},"language":"russian","review":"banrey","timestamp_created":1627949509,"timestamp_updated":1627949509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96840486","author":{"steamid":"76561199104267182","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":134,"last_played":1627973991},"language":"english","review":"got this on the steam summer sale for like 80 cents and it was worth it its more than a great deal its a full length expansion through black mesa and xen from the eyes of barney","timestamp_created":1627948847,"timestamp_updated":1627948847,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96825014","author":{"steamid":"76561198929549822","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":137,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1660494048},"language":"english","review":"How about we remove everything from Opposing Force that made it great and fill it with bugs?

Aun con todo esto recomiendo jugarlo si jugaste las otras entregas ya que es igual de entretenido y expande aún más la historia de lo ocurrido en Black Mesa. Lo único malo que tiene es que, al iniciarlo por primera vez, tiene una configuración que no permite al jugador mover la cámara libremente pero se soluciona fácilmente desde las opciones de controles marcando la casilla de input por mouse.","timestamp_created":1626812044,"timestamp_updated":1626812044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96085582","author":{"steamid":"76561199073145457","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":58,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1650677555},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bueno, muestra el punto de vista de barney calhoun (el tipo que nos ayuda en half life 2),  hasta ahora que aun no lo completo se ve muy bueno y tiene el mismo nivel de puzzles que half life, aunque me decepciono que esta expansión tenga solo las armas del half life y no nos de más catalogo de armas (cosa que opposing force si hacia y este salio medio año antes).
