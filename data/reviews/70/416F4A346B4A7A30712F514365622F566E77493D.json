Sin embargo, durante el experimento algo no sale según lo previsto y Freeman abre un agujero interdimensional que da acceso a un mundo paralelo llamado Xen, el cual está poblado por criaturas extraterrestres.\n\nSeré directo: la historia, a pesar de ser muy avalada por la comunidad de jugadores, me ha parecido un desastre.\nNo me malinterpreten, el guion es muy interesante y en 1998 sería una maravilla, pero hoy en día me parece que la narrativa y cómo te cuentan la historia no está a un nivel decente. No entendía casi nada de lo que sucedía en pantalla y he tenido que recurrir a medios externos.\nNo obstante, como he dicho, lo que cuentan finalmente me parece estupendo, deseando empezar el siguiente de la saga.\nY el Traje de Protección HEV… El traje directamente vuelve a Freeman un Dios o un Doom Slayer.\n\n**3/5 estrellas**\n\n*JUGABILIDAD*: Half-Life fue la revolución jugable de finales de los 90.

Yeni nesil oyunculara söyleyeceğim ilk şey bu oyunu bitirmeyen kimsenin kendisine gamer dememesi gerektiğidir. Grafiğine bakmayın oynarken alışacaksınız zaten döneminin cidden çok üstünde bir oyun. Oyunda hiçbir ara sahne yok senaryoyu tam anlamıyla anlatmayıp merak etmemizi sağlasa da anlattığı zaman tamamen oyun içi şekilde anlatıyor yani ara sahneyi oynuyormuşsunuz gibi oluyor. Yıl 1998 olmasına rağmen tüm oyunda bir tane bile uzun süreli yükleme ekranı yok sadece sonraki bölüme geçtiğinizde 2 3 saniyeliğine oyun durup loading yazıyor. Biraz gerici ve ıssız bir atmosferi var. Bölüm tasarımı ise oyunun en güzel yanı çünkü tüm bölümler birbirinden farklı chapter 12 hariç o da biraz uzun kaldım diye sıkıldığım hiçbir bölüm yok. Çok güzel ve şaşırtıcı bir finali ve kesinlikle çok güzel bir final boss fight'ı bulunmakta. Oynanış açısından da o dönem çıkan fps'lerin sadece silahı alıp önüne geleni vurmaktan ibaret olduğunu düşünürsek bu oyundaki silahlar bilim kurgu temalı olmasından da kaynaklı olarak öyle normal bildiğimiz silahların yanında kendine has dizayn edilmiş kullanımı eğlenceli silahlar da bulunmakta. \nKısaca olumlu yanlarına bakarsak:\n-Bölüm Tasarımları birbirinden farklı ilerlediğinizi çok iyi hissediyorsunuz.\n-Hikayesi ve evreni fazlasıyla merak ettirici ve şaşırtıcı, güzel bir finali ve son boss fight'ı var.\nOlumsuz yanları ise:\n-Az sayılmayacak derecede salak saçma bugla karşılaştım yani 98 yılında çıkış yapmış bir oyunda hala bu kadar bug olması çok saçma.\n-Bunu özel olarak Half Life için değil 90'lı yıllardaki oyunların çoğuna söylüyorum oyunda çok gereksiz bir zorluk var. Yani bu zorluktan kastım Dark Souls'u oynayıp bitirmiş aşşırı zevk almış birisiyim yer yer gıcık etti elbet ama eski oyunların zorlukları böyle bir zorluk değil yani yapay zeka mükemmel diye zor değil siz az vuruyorsunuz o çok vuruyo. \nPuan vermem gerekirse 96/100","timestamp_created":1599270209,"timestamp_updated":1599270209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602649033069610596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75456838","author":{"steamid":"76561198096024875","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1056,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":753,"last_played":1610327602},"language":"spanish","review":"mu weno","timestamp_created":1599267505,"timestamp_updated":1599267505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75450606","author":{"steamid":"76561198037759019","num_games_owned":438,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":335,"last_played":1641203493},"language":"english","review":"If I have to ride that tram one more time I'm gonna...","timestamp_created":1599256588,"timestamp_updated":1641209170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75448673","author":{"steamid":"76561198038484993","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":816,"last_played":1599257418},"language":"english","review":"TLDR:  Rail-shooter that once set a standard and is now showing its age.\n\nI remember when Half-Life spilled onto the scene twenty years ago. At the time, people were still arguing the supremacy of Quake vs Duke Nukem vs Doom for the king of the FPS heap. Then in stumbled a new game, sometimes dubbed the \"thinking man's FPS\" and the genre was never the same again.\n\nI got it on Steam mostly on the nostalgia factor; I sank so many hours into it back in the day I wanted to see if still measured up. Taken in isolation and compared to the games of its day, I think it did all right ... but as one would expect it has ceded ground to newer and better shooters since then.\n\nHalf-Life is the story of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist at Black Mesa, a top-secret research facility where scientists are monkeying with stuff they shouldn't be. As usual, that kind of nosiness doesn't end well. A dimensional gateway opens, flooding the facility with all kinds of beasts and it's then up to the player to help Freeman save the day. You'll find a crowbar to defend yourself, then plenty of other guns and goodies along the way. Eventually, the military will show up to rescue everyone ... I mean, \"rescue\" everyone and things get more complex.\n\nGameplay is straightforward, with a default WASD/mouse movement scheme, L/R clicks to attack and alternate attack. The controls are ... adequate. Certain objects--such as wheels and switches--can be interacted with to open doors, raise or lower water levels, move cranes out of the way of rail tracks, etc. The game pretty much has one path you can follow so if you find yourself unable to advance, you'll have to look for some of these items. Some advancement requires puzzle solving; for example, the Blast Pit requires the player to find and turn on the oxygen and fuel lines to fire a test rocket--though to get to those, you have to sneak past a blind but very powerful mob that can basically one-shot you. Just don't make a sound. Generally speaking, the puzzles add depth and tension to the game, though some are aggravating. Far too many points in the game require pinpoint running and jumping and I'm glad that (aside from platformers) modern games have largely left that trope in the dirt.\n\nEnemies are varied and have their own behaviors. The most basic alien animals will simply charge. Humans will fire and seek cover. Some of the more exotic aliens present their own challenges. A handful of big ones are all but bulletproof, forcing you to find other ways to evade or defeat them.\n\nThe game's ambiance is pretty decent; before the disaster you'll see scientists and security going about their daily tasks, discussing experiments and other happenings at Black Mesa. After, you'll find their bodies, or see them getting attacked and eaten. Those that live often offer to help Freeman by opening doors or providing clues about how to get around certain mission objectives, and so on. You can ask security guards to follow you and they will do a decent job of attacking enemies for you (though the guards don't last too long). Consoles will randomly explode, radio messages about what's happening can be heard, and you'll come across the military fighting the monsters, in some places giving you the choice of running through while everyone's distracted or just killing them all.\n\nOne nice aspect is that because the game is older, it runs well on just about any modern machine, with a small footprint and virtually no disc space.\n\nHaving said all that, the game feels dated because, well, it is. Textures and shading are some of the most glaring examples. For all the NPCs you'll see, there are like three models for scientists and one for security guards, and all are pretty angular, even on higher resolutions. The game will sometimes load new areas and even on a powerful PC, will freeze in the middle of a hallway for five seconds with the word \"LOADING\" on the screen. While the sound is mostly good, it's limited. Each enemy tends to make one or two sounds, repeated over and over. There are only a handful of military \"radio static\" message patterns, all of which sound like dull squawks. Again, dated.\n\nThis game is also a fair bit harder than modern shooters. Maybe I was just younger with faster reflexes when it first came out but I remember back in the day HL being one of the only shooters where I felt the competitive multiplayer was more forgiving than the single-player game. Even on easy mode, it is very simple to get shredded in by enemies in HL, or fall to your death, get electrocuted, run into industrial fans, fry yourself in radioactive goop, etc. There are a lot of ways to die in every area and most players will find them.\n\nMy biggest gripe is about the controls which feel sloppy and uncontrolled. Simply tapping the AD keys (even holding Shift for \"slow\" movement) can send you flying to the side. Great when strafing to avoid combat. Bad during precision jumping sequences, which this game has aplenty of and the jumping, especially in places where you can't get a running start, feels very inconsistent.\n\nHalf-Life is a good game and a good throw back. I don't think most people will find as sharp as today's best shooters--in appearance, content, or interface--but if you can pick it up for a couple bucks, it's still worth playing.\n\nPros\n- Nostalgia! Can still be fun, after all these years\n- Minimal install, runs well on just about any modern machine\n\nCons\n- Anyone who grew up on modern shooters is probably going to find it unforgiving\n- Graphics, sound, and controls dated\n\nFinal Score:

been good when it was published but today everything is just simply terrible.\nIt includes a lot of:\n- getting stuck in floors\n- NPC not doing what they're supposed to do, locking the game\n- things that aren't obvious but never explained\n- falling since you're basically always running on ice\n- visual glitches\n\nKinda sad to see how bad it really is since otherwise it doesn't seem too bad but

게임엔 그다지 많은 말이 필요하지 않습니다 이건 현대FPS의 뿌리 그 자체이기 때문이죠,예를 들어 이전 FPS는 텍스트 쪼가리로 스토리를 전해줬다면 하프라이프 이후의 FPS는 마치 내가 여기 있는것과 같이 컷신으로 게임의 스토리를 전달하게 된겁니다,그것말고도,몇몇 퀘이커들이 비공식적으로 쓰던 WASD조작방식을 정식으로 들여와서 지금 했을때 그래픽은 모르겠지만 조작감하나는 지금과 다를게 없을거라는 느낌이 들겁니다,그리고 많은 모드들의 본산이기도 하죠,데이오브디피트,카운터스트라이크,팀포트리스등 걸출한 명작들이 이 게임의 모드에서 시작했습니다  지금 이걸 해본 저로는 명작이긴 하지만 딱히 추천드리고 싶진 않습니다,핲라 소스나 블렉메사를 대신 해보길 추천드림니다,그 이유는 현대적인 게임과는 다르게 시야가 사람마다 안맞는경우도 있고,그런경우엔 흔히 3D멀미라고 물리는 어지럼증이 일어날수도 있거든요,예전 그래픽에 익숙하시거나 블렉메사를 해보고 이걸 해보고 싶다는 생각이 드신다면 할만한게임임은
