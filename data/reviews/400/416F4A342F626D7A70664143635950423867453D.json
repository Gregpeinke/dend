Portal is an amazing puzzle solving game which was revolutionary at the time of its release by the portals and other technical pieces. Players could either take the game slow and learn as they go along while others can try to speed through it for the fastest time. This gave the players more of a drive to comeback and replay it. The game is a little too short though, but that was fixed in the newest game, Portal 2. Portal was an all around treat to play and Glados was probably my favorite part due to her humorous lines which kept me always waiting for the next sarcastic line to come out. This game I will recommend to anyone who wants an amazing puzzle experience.\n\n10/10\n~K4STOR","timestamp_created":1581975714,"timestamp_updated":1581975714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63689127","author":{"steamid":"76561198001906186","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":492,"last_played":1599316235},"language":"english","review":"its good","timestamp_created":1581973360,"timestamp_updated":1581973360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63687086","author":{"steamid":"76561198830681345","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":81,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":81,"last_played":1581970182},"language":"english","review":"vibe'd it . gg ez","timestamp_created":1581970311,"timestamp_updated":1581970311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63686370","author":{"steamid":"76561198956603311","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":678,"last_played":1585190813},"language":"brazilian","review":"bom","timestamp_created":1581969327,"timestamp_updated":1581969327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63685159","author":{"steamid":"76561198073797089","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1122,"last_played":1641320118},"language":"swedish","review":"Ett pusselspel som alla andra.

The environments are well crafted, the interactions between portals are flawless, and the feel of the world is almost tangible.  I will have endless hours of replay and this game is never leaving my library.  \n\nOpinions:\n1) The storyline is nice but I would not call it \"rich.\"  There is very little background to explain why humans were being tested in the first place or who the protagonist is as a character.  \n\n2) The player has no choice on how to forward the storyline yet nearly everything is framed in the concept of a choice.  Alternate paths and solutions would actually create more options for the players than simply placing portals and following a hard scripted path to the finish line.   \n\n3) She is superhuman?  Fall assist boots aside there are impacts and falls that no average human would survive.  On a few momentum challenges, she hits a railing that would cut her in half, and she can brush off bullet wounds in a few seconds.
