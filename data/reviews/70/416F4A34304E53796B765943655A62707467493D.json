For one it causes motion sickness. Unfortunately I'm the unlucky few that is affected by this but with a couple of settings changed I barely noticed or had symptoms. Minimize window (biggest effect), Change fov to around 110, Turn of Bobbing!, and Unlock frame-rate which is locked at 100. You can find how to do this online.\n\nAs for the story. I think most of us are familiar with the Mc Gordan Freeman. He's a scientist that had to toughen up to save his ass. I have to reiterate that this game is hard. They're are so many annoying easy to die to enemies like Doom. But unlike Doom the game can be very strategic. \n\nThis is a great copp if it's on sale and would be fun and hard if you download a graphics mod.

Unfortunately, the scientists are filled with pride, and they are too stubborn to take consideration of a possible catastrophic event. Despite their efforts of tuning their scientific equipment to safety status, unforeseeable consequences came. Extra-dimensional aliens manifested around the facility, caused by the infamous anti-mass spectrometer. Gordon lost the people he knew, his associates, co-workers, friends and family. In spite of all of this, Gordon is confident enough to maneuver through the ruins of the infamous facility, with the aid of the cutting edge HEV suit, and his impeccable intellect.\n\nThe game features an arsenal, with various guns and scientific tools.

Its primary features are two pieces of a durable material, attached as back and seat to one another at a 90° or slightly greater angle, with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in turn to four legs—or other parts of the seat's underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers can turn—strong enough to support the weight of a person who sits on the seat (usually wide and broad enough to hold the lower body from the buttocks almost to the knees) and leans against the vertical back (usually high and wide enough to support the back to the shoulder blades). The legs are typically high enough for the seated person's thighs and knees to form a 90° or lesser angle.[1][2] Used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g. in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces, chairs may be made of wood, metal, or synthetic materials, and either the seat alone or the entire chair may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics.\n\nChairs vary in design. An armchair has armrests fixed to the seat;[3] a recliner is upholstered and under its seat is a mechanism that allows one to lower the chair's back and raise into place a fold-out footrest;[4] a rocking chair has legs fixed to two long curved slats; and a wheelchair has wheels fixed to an axis under the seat.[5]","timestamp_created":1607037931,"timestamp_updated":1607037931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49800795316696167","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81555643","author":{"steamid":"76561198165519174","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1659253798},"language":"english","review":"theyre waiting for you gordon, in the test chamberrrr","timestamp_created":1607037882,"timestamp_updated":1607037882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81555335","author":{"steamid":"76561198881168479","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":585,"last_played":1607036696},"language":"english","review":"the game basicly becuse of the date of publish, is amazing and the story, MAMA MIA, but has few gameplay deficulty, 1 the game is slippy, the charter moves a few after you deselected the key on keybored, might say it is not big deal. but theer is a level in mountent... 2 the game is unreasenably hard, i mean for no reasen you have to struggle for passing the level an lack of map or showing the obj and ... but agine for game that made in 1998, it is AMAZING.","timestamp_created":1607037442,"timestamp_updated":1607037442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81555033","author":{"steamid":"76561198128715872","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1612056902},"language":"english","review":"the game is fun, the reason why is because of the difficulty and the story. valve has a pattern with their games, they dont tell you what to do and thats whats makes their games challenging.
