It's easy to pick up, and easy to put down, which are simultaneously its best and worst qualities. You play a survivor of what I believe is a series of genetic experiments on humans (haven't played any of the story modes yet) hunting down the mutated freaks who come after you with everything from claws to rocket launchers. On the multiplayer, you can team up with people (generally 6 people on most servers, but I've seen servers with up to 25 players) and navigate through the various waves of zombies/mutants who are all trying to kill you, each zombie/mutant with their own distinct attacks, and some of them much tankier than others.\n\nThe player characters are \"perk\" based (think 'classes'), which each perk allowing the player various discounts at the in-game store for particular weapons (ie. sharpshooter perk gets discounts on pistols and rifles, firebug perk gets discounts on flamethrowers, as well as additional damage for the appropriate weapons). You can only have one perk at a time, but the way you play levels up various other perks, so if you're not sure which perk to go with, you'll be able to see which one you're most suited for based on your playstyle. As of now, you're only able to customize which survivor you're playing, and apply whatever perk you'd like to the character skin. \n\nThere is a HUGE selection of guns and melee weapons, as well as launchers, ray guns, laser guns, grenades, and the occasional sword, as well as a healing item, a knife, a door-welding item, and a secondary weapon (all included in your initial loadout, regardless of your perk). An in-game store allows players to purchase new guns after each wave, with your cash income based on how well you're doing in the game. The higher-tier weapons aren't necessarily better than the lower tier, and you really have to figure out which guns work best for your playstyle. \n\nThe last pro I'd like to talk about are the maps. The maps are absolutely incredible, and credit is to be given in full to the dev team. Some of them are vast, open arena-style maps, with enemies coming from every side, and your group (if they stuck together) dead center. Others are filled with corridors and doorways which can be welded, sealing it off from enemies (though they can break through after some damage). These maps with the corridors make it easier to funnel your enemies, but you always have to be watching your back. I've seen a few maps on the workshop, and they look fantastic, allowing for many different modifications to change the game up.\n\nThose are all the pros. Now let's talk about the cons.\n\nKilling Floor is frustrating. Upon death, regardless of which wave you're on, you will lose all purchased guns and begin again on the next wave with the initial loadout (healing item, knife, pistol, welder), and $250 (which is barely enough to get a new gun). The thing about this is that while any alive teammates are buffed, and can take out aggressors easily, you become pretty squishy, and not much help. This is a game mechanic, and not a broken one; just an annoying one. \n\nNot only that, but when the next wave begins, and you respawn, you're typically a good distance away from your team, and from the store, meaning that you're probably going to end up trying to defend whatever wave was next with some very crappy weapons. \n\nThe Killing Floor online community ranges from skilled to ass-hatted. Though it is a survival game, and you think the best way to survive would be to stick together, players often disperse from the team to farm for better weapons. That's great for them, but meanwhile, the small party has gotten smaller, and is more susceptible. If you're going to play online, I'd recommend you play with friends, or people you know won't ditch the group in favor of themselves. \n\nFurthermore, there is a difficulty setting on servers. While this is an excellent feature, you're not able to see the difficulty of the server you're about to join from the menu, so if you're a new player, you could be joining a lobby on the hardest difficulty, which might leave you feeling absolutely useless. This can be very disheartening, and has caused one or two rage quits on my part.\n\nShould you buy Killing Floor? If you like FPS games with waves of mobs similar to Left 4 Dead, Nazi Zombies (in CoD), or even Space Invaders, yes. It's a good game for a good price, and a lot of fun if you just want to kill some time by playing a game. Is it worth the price? If you have friends who can play with you, it is very much worth the price. It's hard to survive on a team that isn't communicating, and on the servers, there is very little communication. Still, it's a well-designed FPS, and will provide hours of entertainment.","timestamp_created":1403893298,"timestamp_updated":1403893457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10878232","author":{"steamid":"76561198083999681","num_games_owned":438,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":4417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4064,"last_played":1417129989},"language":"brazilian","review":"otimo horror survive e ainda por cima ótimo coop","timestamp_created":1403891885,"timestamp_updated":1403891885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10877577","author":{"steamid":"76561198041474884","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":570,"last_played":1643825256},"language":"english","review":"really good game if you want to kill something","timestamp_created":1403890836,"timestamp_updated":1403890836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10876984","author":{"steamid":"76561198081113654","num_games_owned":298,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2389,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1848,"last_played":1452404190},"language":"english","review":"10/10 Good game.","timestamp_created":1403889944,"timestamp_updated":1403889944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10875651","author":{"steamid":"76561198021544073","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1405707669},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра,советую играть в неё под рок или тяжёлый металл))).","timestamp_created":1403887470,"timestamp_updated":1403887470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10874458","author":{"steamid":"76561198072154606","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5711,"last_played":1502647866},"language":"german","review":"Ein unglaublich geiles Game, selbst nach Jahren macht es echt viel spaß.

The game is about you and 5 other people trying to survive and fight off the oncoming horde of specimens. The specimens I guess could relate to zombies in a sense, for most of them are slow and looming towards you. There are other specimens, and some are extremely difficult and take technique to take down. The game adapts in difficulty as more players join, by giving the zeds (specimens) more health, and they appear in more drastic numbers. This makes the game challenging. There is not running away strategy, you need to stay and fight, which gives you a sense of peril or danger, knowing that many of the zeds could easily outrun you leading to your ultimate demise. The gun mechanics are very satisfying and the gore system works perfectly with it. You can pick one of (8) classes to use, each with different stats and weapons to act with the class.
