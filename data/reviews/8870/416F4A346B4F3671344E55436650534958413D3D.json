I have played all 3 BioShocks and this is by far the best one. I never gave this game a chance, because I was such a big fan of the Big Daddy's in BioShock 1 and 2. When i found out that this game didn't have the Big Daddy's, I was dissapointed and never bought it. This game went on summer sale this year and I decided to give it a shot. Here are some reasons this game is my all time favorite.\n\n[b]1. Elizabeth[/b]\n\nElizabeth is your companion throught this game. She is the best part of this game. I have never played a game where when I am in a fight, my companion throws ammo, health, salts(mana) when I am low or even give me money when I am exploring. She runs in front of you anticipating where you will go based on where you are going. She keeps you company which is what a companion should do, but not a lot games make it feel real like this game does. I hope companies learn from this masterpeace of a game.\n\n2. [b]The Story (Agian, NO SPOILERS)[/b]\n\nThis story will mind fuck you. It is such a deep story that makes you want to come back and play some more because you just want to know what is going on. The great part about this game is that the optional side-missions tie in to the main story line to help you better understand the plot. The voxophones are personal recordings of a character that are clues to the plot. This story is very well written and has no plot holes when you finish. The ending makes you wonder how and why, but if you dig deep in the game and look for voxophones and or look online, it all makes sence. \n\nAll in all, this game amazed me. It had me thinking when i started and also when i finished it. It starts out all happy and bright, but gets darker as you play.

Many says different things so that makes it obvious that it is not the easiest story to understand. All though that might be a good thing for alot of people since they sort of can make thier own story about it.\n\nGood: First of a Huge wow to the graphics. Such beautiful enviorment and looks on the game.\nAlso the game really makes you an addict to it, I said after playing 7 straight hours \"I have to take a break, just gonna finish this quest\" then I realise that I am still playing another 3 hours later.\nThe story is just breathtaking, you just have to love exploring the worlds the way you want it and how you want it.\nAnd to get to know the charactors, either like them or maybe even start feeling like you may even start to feel for the charactors. Bound with them and create your own memories with them. \nIt is a long game took me about 13 hours to complete. (If you discover alot of the stuff and absorb what you see)\nAnd all 13 hours are just a blessing to play, you feel VERY empty inside after you have finished the game. I can tell.\n\nSo what score would I give this game?\nI'd say 97/100, highly recommend the DLC's for this game if you enjoyed the story.\nIs it worth 30 € ? Duh... yea big time.

[/h1]\n\nЭта игра оставила мне очень много эммоций, особенно помню момент с концом игры, когда я смотрел титры в шоке от концовки и обдумывал всё произошедшее. Этот эффект повторяли даже длс.\nТак что же именно хорошо в этой игре?\n1. Графика. \nСами текстурки выглядят так себе (можно списать на год игры), но в целом картинка невероятно красивая и яркая, в основном благодаря правильной цветовой гамме и отличной работе художников.\n2. Персонажи.\nСначала хочется сказать о Элизабет. Она очень хорошо и реалистично сделана, её действия естественны,она не бежит в пекло сражения, а из укрытия подкидывает боеприпасы, аптечки, соли, а также может открыть разрывы, которые очень сильно помогают в бою (укрытия, различные турели и т.д.). Да и что тут говорить, если в этой игре раскрыты даже эпизодические персонажи, например Фицрой или тот же Финк.\n3. Геймплей.\nПротивники могут делать практически всё то, что и Букер, также могут неожиданно подкрасться из-за спины. А с \"Патриотами\", \"Пожарниками\" и т.д. сражаться одно удовольствие, ведь у них много хп, большой урон и некоторые могут использовать энергетики и поэтому убить их достаточно сложно. Благодаря энергетикам гейплей становится невероятно вариативным, правда иногда о них забываешь, да, иногда бывало однотипно и скучновато, но в целом геймлпей мне понравился.\n4. Сюжет.\nСчитаю самым главным плюсом этой игры сюжет. Причём всё в основном открылось от концовки. Она конечно сразу вываливает кучу ошеломительной информации, на обработку которой мне потребовалось несколько часов, но таких сюжетных поворотов я точно не ожидал, также порадовала возможность додумать самому.\n \nВ итоге могу сказать, что игра прошлась мной на одном дыхании. Отличная графика, хороший геймплей, проработанный и атмосферный мир который затягивает от начала до конца, проработанные персонажи и великолепный сюжет, который держит в напряжении.

The storyline was great, pretty heavy but intriguing for those who like plot-rich games like me (even with some holes). The combat needed some getting used to but the mix of fighting with guns and vigors to get leverage on the battle landscape while zipping on skylines is fun - though a bit short-lived in some sections. The scenery is beautiful - though only seeing it for the first hour of the game before everything goes to hell. Though dead Columbia still looks pretty great. ++ Elizabeth is the best companion ever! \n\nSome weak points included the fact that after a while it gets quite repetitive to combat the same enemies every 1 - 5 minutes (you can almost expect getting ambushed everywhere), and this is me exploring most of the place. The boss battles get really easy if you know their weaknesses (like bringing down the Handyman without breaking a sweat) and there's not much variety to the battle mechanics otherwise.

It is graphically beautiful and runs great. I don't believe it is very demanding though I do have a pretty high powered PC. I am not too far into the game and am simply loving it. The combat and gunplay is super fun. There is also gear that provides differant power ups which I believe is distributed at random. I died after grabbing gear and reloaded and found a completly differant item in the same place. Getting this game on sale for 5 dollars is a HUGE steal and is worth the 30 dollars regular price. I will come back and edit this after I complete the game but as of right now I highly recommend it. On top of the gun play there are random powers that you will learn throughout the game that are fueled by salt. I know I am not the best at writing reviews but I promise if you like atmospheric FPS games this is a must play. Get lost in the world as I have! Cheers!
