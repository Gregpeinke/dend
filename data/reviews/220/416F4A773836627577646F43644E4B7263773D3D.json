Пишу этот обзор очень осторожно, ибо об этой игре написать что-то плохое просто воспрещено! Игра просто великолепна! Нас переносит в ту же атмосферу, что и в первой части. Мы игрем за того же учёного Гордона Фримена. Вообще смысла нет описывать всё, из-за того, что в эту игру играли почти все. Игра 2004 года, и графика в неё уж точно шагнула вперёд. Движок Source выдал себя на высшем уровне. Геймплей игры почти идеален, как и во второй части. Физика в игре стала ещё лучше. Что говорить про сюжет (чисто моё мнение), мне он понравился, но это не прям уж глубокий непредсказуемый сюжет с несколькими концовками и т.д. Но атмосфера, я повторюсь, меня она зацепила. Саундтрек в игре тоже порадовал. Ну и конечно же оружие, его много и оно проработано на высшем уровне. Мультиплеер в игре присудствет, но он почти мёртв, также существует огромное количесво модов и дополнений для игры, некоторые из них влились в отдельные игры. Главный из модов - это мод Sanergy (о нём я напишу обзор позже). \nВ итоге игра на 98 из 99, 5 из 5, 10 лямбд из 10.

Prop jumping and strafe bunny hopping is an absolute blast and I would recommend this game just for that reason alone.\n\nFor what it is, its got charm. But ....\n\nThe gunplay is pretty fun (if you know a few hidden mechanics to speed up the reloading process) and the levels at the beginning are good, but once you get out of the city and into the water with the game's first vehicle, get ready for some serious padding.\n\nImagine this, you are being forced to go on a freaking boat and car ride for most of the HL2's playtime with barley enough enemies to makes things feel more purposeful. The vehicle levels are baron and boring and it feels like it was put into the game just to show off the engine. HL2 also suffers from the \"Hey, look what our engine can do, isn't that great!\" factor where they should have focused on making fun levels.\n\nThe enemy variety is pretty pitiful compared to the first game. You pretty much fight 6 enemies through the entire game and most of them are just a copy paste of the civil protection enemies but with more health and very slight tweaks. You think with the world being overrun by aliens they would have tons of things for you to kill that isn't the effing combine soldiers, How about some of the enemies from HL1 or even tampered versions of them to suit the combine, but they dont. Most of the interesting enemies from the first game were completely cut, including some really rad cut HL2 enemies like the Cremator or the Synth and super combine soldiers.\n\nIt doesn't help that most of the focus in Half-Life 2 is on its mediocre story. To be honest I dont care for story in fps games, and it pisses me off to no end that the NPC's in these type of games slow the flow to a halt where I have to sit and do nothing just listening or watching them do pointless crap instead of having you play the game!! They just have no real purpose except slow you down, unlike HL1 where you can skip most the of interactions by ignoring them completely or killing the NPC.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a good game with some really odd decisions that hurt the game than helped it. If you want to play a game from the Half-Life series that represents why the series has a special place in the communities hearts, just buy the first one or Black Mesa, and then play HL2 and you will see exactly what I mean.","timestamp_created":1488835336,"timestamp_updated":1621022345,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.342729836702346802","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30361429","author":{"steamid":"76561198153984227","num_games_owned":497,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1539199261},"language":"german","review":"Half-Life in bestform.

Half Life 2 irmão, se você tá olhando análise pra saber se compra ou não Half Life, já tá errado. Ter Steam e não ter Half Life é um pecado, apenas. Falar de Half Life é uma coisa meio complicada pra mim. O primeiro Half Life foi um jogo que eu cresci jogando e não parei de jogar até hoje, vira e mexe instalo pra dar uma revisitada na Black Mesa de 1998( com textura um pouco motificada eu sei, maaas...). Eu sou muito fã...o jogo é tão bom que dá até vontade de negativar só de raiva por conta de uma sequencia não ter saído até hoje(sequencia do ep2 eu digo). No momento o jogo que eu mais estou jogando é Counter Strike Global Offensive, mas se um Half Life 3 fosse lançado eu esqueceria rapidinho.

Your character doesn't even talk the whole game! Unlike COD Infinite Warfare (absolutey amazing) this game doesn't have good characters or dialogue. They are incredibly cliche and clunky. If I had a dollar for every time I walked into dumb Alex and she didn't react, I'd have about a billion bucks.

But Half-Life 2 always felt like pretty much a glorified tech demo.\nFor it's time yeah sure the physics engine was impressive, but the amount of the times the story or action would grind to a halt so you can load a pile of bricks onto a plank or a lift or something. Like I think it's more than 3, and each one is more annoying. Like ok you want some puzzles I can dig that but don't stop the game in the middle of me fleeing for my life from an army of alien nazis to put a small crate onto a big crate so I can hop a chainlink fence. or at least don't do it more than once.\nThere are 2 overly long and mostly boring vehicle sections as well.\nThe gravity gun is cool but again it hasn't really dated well considering how much of a prominent place it has. Like again for the time I'm sure it was fine, but there are so many games where you can pick things up and throw them. It's pretty much treated like \"oh look what we can do\" like the dialouge when you get is pretty much \"hey come here and try this new gravity gun(tm) it's so good pick up things and throw them whooo this is not a tech demo\"\nIt probably doesn't help that aside from the bits I enjoy like most of Ravenholme, some of the Antlion parts and...other Parts I think, Pretty much everything good the game does can be recreated in Gmod in under half an hour. Not that I'm a huge fan of Gmod either really but It doesn't help a game age well when every asset and weapon is available in a sandbox mod-game with the same graphics and so much more to do than pile 4 bricks onto a beam or listen to scientist man talk at you about teleporters for 20 minutes.\nTo be clear I don't hate this game, I think it's a slightly dated mostly solid but boring fps, but I see so many reviews and people saying it's the best fps ever made or that there hasn't been a better game made since. Like thats your opinion and I respect that but I just can't help wondering what it is that you're seeing that I'm not.\nThere are parts in the game I kinda like, but the overall package is just way too bloated and contrived feeling.","timestamp_created":1488422321,"timestamp_updated":1529930716,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565802812576293945","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30270883","author":{"steamid":"76561198284807561","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":466,"last_played":1639128679},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2 is a good gameplay with and enjoyable story with good characters and gameplay.
