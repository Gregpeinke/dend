Un accidente en mitad de un experimento iniciará una serie de eventos en los que unos seres presuntamente alienígenas cundirán el pánico en las instalaciones y entre el personal. Nuestra misión será sobrevivir, pero en ningún momento el juego nos dirá qué hacer o a dónde ir. Eso lo sabremos y lo averiguaremos nosotros mismos, y sin duda este será uno de los puntos fuertes de nuestra aventura. Lejos de lo que proponen los juegos modernos, donde atascarse es sinónimo de pulsar un botón y ver una lucecita guía o una brújula, Half-Life no querrá cojernos de la mano en ningún momento. Y gracias por ello. La experiencia de este videojuego no sería la misma si no estuviese acompañado por la agobiante sensación de tener que salir de cada atolladero y de encontrar el camino de avance por nuestra cuenta.\n\nEste título, aunque siempre sea considerado un FPS, es en realidad un gran ejemplo de adaptabilidad al requerimiento de cada situación. Tendremos trazas de puzles, plataformas e incluso terror, y por descontado tiroteos, pero todo ello converge en una gran pieza interactiva heterogénea y perfectamente balanceado. Su aparente simpleza narrativa es solo una máscara que esconde una gran riqueza argumental, mostrada a través de las conversaciones interactivas con otros NPCs, sin escenas de vídeo que corten el ritmo, o mediante muchos de los sucesos que irán ocurriendo a lo largo de nuestra huida de Black Mesa, un gran complejo que gracias a la presencia de unos tiempos de carga muy pequeños, y a la carencia de interrupciones en el desarrollo, crean una sensación de plena unificación y finalmente de un gran y enorme escenario, complejo y medido al milímetro.\n\nUn gran juego que, en retrospectiva y viendo lo que ha salido a continuación dentro de la saga, al final deja la sensación de haber atestiguado la punta de un enorme iceberg, y todavía quedan muchísimas preguntas abiertas que esperemos se respondan en lo que empieza a ser uno de los mitos más grandes jamás creados en los videojuegos. Y recordad, este juego fue el inicio de lo que hoy es Valve.\n","timestamp_created":1424550610,"timestamp_updated":1424550610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613314449787139893","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14581299","author":{"steamid":"76561198041142998","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":2251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":655,"last_played":1648136139},"language":"english","review":"This game is fantastic, the storyline is gripping, the gameplay is smooth and streamlined, and the games that come after it continue the scientific, puzzle solving fun.

И если в тех же квейках с думами важна была экшен составляющая, тут же большую часть времени мы проводили в поиске различных деталей для паззлов, которыми буквально напикчана вся игра. Серьезно, когда мне было лет 12 и я проходил эту игру впервые, я не понимал ни диалогов, ни надписей на кнопках, поэтому все проходилось вслепую. Опыт конечно незабываемый, и ~месяц потраченого времени тоже.\nИ сейчас, когда после тех приятных воспоминаний, оставленых игрой я решил опять взяться за монтировку то просто провалился во времени и пространстве и залип до тех пор, пока не дошел до финального босса. Много вещей изменилось с тех пор, даже если я и выучил английский, и даже начал понимать сюжет полностью, я пару раз жутко застревал в тех местах, где раньше бы прошел секунд за 10, если не меньше. Причина в том что раньше игры делались в основном без визуальных подсказок или даже туториалов, не вели игрока за нос и не указывали ему что делать. Поэтому что бы понять что делать порой приходилось реально изощраться и искать способ несколько дней, попутно обсуждая это с другом. \nНо если взглянуть на игру с современной точки зрения, то у нее будет полно недостатков  в виде отсутствия карты или адекватной системы квестов, а еще нужно было сохраняться самому, ведь если игра вылетала - то все чекпойнты слетали...\nНо кого волнуют все эти недостатки?

If you're just looking for a fresh perspective on one of your favorite classics then this review might also be for you. This was the first time I have ever played a Half-Life game. I'm afraid I missed it when it was released, however, I did play similar shooters from that era. I didn't think a review from me would be necessary for such a popular title like Half-Life but seeing that all of the top reviews for it are those ridiculous one or two sentence jokes, I thought that maybe my take on it would be welcome.\n\nIn Half-Life, you fill the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who's getting ready for an ordinary day at the office. Gordon Freeman apparently, dons his fancy HEV suit every morning after punching in on the time clock, and then runs around in a room that is not safe anyone not wearing said suit.\n\nLong story short, something bad happens while on the job, and aliens decide to invade Gordon's workplace, Black Mesa labs. You then spend the rest of the game trying to get out of the now compromised Black Mesa facility. The structure is surprisingly large for a research lab and you'll spend quite some time traversing it's different levels, from labyrinthine industrial machinery to the sterile, clean laboratories where Freeman's colleagues go-a-sciencing. Without spoiling too much, the army becomes involved and for some unexplained reason, presumably a cover-up, considers you to be just as dangerous as the invading aliens.\n\nThat pretty much covers it, as far as an overall picture is concerned. You won't start with much, as far as weapons are concerned, however you'll slowly build up your collection as you romp through Black Mesa. The gameplay is smooth and uncluttered with too many bells and whistles. You run, shoot, and jump your way to the surface of the facility. Sometimes, you'll even push and pull some things to solve some very mild puzzles. The game can be quite challenging if you up the difficulty enough. And ammo is at a premium. You really have to think about what weapons you're using against which enemies and what is the most efficient way to kill them. Some weapons are better for killing different targets, which is a nice thing that makes this game more than just a mindless shooter.\n\nThere is little dialogue throughout this game. In fact, there are even a couple of levels where you won't encounter too terribly many enemies, however those are mostly reserved for the more industrial areas of Black Mesa.\n\nThe game is definitely dated, as it runs on the old 1998 GldSrc engine. If you're itching to get your nostalgia on, this can be a good thing, though. It reminded me a lot of Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force from the early 2000's (unsurprisingly, as Raven Software admitted Half-Life was their inspiration for Elite Force). It can also be considered reminiscent of Doom, in it's tone, especially in the later levels I think. If you really just aren't in the mood of '98 graphics, thought, you could always get the Source version of the game, which isn't terribly different, but does give it that extra little oomph you may be looking for.\n\nAll in all, there weren't many cons in this game for me, except for it's lack of exposition. I think that may be more of a sign of it's age, however. Like I said, there isn't much dialogue and if you're looking for a lot of story, you won't really find it in this game. However, I've been told that HL2 has more of that sort of thing. I also mentioned above that ammo can be hard to find and many might consider that to be another negative trait. That's just something that will come down to personal preference, though. At least I never found myself bored while playing. The end boss was pretty unforgiving, though. The technical difficulty of defeating the final boss was fairly frustrating and they didn't exactly make the mechanics of doing it very smooth. This also seems to be a relic from gaming's past, though.\n\nAll things considered, I really enjoyed this game. I came it with mostly a fresh perspective, as I knew little about the tone of Half-Life and I knew little of the story. Even though I never played this as a kid, the nostalgia from shooters of it's era was enough to make me smile from time to time. If you played Quake III or games like it, you might also notice some of the minor similarities. When you consider that this was Valve's debut product, it makes it all seem that much more impressive.","timestamp_created":1423518448,"timestamp_updated":1423846570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":60,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.834078311920166016","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14404151","author":{"steamid":"76561198056171761","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1840,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1693,"last_played":1626553134},"language":"english","review":"Great game fun.","timestamp_created":1423497762,"timestamp_updated":1423497762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14404029","author":{"steamid":"76561198129194016","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":962,"last_played":1574976214},"language":"russian","review":"ЗАЕБИСЬ","timestamp_created":1423497140,"timestamp_updated":1574976234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14402737","author":{"steamid":"76561198142745982","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":913,"last_played":1460943569},"language":"english","review":"This game is a masterpiece for its time, it didn't stand the test of time as well as Half Life 2, and its not required to know what happens in HL2 and on, but its not a bad idea to help follow the plot of HL2 and the episodes, along with HL3.\nIts a good game, and fun, if you can get past the not so good graphics of the 90's but if you cant, you can if you so choose, skip to Half Life 2.","timestamp_created":1423490620,"timestamp_updated":1423490620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481180489063262939","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14399351","author":{"steamid":"76561198162739549","num_games_owned":449,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":479,"last_played":1574223214},"language":"spanish","review":"Sin duda un juegazo y si no lo jugaste dejame decirte que no tuviste infancia","timestamp_created":1423463804,"timestamp_updated":1505225907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14396550","author":{"steamid":"76561198042804277","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":396,"last_played":1565474209},"language":"english","review":"20 minutes into the game, got killed by a bookcase. 10/10","timestamp_created":1423441953,"timestamp_updated":1423441953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":96,"votes_funny":304,"weighted_vote_score":"0.726204633712768555","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14391883","author":{"steamid":"76561198149830308","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":9914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":200,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1660495853},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores jogos que já joguei e suas expansões são incriveis, faz sucesso até hoje!","timestamp_created":1423420889,"timestamp_updated":1423420889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+uKftcsCe6TzNg=="}
