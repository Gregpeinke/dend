The game starts off okay, nothing crazy good but to rag on the details would be nitpicking. Where it starts to fall off is the 3rd level \"Lowlife\". To describe, it's essentially a dark and destroyed (parking lot I believe?) and you have to use your flashlight along the way to illuminate your obstacles. This on paper sounds fine, but you have to remember your flashlight has charge. This means that one minute, your cruising along with Alyx blasting away zombies, the next your sitting the dark looking at your pistol LEDs wondering if the battery always took this long to charge. It just makes the pacing feel awkward.\n\nSoon in to the level a new enemy is introduced, called the \"Zombine\" by Alyx. The only good thing I can say about them is that the name made me chuckle. It's unfortunate because I really like the idea of them, but it just wasn't introduced right. See, one way of attacking is using a grenade to suicide bomb you. This is fine, but not dark corridors where explosive barrels surround you. I mean hey, one wrong misfire at a barrel and you won't have to worry about the place being dark anymore, right? Both the map design here and the Zombine resulted in me getting blown up, and half the time I wouldn't know where or when and sometimes how.\n\nProceeding deeper into the level we'll encounter the antlions again, only this time they're not our friends anymore. The problem I have was in Half Life 2 they'd only be triggered if you stepped in the sand, which made you think outside of the box and be creative with movement. In this, they keep constantly spawning, in order to stop this you plug them up with usually a car or truck. Again, like the Zombine I like this idea but they end up becoming a chore to do, meanwhile you constantly get hit by antlions while doing it.\n\nOnce we get to \"Urban Flight\" the game gets better, but not by much. The design for this level felt awkward to me, there was one part where the Combine were guarding a gate, and as far as I know, the only way to get in was to charge in guns blazing when the door was occasionally open. For Half Life, this part felt so unnatural, I never think of Half Life as a \"run and gun\" FPS like Doom, it's more \"take your time to think outside the box\" type of FPS. Maybe you'll see this as a nitpick, I'll leave it up to you to determine that. \n\nThe rest of the game proceeds fine, but by then were almost at the end. Which is where my final big complaint comes in, for how short this game is, as well as its age, the price doesn't feel worth it. I got this from a Half Life bundle where I got everything Half Life for about 5 or 10 bucks, but 8 bucks for this? You're better spending your money elsewhere, or wait for a sale.\n\nNow for the positives! For a short game, a lot of story happens and I'm really happy about that. It was enough to keep me engaged and motivated when the gameplay let me down at times. And the ending makes me eager in playing Episode Two. To help progress the story, Alyx accompanies you throughout the game and she is a great companion! My favorite thing about her is that she can hack Rollermines to attack the enemy instead which is a cool gameplay idea! (It's just unfortunate it doesn't happen more, maybe in the next episode we get more)\n\n...And that's all the positives I got. It's unfortunate because I really wanted to like this game, especially after a masterpiece like Half Life 2. But I look forward into the next episode with optimism.","timestamp_created":1612650218,"timestamp_updated":1612650218,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.642392337322235107","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86100011","author":{"steamid":"76561199074396968","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1613941558},"language":"turkish","review":"çooooooook
