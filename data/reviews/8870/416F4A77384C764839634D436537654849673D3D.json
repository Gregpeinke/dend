About three hours in, you're hooked. At six hours in, you're addicted. At twelve hours in, the words \"outdoors\" and \"real life\" seem to lose all meaning. Because you can't stop, clawing for your next shot of \"what happens next.\" Story is where this game really shines.\n\nWell that, and Elizabeth. When it comes to likeability and sympathy for a female companion character, I'm reminded of Alex Vance from Half Life 2. In my book, that's extraordinary high praise -- it's not often that a game excels at character-building.\n\nBut unlike many female characters in videogames, Elizabeth is neither just a pretty face nor a cheap plot device -- she stays interesting, and carries her own weight. When you're fighting, she's scrounging for supplies to keep you alive and tossing them to you mid-battle. When you \"die,\" she revives you and gives you enough ammo to keep on pushing. When traveling, she unlocks doors and provides critical information. She even finds *money* for you. But even more important than her level of utility, it's hard to not feel some sort of attachment to her. The relationship between you (the main character) and her is one that is both complex and fascinating. A relationship that twists and evolves, driving the story forward in unexpected ways.\n\nI can't say it louder: This is storytelling at its finest.\n\nA couple of comments about gameplay. This game, at hard difficulty, is not just \"hard\" -- it's borderline 1990's-era Nintendo-Hard. However, unlike many other games, you don't have to play the same part over and over again (as if on repeat). When you kill an enemy, it stays dead. So even in death, there's still a sense of progress -- even if there are penalties. It's a new type of gaming experience, but one that I have learned to appreciate. It certainly made the game less frustrating, considering its level of difficulty. All I gotta say is, choose \"hard\" if you're either crazy or a masochist. Or both.\n\nAnd what do I say about the ending? No spoilers, but holy crap, the conclusion is something that you have to see to believe. This game is a polished gem that lives up the the hype, that puts you through the wringer and, in the end, leaves you feeling awe-struck and extraordinarily satisfied.\n\n9.0/10 and the illustrious David Wyly Seal of Approval^tm. Highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1391416191,"timestamp_updated":1391416862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8959695","author":{"steamid":"76561198030273723","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":808,"last_played":1393664503},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра 2013 года!","timestamp_created":1391412822,"timestamp_updated":1391412822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8959428","author":{"steamid":"76561198027931632","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1016,"last_played":1483796374},"language":"russian","review":"рекомендую","timestamp_created":1391409803,"timestamp_updated":1391409803,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504541695117950439","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8959119","author":{"steamid":"76561197994527161","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1474435841},"language":"english","review":"Love the story, awesome game!","timestamp_created":1391406500,"timestamp_updated":1391406500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8958547","author":{"steamid":"76561198003200239","num_games_owned":605,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":760,"last_played":1578339368},"language":"english","review":"the most beautiful game i have played. denfently a game worth getting.\n\nJUST BUY IT!","timestamp_created":1391400603,"timestamp_updated":1391400603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8958156","author":{"steamid":"76561198083801421","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":822,"last_played":1375346729},"language":"koreana","review":"스토리가 너무 어렵다\n다들 이 작품에 대해 엄지를 치켜들지만\n나와는 맞지않는 작품..\n쏘쏘","timestamp_created":1391397229,"timestamp_updated":1391397229,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8957904","author":{"steamid":"76561197985680345","num_games_owned":301,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1720,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1286,"last_played":1401073233},"language":"english","review":"Not a perfect game.

The gameplay is just your average FPS variant due to the combination of guns and special powers called vigors that work in a similar way to plasmids from the first 2 games. The story is a fairly average one until you get more towards the end of the game where it finally all hits you and mind****s the hell out of you, and I did thoroughly enjoy it. Whilst the twist may not have had the same impact as the first Bioshock's twist did, it still was pretty much unseen for the most part and is worthy of appreciation as much as the first game was.\n\nIf you have played the first 2 games, I think you will really enjoy this one. In my personal opinion I would put it ahead of Bioshock 2, but behind the original Bioshock, yet still a game worthy of the hype it received. If you like to play games based on the gameplay, and you're looking for a very good FPS, this MIGHT fit the bill but I would recommend it far more for the immersive story, the connections that can be made to the old Bioshocks, and the refreshing colour tones it brings for most of the game. (Oh - And of course all the crazy fan theories people come up with).\n\nVery enjoyable and well worth the download.

Infinite was for me the last stop in my playthrough of the entire Bioshock franchise. Aside from the graphics the game felt boring to me.\n\nIt's been two years since I finished Infinite and I decided out of pure boredom to revisit it, to give it another chance. I have no regrets so far. \n\nBioshock Infinite is closer to the Bioshock franchise than you think. Many people claim that it has nothing to do with the two games and that they're merely linked by name. But Bioshock Infinite is the polar opposite of its predecessors. Like in the original Bioshock you play an unsuspecting person as they stumble upon a mysterious lighthouse in the middle of the Atlantic. They're then transported to a whole other world, one deep beneath the ocean and the other high up in the sky.\nColumbia and Rapture, two completely different cities that are somehow very equally the same. \nOne has succumbed to a civilised devestation following a brutal civil war between its elite and working class, while the other is ruled by a fanatical zeolot who claims to be a prophet, who has a twisted take on the history of the United States, worshipping John Wilkes Booth rather than Abraham Lincoln. While Columbia is at first a bright cheerful place, a utopia floating high above the troubles of the Earth you soon realise that it is suffering from the same issues that led Rapture to its doom: An oppressed minority fighting for their freedom. As you progress through the game this civil war breaks out in many directions.\n\nBut the story and setting are merely the tip of the iceberg. \nUnlike the previous Bioshock games where the player controls a silent protaganist, Infinite lets you control Booker DeWitt, a troubled man who is sent to Columbia to 'kidnap a girl' in order to wipe his debts away. Of course, the girl he wishes to kidnap is none other than the Prophet's holy child, locked up in a golden tower of herself guarded by a giant robot bird and an armed security force. Once you save her, you discover she has a unique power that allows her to open rifts in time. These can be used to your advantage of course.\n\nOne of the core elements of a good Bioshock game is not just the gunplay but its \"vigors.\" In Bioshock 1 and 2 the player was given access to a wide range of plasmids which allowed them to shoot fire out of their hands, or bolts of electricity or even bees. The challenge also came from the fact that the enemies you encountered could also use these plasmids as well. In Bioshock Infinite you discover these vigors in the form of  bottled liquid. You can also buy aids and upgrades for these vigors through vendors. Personally I think that the original plasmids were better. You will find that a lot of the vigors given to you will not be used. On hard mode I usually stick to Murder of Crows, Posession, Bucking Bronco and Shock Jockey. \n\nInfinite is a game that you need to pay attention to the story as its combat is not its strongpoint. Battling enemies does become repetitive due to a lack of variation in enemy types that was present in the first Bioshock games. Most of the enemies you fight are simply grunts with guns, crows, handymen, firemen and others, most of which are just the same enemy reskinned. Their inability to use the vigors results in dull battles. Even on hard difficulty it's not difficult to defeat a group of enemies. \n\nI definetely recommend Bioshock Infinite for those who are looking for a true nitty gritty mind-warping story. In a growing PC culture, you will not find games like Infinite very common. \n\n\nOriginal 2014 review: 3/10\nLatest 2016 review: 9/10","timestamp_created":1391321551,"timestamp_updated":1460759359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8944976","author":{"steamid":"76561198056676568","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":984,"last_played":1614307202},"language":"english","review":"This game is a brilliant mix of fighting, RPG elements , and story....

Здесь нет ничего лишнего — ни «приклеенной» RPG-составляющей, ни надуманных сюжетных поворотов. Геймплей, сценарий, графика, музыка в синхронном звучании создают поистине потрясающую стимпанковскую атмосферу. Когда ты проходишь по солнечным улицам парящей над небесным сводом Колумбии, слышишь приятную музыку, раздающуюся из каждого радиоустройства, подбираешь всякую дребедень, а твои действия сопровождаются характерным «биошоковским» треском и хрустом, то понимаешь, что мир Infinite совершенно уникален, и одно лишь нахождение в нем становится настоящим праздником.\n\nДизайнеры уровней проделали, не побоюсь этого слова, грандиозную работу. Внешний облик Колумбии заставит трепетать сердца даже самых притязательных любителей графики. Локации разнообразны, декорации на протяжении всего прохождения постоянно меняются, каждый квадратный метр города полон каких-то мелких деталей. Хочется ходить по этому миру, заглядывая в каждый закоулок, слушая все диалоги случайных прохожих, просматривая наборы забавных картинок в каждом кинетоскопе.\n\nСценарий BioShock Infinite поначалу кажется в меру банальным и не слишком выдающимся — мистер Букер Девитт отправляется в летающий город Колумбию, чтобы найти и вернуть на землю бренную некую загадочную девушку Элизабет. На деле же сюжет оказывается сложной мозаикой, сложить которую предстоит игроку. Он чем-то напоминает фильмы Дэвида Линча — ткань повествования разорвана, последовательность событий нарушена, и лишь концовка, сначала озадачивающая и приводящая в священный трепет, дает ключ к разгадке.\n\nBioShock Infinite\nИ правда — что?\nВопреки нашим ожиданиям, финал один — изредка встречающиеся возможности выбора в конечном итоге ни на что не влияют. Однако скажите: насколько часто развязка игры заставляла вас часами вспоминать все детали сюжета, долгими мыслительными спекуляциями пытаться закрыть бреши и желать повторного прохождения — более внимательного, неспешного и вдумчивого? Сюжет BioShock Infinite никого не оставит равнодушным — после финала вас ожидает или длительный сеанс самостоятельного мозгового штурма в поисках ответов, или кратковременный серфинг по фанатским форумам. \n\nСюжет изобилует всеми самыми удачными фишками научно-популярного жанра. Здесь найдется место и параллельным вселенным, и квантовым парадоксам, и путешествиям во времени. Что очень важно, все эти модные вкрапления ничуть не смотрятся вычурно — конечная картина происходящего в игре оправдывает наличие «мистических» элементов.\n\nВ русской локализации озвучка персонажей осталась оригинальной. Может, оно и к лучшему — монологи героев, как, впрочем, и сами персонажи, крайне выразительны. Чего только стоит Элизабет! Это миловидное прелестное создание, само воплощение невинности, женственности и жизнелюбия. Она — словно героиня диснеевских сказок: столь же добрая, приветливая и веселая. Одиноко запертая в высокой башне, Элизабет мечтает лишь о Париже и танцах.","timestamp_created":1391256342,"timestamp_updated":1391256342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.624603033065795898","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8933220","author":{"steamid":"76561198118782734","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":981,"last_played":1410709422},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo espetacular.

Note that I’ve never played any of the other Bioshock games, so this is my first experience with the series. One thing that I have to give this game is that it has beautiful visuals and interesting characters. It introduces you to a flying city called Columbia where you, the player being «Booker DeWitt» are here to save a girl named Elizabeth. At first glance the city seems big and interesting, and as I previously said it looks stunning. Though after playing it a while the city loses it charm after hours with boring and repetitive gameplay as well as  the story losses its interest. The story seems fine but was told in a way that many important details got lost through the game, meaning that I could’t connect with the characters as well as I might have hoped. The story isn’t really interesting until the end and therefor the rest of the game is easily forgettable, and it doesn’t help with the uninspiring gameplay. I wanted to like this. I really did, but it was a huge letdown with the gameplay, and the story wasn’t as great that I’ve been told. It might be worth checking out for the ones that likes first person shooters with a bit of story, but it doesn’t hold up compared to the praise that it has gotten. In the end it felt boring and uninspiring.","timestamp_created":1391219040,"timestamp_updated":1391219040,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8LvH9cMCe7eHIg=="}
