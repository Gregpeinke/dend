And what if that experience extends to nearly the entirety of your play time?\n\nYou and your other:\nElizabeth, the person you as Booker DeWitt have been hired to retrieve intact, and thus protect, follows you throughout nearly the entirety of the game, and when she isn't following you, she's bossing you around, requiring comforting, or being captured and in need of rescue.  This type of scenario is certainly nothing new, but the problem here is that the player cannot simply opt-out or choose a different path if they lack the necessary motivations to perform the task at hand.  I mean, if I'm going to serve as the games punching bag or as an unstoppable killer of seemingly endless hordes of bloodthirsty AI, I have to feel as a player that the ends justify the means.  When you're running all over this maze of a game, impaling, decapitating and quite frankly murdering more or less the entire population, your character's personal troubles along with the troubles of Elizabeth, appear to pale in comparison.  And yes, there is a distinct difference between being forced to defend yourself against the insane, plasmid-addled inhabitants of Rapture, and being forced to obliterate armies of (under other circumstances) somewhat normal and decent citizens of the airborne city of Columbia.  I inflict horrendous brutality X on my one hundredth victim, resulting in their terrible death, and all the while Elizabeth is yammering on about how someone might or might not be her real father, or how she feels trapped, or any number of comparatively mild issues that come to her mind at any given moment... And the entire time I just want to say to her \"SHUT THE %&$@ UP!  Take my hand and let's escape this giant glorified quick time event of a game\".\n\nLinearity:\nNo matter how you decide to traverse a map (which is heavily limited beyond the use of skyrails), or dispatch your enemies, the consequences end up being the same.  You can either play as a body guard, punishment sponge and enemy killer, or as a body guard, punishment sponge and enemy killer.  That's it.  Different play styles play-out in terms of what two weapons you decide to use at any given time, along with what vigors.  And I should mention that enemies almost never use vigors, and are susceptible to almost any weapon or power, so strategy is rarely needed. On top of this, the game has plenty of invisible walls, magically blocked off areas that were previously accessible, and a level of predictability (gameplay wise) beyond most that I've experienced; you just know when you're going to bump into enemies.  In terms of gameplay, it ends up being little more than a rail shooter, dressed up to look more sophisticated than it actually is.\n\nStory (no spoilers):\nStarts off simple enough as you're charged with the task of rescuing a damsel, but over the course of the game becomes more and more convoluted to the point that you're just rolling your eyes so hard that it hurts.  Some of the dialogue is good, and some of it is just down right pretentious with all kinds of pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo being bandied about like no one would notice or care.  Welp, I did.  And I was not impressed.  Something that no one told the writers, is that some things are better left to the imagination of the player; knowing how the city floats is immaterial to telling a good story for example, and is equivalent to revealing that Jedi powers are as a result of midichlorians in the blood.  In a nutshell, the story is needlessly complex and the ending is intensely unsatisfying, especially considering the game felt like a chore to play.\n\nConclusion:\nBioshock Infinite is a film that aspires to be a game, and garners praise far beyond its merit.","timestamp_created":1395685187,"timestamp_updated":1395685187,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9620698","author":{"steamid":"76561198101396745","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":935,"last_played":1461617523},"language":"english","review":"This game is just wonderful!

BUY IT!!!\n\nPros: Very pretty to look at, story is amazing, I bought it on sale ( even if its not on sale it's still worth it ), the general atmosphere is very fitting it shows the bad and the flaws in an utopian society and how there's always bad in good. \n\nCons: After finishing the game you want MORE, I wish the story was longer ( Then again thats probably why I'm on the fence about buying a season pass... ), In the end you never really feel like you win, no multplayer or co-op, I mean I understand that that would be a strech for them and BioShock's mechanics wouldn't fit into a multiplayer world but it would have been amazing to see.\n\nVerdict: Like I've already said I highly recommend BioShock, no need for more words, buy it.","timestamp_created":1395636226,"timestamp_updated":1395636226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9615070","author":{"steamid":"76561198032787229","num_games_owned":1088,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":2146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2146,"last_played":1395862004},"language":"english","review":"Elizabeth: \"Booker catch\"! \nBooker:\"No fuck you, what are you on crack throwing a big ass gun at me like that\"\nThe moral of the story is, STOP GIVING ME USELESS SHIT ELIZABETH!","timestamp_created":1395635921,"timestamp_updated":1395635921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9614935","author":{"steamid":"76561198100966381","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":3139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1611,"last_played":1605905095},"language":"spanish","review":"este juego es epico,uno de los mejores que eh jugado,grafico,jugabilidad,sobre todo historia...\nGrandioso :D","timestamp_created":1395634507,"timestamp_updated":1395634507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9614923","author":{"steamid":"76561198126562321","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1079,"last_played":1446786315},"language":"english","review":"so so glad i bought this game on sale! first off its an amazing game and i know when you first look at it youll be dissapointed that youre not in rapture but if you read deeper into the story it is a very similar place to rapture and the idea feels very fresh and youll be left guessing till the very end. i absolutely loved it and suggest that if youre looking for a fun game to pick this title up!","timestamp_created":1395634318,"timestamp_updated":1395634318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9614799","author":{"steamid":"76561197974213197","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2387,"last_played":1487546863},"language":"english","review":"Awesome!","timestamp_created":1395633013,"timestamp_updated":1395633013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9614758","author":{"steamid":"76561198095440148","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1499081775},"language":"english","review":"My absolute favourite game of all time.

The underwater cites and sky cities of Columbia alike will leave you in awe. And the storytelling is very well done. You play as a war veteran named Booker DeWitt and your job is to rescue a woman named Elizabeth. You learn about both characters throughout the story up to the very end. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this game. Part of the story comes from the voxophones and little film scores you see and hear throughout it. I literally just finished the game prior to this review so it took me about 10 hours to beat since I took my time listening to and watching things. The end is a mix of a cliffhanger and a satisfaction in my opinion; it's hard to describe without giving it away. All I can say is it'll make you feel different after you see it. But it was worth every penny I spent and I wish I could take it all back just to play it and guess what happens next again.
