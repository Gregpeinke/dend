O player controla a protagonista, chamada Chell, que é submetida a uma série de testes de raciocínio promovidos por GLaDOS, inteligência artificial que controla o complexo da Aperture Science (ou parte dele). GLaDOS tem uma personalidade muito interessante e por várias vezes expressa sarcasmo e uma certa \"raiva\" em relação a Chell. \nA campanha é curta mas é divertida. O final do game é bastante interessante.\nAlém da Aperture Science, o jogo trás alguns outros elementos que o deixam inserido no universo da franquia Half Life.\nO jogador não utiliza armas propriamente ditas, apenas a \"portal gun\", que cria portais que são utilizados para superar obstáculos e resolver os puzzles.\nA jogabilidade é praticamente a mesma de Counter Strike, porém o personagem não corre. A dinâmica dos portais e a física do jogo são muito bons. \nOs gráficos são simples mas muito bonitos.\nRecomendo este jogo para quem procura jogos com muitos puzzles e para os fãs da franquia Half Life.","timestamp_created":1410024448,"timestamp_updated":1410221745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11997647","author":{"steamid":"76561198077227620","num_games_owned":1265,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":486,"last_played":1409998349},"language":"schinese","review":"V社出品，必属精品！第一次玩的话大约3个小时通关。","timestamp_created":1409999499,"timestamp_updated":1409999499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11995720","author":{"steamid":"76561198066217938","num_games_owned":485,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":407,"last_played":1515286380},"language":"english","review":"Great game, and it'll run on a potato so thats nice","timestamp_created":1409985572,"timestamp_updated":1409986517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11995440","author":{"steamid":"76561198152914609","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":85,"last_played":1452631244},"language":"english","review":"I'm very excited to play this awesome game.","timestamp_created":1409982961,"timestamp_updated":1409982961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510703384876251221","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11994054","author":{"steamid":"76561198006102237","num_games_owned":360,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1158,"last_played":1655779373},"language":"english","review":"Fun puzzle game with a great plot and story to it!!","timestamp_created":1409970578,"timestamp_updated":1409970578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11992640","author":{"steamid":"76561198089131127","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":347,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1499957290},"language":"swedish","review":"it's awesome, buy it and play :D","timestamp_created":1409959217,"timestamp_updated":1409959217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11987495","author":{"steamid":"76561198072341125","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":319,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":315,"last_played":1399033518},"language":"english","review":"Lots of fun a must play","timestamp_created":1409925785,"timestamp_updated":1409925785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11986879","author":{"steamid":"76561198111255221","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":122,"last_played":1423923391},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game, challanging was a really good storyline","timestamp_created":1409921164,"timestamp_updated":1409921164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11986580","author":{"steamid":"76561198149359620","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":861,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1494081054},"language":"english","review":"This game was awesome!!!

Stuck in a test chamber with nothing but a strange AI speaking to you, this game incorperates the use of portals to make a great puzzle game! Although the story is not too present, the character (yes, I said CHARACTER, no plural, it's only you and GLaDOS) is very memorable with her sarcastic humor and  her dark ambition for science. The absence of any 'good' characters in the game makes you feel lonely and vulnerable, but it also can give you more determination to get out of this horrible testing area. The creators cleverly hid rooms filled with random sayings and paintings, which can make some (it made me!) paranoid, however I feel that it adds a good amount of uneasiness to the game. \n       If anyone is looking for a relatively short (it only took me about 2 1/2 hours) but engaging/entertaining puzzle game with a sense of unease and with a creepy atmosphere, this is the game for you!","timestamp_created":1409521178,"timestamp_updated":1409521178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11939380","author":{"steamid":"76561198084508145","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1374458914},"language":"english","review":"Quick, fun game.
