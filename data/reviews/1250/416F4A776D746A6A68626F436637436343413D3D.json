The sanguine lead revelry that takes place each wave is only made more demented and absurd by not only the appearance of the enemies, but the most dimwitted dialogue in the most grotesquely paramount scenarios. In short the periods in which you're not completely eviscerating the mutations known as specimens with the weapons you purchase between waves you'll be either disturbed and/or humored by the game's unique brand of voiced hilarity. Of course this humor quickly turns mundane after a few hours of play, but it will still leave you talking about dosh and how you should \"grab it while it's hot\". After certain facets of the game become stale you're often still beguiled by the sense of progression you receive while leveling up the various classes or \"perks\" the game gives you to choose from, and with the company of friends the experience is much more entertainingly refreshing as you blast through waves of specimens. These specimens come in various forms or types that all require certain strategies to terminate safetly, and so the game often requires teamwork depending on the set difficulty. Upon the end of all of these waves you are faced with a relatively challenging boss (once again depending on the difficulty) called a Patriarch which onsets the end of the map once defeated. It's quite painless to say that the waves leading up to Patriarch are far more enjoyable as most are dispensable slaughter fodder that satisfies the function of whatever weapon you choose. As I said before the weapon selection is quite varying, and your choice of device is often dependent on your selected perk. These weapons are purchased between waves some are cheap while others can be considered \"pedestal\" weapons that are afforded toward the latter part of each game due to accumulated cash. The varying weapons, difficulties, stock maps, player created maps, game variable changing mutators, and perk progression seem to keep this game afloat for some while others play each time a new update is released as the game is quite consistently receiving new content. The only notable con of this game is its propensity to become stale due to its repetitive nature, and while this seems inevitable for some all the gameplay leading up to such a state is well worth the purchase.","timestamp_created":1351110978,"timestamp_updated":1385443962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"405225","author":{"steamid":"76561197970396841","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":37727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36558,"last_played":1407612010},"language":"french","review":"Des flingues qui \"Poutrent\", du Zombies, du sang et de la tripe dans des décors sympathiques: voila le cocktail KF!\nEn prime on a affaire à un des meilleurs jeu d'équipes Coop! \nSi tu flanches tes amis sont morts!!!!! :)","timestamp_created":1351103697,"timestamp_updated":1351103697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1716109","author":{"steamid":"76561197996876168","num_games_owned":798,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":993,"last_played":1426349672},"language":"english","review":"Best Survival Game out there.","timestamp_created":1351098556,"timestamp_updated":1351098556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6721649","author":{"steamid":"76561198073339454","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":926,"last_played":1456961200},"language":"english","review":"This Game Rocks, Love killing Zombies and its the whole reason I rebuilt my PC!

Buy weapons between waves, and kill the specimens during them. At the end, the Patriarch comes (sort-of a boss). Kill it too.\n\nOf course, seen this way, the game in itself might not seem very attractive to some. And despite the few variations you see from one game to the other, excluding difficulty and number of waves on a game, it is quite addictive. The perks you choose (amongst 7) and how you need to play the game to upgrade said perks is what will always keep you playing. Because leveling takes quite a long time, you'll see yourself returning to this game numerous times. \n\nThat said, the perk system can also be a turn-off for new players, given how higher levels on a perk get advantages (like resistance to damage). Still, with patience, it can be well rewarding and fun.","timestamp_created":1350336035,"timestamp_updated":1350336035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3535578","author":{"steamid":"76561198024347387","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":40542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32913,"last_played":1595111480},"language":"english","review":"awesome replayability","timestamp_created":1350269053,"timestamp_updated":1350269053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2782170","author":{"steamid":"76561198012540432","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13883,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13310,"last_played":1425874251},"language":"english","review":"Good and awesome game, Although it requires teamwork, it is a real exciting and suspensful game","timestamp_created":1350266757,"timestamp_updated":1350266757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500826418399810791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"587799","author":{"steamid":"76561197972505159","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":26142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17477,"last_played":1626598778},"language":"english","review":"Don't die.","timestamp_created":1350246713,"timestamp_updated":1350246713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2539712","author":{"steamid":"76561198008996877","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":13054,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10771,"last_played":1422834835},"language":"english","review":"PURE FUN!!!","timestamp_created":1350235665,"timestamp_updated":1350235665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3700551","author":{"steamid":"76561198026277890","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":915,"last_played":1496736097},"language":"english","review":"- Repetitive\n- Flaccid unsatisfying gunplay\n- Workshop doesn't work\n- Wacky voice acting gets old real fast\n\nNot sure why I reinstalled it after all these years.","timestamp_created":1350235449,"timestamp_updated":1496698542,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.453806221485137939","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5502594","author":{"steamid":"76561198050861128","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":40012,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24980,"last_played":1465809245},"language":"english","review":"For Your Health","timestamp_created":1350234967,"timestamp_updated":1350234967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"776214","author":{"steamid":"76561197978036762","num_games_owned":2264,"num_reviews":260,"playtime_forever":25752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25520,"last_played":1405660646},"language":"english","review":"In all my years on the force, not once have I ever encountered a situation that could be comparable to Killing Floor.

In between each wave, you go to a shop and buy/upgrade/refill your weapons and armor. At the end of all of the waves, you battle a big final boss and must beat him to win.

Всем советую поиграть этот, без преувеличения, шедевр!","timestamp_created":1348903275,"timestamp_updated":1348903275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1944779","author":{"steamid":"76561198000081115","num_games_owned":593,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":921,"last_played":1515805167},"language":"english","review":"Is an aboslute hoot as a single player challange and great fun with several people.","timestamp_created":1348889616,"timestamp_updated":1348889616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5249976","author":{"steamid":"76561198046975432","num_games_owned":444,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2057,"last_played":1562228474},"language":"english","review":"Magnificent Horror FPS that does not put as much fear into you as it should but hey whenever you are at Wave 8 blasting away everything that gets in your path, then you turn around to see that you have been backing up into a Horde of enemies you will begin to panic. KF sets the stage for what Steam is basically about. Good Games with not too high of a price, now given that this game itself goes on sale 4 times a year with the Seasons, it is a great first pick up. Your comp does not need to be the best, but for true excitement and pain being able to run KF on High is what you want. Mechanics are pretty on par with every other FPS. It was not hard to get the hang of but sure enough once you get it down you will be popping Zeds easily. There is not a story but then again who really needs one when you are constantly splitting Robo Santa during Christmas time at the price of 5 bucks.","timestamp_created":1348875737,"timestamp_updated":1441863645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2185376","author":{"steamid":"76561198003669869","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":64160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32247,"last_played":1444062451},"language":"english","review":"Dont be a pussy","timestamp_created":1348850735,"timestamp_updated":1348850735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3411511","author":{"steamid":"76561198022246937","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19046,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13642,"last_played":1435673683},"language":"english","review":"Отличная игра!","timestamp_created":1348839622,"timestamp_updated":1348839622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2155279","author":{"steamid":"76561198003151211","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5604,"last_played":1532809890},"language":"english","review":"This very nice game))","timestamp_created":1348813636,"timestamp_updated":1348813636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmtjjhboCf7CcCA=="}
