Je l’ai fini pour la première fois la semaine dernière. C’est un jeu qui a très bien vieilli mais je ne pense pas que ça soit le chef d’oeuvre indépassable du FPS (apparemment au contraire des trois quarts des gens qui écrivent les critiques).\n\nJ’ai enchaîné avec Blue Shift tout de suite après et je dois dire que j’ai beaucoup aimé, peut-être même plus qu’Half-Life. Le problème d’Half-Life c’est que pour les standards d’aujourd’hui, c’est un jeu long, très long. Bien sûr, les environnements sont variés et les niveaux très inventifs, mais il arrive qu’on s'ennuie.\n\nBlue Shift est une version « light «  d’Half-Life. Il y en a pour environ 4-5h de jeu mais les niveaux s’enchaînent très rapidement sans qu’on ait le temps de s’ennuyer. Les combats sont amusants, les puzzles pas (trop) prise de tête.\n\nAlors bien sûr il y a des gens pour critiquer l’absence de nouvelles armes, l’absence de nouveaux monstres ou bien et je cite « le pack de textures HD qui dénature l’esprit du jeu ». Ces gens là sont des esprits chagrins qui ne le jugent pas comme il devrait être: un jeu fun, pas la suite du messie du FPS.","timestamp_created":1419860432,"timestamp_updated":1419860500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.627266466617584229","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13680790","author":{"steamid":"76561198050503396","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":226,"last_played":1419826025},"language":"english","review":"I knew I shouldn't have went to work today...","timestamp_created":1419828579,"timestamp_updated":1419828579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515765190124511719","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13658771","author":{"steamid":"76561198047991259","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":173,"last_played":1419553152},"language":"english","review":"Really good game but very short.","timestamp_created":1419756489,"timestamp_updated":1419756489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13655246","author":{"steamid":"76561198152993606","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1419797097},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego, gráficos fellitos :B pero la buena historia lo compensa :D, pero esta repleto de bugs","timestamp_created":1419741342,"timestamp_updated":1419741342,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13650511","author":{"steamid":"76561198116595200","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":40,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40,"last_played":1417834489},"language":"english","review":"Not as good as the previous 2 campaigns.

Oh, wait, it is also the expansion pack (the 2nd one) for the critically acclaimed game Half Life! And this one was also developed by Gearbox. Interestingly, it came more than a year after Opposing Force, the 1st expansion pack, and while that one packed a punch, Blue Shift did not really offer anything new.\n\nSo, there is no real new content here: no new weapons, enemies or new music. But! It is Half Life! And also, you control Barney! The security officer who was bashing the door when you were riding the train with Gordon in the base game. \n\nAnd this is why I liked in Opposing Force, as well. How the new protagonist's story was connected to that of Gordon. You could see a familiar locale in the distance (when in the helicopter in the beginning) or the aforementioned example of the security guard. \n\nIn any case, while Blue Shift did not really offer anything new (graphics-wise it came with a neat high-res texture pack, though), it offered the same cool atmosphere we loved Half Life for.\n\nBlue Shift is a short but all the more entertaining ride! Highly recommended to all Half Life fans!","timestamp_created":1412113182,"timestamp_updated":1412113333,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":46,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.781965553760528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12301342","author":{"steamid":"76561198041329936","num_games_owned":535,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":167,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":167,"last_played":1412087619},"language":"english","review":"If you liked the original Half Life, you will probably like this too. It's essentially the same, aside from showing the origin of Valve (so many valves you need to turn). \n\nThis time the story is told from a guard's POV. Man, if only the other guards were as useful as Calhoun, the first Half Life would have been so much better!  Just like Freeman, Calhoun started his ordinary day at his job, until the incident happened. Being that Calhoun was a guard and experienced shooter, Blue Shift is more believeable than the original Half Life where a scientist becomes Rambo. \n\nGameplay and visuals are the same since it's using the same engine. Unlike Half Life, it wasn't too heavy on the platforming, but that's probably because the game is really short. While I wasn't trying to break Half LIfe, I never encountered any problems with enemy AI. In Blue Shift, enemy AI was really terrible at times. At one point where you're locked in a truck with the scientist, they kept throwing grenades at the locked door and killed themselves. Another time I flanked them and they just froze and didn't register me at all after shooting them. Guess it isn't as polished as Half Life.\n\nNPCs are once again a chore. When I was escorting the scientist to the lab, he kept stopping and complaining that he's tired. The first time he did that was back in the truck. He didn't even leave the truck and he complained about beeing exhausted. \n\nOverall, the game was too short to stand out too much, and most of the gameplay was too similar to Half Life. It was still fun playing it and a nice touch, getting to play as one of the guards. From what I hear, this event gets completely ignored in Half Life 2, but can't complain about that, as nothing much happened story wise in this expansion. 6/10","timestamp_created":1412088884,"timestamp_updated":1412088884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484429091215133667","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12297989","author":{"steamid":"76561198128263497","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1415383383},"language":"russian","review":"НОСТАЛЬГИЯ больше нечего сказать!","timestamp_created":1412061586,"timestamp_updated":1412061586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpbzb4sgCdfD0Lg=="}
