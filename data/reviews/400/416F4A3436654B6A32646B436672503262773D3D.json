El juego empieza con una serie de pruebas que se realizan sobre nuestra protagonista. De nuestra habilidad con los portales dependerá que seamos un sujeto más o uno que imponga sus reglas a las que el juego tiene reservadas para nosotros.\nEn Portal la experiencia jugable se traslada de manera igual a la protagonista y al jugador. Podemos, o bien hacer lo que el juego nos dice; o bien usar el conocimiento que hemos adquirido a lo largo de los niveles para \"adelantar\" al juego mismo. Obviamente, si el juego nos da esa opción significa que nunca vamos a adelantar al propio juego. Al fin y al cabo, el videojuego, el arte que necesita de un receptor activo y protagonista, tiene unos límites bien definidos, y nunca sucede nada que sus desarrolladores no hayan podido permitir antes. Esto nos permite un videojuego, sentir el placer de creernos por un momento más listos que la máquina. Quizá sean los glitches, los bugs, ciertos aspectos que escapan a los desarolladores en un primer momento. \nA eso juega Portal, entre otras cosas. Uno se espera un juego corto (que lo es), original, con una mecánica y niveles muy bien diseñados, y ya (que no sería poco). Así que después de haber superado los niveles lo normal es pensar que ha llegado su fin, pero es entonces cuando nos resistimos a la voz de GLaDOS y se sucede el último arco, el glitch alargado, en el que el jugador experimenta los límites del videojuego. En ese momento no nos sorprendería ver a G-Man detrás de alguna puerta acristalada. Tampoco sería descabellado incluso descubrir en ese epílogo a Gabe Newell paseando por alguna oficina. La sensación es de grima. Los márgenes de esa pulcritud de hospital de las salas principales de Aperture Science parecen de repente ese averno tras las campanadas de Silent Hill.\nPortal, un videojuego sutil. Humor irónico, terror, diversión, reto intelectual, acción. Incluso un guiño final a HAL 9000. Ojalá todos los videojuegos fuesen como Portal, que siendo tan breves y sencillos, al mismo tiempo albergaran todo.","timestamp_created":1485218953,"timestamp_updated":1646655293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29450544","author":{"steamid":"76561198070869597","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":98,"playtime_forever":536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":536,"last_played":1463215558},"language":"english","review":"A must own and play game.

Have we forgotten that? Well the folks at Valve still know what's going on. Portal is just so much fun and very cerebral, high-minded fun. Tough puzzles and complex obstacle courses are combined with a cutesy, droning robotic voice that guides you through the strange, Science Compound-esque environment to create a game atmopshere that is delightful.\n\nThe portal gun, the tool you use throughout the game, is used to create \"in\" and \"out\" portals that whisk you from one room to another. You can dive into them, shimmy through them, use them to toss blocks here and there.

The modes outside of the main mode aren't very good, but if you're looking for a solid game that will take you a few hours to beat, this is the game for you.\n\n\tPortal is a game where you try to get from point A to point B by using different mechanics such as portals and cubes. The game does an outstanding job introducing its mechanics gradually, so that way the player isn't confused nor bored. The game's story, level design, mechanics, art design, and progression are amazing, however the alternate game modes (namely being the steps and time challenges) are a bit lackluster.\n\n[u] LEVEL DESIGN [/u]\n\n\tThe levels in Portal are simply amazing with everything in each level working together to bring the player a great experience. Everywhere the player needs to go is highlighted by an object or an art asset, so the player never feels lost. Even though this may seem hand-holding or too easy, the game will still leave enough puzzles to the player to add enjoyable gameplay with a large sense of satisfaction at the end of each puzzle. Some of the levels in the game have different shortcuts that only experience players will find. These shortcuts add replayability to the later few levels of the game, as the player will most likely not find all of the shortcuts in his or her first playthrough of the game.\n\n[u] MECHANICS [/u]\n\n\tPortal's mechanics are very consistent throughout the game, and compliment the level design. Portal does a great job of keeping the mechanics consistent so the player knows exactly what to do. For example, you cannot place portals on dark surfaces or metal throughout the entire game. All of the games mechanics interact with the level design to create a cohesive puzzle that is extremely entertaining. In the game, every time you see a large button, you know that there is a cube nearby, and the level does a nice job of explaining where the cube is. Also, in the earlier levels where momentum is needed to solve a puzzle, there is always an extended piston so the player knows where to place his or her's portal. The piston tells the player that momentum will be involved, so the level design and mechanics work well together.\n\n[u] ART DESIGN [/u]\n\n\tThe art design in Portal is very simplistic, which puts emphasis on the different aspects of each puzzle. It's very hard to get lost in Portal, because the puzzles stand out so much against their environment. In Portal, because everything is so simple, it gives the player a sense of \"Everything is here for a purpose.\" The art style also does a great job of telling a story. In the game, certain areas opt-out of using standard lights, and instead use these small rooms hidden behind opaque windows to give the player a feeling of being watched. The art design in Portal works really well with the gameplay and the theme.\n\n[u] ADVANCED MAPS [/u]\n\n\tThe advanced maps in Portal add a little bit more to the game, but I don't think they're anything to write home about. The advanced maps in Portal add obstacles, and remove shortcuts to the already existing levels to make them harder. I didn't spend much time with the advanced levels, as they're built on the same maps from the main game, because I feel the main game's maps are a lot more open with what way you solve the puzzle. Each advanced map has only one or two ways to solve the puzzle, whereas the main game of Portal has lots of different ways to solve each puzzle. Overall, I prefer when there are lots of ways to solve a puzzle as opposed to just having one way, so I didn't enjoy the advanced maps as much.\n\n[u] CHALLENGES [/u]\n\n\tIn Portal, there is a separate mode called \"Challenges.\" The challenge maps are the exact same maps from the main game, however you have a second goal, such as using the least number of portals, taking the least amount of steps, and completing the level as fast as possible. Completing each one of the later levels with the least amount of portals I found pretty clever and fun, but the other challenges have lots of problems. I found the least number of steps challenge to be ridiculous and unenjoyable. The mechanics needed to complete the level with a gold rating, I found to be pretty frustrating and irritating to pull off. Another issue with the steps challenge is Chamber 17. In Chamber 17, most of the level has nowhere to put a portal. Having nowhere to put a portal completely takes away from the challenge, and becomes an annoying game of timing each jump. The final challenge is the time challenge. In theory, this challenge should be pretty fun as it let's anybody try to be a speedrunner. However, for a few of the challenges, the time given to get gold is extremely low, and turns the challenge into constantly saving and reloading. This problem could easily be solved by giving the player a few more seconds to get gold. Overall, most of the challenges are not fun, but they do add lots of replay value as the player must try each challenge over and over again until he or she gets gold.\n\n[u] DEVELOPER COMMENTARY [/u]\n\n\tThe Developer Commentary in Portal is put together well, and is pretty interesting. If you're interested in the development of games, including art design, voice acting, and level design, then I recommend playing through the Developer Commentary.\n\nPortal as a whole is an amazing game, that has incredible level design. The game does have some problems in its other game modes, but the main game is still great. If you are even remotely into first-person games or puzzle games I strongly recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1485030569,"timestamp_updated":1485030569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.655565202236175537","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29405393","author":{"steamid":"76561198109858979","num_games_owned":762,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1531852562},"language":"english","review":"This is a smart game 8.0/10\n\nPros:\n- Original puzzle mechanics\n- A claustrophobic atmosphere\n- Gradual curve of difficulty\n- In each new room the hype for solving the ultimate mystery grows\n- The ending is quite epic\n\nCons:\n- It is quite short and yet sometimes manages to become repetitive","timestamp_created":1485026865,"timestamp_updated":1485919911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29403939","author":{"steamid":"76561198165624739","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1482956400},"language":"greek","review":"great game but remember cake is a lie","timestamp_created":1485022384,"timestamp_updated":1485022384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29403600","author":{"steamid":"76561198028593694","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1484316947},"language":"english","review":"The only complaint i've got is that it's too short.
