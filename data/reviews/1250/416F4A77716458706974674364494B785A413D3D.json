In this game, you play as a bunch of various people who hail from Britland who have an obsession with money and casually insult each other(Those crazy Brits amirite) while fighting various clones of failed lab experiments, dubbed \"Specimens\" or \"Zeds\". The actual backstory is that a company named Horzine, founded and run by the man who would eventually become the Patriarch, was tasked with creating various super soldier experiments which ended up failing. In fear of having his company shut down, he decided to release all of the failed experiments, add the final versions of the technology used in each Zed's creation(Such as the cloaking device used by the Stalker) and let himself go, and he go did. They basically f*cked up everything; it was not pretty.\n\nNow, the actual gameplay involving weapons and stuff is split into 7 perks:\nCommando - The guy who can kill the basic Zeds such as the Clot, Stalker and the Crawler, but has a harder time taking on the big guys such as Scrakes and Fleshpounds. He uses various assault rifles, battle rifles, and a few various versions of the Thompson SMG.\n\nFirebug - Similar to the Commando in terms of role, the Firebug instead uses various flame-based methods of damage including a Flamethrower, the Trenchgun which fires dragon's breath shells, and flare revolvers.\n\nSharpshooter - The Big Game Hunter, this guy has generally low ammo pools for his weapons but is MADE for headshots and killing Husks, Scrakes and Fleshpounds. Has various pistols, a Winchester lever-action rifle, a crossbow, etc.\n\nBerserker - STABBY STABBY SLICE AND DICE I HUNT YA DOWN AND KILL YA MOM. Carries various stabbing and slicing tools including a claymore, fire axe, katana and scythe(Which is DLC).\n\nSupport - The shotgunner of the team. Generally has low-ish ammo pools but does penetration damage(Can kill multiple Zeds with one shotgun blast). Generally better against the big guys than Firebug and Commando. Carries the Benelli M3 and M4, AA-12, BOOM-KILL-EVERYTHING Hunting Shotgun, etc.\n\nField Medic - This guy is the Guardian Angel of your team. Having grenades that can heal you as well as having guns that fire healing darts, he WILL stick it where the sun dun' bloody shine if you don't stand still. He also has upgrades to armor that make it work as a second health bar, essentially. Carries the MP7, MP5 and Victor SMG among others.\n\nDemolitions - BOOM. 'Nuff said. Low ammo pools and expensive stuff, so aim with caution. Carries the M79 Grenade Launcher, M32 Multiple Grenade Launcher, M4 with an under-barrel M203 GL and pipe bombs(Essentially mines) among others.\n\n\n\nWith these perks, your goal is to kill every Zed you see up 'til the final wave. These Zeds include:\nClot - Your basic walker, shambles around and does very small damage. Can grab you. He's the off-white guy with no nose.\n\nGorefast - Shambles around like the Clot until he gets within a close range of you, then he will charge you and try to slice you to bits. He's the red guy with no jaw and a friggin' sword for an arm.\n\nStalker - The invisible-woman-lady-who's-not-exactly-hard-to-find, she has the second lowest HP out of everyone, but can move faster than a lot of other Zeds. Usually spawns in pairs.\n\nCrawler - A spider-thing that has the lowest HP of any Specimen. Can move faster than most Zeds AND the player, and jumps at you when within range, so keep them away.\n\nBloat - A lumbering fat man who actually ISN'T a clone(Yes, this is an actual human being hopped up on failed steroids which makes him fat and.. bloated), he has VERY high resistance to EVERYTHING and can puke acid which can destroy you easily. However, there is one weaknesst: the head. Pop that and he's basically dead. Very easy to do. He walks very slowly.\n\nHusk - A slower-but-not-exactly-slow Specimen, he has a fireball cannon for an arm and is the only Zed with a long-range attack. Be sure to kill him when you see him. Has burns all over his body with a high-pitched metalic voice.\n\nSiren - An ugly and frail creature who moves extremely slow(I believe the slowest of all Zeds), she has a scream that not only ignores your armor and damages your health directly, the scream can also destroy un-detonated pipe bombs and explosives mid-air. Her head HP is surprising high, but her over-all health is very low.\n\nScrake - A failed experiment involving having a field surgeon resistant/immune to pain having a chainsaw for an arm, he decided he likes inflicting pain more than healing it. Headshots are the most effective against this guy. He also rages and charges forward when his health drops below a certain amount.\n\nFleshpound - The tallest, meanest and most powerful Zed, he's hopped up on super-steroids which makes him do only two things: Rage and pound flesh. If enough damage is dealt towards him or he has an un-broken line of sight on you for 10-15 seconds WITHOUT damage done to him, he will rage and promptly pound you and your team's flesh. The good part is that he is vulnerable to explosives, so grenade away. He's the guy with the light in his chest, by the way. Don't shoot him with your 9mm.\n\n\nWhen you kill said Zeds, you earn Pounds(As in the British currency, most of the maps ARE in London or some part of Britian, after all) which you can use to buy various weapons and equipment at the Trader including re-filling grenades, getting armor, and re-filling your ammo. Ammo can also be restored via ammo packs scattered along most maps, same goes for armor. Heath can only be recovered by healing yourself or someone else.\n\n\nAfter dealing with this freak show, you get to the final wave where you face their mutated creator, the Patriarch. The Patriarch has a machine gun and rocket launcher combo for an arm, can heal himself 3 times, and can go invisible and bum rush you. Yes, you should be careful.\n\n\nIf you find yourself in need of some dosh(They're POUNDS NOT DOLLARS D*MNIT) or some other form of assistance, you can use the voice command menu. If you want to compliment your team by criticizing their masculinity, you can use the voice command menu as well. If you want to kill the Specimens with harsh words, well.... You can't, but you can try with - guess what - the voice command menu.\n\n\nThis game is, above all, a tactics and teamwork game. Yes, generally pointing and clicking at something until it stops moving is a tried-and-true tactic, but not always in this game. Some perks don't have the proper tools to kill the big guys by themselves(I.E. Commando, Firebug), so you let a perk that DOES(I.E. Sharpshooter, Support) take care of it. The same perks that are good for taking care of the big guys don't neccessarily have enough ammo to take care of the lesser Specimens, so you let the former perk group take care of them. See what I'm saying? Tactics and team work.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading. I hope this review helps you buy the game. I'd be glad to play with anyone and help you out.\n\n\nP.S.: The game is not dead. Plenty of people still play it consistently.","timestamp_created":1478866740,"timestamp_updated":1615385019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558099031448364258","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26533007","author":{"steamid":"76561198173508782","num_games_owned":645,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1593859626},"language":"greek","review":"\nKilling Floor (πλήρες όνομα Killing Floor: Co-Op Survival Horror) - ένα παιχνίδι στον υπολογιστή, μια συνεταιριστική first-person shooter στο είδος του τρόμου επιβίωσης [2] [3] που αναπτύχθηκε από Tripwire Interactive και κυκλοφόρησε στις 14 Μαΐου, 2009, σύμφωνα με τα Microsoft Windows.

Same Studio, Same Concept, just less power. \n\nNow I would hate to just Copy Paste from my Killing Floor 2 Review but...its the same game. I can't stress that enough. \n\nCombat Mechanics: Ah the glory of floor based zombie shooting mayhem. Team play is key in surviving the harder difficulties. You choose a role that really does do a great job at defining your Role on the field, its not just a gun choice as your abilities of you class define what you bring to the table as a Team Player. Guns and your typical survival melee weapons with a few exotic choices like Katanas, and a mobile version of the magnetic saw thrower from Wild Wild West. \n\nSocial Mechanics: Grab a couple friends and get in there. Communication with your team is what wins the day here. Money sharing, gun retrieval on death\n\nDifferences in KF1 and KF2:  This Game has a few less classes and a few less Perks and weapons to choose from.

After each round, the trader opens the doors to her store, and the team is able to use their dosh to buy new weapons, stock up on ammo, grenades, ammo, etcetera. Strategy is key on the higher difficulties. If you're not careful, squadmates can easily die within seconds, and the whole team can end up getting swarmed. Team composition is absolutely important. If you don't have a demo laying pipe bombs, a commando/sharpshooter running interference with the regular zeds, a medic (or two) for healing, and a support for straight-up DPS, you're not going to be able to beat the boss on hard or
