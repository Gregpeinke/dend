Auch das Spiel nochmal auf Englisch durchzuspielen lohnt sich, da einige der lustigen Stellen im Originalton einfach noch lustiger sind.\n\nAlso noch mal eine kurze pro/kontra Zusammenfassung:\n+ Aufregende Story\n+ viel Humor\n+ gutes Spielkonzept (Portale)\n+ gutes Gameplay durch Source-Engine\n- Storyline dauert nur ca. 4 Stunden\n\nÜbrigens... wer Portal noch gar nicht kennt und nicht weiß, ob das Spiel die 10€ wert ist, sollte beim nächsten Steam-Sale nochmal vorbeischauen. Ich habe das Spiel für 2€ bekommen, und die lohnen sich auf jeden Fall.","timestamp_created":1448727136,"timestamp_updated":1448727136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504997432231903076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19337680","author":{"steamid":"76561198085391069","num_games_owned":1154,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1590161663},"language":"turkish","review":"Yıllar sonra yeniden oynamak isteyeceğiniz ve bittiği için üzüleceğiniz sayılı oyunlardan biri.
