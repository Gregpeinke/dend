I just want to say it's an art work.\n\n1. Extremely fantastic world & scene design. Actually the best I've ever met (not one of). They build a HUGE city in the sky to house this game! The floating pure white structures under the blue sky and sunshine with the white clouds, the amiable statues, the victorian factories are as stunning as that when all of them are \"drown in fire\". Not to mention the stylish Steampunk: the guns, the folk, the huge machines.\n\n2. Second-to-none story. I'm still thrilled by the end of the work. It's just beyond my understanding or my normal recognition. I mean, man, is this a game? Shouldn't it be just killing some monsters and level up and take gears and kill the boss and all.

Elizabeth, probably the most helping and charming and special NPC in all the games I've played.\n\n4. Decent combat system (though I really think the combat itself doesn't matter that much in this art work). Just as Steampunk should be, guns & magic ( vigor in this game). The combat itself is not really hard, as Elizabeth is just a great helper. The vigor is kind of useless considering its difficulty.

Так или иначе смотрел я на Infinite через призму впечатлений от оригинальной Bioshock. Именно поэтому первая треть игры вызывала отторжение. Оригинальный Bioshock многие ругали за монотонный и достаточно простой геймплей, не смотря на то, что казалось бы перед нами \"умный \" шутер с кучей возможности прокачки и модификациями оружия. На деле оригинальная идея с плазмидами сводилась к использованию пары-тройки наиболее эффективных, что имеет отношение и к оружию. В Infinite все оказалось еще проще, к сожалению. Лишь в дополнении Bureal at Sea видны подвижки к более сложному прохождению, но к сожалению за время отведенное на DLC эти решения не раскрываются в полной мере. В общем по геймплею игра ниже среднестатистического шутана, что чуть не заставило меня бросить прохождение спустя часов пять. К счастью, я этого не сделал. Т.к. главное в Bioshock это дизайн, история, персонажи. Не смотря на то, что даже псевдовыбора, влияющего на концовку, как в первой игре, тут нет, участвовать в событиях, происходящих в Колумбии по настоящему интересно. Конечно, дело значительно спасает DLC Bureal at Sea. Именно оно связывает всю серию, начиная с оригинала, в единый цельный и захватывающий рассказ. Главное, что ты веришь в подводный город Восторг, его обитатетлей и историю, тоже самое с Колумбией. Сними Кен Левин фильм - это был бы неоспоримый шедевр (или если бы это была книга). Или ему надо было выбрать не типичный шутер, а модный сейчас экшен в стиле Outlast, Alien: Isolation и последней Resident Evil. Когда геймплей значительно вторичен, а на первом плане стоит история и декорации, создающие атмосферу всего действа. За крутую историю вся серия Bioshock достойна Оскара от мира игр. За кривой геймплей так и тянется нажать кнопку \"не рекомендую\". Жаль, нет чего-то среднего. В общем, если вы хотите купить эту серию игр на скидке - то берите с учетом того, что играть стоит лишь ради истории. За геймплеем типичном для шутера - идите в другие игры, более достойные называться именно шутерами. Вот такая неоднозначность, как и сама история в Bioshock.","timestamp_created":1489306646,"timestamp_updated":1489306646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508235275745391846","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30463238","author":{"steamid":"76561198128292214","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":724,"last_played":1488671879},"language":"english","review":"Amazing story, fun gameplay.

Sure, sniping was out of the question, but I rarely had trouble with interactions and cutscenes.\n\nSpeaking of sniping, this game has a decent weapon system. You can hold up to two weapons at a time and switch between them. This means that you don't have an entire arsenal of weapons with you, but there are many moments you'll switch out to a different gun you find. The weapons are balanced in a way that encourages different playstyles, and situations. My only gripe is that stealth doesn't benefit the player much, making the sniper rifle rather useless.\n\nThe whole point of Bioshock is that you can modify your own body to gain powers. I thought this was done very well here, although it isn't made clear you can access your previously unlocked powers. I thought it worked like the weapon system, and was surprised when the menu came up after trying a key.\n\nThe characters and their voice acting was also well done. I never personally got bored or experienced repetition, and they had personality. You could almost know what they were thinking at times, and it played well into gameplay. I actually cared about the characters.\n\nThe big issue I have is the story. What I mention above is just the beginning. You are already a man in a sky-city with tonics that grant you powers. This is all tied together fairly well, and it makes the game fun. However, the story gets more ridiculous as you progress, as more and more ideas are jammed in. These ideas include [spoiler]A giant robotic bird, ghosts, two sibling scientists stuck in some time accident, a slave revolt (which I have mixed feelings about whether it adds to the story or an attempt just to give the game a message), flashbacks, and a complex timeline around Elizabeth's power.[/spoiler]\n\nIn other words, I found the story ridiculous with no cohesion to these ludicrous concepts. The final level seemed to be an attempt to link all of these crazy ideas into one coherent story, but the ending [spoiler]doesn't even tie together this nonsense, basically throwing it all out without any resolution.[/spoiler]\n\nTo sum up the review, the gameplay was good, it played well with my potato-computer, and the characters were interesting, but it revolved around a story that couldn't support it. I still recommend it because I enjoyed it, being a decent shooter with interesting powers.\n\nEdit 10/27/2020: Polish, grammatical fixes added.\nEdit 7/9/2021: Edited certain bits and elaborated my thoughts.

Сижу уже второй день перед компом и места себе не нахожу, так сильно меня зацепил сюжет и концовка. \nКратко раскажу предисторию моего знакомства с серией.\nПервый биошок был не плох, но немного утомителен (скажем он не зацепил) , второй биошок пропустил, так как были проблемы с запуском та и желания особого не было. Инфинит решил пройти спонтанно, не особо надеясь на то, что она сможет меня заинтересовать на долго. Кстати прошел я инфинит в 2017 , то есть немного не своевременно, весь хайп уже затих.\nЧто же я могу сказать о Инфинит в целом - игра феноминальная! честно сказать я больше не могу назвать игр которые, \nмогут сравниться именно с этой игрой.\nВ Инфинит банально интересно играть . Разработчики сделали шедевр\n\nСаоме главное достоинство игры - персонажи, Элизабет восхетительна во всех отношениях, Букеру можно только посочувствовать за то что он натвоил в прошлом и что он может сделать с последствиями в настоящем и будущем.\nДиалоги проработаны и за каждой катсценой наблюдаешь как завороженный, думая что же там будет дальше...\nЕсть смысл играть без локализации, так как диалоги чувствуются живее, чем в дубляже. Но вроде как с локализацией не напортачили так что смело можно ставить русский (это была моя первая делема, играл на английском и не пожалел)\n\nЛично мое заключение\nИгра надолго запал мне в сердце, послевкусие достаточно горькое по единственной пречине - скорее всего больше я похожих игр не увижу. Честно, после прохождения на ум лезет банальная фраза \"как стереть себе память\" и это при том, что я человек не сентиментальный!

The result? Comunism is bad: the video game (Oddly appropriet for a capitalistic cash grab) with downgraded story, graphics, game play and increased dificulty. It was worth buying while new however because of the multiplay which was fun, story driven, but is currently dead.\n\nBioshock infinate: What do you do when you have told the same story 3 times and witness your publisher push your license to make a slighlty above average game that sees the only selling point of your game as political ideology gone wrong? You make sure they can never play that card again by writing a game that crams every political ideology extreme (focusing on a mockery of a politcal counter movement at the time that was very relavent) into a single game to destract filthy casuals (even setting a 1999 code and mocking your publisher for not allowing the real difficulty setting you wanted to put in, and publically taking jabs at the marketing dept for making your cover to your game suck) while really telling the story of multiple universe theory and the implications of what it can mean for our reality if humans can have control even the smallest aspects of it. A story that is so busy distracting you with an ultimately unimportant political narative that goes nowhere and shows all ideology can be flawed when taken to an extreme (not just the TEA party) that when you finish it and finally get what the real story is you will either go WTF in rage for not making any sense, have your mind blown pretending it was way deeper than it was, realize the story they are trying to tell is impossible to convey in a 3D format and while being underwhelmed overall impressed by the effort, or made you go fap to Elizabeth rule 34.\n\nYou won't think \"Jesus, did I just witness the most expensive and entertaining trolling in the history of humanity and enjoy every minute of it?\"\n\nAn overall recomendation because the creator basically spat in the face of his publisher for messing with his IP, left the story in such an unhinged state the only way for the publisher to progress the IP is to make something entirely different that cannot rely on past formulas, spit in the mouth of fans who wanted more of the same and are willing to except pallet swap cash grabs as acceptable \"sequals\", and finally took a dump on all emplyees who weren't on board with Irrational Games trolling when they closed down and got bought up by the same publishers whose trends they bucked. It even found a way to spit on the fans who will want more because there will be no more. This is it! Done. Over. Everything else is a knock off. Irrational Games is gone. Ken Levine is focusing on other stuff that has nothing to do with Bioshock. The name infinate? Hope you enjoy playing the original games perpetually in a loop. Even games media who gushed their 10/10 reviews got played like tools, voicing every attack Ken wanted to dirrect at those who worked on the game who were not concerned about making art and more concerned with making a product. Even the first DLC was a giant middle finger cash grab made up for later when Ken gave another middle finger to all those who wanted to relive Rapture and sexualize Elizabeth.
