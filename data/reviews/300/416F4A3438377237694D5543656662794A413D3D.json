This is way more than can be said of games like Red Orchestra 2.\n\nForget about modern graphics: DoD:S is rustic, and takes no toll on even the more modest graphics cards. It runs well on old hardware and even IGPs. There are no visual bells and whistles, and I like it that way. The focus of the game is on playability, and once you're on a match, there is no leveling up, no buying weapons, etc. You pick your class and try your best to kill as many enemies as possible and not to get shot.\n\nI have enjoyed this game for several years, and as long as there are online servers out there, I'll be playing, no matter what new games are released.

When I first launched this game I was greeted with a 2 sided menu with an impresive and epic theme which got me hyped for the first server I was going to join and have a remastered version of the game I once played years ago but when I sent client info and chose my faction, I had realized that this game was more than a simple engine upgrade, it was a remake. Everything was different from the classes, balance, and factions.\n\n- Faction and Class Balance: They got rid of the British and most of the classes for the Wheremacht and Americans limiting them down to 6 for the 2 factions. You could say this was done to balance the game a bit more but all it did was break the balance even more. For the US, the rocketeir class's secondary weapon,The M2 Carbine (which was the primary weapon of Staff Sargent from the Original), outmatches the rifleman and assult's primaries and not to mention that the rocket launcher is a 1 hit kill weapon.\n\n-Maps: Mechanicaly the maps are reskins of the original which actually play fine and meet graphical expectations of the time of release, but they also look heavily unpolished to where I found multiple void holes in a number of the defualt maps.\n\n-Sound Design: Outside of the epic intro theme, the voice acting is passable and sound ok but it's nothing close to being considered impresive in comparison to Valve's other games such as TF2, Portal, or Dota 2. for weapons sounds, they actually fit well with the guns they are given to but this leads to a larger problem that mainly lies in server hosting. If you go onto certain servers that have a certain setting enabled/disabled, you will not be able to hear the weapon sounds made by other players  which nearly kills the experience since ive seen this issue occur on several servers.\n\n-The Community: DoD Source is one of those games where you get a lot of older folk playing it and the servers belong to clans what have existed in Valve gaming since the release of Steam. The downside is that those folk who come on the servers are very few in number to where you wil either find yourself playing a game with only 3 people or a server filled with bots. The map making community from what I've seen has produced some maps ive come to like but I havent seen anything that is complete garbage or a game developer masterpeice.\n\n-The Shooting: The gimic that Day of Defeat has behind its shooting mechanics is very simple. The more you fire your weapon the more your crosshair will want to jump upward. The way you would maintain accuracy is to either fire in bursts, move your mouse downward as you fire, fire from the feet upward to ensure all your bullets hit. It's very simple and it would seem very easy to execute but there is one major flaw in the system and that is the hitboxes. The hitboxes are the worst thing I have ever seen any game I have ever played, I have come behind a stationary bot and sprayed into him with my mp40 and I see bloodmarks all across his body but he then turns around and the bot kills me in 1 hit with his rifle. You might suggest I use my melee instead but there is a bigger issue in the melee system. you can only, and I mean ONLY deal damage when you are aiming at their head with your knife/spade and another thing is if you go for a backstab, there is no way you can do to someone who is moving because the game will force you into a 2 second animation when you backstab and it will cancel if you move at all or if the target is too far away so you are better off just trying to use you grenades in any given senario. The grenades in day of defeat as a franchise has always been fucked, they are 1 hit kill, have a large radius, and you are given around 5 per life so the game turns into nothing but a game of throwing bombs at eachother like ISIS on a Tuesday.\n\n-The Conclusion: If you like WW2 shooters that takes place in the American German Theatre. I would advise you pick up a game like Day of Infamy or the original Day of Defeat.","timestamp_created":1397010591,"timestamp_updated":1497933337,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462848961353302002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9767664","author":{"steamid":"76561198107584735","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":91,"playtime_forever":2435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1835,"last_played":1602524814},"language":"english","review":"It's a nice little community shooter set in World War 2, I honestly have alot of fun with it.

You HAVE to work as a team to take out a mg. However, there are some bad things about the game. The first is that the classes for each team have different weapons, and the Germans have the better weapons, making it a bit unbalanced. Then there's the autobalance.... People complain about TF2 having the worst autobalance, BUT OH NO! THE AUTOBALANCE IN DoD WILL DO IT FOR NO REASON! I'VE BEEN AUTOBALANCED TO SPECTATOR BEFORE!\nBut even with those 2 problems, the game is still great and has plenty of people still playing it, i give it a  rating of 8 Doritos / 10 Mountain Dews","timestamp_created":1396333391,"timestamp_updated":1396333391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9678456","author":{"steamid":"76561197989661604","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":48809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24499,"last_played":1658098640},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor fps!!!!","timestamp_created":1396204144,"timestamp_updated":1396204144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9672553","author":{"steamid":"76561198072152255","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1973,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":111,"last_played":1465023577},"language":"english","review":"sups good.","timestamp_created":1396165171,"timestamp_updated":1396165171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ487r7iMUCefbyJA=="}
