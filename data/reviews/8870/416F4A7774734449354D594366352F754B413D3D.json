По своей красоте новый город не уступает старому и, по моему мнению, даже выигрывает. Сюжет же просто восхитителен. Не думал, что после отличной первой части и не очень хорошей второй разработчики выкинут что-то подобное. С одной стороны, жаль, что убрали ту зависимость концовки от действий игрока, которая была в предыдущих частях серии. С другой же, концовка божетсвенна. Не хочется в ней что-либо менять. Ну и конечно, хочется отметить Элизабет :3. Она не только очень красивый и живой персонаж, но и временами очень помогает, подкидывая патроны, аптечки или деньги. В общем, Bioshock Infinite - отличнейшая игра, которую обязательно стоит пройти.

By the end of the game I found myself wanting more so I purchased all the DLCs and purchased BioShock 1 and 2. After playing BioShock Infinite, I found the BioShock 1 left me wanting more in terms of visual effects and controls. Throughout all of BioShock Infinite, there seem to be very few (if any) parts that required you to have played one of the first two games in the franchise to understand the storyline or gameplay, but [spoiler]the end of the game does have some tie in with the previous two games in the franchise[/spoiler].

Having played the other games in the Bioshock franchise, I was at first skeptical about enjoying another world other than Rapture, but Columbia is equally as beautiful and fun to explore. The use of sky-lines is a great touch which varies your method of transport, and combat, whilst Elizabeth's ability to open tears adds a another dimension to combat. The storyline is so detailed and continuely keeps you on your toes to shock you. The main characters, Booker and Elizabeth, are easy to empathise with and you can get much more involved in their choices and feelings than you can in other games. The use of vigors, similar to the other Bioshock games, are fun to play with and can be used in combinations to help elimante your enemies faster - making you feel ultimately powerful when you take down a difficult boss. Bioshock Infinite has so much replay value, whether its for finding all of the voxophones that enable you to discover more of the truth about Columbia's history, or simply to try and complete the game in hard difficulty and 1999 mode. The game is simply beautfiul to play.\n\nThe DLC available to buy is just as irresistible as the main game. Clash in the Clouds offers wave-based levels where you battle off against enemies for as long as possible. Burial At Sea, though, is where everything makes sense. Parts 1 and 2 link Columbia and Rapture together in a different storyline that is long enough to feel like a mini game. Both parts help to answer many unsolved questions of the Bioshock franchise and have left me more knowledgable of the games, but also made me want to play the whole franchise again and again! I would recommend not playing Bioshock Infinite's Burial at Sea DLC until having played the other Bioshock games as past events from the franchise are alluded to in the DLC.\n\nOverall, Bioshock Infinite is one of my favourite games. As a lover of the whole franchise, this latest installment has done it proud.  As they say, \"there's always a man, always a lighthouse, and always a city\".\n\nNow, would you kindly buy and play this game?","timestamp_created":1403549539,"timestamp_updated":1403549539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10721747","author":{"steamid":"76561198086541664","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1212,"last_played":1618064418},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Разработчики очень постарались над сюжетом и гемплеем этой велеколепной игры,я ни капли не жалею что её приобрел!","timestamp_created":1403548850,"timestamp_updated":1403548850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10721718","author":{"steamid":"76561198033048883","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":999,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":884,"last_played":1449278485},"language":"english","review":"One of the best looking games I have ever played!","timestamp_created":1403548805,"timestamp_updated":1403548805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10721535","author":{"steamid":"76561197976737076","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":986,"last_played":1413425398},"language":"english","review":"I found the storyline and gameplay to be excellent.

No regrets. Game play was simple enough for a newbie to get used to, yet i'd think it's complex enough for seasoned gamers to explore as well. Lots to explore in the game and the graphics were awesome. The soundtrack is worth listening to as well but most importantly the characters and story is king in this one. Loved it! Totally hooked and looking forward to more! But this game.
