Even with Doom, Doom Eternal and many other big and small franchises to think about both inside and outside of the shooter genre, this game receives one of my highest praises yet. It's fun, energetic, bright, colorful with enemies that just pop out onto the screen. It has characters to care about and clear villains, it does pretty much everything not-bioshock while being unmistakably bioshock.\n\nTo which, we'll mention what I consider the star of the entire game, the hook-line. It's the first weapon you get, and although its simply a dedicated melee button, it does what it can and more. In combat you're not just limited to your guns and powers, you're limited to how you can maneuver around the game map itself. Jumping from line to line, knocking foes off ledges into the great skies of Colombia before shotgunning his mate nearby. Patriots and Handymen keep you from being gung ho in the open fighting while Rocketeers and Firemen keep you from maneuvering the map safely. The gameplay is fast and dynamic, making it more of a drug the more fun you have at it.\n\nAnd although the gameplay is a blast, its marred by largely noticeable issues. For one, weapons carrying becomes limited to two, and while that's fair and understandable in most shooters, I feel like this was an innovation for innovation sake, and it really bothered me having to swap between weapons I dont much care for. About less than half of the weapons in the game are rip offs of other weapons with some slight change, like the repeater being the machine gun but with a 3-fire burst. Not that I was hoping for massive weapon differences, but its what I vaguely suspected, as the alternate shotgun variant fires off a line of fire instead of shells, which makes me wonder why couldn't they just make the special weapons more radically different?\n\nTo the other side of the coin, we have Vigors (not Plasmids) that are open to you at no limited capacity. While one or two of the vigors are on the weaker side (possession at the second half of the game and the crow thing which doesn't do much), things like Bucking Bronco and the like are fun and engaging, especially when you have a special gear that chains entire rooms of enemies to float in the air with every kill, further adding to the baddassery of your conquest and most importantly, gameplay.\n\nTo end this off, the story itself isn't entirely mind boggling but after going through the struggle to the end, the game ends on a note that isn't satisfying, but it really leaves its mark with how unique it is, and even now after playing it, I still think of it from time to time. There are three DLC's, the blue ribbon challenge is only recommended if you're a completionist, and Burial at Sea part 1 and 2, which are straight-up story expansions to the game itself. They are most definitely shorter, and make up for it by making the enemies harder hitters, but by the end of Burial at Sea, it left me mostly satisfied that this is how Bioshock should end, on a strong note that really makes the whole package worth it. Grab it if you can!","timestamp_created":1595315555,"timestamp_updated":1595315555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73045991","author":{"steamid":"76561198308940712","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":693,"last_played":1595395188},"language":"english","review":"This is my second time playing this game and i'm so speechless everytime i get to the ending like wtf.

The gunplay is simple and fun with a variety of weapons, good enemy variety & a range of powers to use which are all fun and have utility in the fight. In particular the power which absorbs damage into a molten ball which you then throw at an enemy is very nice.\n\nThe only small drawback I found was a strange cheap boss fight, I played 95% of the game on hard, the first 1/4 of the game was incredibly easy, the latter 3/4 was a good challenge with one specific frustrating part. In this boss fight you have to kill this ghost 3 times, the ghost is a massive bullet sponge and has a load of minions to throw poo at you. there is little cover and if you are low on ammo then good luck, went on easy mode because I cba. I don't dislike hard games, I beat Dark souls 3 twice on my PS4 along with Dark souls 1 and Bloodborne(barely) but this was annoying & cheap af.\n\nDespite it's flaws the simple but fun gunplay and one of a kind story is worth the every bit of the £7 I spent on it. Its not a long game & I plan on playing it again on 1999 mode at some point in the future. i'll stock up on ammo to spank that mf ghost.\n\n5/5 \n\ngo & get it

есть маяк. Всегда есть человек, всегда есть город[/h1]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1917371110\nЗаключительная часть в серии игр BioShock, которая не смотря на смену тонов с темных на яркие, ни сколько не потеряла своей мрачности, а скорее даже увеличила её, так как мы в отличии от прошлых частей (в которых мы сразу оказывались на развалинах некогда земли обетованной) своими глазами наблюдаем за тем, как этот мир кажущийся священным градом на холме буквально превращается в ад, все глубже падая в пучину отчаяния и разрухи, причем не без нашего непосредственного участия.\n\n[h1]🎬 Графика и дизайн[/h1]\nКартина по истине завораживает, локации (особенно в первой половине игры) неописуемо живописны и прекрасны, глаз радуется буквально каждой детали и хочется разглядывать абсолютно все, а не лететь куда-то сломя голову. \nГрафика и по сей день смотрится отлично, ни сколько не потеряв актуальности. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1934108672\n\n[h1]🎮 Игровой процесс[/h1]\nПожалуй самая слабая часть игры, он не плохой, но особо звезд с неба не хватает, стрелять и использовать способности занятно, но какого-то излишнего восторга не вызывает. Хотя взаимодействие со всеми любимой Элизабет, которое неимоверное простенькое (она порой подкидывает вам припасы, вскрывает замки на дверях) добавляет своего шарму и делая нашу напарницу более живой и менее безучастной к происходящему, чему я несказанно рад, ведь не будь этого элемента, уже было бы совсем не то. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1914840753\n\n[h1]🎥 Сюжет[/h1]\nСюжет не побоюсь этого слова бесподобен. Он полон неожиданных поворотов, моральных дилемм, трагических моментов и философских подтекстов. За изменением персонажей по ходу действия наблюдать интересно, особенно за тем как преображается Элизабет, из доброй и наивной девушки, в отрешенную от чужих проблем и закаленную испытаниями (оставившими глубокие в первую очередь душевные шрамы) женщину. \n\n[h1]🏁 Заключение[/h1]\nBioShock Infinite из той когорты игр, которые выходят крайне редко и по праву могут считаться шедеврами игровой индустрии, являясь прямым доказательствам того, что игры это тоже искусство на ровне с кино.","timestamp_created":1595222292,"timestamp_updated":1596135906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":52,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.791173279285430908","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72984756","author":{"steamid":"76561198186436169","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1653739599},"language":"schinese","review":"伊丽莎白我老婆！","timestamp_created":1595222140,"timestamp_updated":1595222140,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72984392","author":{"steamid":"76561198317872866","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":462,"last_played":1595344911},"language":"schinese","review":"画面还行，游戏体验良好，只是容易头晕，不行了兄弟们，我先去吐了。。。。。","timestamp_created":1595221419,"timestamp_updated":1595221419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72983784","author":{"steamid":"76561198374808866","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":328,"last_played":1595308631},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩","timestamp_created":1595220166,"timestamp_updated":1595220166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw14CitfMCeM60lgI="}
