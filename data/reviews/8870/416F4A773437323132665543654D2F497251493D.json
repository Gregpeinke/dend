The story was easy to follow in the beginning, but they lost me at the climax because a lot of the things that take place are not explained properly like how the siphon works or what exactly is the deal with the Luteces or how Fitzroy, a normal maid, rises up as the leader of the rebellion, etc. All of it's just shoehorned in. Then at the end, the story completely falls apart with too many plotholes and a hamfisted parallel universes ending to somehow link Infinite's universe to 1&2's. The cherry on top was Burial at Sea DLCs, which basically retcon not just the main game's ending but also the gameplay to be more in line with the previous games. That wouldn't be so bad if it were not for the fact that they never tell the player that they're doing this. After playing through Infinite and CitC DLC on highest difficulties with no issues, I was dead confused as to why I kept dying over and over again in Burial at Sea DLC on the same difficulty or why I was consistently struggling to find ANY ammo for either my weapons or powers to deal with the hostile elements, for that matter. Problem is- they turn the difficulty curve on its head instantly and without informing the player; the two most horrendous sins in the world of level design- both combined together in this case. Despite being a scaredy cat who never plays survival horror games, I still believe Burial at Sea to be objectively the worst part of this series so much so that I'd rather play Bioshock 1 and 2 anyday of the week over that crap (Infinite is still my top favorite of the series though). The ending for Burial at Sea was so bad, full of plotholes and unsatisfying the likes of which I have probably never experienced in my 15 years of gaming. Big no to that DLC. In fact, CitC wasn't that good either in terms of content.","timestamp_created":1605349386,"timestamp_updated":1605349386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79241167","author":{"steamid":"76561197981431941","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1113,"last_played":1605344972},"language":"russian","review":"Ужаснейший сюжет, жаль потраченного времени.
