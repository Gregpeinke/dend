The story is one you just have to experience along with the twists.  I really loved how they went away from the dark and danky atmosphere from the first two games and innovated into an awesome looking place named Columbia.  I liked the gunplay but its only good enough, it really could be alot better and i mean alot.  I liked the new salt and vigor system and works very well.  The way the game looks is amazing and uses great color.  Putting this game at the highest settings looks like watching a newborn baby be born. Its beautiful and great thing is that it has been optimized well and didn't tank the fps much at all.  The game is one of my favorites for its amazing dialouge and the main characters interactions.

It is a fine addition to a fine series and I would strongly recommend playing at least Bioshock 1 before Infinite, but while you're at it you should play 2 as well because it too is a great ride!\n\nInfinite contains a beautifully sculpted world--Columbia--which rivals Rapture in its depth (though not literally) and immersiveness. The gameplay is far more action or combat-based than Bioshock 1, which focused more on a kind of rudimentary stealth. In this sense, the action in Bioshock infinite is far superior to its predecessors and is actually a hell of a lot of fun at times. Almost all of the weapons and vigors (i.e. plasmids) are fun and useful in some way, which adds greatly to the variety of gameplay options. As for the story, it is extremely hard to top the kind of atmosphere created by the story in Bioshock 1, and I think Infinite's just falls short. However, as it progresses it becomes increasingly complex and far more interesting in a way that neither of its predecessors achieved. Without spoiling anything, the ending is far from unsatisfactory to those who like to actually *think* about the games they play.\n\nAll in all, the game is excellent. I would highly recommend to any gamer. 9/10.","timestamp_created":1408200069,"timestamp_updated":1408200069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11737934","author":{"steamid":"76561198090746033","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1060,"last_played":1491862767},"language":"russian","review":"Игра в целом хорошая советую по играть,графика и эпизоды тоже отличны,советую по играть в другие части Bioshok","timestamp_created":1408190886,"timestamp_updated":1408190886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11737628","author":{"steamid":"76561198069349174","num_games_owned":328,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":655,"last_played":1658697981},"language":"turkish","review":"Gerçekten çok zevkli ve güzel bir oyun.Uçan Şehir Columbia da geçen oyunumuz görsel olarak iştah açıcı.Oyun içeriği adil(\ngenelde insan vs. insan),sıkıcı değil,çeşitli,gelişmiş ve efsanevi bir oyun.Herkese tavsiye ederim.","timestamp_created":1408188861,"timestamp_updated":1408188861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497942358255386353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11733033","author":{"steamid":"76561198065875949","num_games_owned":1893,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":856,"last_played":1375636988},"language":"french","review":"Les joueurs sont en général beaucoup plus critiques avec les grosses productions, et c'est bien normal.

Clash in the clouds is fun, until a certain point. And that is that.\n\nBurial at sea ep. 1 - A deeper story of rapture. It was kinda fun! Good story, small secrets and worth to get the audio dialogues for. Remember that you can buy upgrades for weapon/vigor before getting it!\n\nBurial at sea ep. 2 - This time you play as \"someone else\". This \"someone else\" is maybe not as though as Booker, and requires a bit more stealthy approach, and that is what makes it fun!

While the lyrics originally intend to find solace in meeting one's ancestors in heaven, Bioshock Infinite Creative Director Ken Levine takes the hymn literally in establishing Columbia, the floating utopia on which his latest game takes place.\n\nColumbia is the result of self-proclaimed \"prophet\" Zachary Comstock feeling that he must establish \"an Ark for a new time\" in the sky. This Ark separates the true believers, who worship the ideals expounded by the founding fathers of America, from the godless heathens of America circa 1912.\n\nComstock's hyper-American floating city sounds grand enough on paper, but in execution, the sights and sounds frequently made my jaw drop. Bioshock Infinite dares to be different with an art style that is vibrant and diverse while still remaining cohesive. The bright colors, lively music, and larger-than-life statues brought me back to Disneyland's Main Street of all places. Sure, it doesn't seem believable that ordinary folks would actually live there, but in the depths of my imagination, Columbia could actually exist. The city isn't just there to look pretty either. Columbia is chock-full of details that contribute valuable details to the narrative.\nbioshock infinite columbia\nThe setup for Bioshock Infinite's plot is pretty basic: Booker DeWitt, a mentally scarred war veteran down on his luck, is in debt to the wrong people. When Booker is offered a chance to rescue a girl named Elizabeth in exchange for an erasure of his debt, he jumps at the chance. This basic premise allows any player to get into the action and feel like there is a \"reason\" for everything that happens on screen, but players who take the time to analyze the game world will be highly rewarded. The nature of Booker's debt is never directly explained in the narrative, but if you look at Booker's desk in his office, the mountain of losing horse race tickets might give it away.\n\nOne important detail that expedient players will run past completely is Bioshock Infinite's honest portrayal of racism in the 1900's. It is brought to the forefront a little bit at the beginning of the story but only through overhearing conversations, and thoroughly exploring the environment, do you get the full picture. Time and time again, one doesn't get the full experience unless you take up Bioshock Infinite's frequent offers to ignore the main objective and explore the storefronts, slums, and back-alleys of Columbia. There is such an abundance of story details living in the walls of the game that Columbia shouldn't just be considered the setting of Bioshock Infinite; it's one of the main characters. A journey through Columbia makes every other game world feel dull and lifeless by comparison.\nbioshock infinite garden\nThe core of Infinite's plot is the relationship between protagonist Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth. Players meet Elizabeth about an hour into the game, rescuing her from atop Columbia's tallest tower. From here, the story shifts towards a breakneck pace of firefights across not only the city but, thanks to Elizabeth's power to open portals, across dimensions as well.\n\nThe relationship between Booker and Elizabeth generates more emotional moments than I have experienced in any recent shooter. Watching Elizabeth and Booker grow closer was more exciting than all the explosions in the entire game put together. The twists and turns are constant throughout the 12 hour storyline until the very end when the rug is pulled out from underneath you, and that is where the genius of Bioshock Infinite really shines. The brilliantly confounding ending is the cherry on top of what is already one of gaming's best stories. But enough about the narrative: how does it play?\nBioshock Infinite Elizabeth\nThe rescue mission premise for Bioshock Infinite may give the wrong impression. Normally, games centered around escorting a weaker character mean constantly halting the flow of an action sequence to check on an inept companion. Fortunately, while Elizabeth experiences quite a shock after first witnessing violent acts, she quickly becomes indispensable in battle. Whenever Booker gets injured, runs low on ammo or \"salts\" (mana), a quick button prompt turns the player to face Elizabeth to catch a quick resupply. Elizabeth can also use her dimension-warping powers to summon cover, weapons, health kits, or environmental hazards into the scene, though only one can be active at a time. This contributes to the frantic nature of the combat, which is already hectic with just Booker on his own.\nbioshock infinite gameplay\nBioshock Infinite decks Booker out with the standard supply of first-person-shooter guns. The shooting by itself is smooth and satisfying enough but the real fun comes in \"Vigors\", the array of magical powers Booker can shoot from his left hand. I found the array of powers in Bioshock Infinite to be much more satisfying than those in the original Bioshock. Depending on how many enemies there are in an encounter, or even how many of them are human or machine, the power that can most efficiently dispatch of them will change. This encourages more experimentation than the Bioshock of 2007, but I still found myself settling on a one-size-fits-all approach for the final third of the game, which is heavy on large firefights. The combination was Bucking Bronco / Shotgun to the face, by the way.\n\nOverall, the gameplay in Bioshock Infinite is on par with most of its contemporaries. The original Bioshock's combat was clunky even by 2007 standards, so it's good to see the series take such a strong leap forward. However, while I appreciate the stress-free aspects of not needing to constantly tend to Elizabeth, there could have been more interaction between her and Booker in combat to deepen their relationship. Still, that is a minor nitpick given how satisfying the combat feels compared to all the other games in the series.\nbioshock infinite prayer\nIrrational Games has achieved several milestones in Bioshock Infinite. They put out a shooter with mass market appeal that is about much more than shooting. Racism, sexism, religion, and controversial events from America's history are explored by the story's end. The floating city of Columbia hits unforgettable status after about five minutes, with visuals that forced me to mouth \"wow\" at my computer screen constantly. Irrational also cultivates a genuinely heartwarming relationship between two main characters in a game that otherwise delights in the surreal.

This is going to be an in-depth review of the game as a stand-alone game, and as a part of the series, divided by the various elements that make a game, well, you know, a game.\n\nGameplay:\nAs a Part of The Bioshock Series (assuming you have already played them):\nSeriously lacking. They replaced the Power To The People Station with simple and cheap ways of weapon upgrades, which is, as a part of the series, a dissapointment. They replaced the plasmids with vigors which are frankly awesome, but not THAT new. What was new was the introduction to traps, which was very well handled. But what I cannot forgive is that they took away the ADAM gathering, and moved away its upgrades to simple vending machines, giving the game a much easier experience, apart from the serie's particular difficulty. 8/10\nAs a Stand-Alone Game:\nDifferent, innovating, thrilling and rewarding, not to mention hard. Vigors kept the experience fresh, and the guns were well balanced. Good work. 9/10\n\nStoryline\nAs a part of the Bioshock Series: \nGood enough. It provided new and fresh ideas, but keeping the feel of being a Bioshock game. The unfolding of the story trough voxophones is brilliant, and, as compared to the stories in previous games, much, much more coherent and entertaining. 9/10\nAs a Stand-Alone game:\nAn absolute Masterpiece. Mind-blowing, exciting and amazing in every way. The characters are beautiful, the voice-acting is tremendously well done, and, not to spoiler anything, an ending worth crying for. 10/10\n\nOther elements:\nAnimation: Perfect in every way. Very well done. Way better than the series (due to the fact that most of the main character in previous installments had little to no screen time) 9/10\nSoundtrack: Very well put toghether as actual parts of the storyline. 9/10\nDLC's: Absolute must haves. (Maybe Clash In the Clouds not as much) but the Burial at Sea series are definetly worth getting. ESPECIALLY if you played both previous Bioshock games. They may have their own reviews later on.\nGraphics/art: The art, as it's common among the Bioshock games is absolutely, amazingly beautiful. Therefore, the graphics are really, really good. 10/10\n\nOverall:\nAs a part of the Bioshock Series: 8.5/10.

Stessa cosa dell'ambientazione, da Rapture immersa nell'oceano, a Colombia immersa nelle nuvole. Poi con il passare delle ore di gioco ho capito che il nuovo capitolo aveva qualche aggancio con i primi due capitoli ma era a se stante. Da quel momento in poi la trama è diventata più avvincente e inprevedibile. Tutto era logico ma allo stesso tempo illogico come i due fratelli gemelli Lutece. Non c'era da capire, era da giocare e basta. Un finale inaspettato che ti lascia a bocca aperta, la ciliegina sulla torta. Ho giocato anche i due DLC Burial of Sea: aggiungono ore di gioco e soprattutto risposte come me su quale legame ci fosse tra Rapture e Columbia.

It's not a bad game but I think it is massivly over-rated. \n\nThe levels are super linear, the enemies are huge bullet sponges. I actually almost got stuck once because it takes so much ammo to kill one of the bosses and when you die you don't get your ammo back and you loose money you could use to buy ammo. It doesn't help that you can only carry 2 weapons at a time and the enemies end up dropping ammo for guns you are not carrying. Protip Don't play on hard-mode. It doesn't make it more challanging it just makes it more annoying.\n\nElizabeth was sadly a dissapointment as well. She doesn't actually help you fight. She is ignored by all enemies and she ignores all enemies. All she does is throw supplies at you and trigger different things.\n\nI was not a huge fan of the story either. While the dialouge and atmosphere of the places you visit are nice it also has a lot of shortcomings. None of the choises you make, makes a difference and the ending isn't explained very well. I do understand what they are trying to do but I just don't think they executed and explained it very well. Without spoiling anything its also flawed and doesn't make any sense. They also tease you to fight a certain boss the entire game but it never ends up happening which was a huge dissapointment.\n\nI bought this game full-price though and at a lower cost it is definatly worth checking out, despite its shortcomings. I just needed to give it some critique because no-one seems to do so.
