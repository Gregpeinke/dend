It's a hard game, sometimes deaths can feel cheap and some moments will make you want to pull your hair off. I don't think I would bother finishing this game if not for the quick save feature.\n\nDespite this, I can't deny Half Life's importance to the industry. Without it, Valve wouldn't exist, without it Steam wouldn't exist. It's an historic game that every gamer should experience at least once.","timestamp_created":1575361654,"timestamp_updated":1575361654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59108604","author":{"steamid":"76561198096580041","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":905,"last_played":1654665986},"language":"english","review":"I was skeptical of Half Life, hearing all the buzz about the series being legendary and fun with a cliff-hanging story. It's $0.99 Steam sale price tag was pretty appealing, and I figured, \"If I don't like it, I lost only $0.99. Who cares?\" I bought it about a year ago and never got a chance to start it until a few days ago. Here are my opinions:\n\nThis game is jaw-droppingly intuitive for it's time. My goodness. The moment that I was shown that \"crouch jumping\" was a mechanic in the tutorial, I was blown away (personally) by the idea of it being utilized in a shooter game. I grew up with shooters like Call of Duty Black Ops and Battlefield 3 for years. They are nowhere near this level of mechanics in my personal opinion, despite the fact Half Life was released in 1998. \n\nThe game play is super slick for it's first play through. Small issues and a few confusing destination points, but none to make me even consider not recommending the game anyway. The game has really nice (mostly) indicators of where you need to go or what you need to do. The color of pipes heading in a clear direction, named signs, glowing control panels to signify that you completed something (turned on the gas, turned on the fuel, etc). Sometimes it was awkward, admittedly.  I'd only recommend that if you are having a hard time with a specific part, check a play through on YouTube. As for the mobs that you fight, they can be hard, but mostly fair and never felt impossible at the Normal difficulty. Think about what is near the enemy if you aren't sure how to beat it (grenades near a large mod, for example). Save A LOT if you are worried about getting YEETED like I was. It saved me a lot of grief. \n\nThe story is fun and develops at an interesting pace over time. No cut scenes in the game, all centered around dialogue and listening to background announcements or voices. Let the NPCs do the talking so you catch what's happening. It's almost like the story isn't forced on you necessarily (you go from point A to B, but don't *have* to hear the dialogue), but its part of the background as you continue onward. If you skip over the story too much, you will be surprised by what happens next. I never knew that the Half Life's story would go *this way*, but it did, and it was a super cool experience. One of the best cliff-hanging endings for sure.\n\nI beat the game in about 4 days just over 15 hours on Normal mode. It was super fun and I am sold on playing the series. This game is epic and deserves the praise it gets. \n\n99 cents out of 100 cents for me. If you have been on the fence about it, do yourself a favor and play this game. \n\nTLDR; Worth every penny and 100% recommend it. Fantastic game with very few short comings that can be dealt with fairly easily with some brief research. Get it while it's on sale for $0.99 to buy more games (even more Half Life, dang it!). Heck, I would have bought it for $10.","timestamp_created":1575360848,"timestamp_updated":1577678590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59107629","author":{"steamid":"76561198188333327","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":991,"last_played":1575359149},"language":"russian","review":"По сути игра в комментариях не нуждается, но всётаки напишу.\nХотя вторую халфу прошёл уже давно, до первой руки не доходили ещё, но посмотреть на легендарную игру хотелось.
