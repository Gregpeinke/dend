It is a puzzle game, yet a game with a story line. Portal 2 is a game that took me half a year to complete due to its slow points in the game, but one thing that made it really one of my favorite story line games, was its realism. Saying this, i mean that the game itself has evidence around each corner that the lab was in use at one point. The evidence ranges from posters to voices of old scientific testers. All I can say is that this game (especially the ending) is just flat out beautiful. I would pay money just to watch the last five minutes of the game. So in all, this game is worth money and your time if you are into half-life or puzzle games itself. 12/10 would reccomend.","timestamp_created":1421556586,"timestamp_updated":1421556586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14043445","author":{"steamid":"76561198081056099","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":316,"last_played":1624905533},"language":"english","review":"Easily, the best puzzle game of our generation.

Ainda melhor que o primeiro.\nO que eu mais gostei de Portal 2 é a coerência que os desenvolvedores tiveram na criação deste jogo. Na minha opinião, é o que se espera de uma boa continuação de um sucesso. Muitas vezes sabemos que fazem mer** em cotinuações, seja por não inovar nada, ou por não melhorar gráficos, ou por mudar muito o estilo de jogo, enfim. Mas em Portal 2 acertaram na mosca. Fizeram uma continuação que realmente te dá mais do mesmo no sentido que o jogo se mantém fiel a raiz dele, mas também apresenta várias inovações em seus puzzles que te farão ter que pensar de maneira diferente a cada novidade apresentada. Até um pouco antes da metade o jogo parece realmente uma continuação um pouco preguiçosa tanto no gameplay quanto na história, mas quando um certo acontecimento chega o jogo \"muda de foco\" na trama e vários novos tipos de puzzle são introduzidos, fato que realmente me agradou muito. Até o fim do jogo me diverti muito resolvendo tudo e vendo os diálogos. E ah, fora a melhoria gráfica que também foi muito boa.\nIsso tudo sem contar a trilha sonora, o modo cooperativo, modo de criar e jogar em fases criadas, enfim...\nRecomendadíssimo, 10/10!\n*É o único jogo em que assistir aos créditos é realmente legal.","timestamp_created":1421543374,"timestamp_updated":1421543549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14041243","author":{"steamid":"76561198129508692","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":997,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52,"last_played":1594090039},"language":"german","review":"Super Atmosphäre und mal etwas anderen Mechaniken, die auf ganzer Linie überzeugen !\nAufgaben, Soundtrack und Story, sehr unterhaltsam.\nAbsolute Pflicht und bis heute eines der besten Games in Steam.\nH.o.l.e.n. :)","timestamp_created":1421542329,"timestamp_updated":1421542329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14040955","author":{"steamid":"76561198088580136","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2896,"last_played":1655277851},"language":"english","review":"its nice\n-Heavy\n\n\n1337/10 IGN approved","timestamp_created":1421540951,"timestamp_updated":1421540951,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":36,"weighted_vote_score":"0.359703153371810913","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14040638","author":{"steamid":"76561198052192891","num_games_owned":373,"num_reviews":182,"playtime_forever":1965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1230,"last_played":1459660677},"language":"russian","review":"Чтобы фанаты не говорили, но для меня она навсегда будет лучшей игрой Valve.\nПланирую перепройти её на идеально.

To say that as a sequel  Portal 2 is great (and by that I mean really great; one of the best follow ups in gaming history in my humble opinion) is the least of it.  As a platformer/puzzle game, as a sequel, but simply as a game, Portal 2 is ‘all across the board’ a phenomenal achievement! \n\nIt’s easily twice as long as Portal and with more humor to go with that extra length. Co-op missions have also been added for additional gameplay and there is now an even crazier use of physics-based puzzle solving elements thrown into the mix, most notably with the addition of liquids that allow you/other objects to bounce (blue liquid), move faster (orange liquid) and create portals on surfaces you normally couldn’t utilize for that purpose (white liquid) – not gonna go into specifics on that or when that even factors into the game’s campaign but for certain Portal 2 is a wild ride fraught with wacky antics, danger, intrigue and….umm….potatoes (yeah, not gonna go into that either and spoil anything for ya! You’ll just have to find out on your own).  \n\nTo sum up my thoughts:  Portal 2……..I love you!!!!","timestamp_created":1421368777,"timestamp_updated":1421368777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14001846","author":{"steamid":"76561198047727923","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":10236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10160,"last_played":1657576545},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games to come out of Valve since Half-Life 2: Episode 2.\n\nFantastic story, fantastic graphics, even ten years on, it still holds up.\n\nAlso super fun to speedrun!","timestamp_created":1421364913,"timestamp_updated":1636867652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14001280","author":{"steamid":"76561198143417858","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":897,"last_played":1646900895},"language":"english","review":"best game ever awesome story line 10 out of 10 would buy","timestamp_created":1421362943,"timestamp_updated":1421362943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4war198oCcMi0NQ=="}
