Además de alargar bastante más la duración esta segunda parte introduce nuevas mecánicas como las generadas a partir de la segunda mitad del juego por los geles. Igualmente el espíritu del primero sigue intacto, más bien se agranda si cabe aún más.\n\nLos puzzles, pese a no ser de una complejidad muy elevada en su mayoría, son todos una aplicación de los principios y mecánicas que nos ofrece el juego basados en los portales, la clave para que sean tan fluidos es que no son del tipo \"ensayo y error\", para pasarlos únicamente tendremos que pensar como aplicar todo lo que hemos aprendido sobre el uso de las herramientas que se ponen a nuestra disposición, pero en ningún caso nos veremos repitiendo las cosas una y otra vez hasta aburrirnos y podamos dar con la solución.\n\nPero los puzzles son solo un fragmento de ese \"todo\" que convierte a esta saga -bajo mi punto de vista- en una de las mejores de la historia. Personajes carismáticos, desarrollo dinámico y variado -cosa muy meritoria dado el género-, una historia muy trabajada, humor, unos valores de producción cuidados al detalle... y todo esto en un tipo de juego tan poco convencional que lo convierten en una experiencia tan auténtica como única.\n\nNo tengo ningún pero, ninguno para esta obra maestra. No es algo que deban jugar los amantes de los juegos de puzzles, es algo que debería de probar todo el mundo que le gusten los videojuegos porqué seguramente no encontraran nada parecido a esta maravilla nunca.","timestamp_created":1416651377,"timestamp_updated":1417036004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637688696384429932","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13038006","author":{"steamid":"76561198110501880","num_games_owned":403,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":615,"last_played":1592513147},"language":"turkish","review":"hikayesi gerçekten çok sürükleyici ve zamanın nasıl geçtiğini anlamayarak oynadığım nadir oyunlardan. eğer bulmaca gibi şeylere merakınız varsa tavsiye ederim kesinlikle.","timestamp_created":1416650888,"timestamp_updated":1416650888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.642857134342193604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13037005","author":{"steamid":"76561198028102438","num_games_owned":1913,"num_reviews":155,"playtime_forever":1969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1452,"last_played":1565551473},"language":"schinese","review":"此游戏做的真的用心.\n单人模式下难免有些寂寞.\n但是联机模式,简直乐趣无穷啊.\n而且开发者对每个关卡和设计理念都有口叙.\n而且有创意工坊,和无限实验室,简直玩不完啊.\n更赞的是,有简体中文的完美支持.\n你还有什么理由拒绝?\n更更赞的是,我是合徽章送的90%打折卷买的.\n哈哈哈哈啊.......","timestamp_created":1416643725,"timestamp_updated":1416643725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524626731872558594","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13036974","author":{"steamid":"76561198149379440","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2033,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":167,"last_played":1642746895},"language":"english","review":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1416643496,"timestamp_updated":1416643496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13031859","author":{"steamid":"76561198120694185","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1695,"last_played":1601318955},"language":"english","review":"'Please disregard any undeserved comments' oh, and dont not stare into the operational end of the device.","timestamp_created":1416605374,"timestamp_updated":1416605374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13030578","author":{"steamid":"76561198041176569","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":10662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5333,"last_played":1643483958},"language":"english","review":"This ultimate masterpiece game is filled with puzzles, sacarsm and emotions. \n\nAs you get betrayed by your \"best buddy\" you wonder through the depths of a Salt Mine bought out by a maniac who made shower curatains you learn more and more about this mystical place. \n\nPortal 2 is by far the best sequel to a perfect puzzle game with a story line full of action, joy, fun and happiness.

It's still amazing either way, but there are some easter eggs from the first one that will only add onto your emotional distress. Which, admit it, most of you love a good story, and letting connections click. I highly recommend playing Portal before Portal 2.\n\n-There is much more of a story in this one. Even after a year and a half, I still think of it all the time.\n\n-Before you know it, you're emotionally attached to all of the characters.\nThe puzzles will leave you extremely frustrated, but it's an exilarating feeling to finally complete a test you've been working on for an hour.\n\nI've played this game 8 times through. I love the characters, the plot, and everything about it. If you haven't gotten this game, I highly recommend getting it right now.
