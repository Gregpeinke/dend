Although it comes free with Half-Life 2 I’m just telling you that it’s not worth playing and is just pretty pointless at this time. It’s about 10 minutes of going up a cliff side and through a little town killing combine and killing a combine helicopter the end about 10 minutes that’s it. This map was initially supposed to be a level during the Highway 17 chapter in Half-Life 2 but was cut and then was used as a test for HDR which serves as the only point of this is to see Half-Life 2 in HDR. \n\n+Cool map\n+Dev commentary\n+Gabe says Gaben :)\n+HDR\n\n-Literally like 12 minutes or so of gameplay extremely short boring not worth playing\n-I really don’t see the point in this whatsoever. It's a cut level so even then it’s a HDR test which I don’t see why is public and or is still given to players who buy Half-Life 2 as I’m sure Valve isn’t collecting results from this anymore. Would be nice if this would be sold independently as players could get this on their own accord instead of forcing everyone who buys Half-Life 2 this pointless game. \n-Remote Play doesn’t work\n\nThis is nice to see Half-Life 2 in HDR although personally I didn’t see much of a major difference from the main game. Even with this cool visual upgrade this demo was really short and uneventful and ik the whole point just to show off the HDR and listen to the dev commentary along with it. Personally I just felt it to be rather pointless to have bundled with Half-Life 2 as it’s put into your Steam library as a separate game. It would be nice if it was just an option to load into on the main game instead of being a seperate game all together. Otherwise it would be nice if you could just download it and play on your own instead of being forced to own this seperate game by buying Half-Life 2. Just rather pointless. I don’t feel like the HDR is so amazing that this is worth playing. \n","timestamp_created":1402540644,"timestamp_updated":1623817284,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503840267658233643","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10433291","author":{"steamid":"76561198119130644","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":34,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24,"last_played":1390348239},"language":"english","review":"half life 2's  long lost brother???? after all it lost its meaning to play it and enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1402529645,"timestamp_updated":1402529645,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460448652505874634","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10425168","author":{"steamid":"76561198035223774","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1431223143},"language":"english","review":"After having played this 5 minute demo for a total of 8 hours, I, a dead beat do approve.","timestamp_created":1402472993,"timestamp_updated":1402472993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10410568","author":{"steamid":"76561198059968702","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":27,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1562537903},"language":"italian","review":"a","timestamp_created":1402346154,"timestamp_updated":1402346154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10399278","author":{"steamid":"76561197984905903","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":26,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26,"last_played":1325577600},"language":"english","review":"a cool tech demo tho worthless in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1402261321,"timestamp_updated":1402261321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10398116","author":{"steamid":"76561198057344530","num_games_owned":575,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":67,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1463253497},"language":"english","review":"DONT BUY THIS GAME! no its not bad its a tech demo and its hella expinsive BUT its in a bundle with half life 2 so buy that game instead and you will also recive thisone and btw 40$ for a tech demo?
