The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off. This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for the entire length of the show. Reruns of the series have not been produced on Disney Channel, or on Disney XD; however they continue to air on the Family channel in Canada. Raven-Symoné guest-starred, reprising her role as Raven Baxter in one episode. In 2014 Disney Channel started airing a weekly block called Disney Replay on Wednesdays nights, during which episodes of Cory in the House air alongside That's So Raven and Kim Possible, among others.","timestamp_created":1469143143,"timestamp_updated":1469143143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518209397792816162","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24444166","author":{"steamid":"76561198135611438","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":141068,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1048,"playtime_at_review":5968,"last_played":1660521618},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito

esse jogo de vez em quando há mais de dez anos! Sempre gostei, é bem divertido e dinâmico. As fases são baseadas em filmes de ação bem conhecidos. Primeira missão (Recoil) vem do filme Falcão Negro em Perigo (2001), a segunda (Lost Cause) é baseada no filme do Chuck Norris - Missing in Action (1984), a quarta missão (Building Recon) se parece um tanto com Goldeneye (1995), a quinta (Drug Lab) se parece com o filme Efeito Colateral (2002) do Arnold Schwarzenegger. A missão Thin Ice é uma mistura do filme Velocidade Máxima 2 (1997) com K-19 (2002) e Caçada ao Outubro Vermelho (1991). A missão Turn of the Crank contém referências à Scarface. A última missão (Rise Hard) é uma referência clara a Duro de Matar (1988).\n\nPra quem gosta de filmes de ação, tá aí um bom jogo.","timestamp_created":1468902733,"timestamp_updated":1468902733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24401533","author":{"steamid":"76561198248280790","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1468636429},"language":"schinese","review":"cs剧情版","timestamp_created":1468900632,"timestamp_updated":1468900632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24396243","author":{"steamid":"76561198060014793","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1451590541},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom jogo","timestamp_created":1468873642,"timestamp_updated":1468873642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24394633","author":{"steamid":"76561197978902089","num_games_owned":8067,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":266,"last_played":1569790507},"language":"english","review":"Brilliant singleplayer version of Counter-Strike if you're the kind of person that enjoys missions from back in the day where you didn't have to 'pay to win' (or look cool) and receive just the satisfaction of beating a game rather than selling a 5 cent case you earned thinking it was actually worth your time.\n\nOne niggle I have however is that the bots are pretty useless half the time, especially as the game pretty much depends on them entirely unless you're an expert player that can win 1v6 almost every round.","timestamp_created":1468867624,"timestamp_updated":1468934969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528210461139678955","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24392442","author":{"steamid":"76561198209310039","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2729,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2564,"last_played":1503530870},"language":"spanish","review":"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero\n\n\nAcerca del juego:\n\nEsta versión de Counter-Strike trae una extensa campaña Tour of Duty, un número casi ilimitado de escaramuzas, actualizaciones y nuevos contenidos para la modalidad multijugador, que ya ha recibido varios premios. Además, disfrutarás de más de 12 misiones para un solo jugador de regalo. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero es toda una gozada tanto si juegas solo como si juegas con tus colegas.\n\nLa historia del lanzamiento de Counter Strike Condition Zero (A partir de ahora CZ) ha sido lo más parecido a un culebrón. Un juego que en estas líneas avanzábamos hace ya casi dos años, y que en un principio desarrollaba la compañía GearBox al fin ve la luz en nuestro país pero desarrollado por Turtle Rock. Para muchos la espera ha sido demasiada larga, y quizás para la mayoría ha llegado tarde, muy tarde.\n\nCounter-Strike: Condition Zero Counter Strike es un mito en el mundo de los videojuegos, cualquier aficionado al menos lo ha visto funcionando y muchos al menos lo han probado. Este Mod del Half Life ideado por aficionados ha llegado a ser el juego más jugado de Internet durante largos años. No había cibercafé sin que Counter Strike se encontrarse instalado en sus equipos, ni portal de juegos que no albergara servidores destinados para este juego online.\nValve al ver la popularidad que rodeaba a este Mod fue apoyando paulatinamente cada vez más al equipo que lo ideo a sacar nuevas versiones, ya que indirectamente al necesitar una copia Half Life instalada en el PC para hacerlo funcionar, conseguían que este otro mítico FPS siguiera vendiendo más y más.\n\n\nCounter-Strike: Condition Zero Finalmente Valve decidió realizar una versión comercial completa actualizándolo y convirtiéndolo en un juego autosuficiente, pero aquí es donde comenzó el principio del fin. El título que en un principio se iba a encargar Rogue Entertainment dejó el proyecto tras desarrollar un prototipo que no convenció a Valve. En agosto del 2001 esta patata caliente' llegó a las manos de Gearbox Software, un estudio estrechamente relacionado con Valve pero que finalmente en Julio del 2002 abandonó el proyecto.\n\n\nCounter-Strike: Condition Zero A finales del año 2002 cuando CZ parecía estancado, Ritual Entertainment se hace cargo de él, finalmente parecía que finalmente alguien se iba a encargar de acabarlo y presentarlo al público. Pero como una historia que no parece tener fin, el juego se retrasaba más y la gente empieza a preguntarse cuando aparecera este Mod reformado del Half Life.\n\nRequisitos del sistema:\n\nMínimo: procesador de 500 MHz, 96 MB de RAM, tarjeta de vídeo de 16 MB, Windows XP, ratón, teclado y conexión a Internet.\n\nRecomendado:\n\nprocesador de 800 MHz, 128 MB de RAM, tarjeta de vídeo de 32 MB, Windows XP, ratón, teclado y conexión a Internet\nDisponible como descarga digital en:\n\nFicha técnica:\n\nGeneros: Acción\nDesarrollador: Valve\nDistribuidor: Valve\nJuego on-line: Multi\nTraducido: Si\nFecha de lanzamiento: 01/03/2004","timestamp_created":1468859209,"timestamp_updated":1468859320,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24389028","author":{"steamid":"76561197995823838","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":583,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":530,"last_played":1551673387},"language":"english","review":"MY childhood, wish they have a new condition zero coming out so I could throw my money in","timestamp_created":1468844758,"timestamp_updated":1468844758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24376552","author":{"steamid":"76561198079291984","num_games_owned":370,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":74,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":74,"last_played":1468781528},"language":"english","review":"Very nice and challenging game. \nHas an okay story line.\nI espacially like the \"Sneaky-Beaky\" parts of the game.\nWould buy again.. if I didn't own it already..

It had a surprisingly troubled development and changed hands between 4 distinctive developers before finally becoming finished. \n\nThe game was originally designed by Rogue, the developers behind Strife and American McGee's Alice. However the developer went out of buisiness so Valve instead gave it to Gearbox, who Valve had previously worked with on Opposing Force and Blue Shift. Much of the game is based around Gearbox's version, which focused on creating more impressive graphics and remaking many of the classic Counter Strike maps in better detail.\n\nHowever, the project changed hands again and the game was handed off to Ritual entertainment. The guys behind SiN. They remade the game as a pseudo singleplayer title before Valve decided to hand the game off to Turtlerock studios. Who would years later create Left 4 Dead. Who finished the game and completed it based on Gearbox's version. The content Ritual made would be released as the \"Deleted scenes\".\n\nThe final game is very much inspired by Counter Strike 1.6. It plays very similarly albiet with nicer graphics and a very different art style. It was also the very first Counter Strike game to ship with bots by default. The game also contains a singleplayer separate from the Deleted Scenes, however this is just an Unreal Tournament style ladder featuring botmatches. \n\nWhen Condition Zero came out, it was seen as outdated. It released two years too late, and the very same year as Valve's own Counter Strike Source. As a result it isn't often talked about when compared to the other games. Since you do get it by default when buying 1.6 it's interesting to play for curiosity's sake, but you'll likely find more players for 1.6 or Source.","timestamp_created":1468381149,"timestamp_updated":1468381149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547190725803375244","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24283828","author":{"steamid":"76561198032206976","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":59,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1518956414},"language":"english","review":"Good.","timestamp_created":1468361720,"timestamp_updated":1468361720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24283251","author":{"steamid":"76561198150847428","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":145,"last_played":1659728181},"language":"polish","review":"Jeżeli nie ma się dostępu do Internetu to można zagrać w tego fps'a.

Juegos como estos merecen un buen Remake. (me refiero al Deleted Scenes)\n\nEn lo que es la historia, cuenta como los grupos anti terroristas del mundo batallan contra las fuerzas terroritas que pretenden causar caos a nivel mundial (algo que vivimos hoy en dia lamentblemente) y eso le añade su toque de realismo a la actualidad.\n\nOjala añadieran un modo historia al CSGO. seria emocionante.\n\nEn musica, bueno es buena y combina con el juego.\n\nEl Deleted Scenes dura unas buenas 8 horas de juego, es largo y extenso con la mecanica del orignal juego.\n\nMi puntuacion para este CS es 7/10\n\nPEEEEEEEEEEERO! el Deleted Scenes es el que se lleva la corona y le doy un 8.5/10\n\npor entretenerme mucho y no aburrirme.\n\npara mi vale la pena comprarlo y valio cada centabo que gaste en el.\n\nlo recomiendo para aquellos que tengan una PC con bajo soporte grafico. (como yo actualmente)\n\nPero todo muy bien (juegenlo en OpenGL, en Software note unos bugs que no son muy graves y que no son tan imortantes de corregir).","timestamp_created":1467702764,"timestamp_updated":1467702764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24090520","author":{"steamid":"76561198281554544","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":116,"last_played":1473243014},"language":"turkish","review":"That game is rlly good i liked it\n","timestamp_created":1467660575,"timestamp_updated":1467660575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24089315","author":{"steamid":"76561198109870136","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":139,"playtime_forever":1274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":160,"last_played":1653052104},"language":"bulgarian","review":"nice game","timestamp_created":1467658027,"timestamp_updated":1467658027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24082177","author":{"steamid":"76561198000404692","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":146867,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":145010,"last_played":1590100899},"language":"english","review":"Greatest version of CS.
