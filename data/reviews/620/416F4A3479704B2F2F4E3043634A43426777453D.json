So, during the summer sale I bought the bundle of both games and I played the first one. AMAZING. Then, I played the second one.\nThis is what this review is about.\n\nPortal 2:\nA game full of puzzles. With a full co-op mode and story mode, there is a lot to do.\nBut the puzzles... they are not puzzles like any others...\nThey are like a puzzle but with that twist you can't stand.\nAt first I thought Portal was a game for incredibly smart people.\nI then played both games and realized it was for all players!\n\nStory:\nI will be completely honest with you right now. I do play a lot of sandbox games and some story games, but this is by far the BEST STORY I HAVE EVER SEEN. Amazing.\n\nGameplay:\nGameplay is perfect. Nothing wrong with it. Also nothing else to say.\n\nExtras about this game:\n\n- Puzzles for all ages but are still very challenging for everyone\n- If you get stuck on a puzzle, quit the game and refresh your mind. It will help a ton.\n- no lag on the highest settings (on a laptop)\n- Remember to bring the resolution up!\n- PLAY PORTAL ONE FIRST, or else this will make no sense to you.\n\nThis game is one thing: A must-have for ANY GAMER!","timestamp_created":1503356689,"timestamp_updated":1618025546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34404003","author":{"steamid":"76561198083514930","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1416,"last_played":1630785119},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor jogo da história!","timestamp_created":1503354484,"timestamp_updated":1503354484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34402637","author":{"steamid":"76561198387819272","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":250,"last_played":1648314043},"language":"italian","review":"Assolutamente sì.","timestamp_created":1503349078,"timestamp_updated":1503349078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34401567","author":{"steamid":"76561198074383768","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1497786399},"language":"russian","review":"Меня стошнило раз 5.","timestamp_created":1503344968,"timestamp_updated":1503344968,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.424141556024551392","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34401481","author":{"steamid":"76561198137383735","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1227,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":695,"last_played":1583498335},"language":"english","review":"Best puzzle/platform game on Steam.

You have been in suspension for -FIFTY- days. In compliance with state and federal regulations, all testing candidates in the Aperture Science Extended Relaxation Center must be revived periodically for a mandatory physical and mental wellness exercise.\n\n==========================================================================\nR A T I N G\n==========================================================================\n\n---{Graphics}--- : The atmosphere really makes you feel like a lab rat. A great improvement compared to Portal, with more varied environments. And for good measure! Decent graphics that make you enjoy the storyline even better! 9/10\n\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}--- : Fun gameplay, fairly easy at the beginning and quickly becomes nightmarishly complicated. The co-op gameplay is also tricky to grasp but adds hours of fun! Be sure to analyse the environment to avoid spending hours locked in the same test chamber. 10/10\n\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It‘s just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Starring at walls is better\n☐ Just don‘t\n\n---{Audio}--- : Very good soundtrack that gives a dark atmosphere to the game. Sounds are well crafted, don't forget to put it in 5.1 (or at least stereo) to help you during the game. GlaDOS's song at the credit is my personal favourite. And Wheatley definitely brings a good dose of humour in this crazy game! 9/10\n\n☐ Eargasm\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- : Although the levels do not require high-end graphics, it is much more enjoyable to play such a game on a fast PC to really get into the game. If you want to play without high end graphics, a decent PC should do the trick. 9/10\n\n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☑ Fast\n☐ Rich boiiiiii\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulty}--- : Very fun and easy to grasp at the start. But beware: as you advance in the came, the levels become exceedingly difficult. Don't overestimate potatOS. Beware, keep your friends close but your enemies closer. 10/10\n\n☐ Just press ‚A‘\n☐ Easy\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Difficult\n\n---{Grind}--- : The game takes many hours to master and understand the dynamic. Can make you start over several times to achieve your goal. Patience is your friend. The cake is a lie. The companion cube your best friend. PotatOS is not food. 8/10\n\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☑ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You‘ll need a second live for grinding\n☐ Minecraft\n\n---{Story}--- : One of the best scenarios for such a game! It will mind♥♥♥♥ you as you try to escape Wheatley and the Aperture Science complex as you walk around with a potato on your gun! 10/10\n☐ Story?\n☐ Text or Audio floating around\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☑ Lovely\n☐ It‘ll replace your life\n\n---{Game Time}--- : Will last you around 10ish hours for sure to complete the game. Can take you longer if you have a tough time figuring out how to escape from certain test chambers. Some levels might take you 5 hours to figure out : one advice is sleep on it, next morning you'll get it over in less than 30 seconds. If you want a new dose of challenge, give in to the co-op game! 8/10\n\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☑ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}--- : Really worth the price for such an epic game! 10/10\n\n☐ It’s free!\n☑ Worth the price\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{Bugs}--- : A couple of minor glitches but very few bugs to speak of. 9/10\n\n☑ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{Overall}--- : A classic, epic puzzle game with a FPS style, an intriguing story and complex gameplay that will require you to master guns, skills and environment. A necessity. A must have. For those that completed Portal, Portal 2 is a sweet sweet throwback into Aperture Science complex with new types of challenges that are totally dope! A game to be cherished! 9/10\n\n☑ Competes with the classics\n☐ Impressive but has something missing\n☐ Fun to play, easy to forget\n☐ Playable because you are bored\n☐ A decapitation or ♥♥♥♥ is more fun\n\n==========================================================================\nO P I N I O N\n==========================================================================\n\nAs for Portal, Portal 2 has a simple goal mixed with an intense script, mind twisting puzzles and spooky environment. A must have and must play. Remember that if you are stuck on a level for more than 3 hours, a good night sleep will help you figure out the trick to get you out of Wheatley's insane grip! Don't forget to keep potato GlaDOS alive ! And remember: this game is meant to fuck with your brain. One of the best games to feel like your intellect has to work overtime.
