Each playthrough reveals something new, with just about every second still feeling enchanting regardless of how many times I stroll through it. It's almost a shame there are a few things holding it back from replacing Bioshock (2007) as my favorite game of all time.   \n\nHere are the Nifty things I liked, and the Lame things I didn't.\n\n[h1]The Nifty[/h1]\n✪ I always have, and still very much do love the way this game tackles story-telling. In a sense, it brings back a lot of what made the original Bioshock's story so fantastic, then cranks it up to 11 in every area besides the pseudo first-person narrative. By that, I mean even though you're playing as a character with an established name and purpose, the original Bioshock's lack of making that identity clear made it feel like a more personal experience.\n\n✪ In addition to that, this game does a fantastic job setting itself up for multiple runs. A lot of heavily story-driven games feel boring when I go back to play them again. However, with Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite, I'm always noticing something I missed in prior runs, learning new stuff and experiencing the game in a different way than I did before.\n\n✪ The music is top notch. Almost every licensed song you hear either elaborates upon the situation you're currently experiencing, or provides a bit of foreshadowing that you might not notice until one of your next playthroughs. \n\n✪  While on the subject of music, Frédéric Chopin's \"Nocturne in E-Flat Major, Op. 9, No. 2\" can be heard in several parts of the game. I'll always be dishing out bonus points for that one.\n\n✪ Bioshock Infinite's combat may not be as extensive as the last two games, but it's still immensely satisfying and brings back good ideas from each; mostly Bioshock 2. Much like the aforementioned game, we're able to use [strike]plasmids[/strike] vigors at the same time as our firearms. We're also able to utilize two different versions of each, and combine vigors for more effective combat techniques.\n\n✪ Though it's a DLC that must be purchased separately unless you bought the collection, Burial at Sea is a must play. Its setting, pace and gameplay mechanics are all fantastic, with a necessary expansion on not just Infinite's story, but also the original Bioshock's.  \n\n[h1]The Lame[/h1]\n✘ Getting this game to run well, despite having a pretty solid rig that should easily handle it on the highest settings, was a tad irritating. In order to access ideal settings, I had to follow [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=203916658] this guide[/url], then spend almost an hour tweaking my mouse's sensitivity settings in not just the game, but the device's control center (iCUE, for the sake of referencing). \n\nWithout doing all of this, even the slightest movements from my mouse caused a stuttering effect on my screen, the interface was far too small for me to see most of the time and my FOV, which I usually prefer being high as possible, only would have increased 15%. Sure, that last one is just me being picky, but the rest still stands. It was borderline unplayable without making a lot of adjustments.\n\n✘ You get plasmids in the form of vigors, run around a city that can only exist in fiction and are met with plot devices that scream \"BIOSHOCK\", but this, especially compared to the other entries in the franchise, is not a Bioshock game. There is so much missing from the original formula that it almost entirely feels like a canonical spin-off rather than the prequel/sequel this game strives to be, and for those wondering why people dislike Bioshock Infinite so much; that's it, most of the time. \n\nI could go into more elaborate detail explaining the dozens of things that made Bioshock 1 and 2 greater from a gameplay perspective. but instead, I'll simply say this; Bioshock Infinite is a game that is blatantly tailored toward telling an immersive story, which was designed to be enjoyable multiple times over, than being an immersive game.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nEven if it's not quite the Bioshock game many expected, including myself, Bioshock Infinite is still a near-perfect experience. All you have to do is stop comparing it to what you knew and accept it for what it is rather than what it was expected to be. It might not be my favorite game of all time like the original was, but it tells my absolute favorite story; especially when you toss Burial at Sea into the mix.","timestamp_created":1584659619,"timestamp_updated":1584659656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481481492519378662","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65357837","author":{"steamid":"76561198845468677","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":709,"last_played":1584698371},"language":"schinese","review":"好","timestamp_created":1584657977,"timestamp_updated":1584657977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65355385","author":{"steamid":"76561199016747895","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1608319497},"language":"english","review":"nice and easy, reminds me of of those wolfenstein games with crazy nazi germans, but here you have crazy other guys =) good game =)","timestamp_created":1584654704,"timestamp_updated":1584654704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65353966","author":{"steamid":"76561199012876437","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1584923620},"language":"turkish","review":"Oynadığınız tüm oyunların finalini unutun ama gerçekten unutun...","timestamp_created":1584652823,"timestamp_updated":1584652823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.615051329135894775","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65351835","author":{"steamid":"76561198117738630","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1267,"last_played":1654432574},"language":"english","review":"great story\ngreat FPS\ngreat sets\ncreative\n\nI don't write reviews much.
