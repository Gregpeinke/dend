Life 2 is not a game, it's a adventure across first-person action,physics puzzles, and a major success for it's time.It's still fun to play because of the great graphics,good A.I(even though it's annoying sometimes),the physics system that allows you to throw random stuff at enemies,and of course good ol' Freeman with his crowbar.The game kinda lacks a storyline, but along the way you'll get to understand the plot and what you're supposed to do.The first game was 2 steps into the franchise,while the second one is 3 steps ahead.The combat is brilliant,The graphics are good,and the characters are somewhat likeable i guess (it could depend though i still think it's good) and just messing around with the Console:).I played the game originally on the Xbox,then pc but i suggest pc

storia con misteri, come il personaggio G-Man, per non parlare dei mostri veramente belli e le locations anche, la trama poi è spettacolare che lascia sempre qualcosa nel cuore veramente, non vedo l'ora di giocare al 3° capitolo della saga ossia Half-Life 3. \nLa grafica poi l'amo veramente, anche se è molto vecchia è sempre bella da vedere, l'unica pecca del gioco è il doppiaggio italiano veramente fatto malissimo, consiglio di giocarlo inglese con sottotitoli italiani.\nE vi parlerà anche dei DLC di Half-Life 2, come al solito sono spettacolari e spiega l'eventi subito dopo la fine di

Half-Life 3.\nThe graphics then I really love, although it is very old it is always nice to see, the only flaw of the game is the Italian dubbing really done badly, I suggest you to play English with Italian subtitles.\nIt also tells you about the DLC Half-Life 2, as usual, are spectacular and explains the events immediately after the end of Half Life 2, and the story is told perfectly well.\nI

An excellent First Person Shooter (FPS) that's what you can hear about this game BUT is it really this good?\nSo I tried it myself and I can absolutely say: YES, IT IS\nEven without cutscenes or big dialoges it has a story. \nThe game starts during your arrive in \"City 17\" after a short appearance of G-man. It continues with meeting some old characters like Barney Calhoun from Black Mesa. \nYou're fleeing more or less the whole game from combines, striders, headcrab zombies or more mutants.\n\nThe best of Half Life 2 is, I think, that you have to search often the way, discover the levels or find secret places. It's very much fun and it never gets boring. \nThe big battles with a rocket launcher or with the machine gun against soldiers are impressive and you can easily forget time in the heat of battle.\nSome levels are pretty creepy... for example when you're searching your way through darkness and you hear zombies groaning or you see the figure of G-Man watching you and disappearing.\n\nIt's so AWESOME to play it, so it's very hard to describe...There's so much to see, play, fight... \nIf you didn't played it yet, just go ahead and play it!!!\n","timestamp_created":1415555266,"timestamp_updated":1415555266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12862804","author":{"steamid":"76561198065738408","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":856,"last_played":1415564562},"language":"turkish","review":"Tek kelime ile muhteşem.
