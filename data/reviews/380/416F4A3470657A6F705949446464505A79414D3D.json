Everything good about Half Life 2 (pretty much everything)\n- The City 17 wreckage offers some great new levels to play through, and offers a lot of variety for the length of this DLC.\n- Valve were able to balance moods well, from more lighthearted moments with Alyx to more tense (even horror to an extent) sections with darker lighting.\n- Great variety of activities (puzzles, combat, escorting NPCs, story moments).\n- Once again, it's Half-Life 2.\n\nCons: - It is somewhat short.\n- Nothing really happens in the story (but you can tell it is building up to something).\n- A bit linear and repetitive, and a few missed opportunities (bug bait... ).\n\nIf you like Half-Life 2, this is more of that in the best way possible.\n\n8.5/10","timestamp_created":1659818481,"timestamp_updated":1659818650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120181685","author":{"steamid":"76561198850764527","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":771,"last_played":1631317814},"language":"spanish","review":"Linkin Park Lore:","timestamp_created":1659818302,"timestamp_updated":1659818302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120168900","author":{"steamid":"76561198823564803","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":382,"playtime_at_review":332,"last_played":1660158542},"language":"english","review":"gBUY THE GAME ALREADY","timestamp_created":1659800126,"timestamp_updated":1659800126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120167905","author":{"steamid":"76561198062394898","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":179,"playtime_at_review":246,"last_played":1659797204},"language":"english","review":"a tad short","timestamp_created":1659798956,"timestamp_updated":1659798956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120167049","author":{"steamid":"76561199021716425","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":144,"playtime_at_review":699,"last_played":1660227454},"language":"koreana","review":"ÍµøÍµø","timestamp_created":1659797953,"timestamp_updated":1659797953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120159620","author":{"steamid":"76561198387230868","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":308,"playtime_last_two_weeks":108,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1659775157},"language":"english","review":"Fun.","timestamp_created":1659788019,"timestamp_updated":1659788019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120157876","author":{"steamid":"76561198189773925","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":101,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1659797670},"language":"english","review":"The combine after housing their entire government and military production inside an active nuclear reactor.","timestamp_created":1659785378,"timestamp_updated":1659785378,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507042229175567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120155033","author":{"steamid":"76561198132995625","num_games_owned":1008,"num_reviews":481,"playtime_forever":29,"playtime_last_two_weeks":29,"playtime_at_review":29,"last_played":1659654159},"language":"german","review":"[h1] Half-Life 2: Episode One [/h1]\n1/5 first person shooter from 2006.\n\nEpisode One is the first episode in a game series that unveils what happened after Half-Life 2 and takes you on a new journey beyond the confines of City 17.\nThe first in a planned trilogy of shorter episodic games that continue the Half-Life 2 story. Episode One is a standalone expansion, meaning Half-Life 2 is not required to play. \nThe trilogy only became two official standalone expansions, the third is not available on Steam. At my count above there is a short intro and two fan projects\ncontain.\nIf you're good at shooting your way through, you'll need about three and a half hours. I played the game all the way to the train station, about three hours, then it became too shooter-heavy for me.\n\nThis part starts seamlessly with HL2. I was busy climbing the eternally high tower to the top. Now that you are so close to heaven you have to go back down and to the train station to escape. Surprisingly, you encounter resistance. Someone probably doesn't want her to escape.\n\nGreat graphics at the time and still great today.\nI personally like the game very much. It's tricky and on level normal you also have some difficult passages.\nI currently accompanied HundelungeVR leif to the end. He is a shooter gamer and only occasionally had a problem progressing. Below is a link to YT where you can watch the game.\nSuitable and recommended for trigger-happy gamers.\n\nHere you get the full Half Life program. Various HL games are already online and there are more to come.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2zGfp1auA43vXUG266M1Hg\n\nMy group and my archive with over 5,300 reviews here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/hoi4deu\n\nüëë Powered by HoI 4 Deu Curators group in German / English üëë‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä[list][*][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30388691/] Follow Main group [/url][*] [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40282064/] Follow Second group [/url][/list]\nand discover more reviews from me\n\n\n\n\n[h1] Half-Life 2: Episode One [/h1]\n1/5 Egoshooter von 2006.\n\nEpisode One ist die erste Episode einer Spieleserie, die enth√ºllt, was nach Half-Life 2 geschah, und Sie auf eine neue Reise √ºber die Grenzen von City 17 hinaus schickt.\nDer erste Teil in einer geplanten Trilogie k√ºrzerer episodischer Spiele, die die Geschichte von Half-Life 2 fortsetzen. Episode One ist eine Standalone-Erweiterung, was bedeutet, dass Half-Life 2 zum Spielen nicht ben√∂tigt wird. Aus der Trilogie wurden nur zwei offizielle eigenst√§ndige Erweiterungen, die dritte gibt es nicht auf Steam. Bei meiner obrigen Z√§hlung sind noch ein kurzes Intro und zwei Fanprojekte enthalten.\nWenn ihr euch gut durchschie√üen tut braucht ihr etwa  dreieinhalb Stunden. Ich habe das Game damals bis zum Bahnhof gespielt also etwa drei Stunden, dann wurde es mir zu Shooterlastig.\n\nDieser Teil setzt fugenlos bei HL2 an. Ihr wart ja damit besch√§ftigt den ewig hohen Turm bis oben zu erklimmen. Jetzt da ihr dem Himmel so nah seit m√ºsst ihr wieder runter und auch noch zum Bahnhof um zu fl√ºchten. Erstaunlicher Weise st√∂√üt ihr auf Widerstand. Irgendwer will wohl nicht das ihr entkommt.\n\nSeinerzeit eine grandiose Grafik und auch heute noch sehr gut.\nMir pers√∂nlich gef√§llt das Game sehr gut. Es ist knifflig und auf Stufe normal habt ihr auch einige schwierige Passagen.\nIch habe aktuell HundelungeVR life begleitet bis zum Schluss. Er ist Shootergamer und hatte nur gelegentlich mal ein Problem weiter zu kommen. Unten findet ihr ein Link zu YT, dort k√∂nnt ihr euch das Game anschauen.\nGeeignet und empfohlen f√ºr schie√üw√ºtige Gamer. \n\nHier bekommt ihr das volle Half Life Programm. Diverse HL Spiele sind schon Online und es kommen noch welche hinzu. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2zGfp1auA43vXUG266M1Hg\n\nMeine Gruppe und mein Archiv mit √ºber 5.300 Reviews hier:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/hoi4deu \n\nüëë Powered by HoI 4 Deu Curators group in German / English üëë‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä[list][*][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30388691/] Follow Main group [/url][*][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40282064/]  Follow Second group [/url][/list]\nand discover more reviews from me","timestamp_created":1659780678,"timestamp_updated":1660305339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.805713236331939697","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120154227","author":{"steamid":"76561198148109009","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":197,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1659778763},"language":"russian","review":"–•–æ—Ä–æ—à–µ–µ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ–π –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏. –ö–∞–∫ —Å–∞–º–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—É—é –∏–≥—Ä—É —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å –Ω–µ —Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç (–ø—Ä–æ—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è –∑–∞ 3.5 —á–∞—Å–∞). –ì–µ–π–º–¥–∏–∑–∞–π–Ω –Ω–∞ –≤—ã—Å–æ—Ç–µ, –ø–æ—á—Ç–∏ –≤—Å–µ –º–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –æ—Ä–∏–≥–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –∏–≥—Ä—ã —Å–º–æ–≥–ª–∏ —É–º–µ—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å –≤ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ (–∫—Ä–æ–º–µ —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –Ω–µ —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å —Ñ—É—Ä–≥–æ–Ω –≤ —Å–∞–º–æ–º –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–º –Ω–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—à—å).\n–¶–∏—Ç–∞–¥–µ–ª—å –≤ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ - –≤–µ—Å–µ–ª—å–µ —Å –∑–∞—Ä—è–∂–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –≥—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ø—É—à–∫–æ–π –∫–∞–∫ –∏ –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–µ–π –≥–ª–∞–≤–µ –æ—Ä–∏–≥–∏–Ω–∞–ª–∞.\n–ì–ª–∞–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–æ –ø–æ–¥–∑–µ–º–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞—Ä–∫–∏–Ω–≥ - –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏–¥–µ–π –†–µ–π–≤–µ–Ω—Ö–æ–ª—å–º–∞ —Å –Ω–æ–≤—ã–º–∏ –º–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–∫–∞–º–∏ –∏ —Ç–∞–∫–æ–π –∂–µ –∞—Ç–º–æ—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–æ–π –¥–µ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏—Ç–∞ –∞–º—É–Ω–∏—Ü–∏–∏, –≥–∞—Å–Ω—É—â–µ–≥–æ —Ñ–æ–Ω–∞—Ä–∏–∫–∞ –≤ –ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–π—à–µ–π —Ç—å–º–µ –∏ –æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π –∏–∑-–∑–∞ –∫–∞–∂–¥–æ–≥–æ —É–≥–ª–∞.\n–ë–æ–∏ –≤ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–µ - —Ä–µ–º–µ–π–∫ –≥–ª–∞–≤—ã \"–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –Ω–∞—Ä—É—à–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å\" —Å —Ç–∞–∫–∏–º–∏ –∂–µ –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏—á–Ω—ã–º–∏ —É–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–º–∏ –±–æ—è–º–∏.\n10 –∑–æ–º–±–∞–π–Ω–æ–≤ –∏–∑ 10.","timestamp_created":1659779301,"timestamp_updated":1659779301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120147530","author":{"steamid":"76561198161293371","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":35,"playtime_at_review":560,"last_played":1659598520},"language":"english","review":"A great continuation to Half-Life 2","timestamp_created":1659767296,"timestamp_updated":1659767296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507042229175567627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120147071","author":{"steamid":"76561199017287422","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":354,"last_played":1625901177},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2: Episode one thing I don‚Äôt know why it doesn‚Äôt even matter how hard you try keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain in due time.

Possible  Purchaser, I'm here to convince you to purchase this game.  First of all, this game is a very short game that lasts maybe a 1 hour and 30 minutes minimum, even though it is short it is fun and makes you crave for more..  Good story telling, great action and puzzles, this game has a lot of fun packed inside a small package. Now onto the why you shouldnt buy it.
