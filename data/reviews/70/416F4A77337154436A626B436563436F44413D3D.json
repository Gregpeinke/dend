I bought Half-Life.  Half-Life was not my introduction to PC gaming, nor was it my introduction to Steam.  I have Far Cry to thank for the former, and Portal to thank for the latter.  Half-Life, however, opened my eyes to PC gaming at large, and allowed VALVe themselves to forever capture my soul... which, of course, makes recent events all the more painful.  \n\nI've been lucky enough to have joined the party late, because by the time I'd got there the host left the building promising to bring back more booze, except he was never seen again and we're all still stuck in his apartment waiting for him to come back.  [strike]If you're astute, you'll be able to catch onto the metaphor immediately.[/strike]  Yet despite all this, every single one of us, myself included, are in the same boat and we all share the same pain.\n\nThere's nothing I can say about Half-Life that doesn't make my words sound either redundant or unoriginal, yet I am willing to set forth my two-cents in the spirit of remembering an incredible series of video games, and how it will always remain in our hearts and minds for decades to come, even if the same can't be said for the party responsible for said series.\n\nDespite being almost 20 years old the visuals are, although dated, a joy to look at.  There's so much charm in its simplicity, much like the GoldSource engine itself.  The enemies are memorable; the weapons feel impactful; the sound design is spectacular; the way the story is conveyed through player action and the world around you is so immersive; puzzles, though simple, are nice ways to fill in the gaps between top-notch firefights; fucking G-Man; Xen... uh, not so much.  [spoiler]There's also the fact that Half-Life is the reason the [b]Freeman's Mind[/b] machinima exists which is what I live for at this very moment in time so, you know, there's that.[/spoiler]\n\nIf you call yourself a PC gamer yet you haven't had the opportunity to experience such an indisputable masterpiece, then I demand you sell all your Cancer-Strike skins, throw that game in the fucking trash where it belongs, use your steam wallet money to purchase Half-Life, or just go for the \"Half-Life: Complete\" bundle if you actually have any taste in video games, then play through it and/or all the other games in the series.  Then you too will join the party, much later than me; but you will have joined nonetheless.\n\nOur supply of booze has almost completely run dry upon the news of the host being run over by a car during a drunken stupor.  In fact, many attendants have left due to the belief that the booze is no longer coming and there's no point in sticking around.  This leaves two cliques left in the party; the blind hopefuls who, despite the host being very obviously dead and the bottles of beer shattered across the pavement, still believe that there's a small chance that more booze will come in time; and the ones who understand the circumstances, yet stick around in an effort to keep the spirit of the party, and the host as he once was, alive for as long as possible.  I land squarely in the latter.\n\nWhatever you may believe about the future of this series, one thing you can not dispute is that the games in the series that have had the pleasure to see the light of day have all been amazing games in their own right, and they will never abandon us.  They will always be here for us mere mortals to replay throughout the years, they will always be here for us to marvel at its storytelling, they will always be here to remind us of a VALVe that once was but ceases to be...\n\n[h1]10/10[/h1]\nCome join the party.  There's plenty of room.","timestamp_created":1355782554,"timestamp_updated":1508015523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496554464101791382","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3273623","author":{"steamid":"76561198019951009","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":69,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1558829829},"language":"brazilian","review":"TOP, recomendo a todos!!!

It’s a game that will be remembered by everyone who wears the HEV suit and one of my personal favorites. It’s a game that revolutionised the FPS genre from a texture map maze where you hunt down keys fighting hordes of enemies to a genre capable of creating fascinated worlds, interesting stories, and impressive visuals. The starting tram ride truly is iconic. No longer was the player plopped down in a level and having to shoot everything in site. It’s a introduction into the world of Half Life, Black Mesa. Fate was never on our protagonist Gordon Freeman's side that day, after arriving late for work he walks into the testing facility and begins the test. His job is simple, push this crystyl into the anti-maspectromitor after starting the rotors and that's it. However when you try and break the fabric of reality things can never go smoothly. A residence cascade occurs jumpstarting Gordons fight for survival as he tries to escape the facility. The first weapon the player receives is quite iconic. The crowbar is Freeman’s sword and the only thing preventing imminent death at the start. Half Life has a lot of weapons. From the standard pistol, shotgun, and rifle at the beginning to the more mysterious weapons of Black Mesa like the gluon gun that assist in Gordons survival in the later half of the game. The inner workings of Black Mesa start to get exposed, captured specimens from other worlds, experimental weapons, and heaps of toxic waste litter the facility all seen by Freeman on his escape. The enemies are unique. You typical zombies start the game off but unknowingly to the player they are more varied than the typical zombie. Headcrabs lay on top of the heads of these zombies and try to latch on to the player and NPC’s. Other enemies such as grunts who are strong foes capable of taking lots of damage, Vortigons which are a enslaved race that attempt to shock the player, and bullsquids you spit toxins at the player. The military appears around 1/5th of the way through but they’re not on Freeman’s side. They’re trying to erase the incident entirely including killing all the scientist, security, and even Gordon Freeman. Darker and most dangerous creatures also reside in the bowels of the Black Mesa facility serving as the boss fights of the game. The fight for survival has the player going throughout Black Mesa. Whether it be riding in a rail car in the famous on “a rail section” or one of the best levels in gaming history “Surface Tension” the experience is quite a memorable one. In the last half of the game Gorden leaves earth behind to head to the border world Zen as an attempt to try and kill the beast holding open the portal. In terms of gameplay, Half Life is nothing special. Gun play consists of just shooting the enemies. The military primarily uses hitscan weapons and grenades to jumping in and out of cover is vital to ensure one's life. Half Life can also be quite difficult at times but most of the deaths are a result of the players fault. It’s truly a landmark title in the FPS genre, though graphically it may be a little dated it’s all part of the world that even to this day provides some of the most immersive gameplay to date. It’s a wonderful mis of old school and new school FPS design and is a must play for any fan of Half Life 2 or FPS games in general. Though we may never be able to dawn the HEV suit once again we will always have this classic masterpiece of a game to come back to again and again. 9.8/10 -Infinite","timestamp_created":1346430366,"timestamp_updated":1519677631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2725039","author":{"steamid":"76561198011674652","num_games_owned":552,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2183,"last_played":1515111711},"language":"english","review":"This game is great and I would say neccesary for anyone who wants to play Half-life 2.

In fact all other first person shooters and games in general can learn from Half Life 1. The game world is extremely immersive. There are no level ends, there is no text to read, there are no scores and everyone talks to you without freezing you into a cut scene. All of this makes you feel less like you are a player playing a game, but you are indeed the hero Gordon Freeman. Characters recognize you, talk to you, and you can have them come with you or stay put. Security guards that come with you will shoot enemies (slowly).\n\nThe story is that you are silent protagonist Gordon Freeman (you'll feel like him by the end) and you work for Black Mesa, your standard super secret facility. Something goes horribly wrong and uh. The formula is very simple, but they execute it so well that other games have copied it and failed (Doom 3). Needless to say you need to fight your way out through the facility, on the desert (being chased by a helicopter), and everything else would just be a spoiler. There are no levels, no loading screens. Loading is seamless and happens during downtime.\n\nHalf Life 1 has simple controls and an optional tutorial level. There are buttons for jumping, crouching (sneaking), using your flashlight (that needs to be off to charge it), shooting, secondary shooting (for machine guns) and \"using\" things. The game is always in run mode and character speed seems to be fast. Too fast sometimes, but there is that sneak button that will slow you down.\n\nBut how is the first person shooting? There is a wide variety of guns and each has a certain joy and usefulness to them. Even the simple pistol is useful for lesser enemies 8 hours into the game. There is a shotgun, a machine gun with grenade launcher, grenades, explosives you detonate, wall sensors with explosives, a harpoon, a laser guided rocket launcher that once it launches you point your cursor and it will turn accordingly, lasers, homing missiles, head crabs and more. An amazing array that you continue to get even up to the final levels areas. To swap weapons you push 6 number keys and press some keys twice to access some weapons like the shotgun / machine gun / harpoon.\n\nYou start with a crowbar good for breaking grates, and destroying boxes. Destroying boxes is how you will find most items and ammo. Instead of just finding things scattered on the floor, on shelves or on a desk you need to bash open boxes to find the good stuff. You can also push or pull the boxes too which is nice for puzzle solving and platforming.\n\nThe enemies are just as diverse and each one requires you to think and act differently. Since I don't know the name of any enemy I'll fumble through this. The start enemies are lesser creatures that will start on the floor and jump at you. 2 shots from a pistol take them out. There are zombie-ish aliens that take a shotgun or two, but they are easy enough to avoid. Aliens that teleport in and beam electricity at you will cause you to hide, pudgy little alien crawler / hoppers will make you shoot from a distance because they will send out a small shockwave. Standard soldiers that will shoot machine guns, throw grenades and coordinate attacks against you like flanking. Ceiling huggers that are yucky red globs on the ceiling with long rope like tongues that when they catch you, you'll be pulled up and eaten... if you don't shoot them. Giant aliens with homing missiles too. There is a wide variety of enemies and bosses. I can't list them all.\n\nThe game also shines with its tricks and traps and will throw a puzzle or challenge at you to keep you thinking. But in this game it doesn't feel like a puzzle or a challenge. It seems natural. There can be a hidden turret where the fun is making your choice how to take it out... Grenade, explosive, shooting it and getting shot in the process, running by it or just not hitting the trip wire to start it in general. Wall sensor explosives, push and pull box puzzles, pushing buttons, hopping hanging boxes over a pit, conveyer belts, using a sky cannon to destroy walls, using turrets, on rails vehicles that you have a lot of control over, water puzzles, high jump pads and so on. There is a lot of variety and it's never the same thing twice.\n\nTo sum it up, this is a diverse and VERY FUN game. It has a sense of humor to it and you'll feel like you are Gordon Freeman through the game's well crafted immersion. Puzzles, shooting and challenges all melded together into one fantastic game and I can't say that too often.","timestamp_created":1344778348,"timestamp_updated":1424572017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.735683083534240723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3qTCjbkCecCoDA=="}
