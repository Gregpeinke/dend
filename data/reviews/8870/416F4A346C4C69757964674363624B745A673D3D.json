Sadly, the Big Daddy is replaced by Handyman, a boring mechanical boss that moves like a gorilla, adding nothing to the game besides annoying the player. The remaining bosses are insteresting enough tho.\n\nThe game is set in the floating city of Columbia, where a good amount of your time is looting and searching trash cans, trying to follow the classic Bioshock format. Sadly, it doesn't quite work, because Columbia IS NOT an apocalyptic city, it's modern and full of life, making no sense the need to add such mechanics to the game.\n\nAlso, where in the previous Bioshock games, the use of plasmids is pretty much necessary, or at least making the game a little easier, I can pretty much complete the entire game without using them, lacking not only an essencial part of the Bioshock formula in terms of combat, but also the need of plasmids to unlock different areas that otherwise you wouldn't have access. The only way to enter locked areas is by simply having lockpicks that Elizabeth can use in locks.\n\nOverall, Bioshock Infinite is still a great game, despite being made for casuals.\n\nNOTE: This game IS NOT a Bioshock game. The only times that the previous titles are mentioned is at the end of the game (last 15 minutes) and in the DLC's, where you play in Rapture.","timestamp_created":1479932464,"timestamp_updated":1533993810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26855624","author":{"steamid":"76561198097600934","num_games_owned":553,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1651,"last_played":1417852115},"language":"english","review":"I could have nominated this for various categories, but I went with best NPC.
