Вы – частный детектив с мрачным и кровавым прошлым Букер ДеВитт, страдающий от алкогольной зависимости и расстройств памяти. В один из дней Вы заключаете сделку, после которой вам простят все долги. «Приведи девчонку, и все долги будут прощены» - что может быть легче? Но, найдя ту самую девчонку, Ваша жизнь максимально стремительно поменяется.\n\n[b] Колумбия. [/b]\n\nЭстетичный город, отрешенный и обиженный на весь остальной мир. Во главе стоит вождь, посланец Божий - Отец Камсток. Как и в любом утопичном городе, вокруг Камстока построен культ личности, подкрепленный сильной религиозной, идеологической и расисткой наклонностями. Красивый город снаружи, но сырой и прогнивший внутри.\n\n[b] Цветовая палитра игры. [/b]\n\nИгра насыщена, красива и просто завораживающая. Встречают вас мягкие, пастельные тона, картинный, приятный глазу свет и, в целом, успокаивающая атмосфера. К середине игры цвета меняются – из пастели и мягкости в грубость и резкость. Приятные сочетания цветов меняются на, казалось бы, несовместимые пары. В финале игра подводит вас к классике: черный и белый, тёмный и светлый и никакой яркости и романтики начала, только жесткая и депрессивная правда. \n\n[b] Музыка. [/b]\n\nБуквально пару слов о музыкальной составляющей игры. Саундтрек великолепный! Максимально атмосферно, затягивающе и хорошо сделано – вот как можно описать музыку в игре. \n\n[b] Механика боя, враги. [/b]\n\nНа выбор представляется множество разного оружия, начиная от пистолетов и заканчивая гранатометами. Вы можете выбрать своих двух фаворитов и пройти с ними всю игру, прокачивая в специальных автоматах их урон, скорость перезарядки и другие параметры. А в купе с 8 энергетиками-плазмидами, которые так же можно прокачивать и комбинировать, Букер в ваших руках превращается в машину для убийств. \nС множеством оружия в игру добавляется и множество противников. Мелкие сошки, более сильные ребята и «боссы-Механики» - все они будут встречаться Вам в разном количестве на локациях. \n\n[b] Сюжет. [/b]\n\nБез спойлеров! Хорош, интересен, не понятен на первом прохождении, но чист как слеза на втором. Поговорим о Вашей прекрасной компаньонке на большую часть игры – Элизабет. Она, как и сюжет, прекрасна, интересна, влюбляет в себя каждого игрока. В начале игры она добрая, местами наивная, открытая всему миру и испускающая теплоту вокруг себя. Но по мере прохождения Элизабет меняется. Так из доброй и открытой девушки она превращается в закрытую, пропитанную всей гадостью реального мира, разбитую жертву. Но вместе с ней меняется и Букер. К финалу бросаются явные изменения характеров героев: мягкая Элизабет становится грубой, а грубый Букер становится мягким, но только к Элизабет. \n\n[b] Эпилог. [/b]\n\nBioshok Infinite одна из лучших игр ушедшего десятилетия. Непохожая  на своих предшественников, она влюбляла в себя и долго сидела в сердце у игроков. Её нужно пройти хотя бы раз, чтобы насладиться ей и после перепройти еще раз, чтобы по новой влюбиться, открыть для себя что-то новое и насладиться еще раз.

I played both Bioshock 1 and 2, before the remaster, and replayed them as remastered, and found them totally enjoyable from start to finish. This game was pretty good in the start, but then dragged into tedium. Here is why:\n\n1. Gunplay is terrible; enemies either die in 1-2 shots or eat an entire clip of ammo. You can only carry about 1-2 clips of spare ammo, and can only have two weapons equipped at any one point in time. So if you run out of ammo for both, you are going to be scrambling to find a new gun fast. \n\n2. Vigors, the new plasmids, are terrible; most of them do ineffectual damage, while eating up your salt meter very quickly, making a pure-vigor build impossible to play, unlike previous Bioshocks. Throughout the game, I used two out of 8 vigors consistently and one more rarely, but the other 5 I never used, as Salt is too precious to waste on things that do not kill enemies effectively enough compared to the ones I did use. It is also harder to acquire salts, as unlike in the previous bioshocks, you cannot carry a supply of health kits or salt kits and must scavenge for them in the environment, and they are rarely placed in the environment. It is nice that by mid-game, with Elizabeth, she'll scavenge salts for you but only during combat. \n\n3. Gameplay progression is slow and fairly meaningless. You can upgrade guns, but it costs monstrous amounts of Silver Eagles to do so with a few upgrades only requiring 300 SE but more requiring 500 to 800 SE. Then there is upgrading Vigors, with the cheapest being 800 SE and the more expensive being 1600 SE. You do earn money, but, never enough to fully upgrade stuff. You also get things that will upgrade your shield, max hp and max salt. Each one gives a pittance of an increase, and even at maxxed bonus, shield is never really reliable for protection, health is never all that high, and salts never provide enough salt for a pure vigor build.\n\n4. Lockpicking was made to seem to be something of a rarity and make you make tough decisions of which locks to pick in the beginning with Safes requiring 5 lockpicks and doors requiring 3 lockpicks. However, by mid-game, suddenly safes only require 3 lockpicks and doors require 1 lockpick and sometimes 3 lockpicks. By late game, I had max lockpicks of 30, and now safes only require 1 lockpick and doors frequently require 1 lockpick as well. Very inconsistent. And I search everywhere too... which is probably why I had so many lockpicks and nothing to spend them on. \n\n5. The new mechanic, of the skyline hook, is poorly implemented. It is very hard to control your character while on a skyline, you cannot switch to the other rail, while on the opposite parallel rail (yet enemies can do so), and enemies are dead-eye accurate when you are on the rail, so it highly discourages you from using them. On paper a great idea, in implementation, terrible. \n\nOn a more positive note:\n\nA) The game has an excellent story. One of the best in all of gaming. \n\nB) Elizabeth is a very believable, lifelike character. Even when idling she is amazing. Pity real women aren't as amazing as Elizabeth... sigh...\n\nHowever, I play Bioshock for its gunplay, its plasmid variety, and its valuable progression, and this Bioshock lacked them all. Thankfully, I got the game for all of $16 CAD, for it and it's DLC, so I got my money's worth and now I'll go try out the DLC for it as the main game is boring me to tears now.","timestamp_created":1561826872,"timestamp_updated":1561826885,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475418716669082642","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52067460","author":{"steamid":"76561198061123110","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3727,"last_played":1633203648},"language":"russian","review":"Даже спустя 6 лет, все еще в моем сердце, как одна из самых лучших игр","timestamp_created":1561826832,"timestamp_updated":1561826832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52065782","author":{"steamid":"76561198826542966","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1584364175},"language":"english","review":"this is epic the first hour you just think you need to find a girl but surprisingly when you dive more into the game you realize something wrong so recommended to people who like a good gameplay,graphics and an super epic story","timestamp_created":1561826643,"timestamp_updated":1561826643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52057284","author":{"steamid":"76561198111202215","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1036,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1019,"last_played":1611795420},"language":"spanish","review":"Una maravilla de la narrativa visual y vicio","timestamp_created":1561825674,"timestamp_updated":1561825674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52050944","author":{"steamid":"76561198152011416","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":4250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1549,"last_played":1628294122},"language":"english","review":"Art.","timestamp_created":1561824980,"timestamp_updated":1561825225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52046141","author":{"steamid":"76561198042236878","num_games_owned":617,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3196,"last_played":1650275647},"language":"english","review":"Multiple play through's under my belt and still have a blast playing this game","timestamp_created":1561824458,"timestamp_updated":1561824458,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52046128","author":{"steamid":"76561198305328321","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1796,"last_played":1548749004},"language":"schinese","review":"生化奇兵天下第一","timestamp_created":1561824456,"timestamp_updated":1561824456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52038041","author":{"steamid":"76561198035108794","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":593,"last_played":1561912252},"language":"english","review":"GG","timestamp_created":1561823580,"timestamp_updated":1561823580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52035871","author":{"steamid":"76561198431976529","num_games_owned":832,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1142,"last_played":1584143374},"language":"spanish","review":"Una obra de arte.

НО!\nЭТО НЕ БИОШОК! \nпредыдущие две части посвящены мрачному, темному подводному миру, который населяют злые и угрюмые персонажи. Создается угрюмая атмосфера практически из каждой детали. А инфинити это супер яркий, светлый мир воздушной крепости/города. Даже слишком яркий, такой яркий, что даже глаза устают смотреть.\nПоймите правильно, сюжет хорош, графика тоже, враги и их ИИ, разрывы прикольно сделали, но этот шутер не из линейки биошока. Да, как отдельный проект он катит не плохо. Для меня, как любителя 1-ой части и более-менее сносной второй части, третья часть не является продолжением двух предыдущих, не в плане сюжета, а в плате геймплея.\n\nПоэтому если Вы хотите продолжить игру в стиле двух предыдущих частей, то этого не получится. А так по скидке можно взять.","timestamp_created":1561813404,"timestamp_updated":1561813404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlqnV0esCecCRxgE="}
