Freeman participa de um experimento que dá errado, criando um efeito cascata que ocasiona a invasão de aliens no local. Assim, ele precisa entender como reverter o incidente. O jogo tem diversos tipos de armas e de inimigos que, sem querer dar muito spoiler, não se limitam a extra-terrestres. A ação é o foco, mas não quer dizer que você não terá que parar e pensar um pouco em alguns momentos para resolver situações pontuais a fim de poder progredir. Uma facilidade que o jogo tem é poder salvá-lo a qualquer momento. Hoje em dia os gráficos não são tão atrativos, mas para a época de lançamento com certeza surpreenderam. A trilha sonora é quase inexistente, servindo para marcar apenas alguns momentos. Há mais de um final possível e um deles vai desenvolver os eventos em Half-Life 2. Então, se você tem interesse em shooters clássicos, não deixe de conferir Half-Life e de entender os detalhes de sua trama.

I decided, on a whim, to play it on its hardest difficulty, and I recommend you do the same, because it's just hard enough to make you be really careful, but not so hard to bring you to throw your controller across the room.\nI'll address my thoughts on Half-Life I in the tradition of YouTube reviewer The Completionist:\n\nStory 9/10\nA la Zelda I, story takes a backseat in Half Life I, and I personally really like that.  There IS a story, but unlike in so many triple-A titles, it doesn't demand so much attention that the rest is neglected.  The story that exists can basically be summed up like this: \nYou are Gordon Freeman, a scientist with special training in the use of a power-augmenting suit, working in a top-secret facility known as Black Mesa.  After an experiment goes horribly wrong, alien creatures with no greater purpose than to kill and infect humans begin appearing around the facility, and you, as one of the only able-bodied people alive, must fight your way out of the death trap that Black Mesa has become.  But along the way, you notice a mysterious man watching your every move...\nAnd that's it.  Most of the developments throughout the game are finding out one teensy little detail about Black Mesa's past through a stray word in normal dialogue or through coming across the aforementioned mysterious figure who watches you throughout the game.\nI love it.  Having the story be so simple lets the gameplay and puzzles take a much larger role in my mind.  Instead of thinking to myself, \"I have to get past this puzzle so that I can know what happened to Jim,\" I'm thinking \"hmm...if I only have 27 health and I need to get past the lightning-throwing alien with only two bullets in my revolver, how quick will I need to fire?  And how close should I get?  Are there more enemies around him?  Maybe I could sneak past him and find a stock of ammo...\" and so on.  The game prompts the player to think so much, in part because you're playing it not for the story but for the puzzles.\nThat is, in my opinion, one of Half-Life I's strongest points.  However, I don't give it a 10/10 for story because I feel like it could be just a little bit more engaging.  If it were as engaging as Portal I in story, it would be absolutely perfect.\n\nGameplay 9.8/10\nThis game is so damn fun to play.  The controls, at least for PC, are fantastic, because you can make them be whatever the crap you want.  Because it's an FPS, you NEED to have a mouse, but what self-respecting gamer doesn't?  (Unless you like to make games harder by playing them without a mouse on purpose, in which case, props to you.)  Like I said in the \"Story\" section, gameplay takes an incredibly important role in this game, and was absolutely perfected.\nOne of the reasons for this is that the gameplay is so simple.  You can jump, you can shoot/use various weapons, you can crouch, and you can use a flashlight.  That's it.  No silly quick-time events, no complicated set of moves, no vast arrays of powers, just jumping, weapons, crouching, and flashlight.\nWhat gives the game depth from here is the plethora of different weapons you can get.  No weapon is similar in more than one way, and every one has different strengths and weaknesses.  Basically, no one weapon is \"the best\"; even the strongest weapon in the game, the lazer gun, is balanced out because you can have an absolute maximum of 60 shots, and because it fires so rapidly, it's easy to use more ammo than you needed to.  My favorite weapon by far is the revolver, because it has a nice sound, it reloads fast, and it does great damage.  It's big drawbacks, however, are that ammo for it is very scarce, and so must be well-conserved, and it has pretty slow firing time.  And all weapons are like that: the crowbar is the weakest weapon, and must be used up close, but it uses no ammo and so has no reload time; the machine gun has the fastest firing and reload times, and can double as a grenade launcher if you have ammo for it, but really low damage and is hard to aim; the rocket launcher deals enormous damage, but can easily kill you, has terrible reload and firing time, ammo is scarce, and the shots automatically will fly around and hit nothing if you don't get reasonably close to your enemy; and the list goes on and on.\nSomehow, Half Life I gives you a wide array of interesting and equally useful weapons to use in the different situations it puts you in.  Every weapon has strengths and weaknesses, every one is useful in different situations, and any could end up your favorite without that impacting your enjoyment of the game.\nThe only reason I don't give gameplay a 10/10 is because the rocket launcher's rockets are the biggest pain in the butt to hit anything with.\n\nPresentation 10/10\nThis game was revolutionary for its time, and still looks great.  It's not COD: AW, but I like that it doesn't need to use the crutch of HD graphics like some games.  The music is fantastic, and used sparingly, which helps a ton with the mood, because you'll know when something important is happening just because of music playing.  There isn't much to say here, because it's not something you really notice, but overall, the presentation is perfect.\n\nTrue Completionist fans are expecting me to move on to the final component of his reviewing style, the final level, but the problem is, I haven't gotten there yet.  I just wanted to post this review now, and I might come back and edit it later to add the \"Final Level\" portion if I feel like it.  (But no promises; I probably won't.)\n\nOverall: 9.6/10\nVerdict: What the hell are you waiting for?

A blast from beginning to end. No filler in this one and it's a crazy long game. This is the FPS that every thing else is based on. Before Half Life we just had run and gun shooters like Quake. Then Valve happened and we got a cinematic masterpiece. No one had made an FPS like this before. There would be no Call of Duty or any other modern shooter without this one setting the standard. \n\nThe graphics look awfully dated by today's standards but the game is so damn good it's totally worth playing anyway. If you really can't get past the Quake 2 style graphics then I highly HIGHLY recommend downloading a remake of this game. It's called Black Mesa and it's Half Life 1 redone with the SOurce engine and hi-res graphics. It is incredible and shows that this game is still a blast to play to this day. The story is very cool and the game is loaded with tons of moments you will always remember. This series is regarded as the pinnacle for a reason. If you've seriously never played this then get it. It's worth it. Or better yet, download Black Mesa.\n\nBy the way, back in the day, there was nothing cooler than Half Life 1 deathmatch. To this day I say it was the most fun I've ever had in multiplayer insanity, period. The mod scene was enormous and I can't even begin to think of how many hours I blew away in deathmatch. I probably have more memories of HL deathmatch than any other video game. My online nemesis was Loach. I remember you, sir. Every time you joined it was a frantic battle through hell to remain at the top of the scoreboard and every map, 1st and 2nd place went to us. If Black Mesa ever gets deathmatch going  and I should run into you again, it's on!
