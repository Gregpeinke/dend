It's simplicity is it's strength.  \n\nIf you are looking for a realistic WWII game then move on.\n\nThe gun game and modded servers keep this game viable, although it seems that active servers are getting fewer and farther between, leading me to assume that players are moving on to Day of Infamy or other newer WW fps.\n\nEdit:\n \nDay of Defeat source is still surprisingly active despite my previous expectations. \n\nI would not be surprised if it outlives Day of Infamy.\n\nI highly recommend it to anyone looking for a solid arcade fps experience that will run on a low spec pc or

Day Of Defeat: Source. A name that I just love to hear. Day of Defeat: Source is a great game, it's set in 1944 World War 2, where the Allies have to eliminate the Axis and vise Versa, they have to secure points and[spoiler]there is a special mode for the Allies to blow up points.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Classes[/h1]\nThe thing I love about this game is, none of the classes seems useless, it's similar to TF2 in a sense. It's based on what play style you use. For example, if you're good with your aim, you'll be the sniper, if you're the attacker type, you're assault. Every weapon seems unique. Me personally, my two favorite classes are the Rifleman and Sniper (I'm the sniper type. ).\n\n[h1]Level Design and Game Engine[/h1]\nThe Two main things I love about Day Of Defeat: Source are the game's engine and the game's level design. First, I'll talk about level design. The level design is great, it makes you feel you're in a real battleground and not in a fictional 1v1 arena. The maps are all special in their own way, and I just loved how it's set in the early 40s.\n\nThe game engine is the best part about the game, it's the source engine (My favourite game engine is the Source Engine for you who is wondering.). I love how every Valve-Source-made game is different from the other. In Day Of Defeat: Source you can sprint, in Counter-Strike: Source you can bunny hop and so on. The source engine by today's standards is still outdated but in my eyes, it's still up to date with me. It's like I'm obsessed with the game engine.\n\n[h1]Trailer[/h1]\nQuick little mention, the game's trailer is one of the coolest trailers I've ever seen, besides the CS:GO trailer. It's made in Source Film Maker and it recreates how a regular match would play out. You feel like you've watched a professional movie.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8jQJ5SFqBU\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAnyways, from a scale from 0-10, How much would I recommend this game? I would recommend this game an 8 out of 10. In my opinion, the 4th best WW2 game out in the market. Check this game out! Thanks for reading and have a good day.\n\n[b]EDIT: I have found out and have played a fan-made game inspired by Day of Defeat called Day of Infamy, It's a more complex and realistic version of Day of Defeat.[/b]\n\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/447820/","timestamp_created":1541282950,"timestamp_updated":1564909674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45543811","author":{"steamid":"76561198355752399","num_games_owned":608,"num_reviews":1000,"playtime_forever":369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":369,"last_played":1540872237},"language":"russian","review":"Норм игра","timestamp_created":1541006108,"timestamp_updated":1541006108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51086956262588501","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45531373","author":{"steamid":"76561198433923394","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":750,"last_played":1589666988},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom jogo de capturar bandeira","timestamp_created":1540959241,"timestamp_updated":1540959241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45487271","author":{"steamid":"76561198063209433","num_games_owned":567,"num_reviews":198,"playtime_forever":570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":469,"last_played":1649319285},"language":"english","review":"The typical Source classic, the only World War 2 first person shooter game made by Valve.\n\nThis game is old, outdated, abandoned by Valve and obviously can't be compared to the modern FPS games. But despite the old graphics and funny animations, there is something special about this game - the gameplay.\n\nDoD:S gameplay is focused on tactic. It's the exact opposite of Call of Duty, Battlefield and games like that. The recoil is pretty big and unforgivable, players have to cooperate and carefully move around the map. It's usually impossible to run over a street without smoke grenades or using cover. One or two hits mean instant death. This type of gameplay probably reminds you Insurgency or Day of Infamy - sure, they are both unofficial spiritual successors to this game, at least Day of Infamy is definitely inspired by this game although DoD:S remains more open to new players and less hardcore.\n\nAt first I didn't even know if it makes sense to post a review of this game after all these years. Then I saw a gameplay video from the new Call of Duty and it was so childish and stupid that I actually learned to appreciate games like DoD:S more. Then I thought there might be still people looking for a WW2 shooter made for people with IQ over 50.\n\nI'd recommend to buy Day of Infamy instead because it's in my opinion the better and newer (even actively supported) game but DoD:S still has its own style so if you don't care about money and want to expand your collection of WW2 games or if you are simply a person who enjoys/wants all Valve games, this may still be an interesting game, even in 2018. And yes, it's multiplayer-only of course. No single-player mode at all. The community is still alive and host dedicated servers.\nDon't even think about playing this game with a controller, it requires mouse for precise and fast reactions.\n\n[h1]System info & performance

Despite being 8 years old there's still plenty of players out there and even if there's no players on there are bots in almost every server to keep the game active and engaging. The biggest positive of it is very good with low quality PC's and bad networks, I've never been kicked from a server for having high Ping.\nMy only real gripe with this game is that Valve just kinda forgot about the game and didn't continue to support it with content updates and it lacks a single-player campaign which is just criminal for a WW II based shooter. Other than that though if you want to have a fun way to pass the time and you're burnt out on Call of Duty, I'd say give this game a shot.
