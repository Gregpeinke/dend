Portal 2 is definitely more polished and refined, both visually and gameplay-wise.  The new mechanics involving things like gels and excursion tunnels work well in the Portal environment, and even better when manipulated with the handheld portal device (portal gun).  I'll admit that I expected more of a challenge like in the first Portal, but was surprised when I passed everything without a problem.  The single player campaign is also more linear with the puzzles; I couldn't find alternative solutions to solve chambers like in the first game.  The single player portion seems to primarily exist to expand on the Portal world.  It does so wonderfully.\n\nThe two-player campaign is where the real challenges are.  These puzzles were a blast to play.  Unfortunately, this portion is short and has little replay value.  Hopefully this will be changed in the future, because these were the puzzles I expected of the single player mode.","timestamp_created":1309482547,"timestamp_updated":1309482547,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"824193","author":{"steamid":"76561197979481222","num_games_owned":426,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1317884400},"language":"french","review":"Tout simplement génial... suite directe du 1 (auquel il vaut mieux avoir joué pour profiter pleinement du scénar), il le surpasse à tous points de vue et sublime le concept o/.","timestamp_created":1309478372,"timestamp_updated":1309478372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"604977","author":{"steamid":"76561197972822414","num_games_owned":432,"num_reviews":393,"playtime_forever":2089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1853,"last_played":1372966893},"language":"english","review":"I must admit I am a Portal fanboy so this may not be the most balanced recommendation but it also meant that I had very high expectations of this game.
