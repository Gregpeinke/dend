Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Half Life 2. Playing this again brings back so many memories. While the multiplayer games have *not* aged well, the Half Life series of games remains a solid gaming experience.\n\nThe puzzles feel fresh even though the mechanics have now existed for a long time in gaming. Perhaps the best part of the game is the story though. The story helps you to make sense of the chaos around you in the game and appreciate the slow moments where Gordon Freeman, the MIT graduate and physist-extraordinaire gets to do what he does best, solve physics based puzzles.\n\nA nice mental stretch from the dull monotony of the typical roided-beefcake of an action hero, Gordon and his story here in Half-Life remain sincere even after more than a decade. When you make a game like this, you can be sure it will last and remain a stalwart example of why video games can convey such amazing stories and lessons.","timestamp_created":1422596828,"timestamp_updated":1422596828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14236052","author":{"steamid":"76561198009311069","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":116,"last_played":1419745307},"language":"english","review":"g00d","timestamp_created":1422596641,"timestamp_updated":1422596641,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.43672025203704834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14235495","author":{"steamid":"76561198047120694","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":10760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5272,"last_played":1648400502},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3Half Life 3","timestamp_created":1422592671,"timestamp_updated":1422592671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14234368","author":{"steamid":"76561197977108659","num_games_owned":963,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":925,"last_played":1468055168},"language":"english","review":"\"Half-Life 2 is, simply put, the best single-player shooter ever released for the PC.

Bu oyunu adam akıllı oynamak ve tüm hikayeyi düzgünce anlamak için İngilizce bilmeniz şart diyebilirim. Ve bu oyunu oynadıktan sonra mutlaka Half-Life 2 : Episode 1 ve Episode 2'yi de edinin derim. Portal serilerini de alabilirsiniz. Half-Life ile bağlantısı olan oyunlar. Half-Life 1'in en azından hikayesiniz okuyun bu oyunu oynamadan önce. Çünkü oyunun en önemli bölümlerinden biri hikayesi. Kesinlikle ve kesinlikle öneriyorum. Counter-Strike gibi oyunlardan hikayesi ve oynanış tekniği ile fark gösteren Half-Life efsanesinin 2. oyununu da mutlaka satın alın ve oynayın.
