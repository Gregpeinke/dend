That is the game which I crapped my pants on and if you can get a copy I'd say it's better than the steam version which toned down the acoustics for the plebs. Half-Life Source is an abomination. It's a tech demo which does away with death-animations, visual consistency and the neat-touches of the original Half Life and all the kiddies go \"MUH GRAPHICS\" and forget the finer details which overall make Half-Life what it is. \n\nIt has a long thought-out campaign with a lot of iteration and cool design decisions which contribute to this air of frantic survival against the odds and wondering if it'll ever work out.

Personally it's one of the best games I ever played and the BEST SINGLEPLAYER FPS I EVER PLAYED (Battlefield and CoD aren't even close to this).\n\n\n\nWell, considering you continue to read this review, who knows, by the time you finish this, Valve might ALREADY have released HL3?

I like to go into moderate detail when I review a game but there's not much I can add to when the game is regarded as one of the greatest fps games of all time and famous for being the aspirations of every fps after its release. I will also add that it was released over 19 years ago. Despite all this, I will review it as I normally would but with the fact in mind that the reader can appreciate an old game.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are obviously outdated, it looks between the quality of the Playstation and the Playstation 2. It has a somewhat pleasing style in my opinion and the graphics are sufficient enough that they clearly show you what everything is. if you see an object the graphics represent the object well enough that you can easily tell that it is that object and you can then infer it's properties. the only issue I genuinely had was the areas of the game where you are outside in the desert in daylight. the textures of the desert rock that is everywhere are quite ugly, it's quite messy, muddy and relatively low resolution, when in a bright environment and moving at the default fast movement speed it can hurt your eyes a bit. there are only a few of these sections in the game but they can take around 20 minutes if you are playing for the first time.\n\nSound:\n\nThe sound design is solid, everything has a unique sound and you can tell what enemies are around the corner if you are cautious and pay close attention to your environment. Weapon sound impactful enough to represent themselves, your footsteps change sound when you run or walk on different materials and the voices are clear and well expressed, you can always understand what the characters are saying at they match the assumed personality of a guard/scientist/agent.\nEchoing and reverbs change depending on your environment although it is usually rather extreme and transitions harshly. I also personally think that the 3D sound balancing is a bit too extreme if someone is speaking to you and your turn slightly away from them you can bearly hear them in your other ear, just a nitpick.\n\nCombat:\n\nAs priorly stated the guns sound and feel good, there's a good amount of recoil and the enemies react satisfyingly\n(crumpling to the crossbow darts, Gibbing from the explosives and getting knocked back by the shotgun shells).\nThe weapons are very diverse between human and alien weaponry, long range, short range, explosive, projectile, hitscan and traps. The occasional turret where it makes sense is always fun. \nAs for the enemies, the human military has some surprisingly complex AI. they try to flank you, force you out of cover with a generous number of grenades, they also appear to communicate with each other, telling their comrades when to move in or to fall back (comically to one scientist in a hazard suit). There have been a few occasions where they make unintelligent decisions and they can be exploited with a few methods.\nThe aliens are more animalistic and less tactical, as they should be.\n\nBosses are few and far between or very regular (depending on what you count as a boss), the final fight is irrefutably a boss and it handles quite well with a large amount of challenge to almost exclusively a first-time player. \n\nThe levels:\n\nEach level/chapter has a theme, almost always a significant fight, a new enemy or a new weapon. the levels mostly make sense and are well designed with hidden paths with rewards and multiple paths to take and loop back to. The puzzles are quite simple and make use of the environment and some forward thinking. Ammo was not in abundance (aside from the exception of the submachinegun bullets) this will force you to use guns you wouldn't otherwise, especially if you play on hard difficulty or if you are not very experienced with first-person shooters.\n\nReplayability:\n\nI have played this game several times over (as well as Half-Life: Sorce (i recommend the standard half-life over source)) and this game is always fun to play in my experience, even if you know what's ahead. my first playthrough took me about 16.5 hours so its great in length for how cheap this game is on sale and in the half-life or valve bundle.

Nečekaně jsou to singleplayer a multiplayer.\nSingleplayer:\nPříběh singleplayeru je naprosto nezapomenutelný.. Gordon Freeman byl poslán do laboratoře Black Mesa, aby posunul jeden vozík s nějakým drahokamem nebo co to vlastně je. Tím se to celé pokazí a budete donucen bojovat proti zrůdám a později i vojákům. Rozhodně jeden z nejlepších, možná úplně nejlepší příběh, co jsem kdy hrál.\nMultiplayer:\nTen je podobný singleplayeru asi jen v tom, že se hraje se stejnými zbraněmi. Multiplayer se hraje formou deathmatche. Hra je velmi rychlá a nemáte čas opravdu na nic. Nejlepší zbraň je asi brokovnice, ale naučit se jakémusi skillu s touto zbraní je docela obtížné. Brokovnice dokáže zabít střelou do hlavy i na poměrně velkou dálku. Navíc dostat se blíže protihráči je poměrně snadné díky rychlosti hry. V tomhle bodě nastává problém brokovnice. Účinek má většinou jen při střele do hlavy a to je velmi, ale opravdu velmi obtížné při rychlosti hry.  Každopádně pokud se tento v uvozovkách skill naučíte a hlavu protihráči dokážete trefit, budete ve velké výhodě. Pokud vám přijde brokovnice až moc jednoduchá můžete zkusit trefit hlavu s revolverem. Revolver sice taky zabije do hlavy na jednu ránu, ale zabití sním je značně těžší kvůli jeho pomalé střelbě. Navíc při vystřelení jen jednoho náboje (revolver) je logicky menší šance, než že zasáhnete hlavu pomocí více broků (brokovnice). Revolver moc nedoporučuji. Jen tak si sním občas ze srandy zahrajte proti slabšímu soupeři, ať nejste pořád u toho samého. Každopádně se určitě revolver brokovnici nikdy nevyrovná.\nVe hře Half-Life jsem nenašel žádnou větší chybu, kromě málo častého bugnutí do textury v singleplayeru. Hru tedy hodnotím 10/10.\n\nEnglish: (translator used) \nThis game is known by everyone, because Counter Strike itself came out of it.\nIt divides into two completely different parts. They are unexpectedly single player and multiplayer.\nSingleplayer:\nThe story of the singleplayer is totally unforgettable. Gordon Freeman was sent to Black Mesa to move a cart with a gem or what it is. This will all go wrong and you will be forced to fight the monsters and later the soldiers. Definitely one of the best, maybe the best story I've ever played.\nMultiplayer:\nHe's just like a single-player, just playing the same weapons. Multiplayer is played in the form of deathmatche. The game is very fast and you do not have time for anything. The best weapon is probably a shotgun, but learning how to use this weapon is quite difficult. The shotgun can kill the head even for a relatively long distance. Moreover, getting closer to the opponent is quite easy due to the speed of the game. At this point, there is a problem with the shotgun. The effect is usually only when the shot is in the head and that is very, but really very difficult in the speed of the game. Anyway, if you learn this quote in quotes and you can hit your opponent's head, you will be in great advantage. If you get a shotgun too simple you can try to hit your head with a revolver. The revolver also kills the head for one shot, but killing is much harder because of his slow shooting. In addition, when shooting only one shell (revolver) is logically less likely than hitting your head with multiple shotguns. I do not recommend the revolver much. Just so I can sometimes take a fun game against a weaker opponent, no matter what you are. Anyway, surely, the revolver does not match the shotgun.\nI did not find any bigger bug in Half-Life, except for a little bug in the single-player texture. The game is 10/10.","timestamp_created":1517086683,"timestamp_updated":1523392760,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551901161670684814","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39662685","author":{"steamid":"76561198218159179","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":491,"last_played":1514298804},"language":"russian","review":"вообще игра классика и тут мало есть что сказать\nHalfLife\n это когда я у мамы СПИДранер(дада спидран за 8 часов)","timestamp_created":1517080183,"timestamp_updated":1517080183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39661513","author":{"steamid":"76561198165660892","num_games_owned":570,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1524798245},"language":"russian","review":"Классика,всем рекомендую пройти!","timestamp_created":1517077230,"timestamp_updated":1517077230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39660882","author":{"steamid":"76561198120433483","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1516923915},"language":"brazilian","review":"Apenas três palavras:\n\nOLD but GOLD","timestamp_created":1517075747,"timestamp_updated":1517075747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597749650478363037","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39659509","author":{"steamid":"76561198261080390","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1930,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1929,"last_played":1520430007},"language":"polish","review":"Замечательная игра!

Evet karşınızda Half-Life.\n\nBu oyun hakkında aslında söylenecek fazla bir şey yok. FPS türünün başlangıcı sayılan ve gerek oynanışı bakımından, gerek seneryosuyla gönüllerde taht kurmayı başarrdı. \n\nHalf-Life, bir gizli araştırma üssü olan Black Mesa'da meydana gelen bir kazayı ve sonrasında gelişen olayları karakterimiz Gordon Freeman'ın gözünden anlatan 1998 yapımı bir FPS oyunudur. Oyunda uzaydan geldiği varsayılan bir taş üzerinde deney yapılırken, teknik bir sorunla ortaya çıkan kaza sonucunda Dünya ve Xen arasında bir portal açılıyor. Bu portaldan geçen uzaylı yaratıklar dünya için tehdit oluşturuyor. Bizim amacımız ise karşımıza çıkan uzaylı yaratıklar ve askeri birlikleri öldürerek  finalde karşımıza çıkan Nihilanth isimli bossu yenmek. Oyunun en gizemli kişisi G-Man bazı bölümlerde bize yardım eder ve boss Nihilanth'ı öldürdükten sonra Nihilanth bize ''Sen insansın, (G-Man'ı gösterek) o değil der.'' Oyun sonunda boss ile savaşımız bittikten sonra son savaşa kadar olanları kayıtsızca izleyen G-Man, Gordon için iki seçenek sunar. Kendisi için çalışmasını yada bir tanık olarak ölmesini. Gordon, yaşamayı seçer.\n\nOyun fazlasıyla kasvetli bir temaya sahip ve nereden düşman çıkacağı belli olmadığından dolayı oynayan kişiler her an tetikte olmak zorunda. Bunun yanında oyunda farklı yerlere gizlenmiş bir sürü supplies bulabilirsiniz.
