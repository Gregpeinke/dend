: Half Life 2\n\"ตื่นขึ้นมาและสูดกลิ่นขี้เถ้าที่ลอยมาตามสายลม\"\n\nเริ่มต้นที่ Gman ได้ปลุก Gordon ขึ้นมาจากการจำศีล อายุของ Gordon จะยังคงอายุเท่าเดิม เพราะมิติที่ Gman กักขัง Gordon ทำให้เวลาไม่มีผลต่อเขา Gordon ได้พบว่าโลกที่เขารู้จักได้เปลี่ยนอย่างสิ้นเชิง เขาได้ตื่นมาบนรถไฟที่กำลังเดินทางมายังเมือง City 17 แต่ในระหว่างนั้นตัว Gordon เองก็เกือบโดนส่งไปที่ Nova Prospekt แต่โชคยังเข้าข้างอยู่เขาได้ถูกช่วยโดย Barney เพื่อนสนิทของ Gordon ที่ตอนนี้กำลังแฝงตัวเป็น Civil Protection และ barney ก็บอกให้ไปหา Dr.Kleiner แต่ทว่า Gordon เกือบจะถูกจับตัวไว้ได้แต่ก็มี Alyx Vance มาช่วยไว้ก่อนและได้พาตัวไปหา Dr.Kleiner เพื่อทำการทดสอบเครื่อง Teleport แต่ว่าได้มีเจ้า Headcrab ที่ Dr.Kleiner เลี้ยงไว้มาทำให้การ Teleport ผิดพลาดแต่นั้นทำให้ Dr.Breenได้รู้ถึงการกลับมาของ Gordon Freeman!!!\n\nเกมเพลย์ในภาคนี้ดีขึ้นกว่าภาคก่อนอย่างมาและภาคนี้มีอาวุธใหม่ๆและเรามี Gravity Gun ปืนที่สามารถหยิบยกสิ่งของได้และระบบ Physics ที่ทำออกมาได้ดีมากการเล่นกับสิ่งภายในฉากและลูกเล่นต่างๆที่เราสามารถจะทำได้ภายในเกมนั้นมีเยอะมากและ Ai ที่เป็นเพื่อนร่วมทางเราสามารถติดตามเราได้ถึงสี่คน Ai ในเกมนี้ก็ทำออกมาได้ดีสามารถช่วยเราจัดการกับศัตรูได้อยู่บ้างแต่ข้อเสียคือมันดูแลตัวเองไม่ค่อยเป็น \n\n(สรุป)\nHalf life 2 คือเกมที่กลับมาสานต่อเนื้อเรื่องได้อย่างยอดเยี่ยม การนำเสนอที่ไม่เหมือนใคร และไม่มีใครที่จะเหมือนได้ Half life 2 ยังเป็นเกมในดวงใจที่ผมรักที่สุด!!\n\n\nScore ( ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ )

So is HL 2 the best game ever created? That is greatly subjective, for me the original will always hold a special place in my heart and I'm sure for most of you other more successful games might take that place but let's be real, HL 2 is the pinnacle of gaming experience no matter if you played it when it came out or right now years later when many other similar games came out.\n\nIn short, Half-Life 2 is what every game developer should play before considering to make a game that will be a success!","timestamp_created":1492448646,"timestamp_updated":1492448646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31203224","author":{"steamid":"76561198228883060","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1497164484},"language":"russian","review":"старый добрый  Half-Life 2","timestamp_created":1492448476,"timestamp_updated":1492448476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605924308300018311","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31202961","author":{"steamid":"76561198042568646","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":2248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2247,"last_played":1559004852},"language":"french","review":"Histoire et décors très réussi.
