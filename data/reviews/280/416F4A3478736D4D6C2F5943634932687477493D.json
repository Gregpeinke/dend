I use the word \"remake\" loosely because it's just a port of the original Half-Life built in Half-Life 2's Source Engine. Which in theory should be a good thing, an older game rebuilt in a newer game engine. Except instead of remaking the game properly Valve went about it in the laziest way possible. They just took the assets from Half-Life and dumped them into the Source engine. There's no real BIG difference between the two. But there are small differences between the two, most of which are bad.\n\nThere are some improvement from the original Half-Life that I can see. The enemies have rag doll physics. Some of the textures look slightly less muddy and the main menu has dynamic backgrounds like Half-Life 2 instead of just a JPG like in the original Half-Life. They used the Source Engine's dynamic lighting and particle effect system. Also some of the out door areas  have actual sky boxes instead of the low pixel still images the original game did. The water effects look better and the flashlight has a real time shadow effect now. Friendly NPC's AI has seen some noticeable improvements. While your escorting them it's harder for them to get lost.\n\nHowever the issue is the game is noticeably buggy. Some bugs are bad enough that they do hurt the over all quality.\n\nThe ones I found are as follows.....\n\n1. There's some screen tarring in a few places.\n\n2. Some of the sound effects are... off. And that's because some of the sound effects have been removed and replaced with sound effects from Half-Life 2. Some of the sound effects were removed and replaced with nothing, making it so there's dead silence when some sound should be present. Some sound effects have been replaced with others, for example when you hit a wooden crate with your crowbar it's supposed to make that sound effect play but instead it plays the sound of you hitting a metal surface instead. No matter what surface you hit with your crowbar it will make the metal hitting sound effect, unless you hit an enemy. It's a lot louder and more ear piercing then most of the other sound effects which got on my nerves after a while. Seeing as you need to keep smashing wooden crates to get to the supplies inside.\n\n3. The barnacle enemy's tugs don't always reach all the way down to the floor. Making it so they look like they're inactive but you'll get grabbed anyway. It's supper annoying that you can get grabbed and pulled up to ceiling after walking into nothing. There's also a section early on where the barnacle's are hidden behind some ceiling panels in a break room and their tugs clip through them. Making it so you can see them when your not supposed to.\n\n4. There are times when the improved textures hurt the game rather that help it. Some areas are supposed to look dirty and trashed with blood stains and trash everywhere. But these areas look clean and spotless instead.\n\n5. The weapon model on your magnum revolver looks weirdly shiny for some reason.\n\n6. The MP5 has some weird sway effect now for some reason and dose way more damage. That includes when other people are using it, not just you.\n\n7. If there's music playing when you hit a loading screen it'll just cut out when the loading screen ends.\n\n8. If the security guard NPC's get injured while your escorting them they'll keep making that \"oof\" noise over and over again as if they're constantly getting injured.\n\n9. There's this tentacle enemy you encounter in a few places like the blast pit in the rocket testing facility. This enemy is totally broken and can't deal any damage what so ever. The tentacles just clip right through you. Making it so you can just ignore them in every encounter.\n\n10. The boss fight in Gonarch's Lair is kinda gimped. She won't attack you properly and instead will just stand around firing acid at you. When the acid hits the ground it will leave a black square shaped decal. \n\n11. During the mission Surface Tension the helicopter fight on the side of the cliff is broken too. The game doesn't give you enough rockets to shoot the helicopter down. So you'll be forced to use your other weapons to finish the job.\n\n12. During the mission We Got Hostels in the original game there's a marine that kills a scientist but now that same marine dose nothing. This ruins a major story moment.\n\nThese are just the bugs I noticed while playing through the game once. There's some videos on YouTube by someone named Defenestrum that go into more detail.\n\nAll the improvements that Half-Life: Source makes to the original Half-Life game don't effect the gameplay all that much but all the things it dose worse dose effect the gameplay, mostly for the worst. Which is why I don't recommend playing this over the original. But there are two final nails in the coffin for me on this so called \"remake\"\n\nThe first one is that this version doesn't work with mods. The second is that there's now a real fan remake of Half-Life in the Source Engine called Black Mesa that's available here on Steam. So there doesn't seem to be much of a point in playing this or even for it to exist at all.\n\nI'll give Half-Life: Source a Bethesda treatment out of 10","timestamp_created":1608101217,"timestamp_updated":1636751252,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":78,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.828729152679443359","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82467477","author":{"steamid":"76561198842937176","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":359,"last_played":1612548989},"language":"english","review":"this is a good port of half life one, i like it since it has the half life 2 source engine","timestamp_created":1608083372,"timestamp_updated":1608083372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82460988","author":{"steamid":"76561198271704904","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1613096407},"language":"english","review":"A complete fuck up.
