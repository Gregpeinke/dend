Easily one of the best of 2013. It has absolutely BEUATIFUL graphics and a great and amazing new city to explore too. It has nice refreching FPS action, a very unique and fun sky hook system, and a BRILLIANTLY crafted storyline. Great character development (With Elizabeth of course :), very fun and useful vigors and powers to use, and even has the balls to tackle major controversial themes such as religous and racial segregation, and also has one hell of an ending that certainly packs a punch! It almost hurts being it's so deep. But don't worry, a quick google search will answer any question you ever had on the end, and when you do figure everything out, your guarenteed a mindblow. The game also has a quick visit to the city you've learned to love in Bioshock 1 & 2, so whats not to love? This is probbably the best game of 2013 or in the top 3, with no doubt. This game earns a 8.5/10 on my list, and i dont give those out easily. I DEFINATELY reccomend this to a friend. And if you haven't played it yet, what's wrong with you? Now it doesn't have much replay value, so it's not exactly worth 40$, but if it ends up on a steam sale for say 10$, picking it up wouldn't be a bad idea.","timestamp_created":1386912349,"timestamp_updated":1389583045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8025210","author":{"steamid":"76561198030057866","num_games_owned":446,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1109,"last_played":1411581396},"language":"german","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1386910161,"timestamp_updated":1386910161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8025046","author":{"steamid":"76561198007615591","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2903,"last_played":1386908195},"language":"english","review":"Game play is fun but its the story that makes the game awesome!!!","timestamp_created":1386908306,"timestamp_updated":1386908306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8024693","author":{"steamid":"76561197969077107","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2389,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2067,"last_played":1400707325},"language":"english","review":"Worth every penny.","timestamp_created":1386905014,"timestamp_updated":1386905014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8024114","author":{"steamid":"76561198068086265","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1272,"last_played":1424665179},"language":"english","review":"Unbelievable game, the story was unparalleled to any other game i have played.

Without a word of a lie, the music and visuals in the first main room took my breath way. My first walk in city streets left me in awe.\n\nAnd creepy. Do \"they\" need to look at me intensely, even as I walk away?\n\nAlas, gameplay got up my nose. Not because it was overly difficult but because it was too cluttered. There were certain scenes that completely flumoxed me because I simply could not see or identify what was going on. \n\nOK, I am \"older\" than the average FPS gamer so hamfisted and blurred vision after 1 or 2 scotches is quite common but I just can't escape the fact that I stopped wanting to play extended sessions because it became too much.\n\nSome really scary moments if you're not careful and a clever story line with some rather crude references to some belief systems. Some conjecture was raised about racism on the Steam forums but they were taken out of context. Such references imho, acutely remind us of the past and must be seen for what they are.\n\nI had some issue with the controls for quite sometime. Coming from Bioshock, I was pressing keys \"instinctively\" in some fight scenes and it made it harder than it could have been. Weapon selection and \"plasmid\" selection tripped me up more than once. Some keys were even difficult to get to when it was full on. \n\n(tbh, I didn't check if there was an ability to change bindings and if there is, some may chose to for reasons just mentioned.)\n\nOne small point if I may, weapon choices started to get silly. When entering a hostile area, the weapon \"choice\" offered sort of gave away what was coming so the element of surprise was taken away. I repeatedly found myself sticking with the carbine and the sniper rifle and not bothering much with some \"ïnteresting\" weapons that just didn't do the damage I expected given their implied \"awesomeness\". This was a let down in my view.\n\nEven some of the choices of the \"secondary weapon\"system\" became confusing and I found I stopped using them at times because the effects were marginal or even completely unknown.\n\nAll in all, a good game, beautifully presented and it held a special fascination for me. I just wish the playing field was a little less cluttered but perhaps, given other highly regarded reviews, it's just my age showing through.\n\nPretty intense at times and without giving away too much, employing \"AI\" to assist at times was very well done. \n\n8.5/10\n\ngg","timestamp_created":1386889669,"timestamp_updated":1386889669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589515805244445801","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8022698","author":{"steamid":"76561197993235431","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1386642113},"language":"english","review":"Fun?

Why isn't it as good? Well, it's the ending and sort of the story to really. It's like they teased you with a little bit of story at the beggining, got hung up with creating the game, then loudly exclaimed. \"Oh Fuck! John, we forgot that whole story thing in the middle. Should we just add it all in the end? Yeah, just put all the rest of the story into some sort of semi-interactive Cinematic piece thing?. Yes i'm sure it'll work. Alright we'll do it.\" And so they did that and no, it doesn't work. It is a good story once you fully understand it (lots of googling) and it's a neat concept, but compaed to the original, it's lacking. Ssort of dissapointing too to find out that your choices in the game ultimately don't matter unlike in the first one where if you decided to set up your daddy-day-care-esk nursery for the little sisters then you got rewarded and got a different ending. And the patriot fights are nowhere's near as butt-clenchingly exciting as the Big Daddy fights in the original, nor are the weapons as creative as in the original. The scenery is awesome and you'll be impressed when you first begin, but it grows dull after a while. It suffers from spouts of genericitis, much like my reviews and daily meals.\n\nIf you're going into this game expecting it to be better or just as good as the original, then it's a dissapointed 6/10. If not, maybe a 8/10, why no 9/10? Because holy fuck is shooting the same enemies over and over ever repetative, even on medium difficulty, you litterally have to go into full grind mode just to get through some areas. Though you will be happily entertained through the game otherwise. Get it when it's bellow $10, possibly $20 if you really, really want to play it, that's what it feels like it's worth to me.\n","timestamp_created":1386828305,"timestamp_updated":1386828305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543711662292480469","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8012066","author":{"steamid":"76561197970674841","num_games_owned":1814,"num_reviews":221,"playtime_forever":2236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1793,"last_played":1386648800},"language":"english","review":"I came onto BioShock Infinite fresh after making a final run at the second in the series, and was not entirely sure what to expect with this new outing.  I knew the setting had changed, but a number of the core gameplay mechanics had made the jump from the first two games. \n\nWhat greeted me though was something a bit different than I could have anticipated, in ways that grew on me very quickly.  The first impression was holy crap wow this is a beautiful game.  The first two were interesting, visually, more for their art stylings than actual tech, but they never really blew me away.  Within the first 5 minutes of infinite with all the settings 'turned to 11' so to speak, my jaw was pretty much on the floor.  Its not that they are technically doing something wholly new I haven't seen before, but that what they are doing is just simply done out and out superlatively.  The lighting mixed with the beautiful texturing, mixed with the motion of the air city all around you just really scratched a visual itch in a way that say, Far Cry 2, and Fl0wer for the ps3 had previously.  Just really high on the wow factor.\n\nBeyond the sheer visuals though, I was immediately and pleasantly surprised by how 'tight' the controlls felt.  One of the bigger criticisms of the first two BioShock games is that they were 'console first' designs with controls clearly meant for a gamepad, and they felt sluggish and un-responsive to a seasoned mouse and keyboard user.  Infinite could not be further from that, and it was immediately noticable.  The mouse was perfectly smooth and responsive in the way the top tier valve titles tend to be, and things coming over from consoles really never seem to hit.\n\nThis also ties in very well with much *much* tighter combat.   The weapons feel powerful and generally satisfying, you are limited halo-like to only having two around at a time, so you generally have to think ahead.  Do you really want to walk into a giant mansion with tons of tight corridors and rooms with a sniper rifle, or would it maybe make more sense to swap it out for something a little faster and more mobile first?\n\nThe 'powers' (aka magic sparkles that fly out of your hand and into an enemies face) take something of a back-seat this time compared to gun play, and I appreciated the changes.  The fighting in rapture in the original games felt more like a game of tic-tac-toe than actual combat.  You had to zap the right enemies with the right magic in the right order then shoot them.  Sans magic you might as well have been firing rubber bullets.  You can make it though a signigicant part of this game barely using the powers at all, or you can use them more tactically, augmenting your fighting style in appreciable and welcome ways, vs out-right dictating it to you.\n\nAlso for once, your 'escort mission' is the *best* part of the game, not the worst.  Its almost cliche at this point that you have to do x and y and protect the girl or you lose and its game over would you like to retry and maybe take more of the bullets this time so your npc can skip through unscathed... and yeah.. not here, not at all.  It feels like working *with* someone, not for them, and they are wholly capable of managing themselves, and maybe even getting you the extra cover you need, etc.  The only remaining question is why has it taken 15 years for the 'gaming world' to get it this right?\n\nThere are in the end a few rough edges, sometimes you can feel a little directionless, there is always a helpful arrow to show you where you 'should' go, and you can of course follow it to the end, but theres so much more going on in the game, and the levels are so huge at times that you just sort of feel helpless trying to complete all the little side quests and secrets.  a 'second playthrough' sort of 'new game plus' option would have been pretty welcome here too, as no matter *how* good you are, you are never going to be able to earn/buy/achieve everything on a single play-through.  Those are quibbles tho, a rough plastic seam on a brand new toy, annoying, but no deal breakers by any means.\n\n(9.5/10)","timestamp_created":1386823888,"timestamp_updated":1386874911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550776183605194092","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8011492","author":{"steamid":"76561198054439471","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":723,"last_played":1490737387},"language":"english","review":"This game is absolutely fantastic, the story behind it is incredible!

The result is that I am not one of of hte many fans of the game. Now, please ignore this review if you are a fan of bioshock, this may indeed anger you.\nOk. First off, I want to say that yes this game has a great story. the story is simple but is a well done story that has some scifi elements that made me say, I want to see a bit more. The ending is really good as it deals with a twist that was kinda unseen in the game. The characters, though likeable, I would say a bit forgetable. The characters I think are more memorable is the twins, who are pretty funny because they have a bit of the \"out of this world\" characteristic that you can enjoy. Elizabeth, the main female protagonist does indeed seems to be a very like able character, though not exactly a outstanding character as people would make her to be. \nHowever, the biggest problem with the game is the game, which I'm sorry to say, is subpar. Originally, I though that the original game wasn't that interesting to me because the combat system was too easy and too dull for me to continue playing the game. In Bioshock Infinite, I felt that combat felt less impressive than the first game. Fewer weapons and limits to what weapons you can have often drives me nuts when playing games. It even worst that the guns feel less impactful and that combat also felt like a chore for me. The only weapons that felt good to use were the pistols, revolver and the Air Grabber.\nThe special abilities that you collect are also a real dull choice as it's possible to only use 1 or 2 of them throughout the game without even using others more than one moment. \nThe enemies in the game are also a real annoyance, Some enemies, such as the RPG and Handy man, felt really overpowered and that the hints given about the handy man's weak point do not even result in doing any damage. The Ghost level is what I considered the worst level becauuse of how poorly done it is and how even the objective pointer after the 2nd tear was extremely broken because they only lead you aroudn the whole map.\nOverall, despite the great story, I cannot say this game is considerd a 9s or even the 10s that it recieved. I wasnt' surprised to see this game get awards at all. Overall, this game isnt' not the game we need or want.","timestamp_created":1386797651,"timestamp_updated":1386797651,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519853174686431885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8008326","author":{"steamid":"76561198067600767","num_games_owned":589,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":753,"last_played":1416261034},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo mais que recomendado, cenario espetacular  otima estoria  mas muito confusa  do começo ao fin , vc vai ter que joga ele mais de 1 vez ou presta muita atenção pra vc enteder tudo, uma coisa muito ruim é expreção facial todos os personagens  tem cara de boneco sem vida no olhar de resto ta otimo","timestamp_created":1386795106,"timestamp_updated":1386795106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8008209","author":{"steamid":"76561198040944028","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1437874488},"language":"english","review":"It is beautiful!

Honestly, I would have guessed it to be a Bethesda title.\n\nI have a hard time writing this review, because I am very conflicted about this game.  \n\nOn one hand I love the graphics, characters, and story.\n\nThe world of BioShock Infinite is beautiful and steam punk based.  The sheer art of the game is amazingly good, and if you have a high end PC you will enjoy it! \n\nThe characters are well thought out, well dialoged.  Your main side kick Elizabeth is lovable.\n\nThe story, if not a little spotty in places because you change dimensions from time to time, is one of the better ones you will see.   Hate, racism, tragedy, war, national pride, capitalism, death.  I feel the game wraps up nicely, and unlike most games you know it's the end of that particular story.  No chance of a sequel.\n \nOn the other hand the game mechanics suck.  \n\nEven though Elizabeth is a lovable character, how you interact with her during combat is a pain in the ass.  She is of no real help besides providing you with extra ammo most of the time.  It causes you to take your focus away from combat.  I find it was more of a hinderance than a help.\n\nThe whole “vigor” (magic powers) system seems very flawed and ill balanced.  I would find myself mostly using only one vigor, Murder of Crows.  Although I experimented with a couple of others, none of them could seem to touch the power of the crows.  Especially with upgrades, Murder of Crows is so over powered.  Where on the other hand even with upgrades Possession is basically useless.  \n\nAnother reason for using Murder of Crows primary is you get it relatively early, where as some of the other ones  like Charge or Undertow come too late for me to really even consider or experiment with.   One of the big reasons is that you only have so much money for upgrades and you can't upgrade everything.\n\nDuring combat you also have to micro different “tears”, basically things you can bring in to your own dimension.  These include automated guns, medpacks, weapon crates, etc....  I feel like this is really a missed opportunity to incorporate Elizabeth in to combat better.  Rather than in the thick of it, to have to look around for the tear and then hit my key to open it, it would be much more efficient to provide a fly wheel and let me pick what I need and Elizabeth then open the tear.\n\nAs mentioned before, this game could be confused for a Bethesda title.  There is a lot of scrounging, lock picking, and exploring.  The explorable parts aren't exactly big, however it make the game feel larger than it really is.  I personally don't think it really fits within the game, and the game would be better without it.\n\nIt feels like the shooter side of it is either a side effect of it just being a BioShock title, or just a way to lengthen the game.  Really I feel like this could be an adventure game, ala Telltales The Walking Dead, and would have been shorter as well as more fulfilling.\n\nThe game, despite it's price tag is incredibly short.  ~12 hours for a first play through.  I have yet to play any of the DLC, although since I payed for it without playing the game, I will spend some time on it.  Besides DLC, I don't see much of a reason to replay the main game.  I feel like I explored as much of the game as I could on the first run, and am unlikely to find much more.  There is no multiplayer, no way to change the story.\n\nSo do I recommend the game?

Em todos os sentidos.\nPra começar, quem viu algumas imagens do jogo já sabe o quanto o visual é destaque aqui. Columbia é uma cidade que impressiona pela riqueza de detalhes, típico de um jogo da franquia, mas agora com aquela impressão de \"mundo aberto\". O jogo, claro, faz aquela misturinha que deu certo na série, do passado com o futuro. O fato de você poder carregar apenas duas armas e não mais várias como nos jogos anteriores é bem interessante, pois isso faz aumentar a dificuldade, mas elas podem ser trocadas assim que você encontra outra (aí, claro, normalmente você vai querer ficar com as que tem mais munição). Outra coisa que você não pode mais é carregar itens de cura: você só os pega se você realmente precisa usá-los. A mecânica do jogo é um pouco diferente, com um ritmo mais acelerado, mas ainda vemos algumas semelhanças, como os loots em caixas e corpos e melhoramentos nas armas e nos poderes, agora tudo pago em dinheiro. Não há mais o sistema de hack das máquinas (apesar de que você pode usar lockpicks para destravar cofres e locais), mas você pode jogar um poder nelas que faz elas cuspirem dinheiro ou lutarem ao seu favor, no caso de turrets. Mas talvez o que mais impressiona não é a dificuldade, a jogabilidade, o visual, a trilha, etc., mas sim, a história. Ela é mais complexa do que aparenta. E os personagens são muito bem construídos, fazendo com que você crie um carisma pelo Booker DeWitt e pela Elizabeth. Em resumo, é algo totalmente novo (e excelente) para a série, que trouxe um novo horizonte e que expandiu as possibilidades.\n\nClash in the Clouds (DLC): diria que é um modo survival, onde você progride em diversas áreas enquanto tenta sobreviver a ondas de inimigos. Apenas uma alternativa para aumentar a longevidade do jogo.\n\nBurial at Sea - Part 1 (DLC): é uma história a parte, protagonizada novamente por Booker e por Elizabeth, agora em Rapture, cidade subaquática do primeiro Bioshock, antes da sua decadência geral. É um episódio bem curto e a mecânica de Infinite no universo do Bioshock original estranha um pouco no início, mas até que funciona e é interessante ver como os personagens adquiriram novas personalidades. Além disso, a impressão é que a dificuldade aqui é maior: mesmo jogando no mesmo nível do Infinite, foram muitas as vezes que morri em curtos espaços de tempo.\n\nBurial at Sea - Part 2 (DLC): já aqui a história é mais como um complemento de alguns acontecimentos do Bioshock original e Infinite, além de dar continuidade à Part 1, claro. É protagonizado por Elizabeth e é mais focado em stealth, apesar de você também poder usar alguns plasmids de ataque, bem como algumas armas. Por causa disso, ele dá a impressão de ser mais comprido que a Part 1. E o final é algo bastante chocante. Ainda considero a história do Infinite melhor, mas Burial at Sea também tem seus méritos.","timestamp_created":1386783402,"timestamp_updated":1416451960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8006038","author":{"steamid":"76561198070211266","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":687,"last_played":1388697988},"language":"english","review":"yeahhhhh boiiiiii","timestamp_created":1386783008,"timestamp_updated":1386783008,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8005742","author":{"steamid":"76561198015533057","num_games_owned":2515,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":2413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1172,"last_played":1400436111},"language":"russian","review":"90/100","timestamp_created":1386781209,"timestamp_updated":1386781209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8005509","author":{"steamid":"76561198008167296","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":765,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":886,"last_played":1366786800},"language":"english","review":"This is a baloon nothing more.

Infinite however makes a departure from the themes of the other games as it is set in a different city, Columbia, a utopian society living on a city in the sky; it is also set at a much earlier time than its predecessors in around 1912 as opposed to 1940-1950. The game follows the story of Booker Dewitt, a private investigator tasked with rescuing a girl named Elizabeth.\n\nNow though this seems like a very bland and overdone story, it manages to masterfully inject other themes into the game, such as racial hate at this time, terrorism, religion and even at some points scientific theories!\n\nThe roller coaster (or skyline)  ride this game takes takes you on story wise is astounding, with the AI companion that you spend most of the game with (Elizabeth) feeling like a natural character that develops throughout the game and doesn't feel like some stretched out escort quest; her animation quality is astounding along with the graphical fidelity that irrational games has manged to achieve, you will find yourself falling in love with the environment, the visual design and most importantly, Elizabeth.\n\nHowever, what you won't be falling in love with any time soon is the combat. Unfortunately Infinite's combat system is somewhat bland, with generic weapons that don't really feel very interesting, and a passive effects only upgrade system that you would be hard pressed to tell the difference with in some cases; you feel yourself longing for more story, more time to spend with the amazing characters and dialogue, and towards the end rolling your eyes every time you see a Vox or a Founder. The game does make an attempt to make the combat more interesting through the use of almost comic book hero like powers, such as creating electrocution traps, throwing balls of fire at enemies and other such abilities named vigors; and while fun at first unfortunately towards the end of the game they start to feel useless and will often find yourself forgetting to use them as they are often quite situational, and if you do use them it is likely you will heavily use 2 or 3 and barely ever use the others. \n\nIf you are looking for a game with masterful story telling, immense sound design and great graphical fidelity and setting, Then Bioshock Infinite is for you; but if good, solid game play mechanics that stay fun throughout the game is what you want, then you may not enjoy it. Though either way I would recommend purchasing this if it is ever on sale just for the pure fact that the story is so song; just stick it on easy and breeze through the game, marveling at the sights Columbia has to offer. \n\nI give this game a Good/10","timestamp_created":1386772335,"timestamp_updated":1386772335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496551752090454102","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8004266","author":{"steamid":"76561198072725899","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":4771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1201,"last_played":1506880450},"language":"brazilian","review":"Excelente jogo!!! altamente recomendado para quem gosta do gênero fps, no melhor estilo anos 50 e 60.","timestamp_created":1386771846,"timestamp_updated":1386771846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8003761","author":{"steamid":"76561198070510151","num_games_owned":479,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":457,"last_played":1386767520},"language":"english","review":"Best shooter of 2013, this game is just so good.\nBioshock infinite shows that FPS games can tell good story and also offer good gameplay.\nReally loved the game and i hope that they will make something similar, because it was just so good but little bit too short to me 7.6h main story with normal.

The main plot of Infinite is compelling, unique, and nothing short of brilliant. The creators of this game set their aim upon a near-impossible blend of philosophic, suspenseful, and emotional appeal, and came through with a precious gem of a video game. All this is, I think, fairly well established as common knowledge. What I wish to say in this review, though, is that this game is, against all odds, extremely replayable. Though most would expect the game to be worth playing through once, then shelving in an effort to forget the plot, it is actually worthwhile to immediately reexamine the \"New Game\" button. Though the most unique and striking feature of this game is the plot, it overshadows an equally wonderful thing about the game; its sheer beauty. In fact, a replay is in many ways even superior to the first playthrough, as you can take your time examining the lovely setting, admiring the subtlety of the narrative, enjoying the challenging combat, and appreciating the emotional impact of events in a new light, in the absence of any hurry to get to the bottom of what's going on.
