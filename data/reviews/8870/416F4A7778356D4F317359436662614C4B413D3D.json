It turns out that this is partially true, in that one character (Elizabeth) is memorable, as is the gimmick of a floating city and dimension-hopping. However, the rest of the story is blah, and all ends aren't satisfactorily resolved by the ending cinimatics. Is this a relatively good story for a shooter? Absolutely. Would the story stand on it's own as a book or even a movie? Never.\n\nBut back to what I liked about the game: the power system works pretty well, in fact it is probably the best thing about this game (a megaman-like dependence on exploiting enemy weaknesses becomes important in late game or high difficulties), and the combos feel powerful, as do purchase-able upgrades. Which speaks to another positive: you cannot afford to buy all the upgrades. This means finding out what your play style is and sticking to it, which is a glimmer of integrity from the increasingly erratic 2K Games.\n\nWhat sucks? Well, for starters there are FREQUENT framerate issues on a high-end PC, as well as game-breaking occasions where enemies, floors, walls, etc. are unsee-able because their skins don't show up. Is the air shooting you? It will go away with a restart, but if the autosave was in an inconvenient spot, you still have to play it over, aside from the obvious downside of completely breaking your momentum. I also have gripes about the story. The first 80% of the game explains nothing-which is fine, if you are playing a mystery game. Why doesn't this work here? Because the objectives you spent all that time pursuing no longer exist when you hop a reality. You end up with a Lord-of-the-Rings style question at the end: why didn't we just fly to Mt Doom (or the final Bioshock bad-guy fight, as the case may be) and skip the big nothing in the middle? Furthermore, only one characters motives are explained (Booker's, don't expect ever to find out what is going on with the twins) and many loose ends remain.\n\nSUMMARY: Was this game good? Well, the last 20% had satisfying gameplay and there were moments of greatness... I'd say it is worth playing if you can get it on sale for $15 or less. Don't expect story greatness, or even bug-free gaming, though.","timestamp_created":1403257058,"timestamp_updated":1403257058,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10556426","author":{"steamid":"76561198032630292","num_games_owned":278,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":178,"last_played":1401577712},"language":"russian","review":"Очень понравилась эта игра, советую её всем !

oscura de rapture, eliminando todas las sensaciones de miedo de nuestro cuerpo y aportandonos muchisima accion, como digo, el punto fuerte de este juego es la historia, me quito el sombrero ante los guionistas, por otra parte la dinamica de combate tambien cambia teniendo ahora aparte de la barra de salud, una barra de escudo que se regenera con el tiempo, de esta forma se hace muchisisimo mas

There is also quite a lot of racial slurs, but I feel it ties more into the timeline this game vacates, so this should not be a big deal, it's more of a compliment to literature so to speak. If you can look past these discrepencies, boy do you have a journey ahead of you!\n\nBioShock Infinite, is by far, one of the best story-driven games I have played in my life, and I have played many. It's one of the first games that I've beaten in quite some time, and I was very pleased with my experience. Getting into the lore of the world, and searching for all the collectibles, you will find yourself sunk into this game. Not to mention the amazing job they did on character development.\n\nYou will be absolutely amazed, and mindblown at the end of this game's plot. You will be sitting there thinking about it for minutes, and my friend who recommended me the game a few months ago, still, talks about this game's story ending, as if it left him distraught, and that's something that's quite hard to accomplish for a game. You will be extremely pleased with the story, and nothing short of astonished. \n\nThe gameplay is, well, a first person shooter. However, with vigours thrown in, you will get quite a lot of options when it comes to how you will defeat your opponent, or hordes of opponents. There is rarely a dull moment, except for near the end of the game when I really just wanted to get the story done so I could see how it played out, and the 15 minute final battle was offsetting, but definitely put a great amount of emotion into you. \n\nThe graphics are ASTOUNDING. The lighting is by far the major thing here in BioShock Infinite, but even with the symplistic artstyle, it leaves nothing to be desired whatsoever. When you're walking around with Elizabeth, and see the texturing on her dress, you can imagine how it feels, and really puts you into the game, that's something I noticed near the end. I originally started this game on an HD7870, and on Ultra Settings, was getting about 40FPS, but since then upgraded to a R9 290, and restarted the game, and very rarely dropped under 60FPS throughout the game on Ultra, in 1080p. \n\nWould I recommend this game to a friend? Oh yes I most certainly will! This game is a must-have to own, and you MUST complete the story, at least once. It's one of the best games you will ever play, I can guarantee you.","timestamp_created":1403167179,"timestamp_updated":1403167179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10522734","author":{"steamid":"76561198040933327","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2242,"last_played":1451110425},"language":"english","review":"This game was my first experience with the Bioshock franchise.

É um jogo divertido, com a boa jogabilidade do primeiro Bioshock e com uma excelente história. Farei uma breve síntese sem colocar nenhum spoiler.\n\nO jogo é bem ambientando e linkado com o primeiro Bioshock, mas não há  a necessidade de você ter jogado o primeiro antes deste.\n\nComo a maioria do games, é um jogo linear (não tem como você jogar livremente sem seguir o roteiro do jogo - mesmo você podendo andar livreemente muitas vezes). Você pode usar seus vigores (poder / magia ou qualquer nome que queira dar) que facilitarão e combate com múltiplos adversários e em caso de não querer, é um bom FPS (First Person Shooter - tiro em primeira pessoa). Você carrega duas armas por vez e a Elizabeth, a moça do jogo (NPC: non-player character - personagem não jogável) é uma excelente parceira te ajudando a encontrar itens (munição, saúde, dinheiro etc) sem que você tenha que se preocupar com ela.\n\nA parte de combate é boa: usar o aerogancho, melee, armas e vigores é bem divertido. Os efeitos gráficos do melee, headshots e sangue são muito bons (para época). O que me decepcionou um pouco foi a AI do jogo, não por ser ruim mas poderia ser melhor. Se você atirar bem de longe (fora do alcance do combate) você descarrega o pente e seu inimigo morre sem reação. Ou então durante o combate, você volta umas duas ou três portas e ninguém te segue ou faz uma armadilha pra você. \n\nA história é ótima, porém para poucos. Eu diria que menos de 30% dos jogadores compreende a história e menos de 7% entende o final. É necessário ter que pensar para seguir a linha de raciocínio do jogo, que usa uma temática científica / religiosa. Teoria de multiverso, teoria de eco, constantes e variáveis farão ligação com batismo, profecias, destino. Vai ajudar a compreender a história ouvindo as gravações (voxophones) que lhe darão mais dados para entender a história.\n\nSão usados associações a fatos americanos da época (revolução, pinkerton, criação de sindicato, racismo). Como não americano, se você pesquisar você vai entender o que é Pinkerton, porque alguns dos nomes (Broker DeWitt / Bryce DeWitt, J. Fink / H. Frick), porque Broker sente muito pela batalha de \"Wounded Knee\", o patriota (George Washington) e outras associações. Há ainda a abordagem do racismo presente no jogo que reflete à época, então se você se sente ofendido em relação ao racismo ou temática religiosa, lembre-se: é apenas um jogo retratando a época.\n\nPor fim, a capacidade de raciocínio vai influenciar na sua compreensão do final, onde nada fará sentido ou \"onde tudo fará sentido\".\n\nObs.: Não ganhou nota maior por causa da IA, que ao meu ver foi bem esquecida.","timestamp_created":1403145227,"timestamp_updated":1523276909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.651919722557067871","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10520730","author":{"steamid":"76561198065388827","num_games_owned":448,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":747,"last_played":1401133168},"language":"english","review":"Best Bioshock,  reinvented the series.
