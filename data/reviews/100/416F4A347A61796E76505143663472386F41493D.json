This is a review of the Deleted Scenes campaign only. The content/replayibility score does take in other modes however.\n\n[b]The Great:[/b]\n++N/A\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+Sound design's actually somewhat decent with some really punchy weapon effects and half-decent environmental effects\n+There's something oddly enjoyable about Gold Source's engine despite its annoying quirks. I honestly can't put my finger on it, but I'm sure plenty of people can relate.\n+There's some bonus levels outside of the campaign\n+The combat isn't totally without its' merits\n\n[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]\n+-The devs actually managed to do some impressive things with the engine. Animating dead bodies to look like true ragdoll as in other games for one, and animating crumpling paper and crushing boxes for some more. I don't know how they managed to do some of it on the engine, but it actually does a good job of mimicking\nreal physics. It absolutely doesn't save this game's presentation, though.\n-+The voice acting isn't the worst thing in the world but it's certainly not good, and the phony accents don't help\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n-If you're below 25 health, all you can really do is pray to the RNG gods that both the enemy will decide to miss you and that your weapons will be accurate, which aren't often the case. So sometimes you'll go around a corner and die over and over until you get lucky and the enemies decide to miss and your bullets\ndecide to hit where you're aiming.\n-Hit detection is awful, and I know I'm not mistaking it for inaccurate weaponry\n-Reload animations are annoyingly long\n-Movement is as slippery as Half-Life's, but much slower. Given how many thin ledges and platforming is required from you, I have to wonder who thought giving the character roller-skates was a good idea.\n-The campaign is very short. Under 4 hours even on Hard. There are some bonus maps, however.\n-Enemy placement is BS sometimes, but especially on the last level\n-There is no story. There are settings and objectives for each level, but they're totally self-contained.\n-It's barely a challenge for at least half the game, but then the enemy placements get more annoying and it starts kicking your butt some more\n-Music's forgettable\n-The stealth sections work about as well as you'd expect on this engine. Thankfully, they're rare and cheese-able.\n\n[b]The Horrible:[/b]\n--This game came out in 2004... two thousand and fucking four. Yet, it barely looks better than the original Half-Life, which ALREADY looked out of date 6 years ago! To compare this game visually to Half-Life 2, Doom 3, Thief Deadly Shadows, or, you know, ANY game released in 2004, is like comparing the U.S. healthcare\nto any other first-world country -- it's nothing but a laughing stock.\n--Counter-Strike's trademark nonsensical, ridiculous recoil system made playing this more and more annoying. It's often up to RNG as to whether you'll actually hit anything thanks to random weapon spread mixed with strong recoil. Sometimes you can get two easy headshots without a problem, and sometimes you'll miss\neven with your crosshair clearly right on their head and even shots point blank at their body. It's just absurd.\n--Incredibly repetitive. Shoot similar types of braindead enemies over and over while planting a bomb or pulling out a gadget every now and then.\n\nSound: 5.5/10\nGraphics: 2/10\nGameplay: 4/10\nContent/Replayability: 8/10\nOverall: 4.5/10\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nNot a dreadful experience, but I can't recommend it. Good for a nostalgia trip if you played this at the time, or just to kill a few hours, but that's about it. I'm sure you have better things to do and games to waste your life on. I don't, that's why I bothered to finish it.","timestamp_created":1603254176,"timestamp_updated":1603254176,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77860796","author":{"steamid":"76561198346995069","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":362,"last_played":1609867616},"language":"russian","review":"кожаные штаны","timestamp_created":1603183200,"timestamp_updated":1603183200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77850553","author":{"steamid":"76561198981717440","num_games_owned":1000,"num_reviews":144,"playtime_forever":5437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3029,"last_played":1649531873},"language":"polish","review":"CS Singleplayer?\nwat.","timestamp_created":1603159596,"timestamp_updated":1603159596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77846384","author":{"steamid":"76561197999999537","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1637,"last_played":1603151887},"language":"spanish","review":"uwu","timestamp_created":1603151408,"timestamp_updated":1603151408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77818479","author":{"steamid":"76561198173339691","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":243,"last_played":1635289723},"language":"english","review":"i want a better counter strike campaign. this will do. kinda fucked up that they made a mission based on a real terrorist attack in japan. 8/10","timestamp_created":1603124012,"timestamp_updated":1603124012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527777791023254395","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77777235","author":{"steamid":"76561199070870021","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":224,"last_played":1625907878},"language":"russian","review":"четко","timestamp_created":1603048155,"timestamp_updated":1603048155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77768344","author":{"steamid":"76561198047932072","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":116,"playtime_forever":47,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1590942046},"language":"english","review":"Cool game.

Görevler klasik savaş oyunları gibi rehine kurtarma, bölge temizleme, gizlilik, kaçış sekansları, pusu kurma, bomba imha etme ve çeşitli operasyonlardan ibaret. Asıl önemli olan tüm bu görevleri yaparken oyunun bize sunduğu atmosferik ve mekaniksel çeşitlilik. ''Turtle Rock Studios'' bunların hepsini atmosferi çeşitlendiren birbirinden farklı harita konumları [i] (Orta Doğu, Filipinler, Rusya, Letonya, Kolombiya, İtalya, Okyanus açıkları, Arjantin, Asya, Amerika, Kuzey İrlanda vs.) [/i] ve çeşitli oynanış mekanikleri [i] (Uzaktan kumandalı bomba kullanma, kaynak makinesi ile kilit eritme, telsiz ile takımımızla irtibat halinde kalma ve yardım isteme, önemli olayların fotoğraflarını çekme, gece görüşü ile gizlilik sekansları, fiber optik kamera vs.) [/i] ile sağlamış. Condition Zero Deleted Scenes, klasik CS 1.6 mantığından fazlasıyla uzaklaşmış ve durum oyuna artı olarak yansımış. Grafiksel açıdan pek bir değişiklik olmasa da silahların kullanış biçimleri [i] (Her silah farklı ve daha tok hissettiriyor.) [/i] çok daha oturaklı olmuş.  Bunların yanı sıra düşman çeşitliliği arttırılmış [i] (Bıçaklı ve klasik silahlı düşmanlar, keskin nişancılar, taretliler, canlı bombalar, çete liderleri vs.) [/i] ve düşmanların rütbelerine göre yapay zekaları ve kullandıkları silahların kalitesi veya hasarı artıyor.\n\n[b] SONUÇ [/b]\n\nYanlış hatırlamıyorsam ''Condition Zero'' gibi bu oyun da CS 1.6'yı satın aldığımda yanında bedava geldi. Yani indirimlerde bu 3 ayrı oyun neredeyse 1 liraya kadar düşüyor. Valve'ın oyunlarını, en azından Counter-Strike oyunlarını seviyorsanız ve kısa kısa süren tadımlık hikayeler deneyimlemek istiyorsanız sizin için birebir.

de Counter Strike: Condition zero (Deleted Scenes)\nTengo dos sentimientos sobre este juego clasico, primera de amor y luego odio, el juego es increible de inicio a fin tiene gran banda sonora y efectos de audios como una gran variedad de armas, la historia bueno es normal, terroristas vs antiterroristas, sin embargo tengo 5 puntos negativos del juego.\n1: El juego ABUSA de poner enemigos detras de puntos no visibles para el jugador y que aumenta conforme el juego pasa lo que hace que estes muy pendiente de todo aunque siempre habra o un francotirador o un enemigo que te apunte y si tienes poca vida tienes que reaccionar rapido, almenos con el franco tienes unos segundos para reaccionar.\n2: El bug del arma al morir es LO PEOR cuando te matan en una batalla (en plataforma pc y esto me ocurrio en todo le juego) al respawnear el arma vaciaba el cargador o disparaba sin parar hasta que cambias de arma y ahi se detiene y llega a ser muy frustante tener que perder balas asi o tener que cargar partida.\n3: las ultimas 3 misiones, el juego inicio muy bien, mapas que no se repiten y sientes que cada mision es beuna pero las ultimas 3, y en especificos las ultimas 2 son abres puerta matas a 15 enemigos y continuas y matas a otros 10 enemigos y te disparan de la nada, y la mayoria llevando armas pesadas, es absurdo la cantidad de enemigos que llega a haber por zona y es donde peor me lo pase y di gracias cuando termino el juego, prefiero jugar 10 veces las primeras misiones que 1 vez mas la ultima (por mucho que sea la mision final es absurdo los cientos de enemigos, es un sin sentido)\n4: LOS LANZACOHETES DAÑAN LA EXPERIENCIA DEL JUEGO PORQUE SON ENEMIGOS CON AIM DE HACKER, abres puerta y boom cohetaso en la cara y algunas veces es de manera tan descarada que te matan casi enseguida, entiendo que le da realismo pero daña el gameplay al ser tan pero tan absurdo su apuntado al jugador, es el peor enemigo del juego.\n5: las coberturas en ciertas misiones dan asco, se que es un counter pero dios no hay zona para cubrirse de manera decente por un momento, eso y que en las ultimas misiones me venian de seguido 3 o 4 enemigos de la nada sin siquiera darme tiempo a ver donde estan.\nAun asi es un buen juego, si compraste el paquete de valve, no pierdes nada en jugar este juego, me lo pase en 6 horas y a excepcion de la ultima 2 horas, el resto es puro disfrute con buenas misiones, armas y escenarios. \nRecomiendo el juego si quieres estar un fin de semana jugando aparte de que corre en cualquier pc. pero intenta comprarlo en con el paquete de juegos de valve o en una oferta muy grande. \nNota final: 6/10 (Perdonen las faltas ortograficas y gracias por leer).","timestamp_created":1601778758,"timestamp_updated":1601779004,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76995877","author":{"steamid":"76561198812070945","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":33,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1586620885},"language":"english","review":"half
