Requiere unos requisitos muy light, podrás jugarlo sin problemas; si esperas unos gráficos híper realistas, siento decirte que no lo es (te recuerdo que el juego es del 98'), pero ni necesidad veo en ello, los que tiene son los originales, quedan fantásticamente y no te sacan del juego.

If anything, playing at 1440p today feels far more spacious and immersive  because the HUD was very boxed in when I played at SVGA (later in XGA with a PC upgrade) back then. The enemy AI was revolutionary back then where your opponents would take cover when under fire from you or if you threw a grenade their way and the AI holds somewhat well today though the scientist and security NPCs can be rather clumsy, especially in doorways or tight corridors. The arsenal of weapons was just as memorable though back in the day I had a Heckler & Koch MP5 as the first weapon under the \"3\" key whereas now it appears to be a Colt M4. Even though you have to use it sparingly due to the scarcity of ammo, the Tau Cannon is still my favourite weapon and I grinned like an idiot again more than two decades later using it in the battle against the HECU Apache by the dam.\nPuzzles and finding ways to traverse the environment are still fun in this game though this modern version feels somewhat bugged as the jump pads don't launch you until you press jump, nor can you move as freely in mid-air as I remembered so many years ago.\nPlaying and enjoying Half-Life again as I did the first time so many years ago make me glad that nostalgia didn't blind me as the game's mechanics still hold up brilliantly. If you are into FPSs from the 1990s, this is one you should give serious thought to buying if you don't have it in your library already.","timestamp_created":1579969173,"timestamp_updated":1579969173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62390870","author":{"steamid":"76561198843606965","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27,"last_played":1599689555},"language":"turkish","review":"tren sahnesi geldi kapattım","timestamp_created":1579968183,"timestamp_updated":1579968183,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.441640377044677734","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62386698","author":{"steamid":"76561198884213402","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1580148255},"language":"russian","review":"норм игра","timestamp_created":1579963716,"timestamp_updated":1579963716,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62385791","author":{"steamid":"76561197975425295","num_games_owned":641,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":827,"last_played":1606568818},"language":"german","review":"Wow das Spiel ist der Hammer.
