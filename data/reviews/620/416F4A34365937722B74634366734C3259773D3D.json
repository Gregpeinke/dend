I played the first Portal years ago quite eagerly, enjoyed it thoroughly. When I found out that one of my all-time favorite games was getting a sequel, I was stoked. And boy, did this game blow me away. Significantly longer than the first game, with a much more in-depth story and a couple more incredible characters, Portal 2 was exceptional. Don't know why I took so long to review it, but here I am. The co-op mode is incredibly fun, obviously the story isn't as invested as the single player mode. \nIt's a bit frustrating if you're trying to play with someone that isn't particularly co-operative, which is counterintuitive, I know. But the gestures help if you're playing without a mic. I love the options to create maps, though I haven't made many myself, all the ones on my account were made by my brother.\nAmazing game, amazing story, great graphics, enjoyable music. All in all, I'd definitely give this game a 10/10, looking forward to playing through it again sometime soon.","timestamp_created":1477812505,"timestamp_updated":1477812505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26309208","author":{"steamid":"76561198087983517","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1498980571},"language":"schinese","review":"创意满分，不可错过的佳作","timestamp_created":1477812268,"timestamp_updated":1477812268,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26308748","author":{"steamid":"76561198227183960","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":96,"playtime_forever":1413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":629,"last_played":1597140618},"language":"english","review":"Cartoon Network's \"Hole In the Wall\" but with two murderous robots.","timestamp_created":1477810190,"timestamp_updated":1578710507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26306049","author":{"steamid":"76561198282645269","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2128,"last_played":1658187848},"language":"brazilian","review":"Game fantástico.

Мы обе наговорили много такого, о чем ты еще пожалеешь. Но сейчас мы должны забыть про наши разногласия. Ради науки... Ты чудовище.[/h1]\n\n[b]Portal 2[/b] — это великолепный пример того, как надо делать сиквелы. На фоне короткой и скучноватой первой части второй портал выглядит просто великолепно. Разработчикам удалось взять все лучшие черты [url=steamcommunity.com/id/dele1996/recommended/400/]Portal[/url] и добавить колоссальное количество качественных нововведений.\n\nСюжет хоть и является продолжением первой части, однако показывает куда большее разнообразие, рассказывая историю прошлого лаборатории Aperture и её главного учёного. Атмосфера на высоком уровне. Особенно это заметно в начале, когда проходишь мимо мусора, оставшегося от разрушенного комплекса, осознавая свою ответственность за это. Музыка тоже хороша. Качественное улучшение получила озвучка Гладос, которая теперь ближе к оригинальной. Гладос во многом раскрывается как персонаж именно благодаря голосу, который вроде как и безэмоциональный, но очень ярко выражает мысли и чувства искусственного интеллекта. Характерный для серии юмор, кстати, тоже прилагается. Добавили несколько новых персонажей, которые органично вписываются в сюжет. Появились новые способы эксплуатировать законы физики (отталкивающий и ускоряющий гель, выкидные пластины, лазеры, лунная пыль), а вместе с ними изменились и головоломки, которые теперь в большей части игры выходят за стены тестовых камер. Зубодробительно сложные и однообразные ачивки заменили на несложные с интересными отсылками, пасхалками и маленькими интерактивными моментами, разбавляющими геймплей. И да, чуть не забыл, отличный кооператив со своей небольшой сюжетной линией, включающей в себя всё, что я перечислил выше.\n\n[b]Portal 2[/b], пожалуй, хорошо проявил себя по всем показателям. Мои аплодисменты, Valve. Вы умеете делать игры. И, более того, как показали [b]Portal 2[/b] и [b]Half-Life 2[/b], вы умеете делать хорошие сиквелы.\n\nМоя оценка: 10 из 10","timestamp_created":1477775889,"timestamp_updated":1477775951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26300634","author":{"steamid":"76561198085857323","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":442,"last_played":1477772543},"language":"english","review":"Good gameplay","timestamp_created":1477774175,"timestamp_updated":1477774175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26300440","author":{"steamid":"76561198045277824","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2169,"last_played":1480184928},"language":"english","review":"Honestly one of the best games I have ever played.","timestamp_created":1477773587,"timestamp_updated":1480185044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26300324","author":{"steamid":"76561198104696212","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":802,"last_played":1491853676},"language":"italian","review":"Fiero","timestamp_created":1477773204,"timestamp_updated":1477773204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26299941","author":{"steamid":"76561198240408082","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":483,"last_played":1612709844},"language":"english","review":"This game should be in your library!

(Lo mas importante y por lo que la mayoria de los juegos de valve destaca) su historia es impresionantemente buena (odio hacer muchos parentesis pero es necesario, necesitas rigurosamente jugar Portal para entender porque estas ahi) tratare de no hacer mucho spoiler, se trata de una inteligencia artificial llamada GLaDOS que despierta despues de que Wheatley (otra inteligencia artificial que cuida de los sujetos de prueba supuestamente) nos saque de nuestra criogenizacion, de la cual despertamos sin poder hablar (obiamente para mantener la inmercion).\n\n-La JUGABILIDAD: No es como tu juego de turno, ya que necesitas pensar y analizar la situacion para poder resolver los puzzles, la pistola de portales esta muy bien implementada ya que sera lo unico que tengas para resolver los niveles y por ese mismo motivo se vuelve aveces aburrido de que todos los niveles dependas de esta arma pero en fin se exploto muy bien por lo menos.\n\n-El SOUNDTRACK: Valve nunca decepciona en este apartado y este juego no es la excepcion, pues el soundtrack es muy bueno cualquier accion en el juego tiene musica y esa sensacion es indescriptible.\n\n-El APARTADO GRAFICO: Para el año que se hizo el juego, los graficos son buenos la verdad.\n\n=-EL VEREDICTO FINAL-=\nValve casi siempre cuando hace un juego con amor, cariño y ternura, y en este juego se nota mucho el amor que Valve le pone a sus juegos y por eso le doy un \n\n=;-Calificaciones-;=\n1-3 es un juego mehh...\n4-7 es medio bueno\n8-12 es exelente\n13-15 es exepcional\n\n\n14/15
