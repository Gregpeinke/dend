Give into the hype, because it's truly deserved in this case. Half-Life is a shoot-em-up, but at the same time it's so much more. The game has a compelling storytelling, but unlike other games, offers no cutscenes. The world is dynamic, with little easter eggs hidden everywhere, making the game much more immersive. The characters seem dynamic (although not as dynamic as in the sequel), with many enviormental voice lines tailored to fit lots of situations. The game is paced well, as is the entire series. It never feels repetative, it always finds a way to feel fresh. One of the best things that this game accomplishes that many other games fail at is that the weapon arsenal is large, but each weapon has its own unique purpose. For example, picking up a shiny new SMG won't make your pistol pointless, because the pistol still has better accuracy for picking off smaller enemies from a distance, while the SMG or Shotgun is better for \"run-n-gun\" tactics.\n\nThere is a mystery element to the game, too. It's the mystery of the [spoiler]mysterious man in the suit who is always watching. But who is this man?[/spoiler] That, my friend, will be very important later on............\n\n\n\n\nOh, and as a side benefit, you'll finally understand all of those \"HL3 Confirmed\" memes.","timestamp_created":1510709905,"timestamp_updated":1510709905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36520171","author":{"steamid":"76561198328272222","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":3061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":913,"last_played":1658886029},"language":"english","review":"Stahp","timestamp_created":1510697862,"timestamp_updated":1590111536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.428068011999130249","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36519502","author":{"steamid":"76561198151032330","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1443,"last_played":1632864827},"language":"english","review":"The Orginal Half-life that is to my knowledge the first game made by valve The story is well made and gameplay is great offering various degrees of difficulty for players.

This is a revolutionary game, there's no doubt about that. I of course recommend this game to anyone who's played Portal and wants to try the \"other half\" of the Aperture/Black Mesa rivalry, or just anyone who likes classic first person shooters and wants to experience a bit of PC gaming history.\nThere's just one major problem I have with Half-Life. I cannot finish it. I can't even bring myself to play it for more than ten minutes.\nIt's not because it's a bad game or anything. Honestly, I don't know exactly what the reason behind it is. But when I start up Half-Life and play it for a few minutes, a terrible migraine sets in. I get these unbearable headaches while playing these old FPS games. Maybe it's the graphics, or the old sound effects, or something else, but I don't have this problem playing classic 2D games like Super Metroid or Mario Bros, or newer FPS games like Fallout or Portal. It's happened with this game and with a few other classic shooters like DOOM and Duke Nukem 3D. I really don't have an explanation, so if anyone out there has a solution to this problem I would really appreciate being able to bring myself to finish this game without puking.","timestamp_created":1509516339,"timestamp_updated":1509598171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36183031","author":{"steamid":"76561198346280444","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":770,"last_played":1531700459},"language":"spanish","review":"Generico........................\n¬øqu√©?
