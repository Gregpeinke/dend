Старый, добрый сурс. Прыгаешь, ставишь порталы. Комнаты в принципе легкие. Игра проходится быстро за часа 3. Больше порадовало другое. В игре самобытный сеттинг и не дурное повествование. Персонаж один (Гладос), но мне дико зашел. Почти все монологи не нудные, не смотря на то, что с тобой по сути гугл ассистент говорит, а ближе к финалу можно пару рофлов словить. Еще тут неплохая атмосфера. Ты один, в непонятном пустом комплексе, наедине с голосом свыше и портальной пушкой, будучи лабораторной крысой, пытаешься выбраться из этой клетки, надеясь триумфально обмануть главгада.\nВ итоге получаем неплохой экспириенс и наслаждаемся тортом под прекрасный трек из титров. Для ачивментхантеров - они здесь легкие, но игру два раза пройти придется + бонусные уровни из меню.\n\nОценка игре - 7,5/10. Чего-то все таки не хватило.
