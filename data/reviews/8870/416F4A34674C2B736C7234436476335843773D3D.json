When you get Elizabeth she is no princess but someone with smarts that will help you through the game. She picks lock finds and gives u health ammo and salts during battle so you can like longer. She also finds money you may have missed. The vigors give you the ability to do special things like real in your opponents or burn them. You can only hold 2 weapons at once besides the melee which sucks but really the only bad thing about this game. Also Elizabeth can open things called tears which she can open so you can have a wall, turret, platform just to name a few. The final thing is THE SKYLINE!\nThe skyline is soooooooooo much fun.

Вроде и много всего хочется написать, а слов-то и нет. Все на месте (\"маяк, человек, город\") - закрученный и захватывающий сюжет с потрясающей (мягко говоря) концовкой, ворохом отличных персонажей и отменным экшеном. Ну и, конечно, Элизабет. Мало того, что сценаристы прописали ей просто шикарный характер и историю, программисты - почти идеальный ИИ, а художники - внешность, так мистер Левин решил вписать ее в, собственно, игровой процесс. Шустрая девчушка тягает главному герою боеприпасы, когда они заканчиваются, аптечки - когда шкала здоровья почти на нуле. Через час знакомства с ней, я думаю, любой нормальный человек к ней привяжется не на шутку. Такого раньше не было, что ни говори. В этом году уже была игра с девушкой, которая должна была стать прямо-таки живой, и которую мы, как нам обещалось, \"захотели бы защищать\", да еще и в главные роли - Tomb Raider. Но там все усилия художников, нарисовавших реально беззащитную девушку, были убиты об сценарий. Здесь же - иное. Когда идет бой - девчонка не мешается под ногами и помогает патронами, а когда настает время тихого изучения мира Колумбии - ходит вокруг и с интересом изучает все что видит, лопает сахарную вату пачками, отдыхает на скамейке - даже сматывается на танцы один раз. Конечно, здесь немаловажный факт играет само окружение. Прибытие в Колумбию - наверное, один из самых сильных моментов в видеоиграх, да и, наверное, то, за что мы их любим. Работа художников впечатляет. Нереально красиво и ярко. Приведя игрока в мир, казалось бы, утопии, разработчики проводят его через все круги ада. И посреди этого ада, творящегося вокруг - с нами всегда эта невинная девушка. Гениально. Сам мир Колумбии можно долго обсуждать, но лучше посмотреть один раз (минимум). BioShock - на редкость умная игра, которая пытается что-то сказать игроку. Вся система Колумбии - она как злобная карикатура, в которой сплелось множество элементов. Достается всем - и религии, и политике. Что-то подобное я последний раз видел в Deus Ex HR, но не таком уровне. Саундтрек, как обычно в играх Левина, помогает окунуться в мир и эпоху игры. Почти все композиции хоть сейчас в плеер. Сюжетный нарратив идеально выверен. Браво, мистер Кен Левин.","timestamp_created":1367010411,"timestamp_updated":1367010411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2997873","author":{"steamid":"76561198015659840","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1188,"last_played":1517168078},"language":"english","review":"My game of the year so far.

It is good. I will definately recommend it but I will say, wait a bit. Let the price fall a bit and then go for it. \nNow the reason I said the last bit is, for me anyway, it did feel a bit short and a wee bit hollow at times. The amont of NPC's in the area felt a wasted excercise. You could'nt interact with them. It gives the game the hollow feeling I said earlier. Don't get me wrong, they do give the game a more active and feeling of life than the previous Bioshock games where you only really saw people you had to dispatch in some ingenious or bullet ridden way. That of course is still there but with the amount of \"ordinary people\" in the areas, I feel an opportunity was missed to give little conversations you could have with them or even trade with.\nCharacters were also excellent I feel. The interaction beteen Booker (you) and Elizabeth was enjoyable and she herself is a great help within the game.\nMy other point is the length of the game. I have completed it and I did feel that the game ended quite quick. I did play it on Normal mode so I am going to play it again on a more difficult setting. \nI felt the combat very easy but fun to use. Combining the weapons with vigors, vigors with vigors and also throwing in the combat fun to be had on the skyrail kept me trying to invent new ways to dispatch my foes. Thinking back, most of the time that I was killed was through me concentrating too much on creating different ways to deal with the enemies.\nGraphically the game is beautiful. Due to my specs I played the game with medium settings and it still looked incredible. Audio is just as impressive.\nOverall, I would recommend the game but I will say it may leave you wanting more.

The consequence is that the game takes time to find its feet and is over too quickly. It doesn't have the same frightening atmosphere as the earlier Bioshock games until some of the latter stages, which is a bit disappointing, although Columbia is a breathtaking spectacle and the politics of the city are really important to the story.\n\nThe inclusion of salts as a proxy for plasmids is welcome, but their role in the city of Columbia isn't as crucial to the story as plasmids were to Rapture. They aren't completely plausible, even within the scope of a fantastical alternative reality, because the citizens of Columbia don't really use them. I think salts would tip the balance in favour of disorder if they were commonly used by the citizens of Columbia, and yet when order breaks down, it's not due to salts. \n\nAlthough some of the enemies in Bioshock Infinite are tough to kill, the greatest sense of peril is associated with losing some money upon 'death', so going into combat with empty pockets is paramount, but it somewhat kills the tension.\n\nBioshock Infinite did feel a bit too much like an animated story, rather than a game at times. I was so dumbfounded by the ending, that I wanted to replay it, in case I misheard something. I thought I knew what the writers were trying to say, but in the end, I wasn't even sure they knew. \n\nI enjoyed the game a great deal, but I think it could have been longer. The release of downloadable levels simultaneous with the game itself is just profiteering in my opinion. I might add that the lack of multiplayer is unforgiveable, and one of the reasons I'm feeling slightly bitter about the game.","timestamp_created":1366663921,"timestamp_updated":1366663921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6396958","author":{"steamid":"76561198065403633","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":4042,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1123,"last_played":1504665626},"language":"english","review":"Worth the weight","timestamp_created":1366661620,"timestamp_updated":1366661620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472242563962936401","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1188736","author":{"steamid":"76561197988817990","num_games_owned":602,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1313,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1086,"last_played":1463023226},"language":"english","review":"One of the most beautiful and amazing games i have played in a long time.

Much of the combat itself lacks any real inspiration or innovation over the previous games, mostly serving as filler as you advance through the story. A great game nonetheless, and worth a second playthrough to make sense of everything that seemed innocuous or irrelevant on the first time through.
