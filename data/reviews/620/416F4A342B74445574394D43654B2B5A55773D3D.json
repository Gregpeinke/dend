Having almost 100 hours in the game, I feel I can write a review on it. Portal 2 is one of those games that will stay with you for a long time, having a good story, a good ending, and good gameplay all the way through it. I would only recommend this game if you like puzzles or physics, as that is essentially this game. Puzzles with physics and Portals. The concept will never get old, I'm always thinking with portals thanks to this game. Hard to find good games anymore. If you indeed do like puzzles, physics, and breaking your mind every time you go through a portal, stop reading and get this game immediately.

Portal 2 uscito nel 2012 è un gioco che definire ben riuscito è quasi un eufemismo.\n\nIl gioco sarà sempre basato sull’utilizzo dei portali per completare il livello, ma nel corso del gioco avremo a che fare con nuove “invenzioni” della Aperture Science, che andranno a dipingere in modo sempre nuovo le camere test che andremmo ad affrontare, fornendoci modi sempre più nuovi e fantasiosi per completarle.\n\nSe c’era un punto ove Portal peccava, era la durata; ebbene Portal 2 in questo non si fa parlar dietro, in quanto la durata media di un intera campagna di Portal 2, è quasi il triplo del predecessore. \n\nPer quanto riguarda l’universo narrativo, vestiremo sempre i panni di Chell, questa volta in un futuro non meglio precisato, nel quale saremo nuovamente nei laboratori della Aperture Science, e questa volta nel corso della storia andremo a scoprire sempre nuovi dettagli su chi sia Glados, e su cosa sia l’Aperture Science, con un finale incredibile che oltre a dare delle risposte, ci farà porre nuovamente delle domande.\n\nMa l’aggiunta più grande di Portal 2 è senza dubbio il multiplayer, sia in locale split screen, sia online grazie alla lista amici, o con un perfetto sconosciuto. Ciò porta l ri-giocabilità di Portal 2 a livelli assurdi, non solo grazie all’enorme quantità di Achievemt proposti da Steam, che terranno occupati i più avvezzi al completamento assoluto, e che strapperanno u sorriso a tutti coloro che lo giocano solo per divertimento.\n\nIn conclusione, Portal 2 è senza dubbio un gioco incredibile e sicuramente ben fatto, che offre la giusta dose di sfida a chiunque desideri averne; lo consiglio ad ogni tipo di giocatore, che sia un amante della storia, del gameplay o della sfida.\n\nValutazione: 4.2/5\n","timestamp_created":1457869332,"timestamp_updated":1457869332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21810565","author":{"steamid":"76561198282173620","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":289,"last_played":1513956736},"language":"russian","review":"сойдёт","timestamp_created":1457863917,"timestamp_updated":1457863917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21810041","author":{"steamid":"76561198134510809","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":712,"last_played":1632777405},"language":"russian","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1457862114,"timestamp_updated":1457862114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21810013","author":{"steamid":"76561198118947001","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":879,"last_played":1658161566},"language":"russian","review":"Просто шедевр.
