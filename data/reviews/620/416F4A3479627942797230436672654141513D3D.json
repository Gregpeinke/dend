Because of this, I took the liberty of forgetting everything I know about the first game, all 300 hours of me playing and speedrunning it, and all 80 hours of me speedrunning the campaign of this game, and played through it as blind as possible.\n\nThe best parts about this game are it's story and dialogue. The graphics are good but you can't really compare it to anything because there's really nothing like it on this build of the Source engine besides CS:GO, but that game doesn't really look good compared to this. Great nonetheless.\n\nI won't go through the story because it's too long to read. If you're doubting your purchase, wait until it's on sale or watch some videos, preferably not about the solo or co-op campaigns in order to not have the story ruined. I recommend watching videos on the custom chambers/stories because they add so much to the game thanks to the built in authoring tools you get, both built into the game and the seperate Hammer editor, the same editor used to make the maps in the story.\n\nThroughout the game, you are put into some scenarios that require you to do some ninja moves, such as [spoiler] facing GLaDOS where the first core transfer happens [/spoiler] and [spoiler] the ending fight to do the second and final core transfer [/spoiler] (if you don't want the game spoiled don't look) but they're not really insane ninja moves. There's really no high difficulty to this. When I played through it the first time on XBox, I completed the game in a few combined hours, longer than PC because of controller issues. It's really not hard and that may be a turn off for the campaign, but custom chambers fix that difficulty itch.\n\nThe writers of this game deserve awards. I'm serious. The dialogue is the best in any campaign I've played, and yes, that's including GTA V. The dialogue alone for me was worth the $19.99 I spend on this game, twice (I have this game for XBox and PC).\n\nChallenge mode is back from the first game but without \"Least Steps,\" a challenging, careful, movement based challenge that made the game a real challenge outside the real game. But, at least the game now includes the challenge in one try. If you want to do a fast, least portals run, instead of timing that run seperately, you can run it and if you get a faster time than your run where you didn't care about the amount of portals used, it overwrites your time even though you were going for least portals. It's a time and pain saver. Bring back advanced challenges though.\n\nThat's all I'm going to say. If you want more, watch some videos, wait for a sale or a coupon, or just get the game, it's true it's one of the best games, if not, the best sequel to a game ever made.","timestamp_created":1365373227,"timestamp_updated":1502050537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5094172","author":{"steamid":"76561198044978614","num_games_owned":289,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2461,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":63,"last_played":1489607606},"language":"russian","review":"Не плохое продолжение оригинала, с прикольным сюжетом.

So würde ich Portal 2 in einem Wort beschreiben.\n\nPortal 2 ist meiner Meinung nach eines der besten oder vielleicht sogar das beste Spiel das ich je spielen durfte. Die Einzelspieler-Kampangne ist absolut genial und knüpft perfekt an die Geschichte des ersten Teils der Portal-Serie an. Witzige Dialoge, umwerfende Gameplay-Elemente und das Portal-Prinzip ist ja an sich schon fantastisch und bringt frischen Wind in das Puzzle-Genre. Auch die Co-op-Story ist makellos, und die Tatsache, dass man von diesem absolut brillianten Spielprinzip nun auch gemeinsam Gebrauch machen kann, ist atemberaubend.\nEs ist nicht übertrieben, zu sagen, dass dieses Spiel mit all seinen Aspekten vollends überzeugen kann. Ich danke Valve, den Entwicklern, die mit diesem Computerspiel ein weiteres Meisterwerk geschaffen haben.\n\nEs darf auch nicht unerwähnt bleiben, dass es fast schon eine Pflicht ist, den Vorgänger Portal zu spielen. Zum einen, weil man so die Story versteht, und zum anderen, um auch in Genuss dieses tollen Puzzle-Shooters zu kommen.\n\nAbschließend ist zu sagen, dass ich jedem Gamer Portal 2 empfehle, weil es einfach in keiner Spielesammlung fehlen darf. :)","timestamp_created":1364428615,"timestamp_updated":1364428615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3845649","author":{"steamid":"76561198028059343","num_games_owned":599,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1593,"playtime_last_two_weeks":441,"playtime_at_review":1152,"last_played":1660522522},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I have ever played","timestamp_created":1364423454,"timestamp_updated":1364423454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6899840","author":{"steamid":"76561198078872212","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":764,"last_played":1473725468},"language":"english","review":"Deep storyline, perfect amount of campaigning, physics intense puzzle solving","timestamp_created":1364415411,"timestamp_updated":1364415411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7053055","author":{"steamid":"76561198084196460","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2334,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":866,"last_played":1578092575},"language":"english","review":"The best game ever made!","timestamp_created":1364412492,"timestamp_updated":1364412492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3421879","author":{"steamid":"76561198022411274","num_games_owned":346,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":529,"last_played":1471547291},"language":"spanish","review":"Superior en todos los aspectos al primero, con extra de humor negro.","timestamp_created":1364398336,"timestamp_updated":1364398336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2413638","author":{"steamid":"76561198006982430","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1000,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":624,"last_played":1377825179},"language":"english","review":"Just as good, if not better, than the first Portal.
