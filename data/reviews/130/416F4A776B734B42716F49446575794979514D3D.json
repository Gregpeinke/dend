CURTO, POREM ÓTIMO! [/h1]\n\nFoi a DLC que menos curti, mas ainda sim é divertido. \nFiquei quase umas 2 horas com o jogo aberto sem fazer nada nele, então ao todo ele ficaria com 3 horas +/- . Não tem chefões nesse jogo, o que é um ponto negativo vendo que ele é feito pela Gearbox, a mesma que fez Opposing Force, que não é tão grande quando o Half Life 1, mas é igualmente completo quanto a armas e ter um chefão. As armas são outro ponto negativo, são as mesmas que vimos em Half Life. \nUm outra coisa que me incomoda são os jumpscares, ele tem MUITOS, mas MUITO mesmo. Em Half Life eles são colocados em pontos estratégicos que fazem sentido, já em Blue Shift eles são colocados em qualquer lugar, e que fica na cara que é só pro momento \"Pegadinha do Mario Games!\", as vezes previsíveis, mas tome cuidado com os cantos estreitos seguidos de curvas.\nNo geral é uma expansão sem coisas novas, curta, mas ainda sim divertida. Os seus erros são mais pela repetição de coisas e falta de novidades. Mesmo assim recomendo, já que comprar o pacote com o Half Life e suas DLCs não é tão caro, e te da mais conteúdo desse jogo.

Blue Shift is a pretty fun, but short and bite-sized expansion to Half-Life. This is more understandable when you know that this was originally supposed to be apart of the cancelled SEGA Dreamcast port for Half-Life. Nontheless, I only have this due to buying the Half-Life complete bundle, and I'd recommend that's where you get it to. Blue Shift is not, in my opinion, worth the money by itself. I'm still gonna give it a \"Yes\" recommendation because it's not bad by any means, but it's doesn't really expand on Half-Life all that much like Opposing Force did. Also the game has no real \"final boss\", I won't spoil the ending but don't expect to be fighting the Ninilanth or anything like that.\n\nThough I'm gonna have to deduct a few points because this expansion brought along with it the horribly cursed HD model pack.\n\nCheers.","timestamp_created":1659686361,"timestamp_updated":1659686361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120091529","author":{"steamid":"76561198422093918","num_games_owned":356,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":121,"last_played":1657626035},"language":"english","review":"If only my shifts as an actual guard were as short as this DLC.

This part of the HL1 saga puts you in the shoes of Barney Calhoun, everyone's favorite Black Mesa security guard who plays a more prominent role as one of the loveable characters of Half Life 2 in that game. But this expansion is a bit of a step down compared to Opposing force. It's still a very solid expansion, but worse nontheless. The role of a security guard is a less interesting perspective than the previous two, and there aren't really any new weapons or enemies introduced. Towards the end of the campaign you also visit Xen, but it's a lot more bearable than in the first game because it removes a lot of the annoying platforming. Despite some of the obvious similarities, it maintains the amazing worldbuilding, atmosphere, puzzles, and music that you can expect in a Half Life game. So if you're a fan of classic goldsource Half Life games then this should provide a short and sweet little taste of that for you, that I can easily reccommend to FPS fans.","timestamp_created":1659311450,"timestamp_updated":1659311450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580419540405273438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119848871","author":{"steamid":"76561198014668744","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1659296457},"language":"english","review":"Cool little Half-Life DLC that's practically over in a flash.
