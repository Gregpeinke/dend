Chell makes her way through old, rotting test chambers of Aperture that bring back a hint of nostalgia from the first game as she is accompanied by her chatty friend Wheatly, a personality core. Soon Chell and Wheatly meet GLaDOS again and all hell breaks loose as Chell is tossed into the underbelly of Aperture Laboratories where she is forced to scratch and claw her way to the surface in order to survive and prevent the lab from melting down. Along the way Chell learns about Aperture Laboratories' shady past, possible hints about her past, and many more secrets.\n\nPortal 2 is a crescendo of comedy, tragedy, and challenging puzzles that takes pages out of the legend of Prometheus. Combined, all these elements make an incredibly smart, tough, and funny masterpiece of a game that should be experienced by all.\n\nPortal 2 is the only game I have played start to finish without stopping and every frustrating second was worth it.

Awesome plot twists and amazing puzzles! \n\nThe co-op game is super fun as well! The possibility of bounding with your science partner through various gestures is honestly the greatest! Also the possibility of downloading user-chambers from the workshop makes the fun last even longer!\n\nAll in all, if you buy this game buy it for the main story! It is rarely I play a game which I fall in love with this much! Wonderful character development and plot! \n\nAnd also, the cake is still a lie!

Es ist so gut, man hat das Gefühl dass man einen kleinen Teil des Himmels erletbt hat. Man will nichts anderes als Portal 2 mehr haben. Es ist die digitalisierte Perfektion. Man Empfehlung: KAUFEN!

Even with a terrible computer like mine, it runs as smooth as a ball rolling down a hallway coated in oil. Graphics are amazingly stunning, Gameplay is sure to be unforgotten. Definetly gonna be a classic that is never forgotten. Like pacman and pong. Makes your brain fucntion for once, but very funny storyline lets your brain cool off. 5 stars all in all","timestamp_created":1371960180,"timestamp_updated":1387933500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0t/Mt78Ce4yaGg=="}
