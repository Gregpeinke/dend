Это был обычный майский день, который особо не должен отличаться от остальных, типичные серые будни ученых. И вот Гордон уже едет на монорельсовом поезде в лабораторию аномальных материалов, опрокидывая своим вдумчивым взглядом исследовательский центр Черной Мезы. Сегодня ему предстоит принять участие в очередном эксперименте с недавно полученным образцом именуемым GG-3883. Гордон проводит математические расчеты в голове, но ему порой мешают образы с его ночного кошмара, словно что-то пошло не так, и целый инопланетный мир вторгся на землю. Нет, это дурной сон, ведь что может пойти не так…\n\nSource версия – переиздание оригинальной игры от самих разработчиков, переведенная на более современную версию движка Source (по тем меркам). Графически игра мало чем изменилась в сравнении с оригиналом, да, изменения все же есть, но их можно пересчитать по пальцам. Больше всего изменения коснулись физики игры, взаимодействие с объектами, рэгдолл и многое другое. Кто-то скажет, изменений на самом деле достаточно много, но их заметит лишь истинные знатоки серии, обычный же игрок найдет не много отличий. А вот чего действительно много, это багов. Я наслышан о большом количество глюков, но мне же повезло, и единственным багом для меня оказалась неуязвимость для зеленых, острых, тентаклей. Но другим везло куда меньше, и доходило вплоть до того, что нельзя было пройти игру. Не открывались двери, не срабатывали скрипты, и просто неуязвимые враги. Можно с уверенностью сказать, что народ не особо полюбил эту версию игры, но все они скажут, что она с одной семьи Half-Life, просто не очень умный сын.\n\nПокупать ли ее вам? Если у вас нет оригинала, то лишь на свой страх и риск. Вам может повезет, как и мне, и вы удачно пройдете игру, получите удовольствие, а может и нет. В таком случае, лучше возьмите и поиграйте в оригинал.
