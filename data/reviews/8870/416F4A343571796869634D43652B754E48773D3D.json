A few months ago, my friend let me borrow his PS3 copy of BioShock Infinite, which included the first game on the disc. I played through BioShock, and it was pretty fun, but I don't think it deserves a Metascore of 96. Then I played BioShock Infinite, and what I got was completely unexpected. But before I get into why I like the game, I want to get the rest of it out of the way. I really enjoyed the first playthrough, but I didn't want to keep it from my friend too long so I gave it back. When the Steam Winter sale rolled along, I saw this game was on sale for $10 and the season pass was only $5. Since I wasn't able to play the DLC on a borrowed copy, I decided to buy it for myself on PC along with the season pass. I was not impressed with the visuals of the PS3 version, but the lighting and water effects on the PC version are fantastic. Now the actual game... The gameplay is great, but what really shines in Infinite is the story. It's not too short and not too long, taking me 8 hours to beat (on my second playthrough), but the developers really focused on quality over quantity. The ending of the game is beyond description. It is the best ending I have ever seen in a video game, even better than Portal 2's ending. It not only surpasses Portal 2's ending, it blows it away. Even though I had already finished it, I beat the game earlier today, and I was just lying down trying to fall asleep and all I could think about was the fantastic ending. I guess now I am going to start playing the DLC. Here's hoping that has a great ending, too.\nEdit: I just finished Burial at Sea Episode One and the ending was amazing.","timestamp_created":1387617292,"timestamp_updated":1387746623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8162515","author":{"steamid":"76561198094050663","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":252,"last_played":1436571428},"language":"english","review":"sjukligt bra spel\n","timestamp_created":1387617250,"timestamp_updated":1387617250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8161948","author":{"steamid":"76561198060872566","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":913,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1474820950},"language":"english","review":"Awesome","timestamp_created":1387615061,"timestamp_updated":1387615061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8161910","author":{"steamid":"76561198098067040","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":454,"last_played":1388071604},"language":"english","review":"very goood game","timestamp_created":1387614889,"timestamp_updated":1387614889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8161583","author":{"steamid":"76561198094352963","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":529,"last_played":1397777408},"language":"english","review":"awesome game!","timestamp_created":1387613511,"timestamp_updated":1387613511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8161382","author":{"steamid":"76561198089000993","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2417,"last_played":1550848648},"language":"thai","review":"เป็นเกมที่ทำเนื้อเรื่องเเละ gameplay ได้ดีมาก\nบรรยกาศเเละสภาพเเวดล้อมทั้งหมดทำได้ออกมาดีมากๆจนน่าตะลึง\nผมเล่นจบไป 5 รอบเเล้วยังรู้สึกว่าเล่นกี่ทีก็ยังประทับใจไม่เปลี่ยนไป\n10\\10","timestamp_created":1387612580,"timestamp_updated":1407076776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8161092","author":{"steamid":"76561198062033154","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":427,"last_played":1388039239},"language":"english","review":"Super complicated storyline, a lot of \"What?

The story consists of plot twists for no reason other than to have plot twists, regardless of the mess it makes of the narrative, or what messages it ends up conveying. One character has the special ability to literally tear holes in the plot. As the \"alternate universes\" angle comes in, any reason to care about the characters goes out the window - if they're all alternate versions, with alternate realities, why care about any of them? Why is one reality/timeline objectively better, or more valid, than any other? \n\nOn top of that, the gameplay is frankly boring. It does absolutely nothing to advance the shooter genre - on the contrary it's bland and derivative. \n\nIt is VERY pretty though, I'll give it that.\n\n------SPOILERS BELOW------\n\nWhen I say \"The story consists of plot twists for no reason other than to have plot twists, regardless of the mess it makes of the narrative, or what messages it ends up conveying\" I'm referring to the Vox Populi turning on you.\n\nThe game starts out with the premise that you're fighting against some really awful people, really vile racists and bigots. By introducing the plot twist that you must now fight the Vox Pop, though the developers almost certainly did not intend it, what their game is now saying is \"You know who the REAL evil people are? They're not really the oppressors, they're the downtrodden minorities!\" It's an absurd position to take, and it's an absurd situation to be in. There is no justification for having to fight the people you've been fighting to save, other than it being a hackneyed \"shocking\" plot twist just for the sake of having a plot twist.\n\nYou can tell that at least one person at 2K had an inkling that this might be the case because before you have to fight them the Vox Pop are mostly black folks, but you only ever fight Irish folks. You can tell because it would make the offensive absurdity of the situation starkly obvious if the second half of the game was all about massacring black people!\n\n\"Fuck minorities, up with Whitey\" obviously wasn't what 2K had in mind when they set out to make this game. But because whoever wrote the plot didn't stop and think that is what their creation says.\n\nThen there's simple, silly things it does to the plot. We jump through a portal into an alternate universe after failing to save the weapons dealer. Ok, so how does it help anything at all to defeat Comstock in this new universe? We've still left behind a universe where he wins. Why is this new universe objectively any different?\n\nWhy does Booker ultimately drowning himself change anything at all? He's just ONE iteration of Booker; why does the death of that universe's Booker have any impact on any others?","timestamp_created":1387604225,"timestamp_updated":1451560082,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475663155317306519","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8159463","author":{"steamid":"76561198091460606","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":458,"last_played":1477232458},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра","timestamp_created":1387604034,"timestamp_updated":1387604034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8158746","author":{"steamid":"76561198055547020","num_games_owned":595,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50,"last_played":1391980480},"language":"english","review":"Graphics are amazing and the story is indepth and latches onto you until you complete the game.","timestamp_created":1387600833,"timestamp_updated":1387600833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8158643","author":{"steamid":"76561198025801310","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1954,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1495,"last_played":1397416487},"language":"brazilian","review":"Você nota que o jogo é uma obra prima quando seus defeitos são praticamente obliterados por sua grandiosidade e qualidade.\nO gameplay pode se tornar massante e cansativo em diversos momentos do jogo, mas a força da narrativa e o desenvolvimento dos personagens te fazem ignorar essa pequena falha rumo a um dos melhores finais (se não o melhor) da história dos jogos.\n\nA direção de arte do jogo é juntamente com a de Dishonored (que teve claras influências no próprio Bioshock) a melhor dos últimos anos.

Враги очень тупые, просто сами подставляются под хедшоты, какой-то интерес представляют только вОроны да силачи. Город наводнен плазмидами-тониками, а кроме парочки видов врагов их никто не использует.\nТы просто идешь и стреляешь вперед - очень сильно в этом плане игра напоминает КоД.
