Начнём с простого. Графика, ИИ и геймплей были очень хорошими для 1998 года. Не только в очевидных достоинствах кроется истинная суть популярности \"Периода Полураспада\". Взгляните на любую другую игру тех лет, и спросите сами себя, так ли сильно вы в неё погрузились как в мир \"Халвы\"? Правильным ответом будет НЕТ. Игра с самого начала и до конца выдерживает в себе рамки, практически полного погружения. Кат-сцена из начала игры с поездом этому поспособствовала. Ты едешь в вагоне, видишь, смотришь на то что происходит вокруг - погружаешься в мир и атмосферу жизни \"Чёрной Мезы\". Когда игрок от лица Гордона Фримена даёт начало каксадному резонансу, игрок чувствует ответсвенность, ведь то, что случилось, вина за происходящее лежит на Гордоне - игроке. Игра имеет свою философию. Для 1998 года эта игра стала ШЕДЕВРОМ и побудила мир начать относиться к компьютерным играм как к полноценному искусству.","timestamp_created":1660330916,"timestamp_updated":1660330916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120512457","author":{"steamid":"76561198322072088","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1244,"last_played":1608838002},"language":"english","review":"The game is great, I personally love the nostalgic feel of it.

Half Life is a classic, and every true fan of FPS should play it. Yes, graphics and game mechanics are dated (and the GoldSRC engine has some weird bugs, especially after quicksaving), but it's a game from the 90's. Computers had a lot less to work with then. AI can be goofy too (especially when marines frag themselves with their own grenades), but enemies still pose a challenge.\n\nI've always liked 90's shooters. Half Life is no exception. Half Life  blends strategy and fast paced movement. You are rewarded for planning ahead, using cover effectively, and utilizing your full arsenal (like planting traps with laser mines, or using the guass to bounce shots off walls or blast guys behind cover). Some of the Xen levels drag a bit but overall it's good fun.\n\nAll in all, this is a must-play. It all began here, in the halls of Black Mesa. Go hit some headcrabs with a crowbar.\n\nP.S. As a Linux gamer, I really appreciate that Valve has made so many titles playable on Linux.

To half life. Gra która stworzyła współczesne shootery. Nadal warto w nią zagrać. Gameplay, nie zestarzał się ani trochę i nadal jest wyjątkowo świeży. Fakt że wiele broni ma pod prawym zamiast przybliżenia drugą funkcję, duża różnorodność arsenału, i wiele typów wrogów. Do tego dochodzi oprawa dźwiękowa broni, i strzelanie nadal jest taką samą zabawą jak dwadzieścia lat temu. Poziomy i rozdziały w większości są naprawdę fajne. Black Mesa jest ciekawym miejscem do zwiedzania, dzięki swojemu rozkładowi, postaciami, rozmieszczeniem wrogów i atmosferze każdej części Black Mesy. Jedyny problem z poziomami miałem na końcu, ostatnie dwa rozdziały się dla mnie ciągnęły i czuły się takie ehhh. I ostatni rozdział z bossem był dobry, ale nie aż tak jak chciałbym by był, czuł się za prosty i ciągłe teleportowanie irytowało. Fabuła jest w mojej opinii silną częścią jedynki, i jest genialnie opowiedziana nam w butach największego szefa ffps, Doktora Freemana. Valve dał nam pełną kontrolę, nie zabierał nas, dla przykładu, do animacji że most się zapadał, tylko kiedy most sie zapadał, zapadał się, tak samo jest z historią. Nie mówi się nam bezpośrednio ale pokazuje, i zostawia się to dla nas byśmy sami to zinterpretowali. Jedyne co się postarzało, to grafika. Gra kosztuje grosze, dała mi 16 godzin dobrej zabawy. Jeśli nie grałeś, to na co czekasz.
