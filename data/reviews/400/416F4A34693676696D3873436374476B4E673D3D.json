Every puzzle is fun and range anywhere from easy to mind bendingly hard. The pacing is great, as you go on the game teaches you about its machanics step by step never throwing you in a confusing situation and ensuring you know how to use them. No lengthy decription, no button layouts, just short expoision from Glados and the games natural learning curve. The difficulty of his game is also well paced.\n\nThe story is very simple, but the game makes up for that with everything else. From the start of the game, the clean, bright, Apple inpired, art style perfectly complimates the the sence of humor. You're main guide Glados is tuants and teaches you throughout the game, she talks completely innocently and caually, but she (and Apature science as a whole) is completely sociopathic. This dark sense of humor is extremely well done. The pacing is also brilliant, as you move on through the test chambers the true nature of Apature sciecnes is slowely revealed to you, cryptic messages left behind can be found, and Glados' comments become darker and darker. The main character Chell has literally no character development or dialog, but that is arguably good becuase it makes it feel like Glados is talking directly to you, not just a character you are controing. \n\nEverthing in this game is memorable, the brilliant game machanics, the turrets, the graphics, and of course, Glados herself. I would recomend Portal to absolutely everyone as it is a truely unique experience and perhpas one of the greatest video games ever created.","timestamp_created":1422760594,"timestamp_updated":1422760594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14271894","author":{"steamid":"76561198120262265","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":153,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":153,"last_played":1422756340},"language":"brazilian","review":"uma das melhores campanhas que existe","timestamp_created":1422759637,"timestamp_updated":1422759637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14271634","author":{"steamid":"76561197975386185","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1437034316},"language":"english","review":"This game is designed with a really nice approach.

It's an incredibly fun (albeit short) game, that I wish I could experience again for the first time. Things improve exponentially in the sequel, but for what it was at the time (and again, even now) Portal is still an amazing game. Really funny, neat puzzles and mechanics, and a interesting story. I do wish it was a little bit longer, had more variety in the puzzles and expanded on the story and world. And some of those final achievements were real tedious to get (such as Least Steps) but you can easily look past all that because the the short campaign is so memorable.\n\nI'd give it a 9.0/10.","timestamp_created":1422585307,"timestamp_updated":1422585494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14234217","author":{"steamid":"76561198172778995","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":504,"last_played":1463377035},"language":"english","review":"i love it is a hard but it is fun","timestamp_created":1422584493,"timestamp_updated":1422584493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14233904","author":{"steamid":"76561198023043287","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":34,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1421929472},"language":"schinese","review":"脑力游戏","timestamp_created":1422582667,"timestamp_updated":1422582667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14233871","author":{"steamid":"76561198150249812","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1439078712},"language":"brazilian","review":"Otimo Jogo","timestamp_created":1422582495,"timestamp_updated":1422582495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14232183","author":{"steamid":"76561198061573263","num_games_owned":793,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1423571391},"language":"english","review":"I played n finished before long time ago and i can say this game actually puzzle is taking ur time n power.. :) \nGraphics really nice.Well just do it ,take it in ur inventory ;) İ just finished when i bought after 3.1 hrs ;D","timestamp_created":1422572813,"timestamp_updated":1422572813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14231405","author":{"steamid":"76561198112581816","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1657549655},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego, entretenido e interesante","timestamp_created":1422568851,"timestamp_updated":1422568851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14231393","author":{"steamid":"76561198014705158","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":38,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1422549742},"language":"brazilian","review":"Não consigo acreditar que passei tantos anos para enfim jogar esse jogo.
