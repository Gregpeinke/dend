But it will be always here for you, and can comfort you during hard times.\n\nThe Story in it's lonesome is quite basic to be honest. The player is named \"Gordon Freemen.\" He is 27 when you play as him during a routine procedure at the test chambers. However during this run, it hits the fan and instead of going good, Xen creatures show up! They wreck havoc as you venture into the halls and corridors of this facility. After a while, you heard a fellow peer say that a team down at Lambda Core has a way of stopping this mess, and they need you to do the dirty work. Once you have reached this place, they decided to send you into the unknown parts of Xen, and stop a \"godly fetus\" so the team can finally put a end to this hellhole. \n\nNow, about the combat. It is something I didn't expected when I first tried it. It was sorta a mix between shooting and solving. It's oddly enjoyable to my ape-like tofu head. The only thing I can compare it to is a mix of \"Resident Evil,\" and \"Quake.\" Granted, the AI has the classic 1998' charm, and sometimes it makes you want to beat yourself up with a crowbar. But once you get into the rhythm, oh lord it feels rewarding!\n\nFinally, the cracks. First of all, the graphics are comparable to a soapwash. The textures looked [i] smooshed [/i] when you look up close. Also the models and levels have a \"Blocky-Triangle Mix\" to them. Search up some scientist models if you don't know. Audio is what you expect for 1998. Muffed, and speaker-like. Imagine a pair of earmuffs around you at all times.\n\nHowever, would I recommend it? Of course, if you are interested in how video games came to be, this is a solid pickup. The best thing is, you don't need any fan-made patch/sourceport, you can just jump in. But, always config the game to your desire. There are also fan-made mods, sequels and prequels, and of course the beautifully made fan-made remake, Black Mesa! That is all I have to say, now go and swing some headcrabs around!","timestamp_created":1572198555,"timestamp_updated":1605915744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55837239","author":{"steamid":"76561198145536817","num_games_owned":291,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1658955404},"language":"english","review":"This is still a very great game with a story that you have to find out yourself.

Před necelými 20 lety (2001), kdy jsem byl ještě malé \"celfátko\" a 256MB ram společně s 64MB grafickou kartou ATI Radeon 9000 hnanou velice silným jedno-jádrovým procesorem o taktu 1,6Ghz byl těžký Hi-Tec. Jsem společně s velice příjemným kolektivem z bývalé 3D herny u místeckého náměstí naistaloval tuto dnes již klasiku. Jelikož jsem byl mladší mohl jsem se na hru pouze dívat spoza zad starších dětí, což mě ovšem neodradilo a hru jsem si sehnal na nejspíše 100 krát použitém CD. \n\nPo úchvatné hodině instalace jsem hru spustil a zamoloval jsem se do světa, který byl tak rozdílný a hrál tolika prvky a barvami, které jsem takřka vůbec z předchozích her neznal. Interakce v místnostech, kdy jsem mohl oslovovat ostatní postavy ve hře pro mne byly novým světem. U opening intra, kdy projíždíte metrem skrze Black-Mesu jsem se popravdě řečeno bál. To mě ovšem neodradilo a pokračoval jsem dále. S každým dalším levelem a každou další interakcí s \"BOSY\" jsem se do hry zavrtával stále hlouběji a hlouběji. Co se hratelnosti týče, tak na tu dobu byla až příliš složitá (žebříky, DuckJumpy, orientace v mapě, návrat do předchozích levelů kvůli postupu), nicméně jsem si na tento styl velmi brzo zvykl a nadále jsem jej vyžadoval od každé hry.\n\nHra oplývala mnoha nepřátely (nejtěžsí byly ty zatracené černé flundry s MP5 ve skladech Black-Mesy) ať se jednalo o lidi a nebo mimozemšťany. Proti nim jsme mohli využít obrovský arzenál zbraní, který vynikal nejen kvalitním zpracováním graficky, ale také zvuky byly kultovní. Celou hru jsem si tak nějak nejvíce oblíbil 357.Colt (revolver, který zabíjel na jednu ránu), ale samozřejmě do něj nebyly vždy náboje a proto jsem musel užívat i jiné zbraně.\n\nSamostatný odstavec bych rád věnoval úžasné atmosféře Xenu, jež byla impozantní. Kopletně celá hra odehrávající se někde v Mexiku a najednou jako když střelí XEN. Vzpomínám si jak jsem se nervoval u marných pokusů přeskakovat mezi poletujícími kameny, načež jsem zjistil, že za pomocí \"DuckJumpu\" využívám gravitaci s poněkud příjemnější přitažlivou silou. Nadšení z nabytých zkušeností mi samozřejmě nevydrželo moc dlouho, poněvadž přišly zástupy nepřátel a dokonce takých, kteří rozdávali mír a lásku na dálku a všichni najednou. Finálový BOSS, byl opravdu kultovní a do dneška si vzpomenu, kdy jsem absolutně netuišl jakým způsobem jej sundat. Dopomohl mi až bratr, který hru měl již dohranou a ukázal mi jak tomu mimozemskému potratu nakouknout do hlavy.\n\nPoslední odstavec bych rád věnoval né hlavnímu hrdinovi Gordonovi, ale jeho těžko říci zda sokovi či nepříteli. Jaký mladý posránek, jsem tuto postavu nechápal a takřka nevnímal, ale když jsem jí po několika letech znovu hrál (doba, kdy už jsem alespoň trochu uměl anglicky) postava mě začala fascinovat. Kdo je G-Man? Co jej nutí takto manipulovat s lidmi? Proč si vybral zrovna Gordona na tuto cestu? Získal Gordon vzdělání a zkušenosti jen díky tomuto člověku, který ho jako loutku vedl až do Black-Mesy? Jaký je pravý důvod jeho manipulace? Takových otázek, je ohromná spousta a proto mne znova tento příběh fascinoval a rád si jej kdykoliv zopakuji.","timestamp_created":1571724269,"timestamp_updated":1571724269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584664523601531982","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55711890","author":{"steamid":"76561198084336854","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":15714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15263,"last_played":1645407248},"language":"english","review":"On A Rail has great music at the start but the train covers it up and is so boring to get on and off.
