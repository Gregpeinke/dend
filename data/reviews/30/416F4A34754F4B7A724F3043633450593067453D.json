В наличии оружие ближнего боя: ножи, лопаты и штыки на винтовках, \nпистолеты: барабанный револьвер Webley MkIV 1899, Кольт-Браунинг 1911, Немецкий Люгер \nвинтовки: M1 Garand , k43, Kar98k и M1 Carbine\nавтоматы: Thomson, MP40, Sturmgewehr 44, Greese Gun, Sten, а так же автоматы с прицелом или ножками для установки в качестве пулемёта с точки ведения огня.\nпулемёты, базука и панзершрек , а так же 2 типа гранат и пакеты взрывчаток. \nЗадача: захватить стратегическую точку (захват флага) и как второстепенно уничтожить противника.

People who played this game were super nice and chill. Put the voice chat to good use. No screaming, only jokes and game-play related stuff. Was really fun. (Or maybe I was just lucky.) Too bad that the only servers left (alive) are the US ones. That's why I've only played this game for 15 minutes.","timestamp_created":1569859345,"timestamp_updated":1569859345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519458651542663574","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55328605","author":{"steamid":"76561198097761425","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":772,"last_played":1647693906},"language":"english","review":"it a old but good game to past the time","timestamp_created":1569729880,"timestamp_updated":1569729880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55304366","author":{"steamid":"76561198051988031","num_games_owned":768,"num_reviews":247,"playtime_forever":31,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31,"last_played":1569248035},"language":"russian","review":"[DROP]\n\nИгра про Вторую Мировую Войну на движке Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1569597600,"timestamp_updated":1569597600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55279804","author":{"steamid":"76561198013146396","num_games_owned":1611,"num_reviews":2086,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1569444639},"language":"russian","review":"Говнище неиграбельное","timestamp_created":1569444646,"timestamp_updated":1569444646,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55230515","author":{"steamid":"76561198399723135","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":24,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1579337812},"language":"koreana","review":"소스나오기 전 앵은 05년 06년 07년도까지 나름 커뮤니티도있고 인지도있는 게임이었는데 iRC서버관리겸 클랜인 P.z.F클랜원이었고 나를 인기도있었던, 클랜정모도하고 애착있었던 게임인데 슬슬 유저들이 사회생활을 하면서, 군대가면서 그렇게 사라진게임..... 많이 애착에 예전 밸브팩으로 사면서 해봤는데 그때나 지금이나 시끄럽기만 한 짱꼴라뿐.... 한국유저는 기껏 한둘.... 비운의 게임이라 너무 가슴아프네 ㅋㅋㅋ","timestamp_created":1569153029,"timestamp_updated":1569153091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474452555179595947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uOKzrO0Cc4PY0gE="}
