E3 1998 \nGame Critics Awards for \"Best PC Game\" and \"Best Action Game\".\nPerfect game for you if you like old school first person shooters.Half-Life has no \"levels\"; it instead divides the game into chapters. Valve released two demos for Half-Life. The first, Half-Life: Day One, contained the first fifth of the game and was distributed with certain graphic cards. The second demo, Half-Life: Uplink, was released on February 12, 1999, and featured original content.Game of the decade definitely for me and gldsrc engine is very good for that time .In Half-Life, players assume the role of the protagonist, Dr. Gordon Freeman, a recent MIT graduate in theoretical physics, and also a recent employee at Black Mesa. After an experiment that goes horribly awry when an unexpected Resonance Cascade (an apparently completely fictitious occurrence) rips dimensional seams that devastate the facility, Gordon must fight to escape the now alien-infested facility as creatures from another world known as Xen subsequently enter through these dimensional seams.And of course i can recommend Half-Life","timestamp_created":1593180576,"timestamp_updated":1593180605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71402320","author":{"steamid":"76561198218038976","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2369,"last_played":1644599249},"language":"english","review":"Kestane oyun","timestamp_created":1593179128,"timestamp_updated":1593179128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71401645","author":{"steamid":"76561198339423772","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":472,"last_played":1605443584},"language":"english","review":"Legend","timestamp_created":1593178608,"timestamp_updated":1593178608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71398940","author":{"steamid":"76561198884866229","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1067,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":114,"last_played":1654844112},"language":"russian","review":"Топовая игра,советую","timestamp_created":1593176501,"timestamp_updated":1593176501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71395767","author":{"steamid":"76561198843920755","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":229,"last_played":1601242466},"language":"turkish","review":"1998 yapımı olmasına rağmen her açıdan tatminkar ve hikaye bakımından çoğu oyunda olmayan efsane bir hikayeye sahip.Zaten çoğu kişi tarafından bilinen ve sevilen bir oyun olduğu için eğer şu zamana kadar bu oyunu oynamadıysanız en kısa sürede oynamanızı tavsiye ediyorum.","timestamp_created":1593173814,"timestamp_updated":1593173814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597661614418029785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71394979","author":{"steamid":"76561198819162581","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":28456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":313,"last_played":1657554694},"language":"turkish","review":"crossfire desem kalbini verir misin?...","timestamp_created":1593173147,"timestamp_updated":1614200290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71394424","author":{"steamid":"76561199031879806","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1609487017},"language":"japanese","review":"[h1] 助けて！早く遊びたいよ～[/h1]\n言わずと知れた名作ゲーム、ということでセール時に購入したが、なぜか黒い画面(音はする)から全く進まず、、、\n遊びたいのにできない、結構つらいです。\n","timestamp_created":1593172698,"timestamp_updated":1593172698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.431372553110122681","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71393670","author":{"steamid":"76561198146264947","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2474,"last_played":1643436546},"language":"english","review":"Old Classic, found myself shooting everything that opposes me.

I've been using every weapon (well not the grenades and bombs really) all throughout the game, so none of them are really redundant. It can get kinda hard at times. Graphics are old but definitely not outdated. Near the end of the game, when you get into those weird limbo/space/open kinds of maps it can honestly get worth to stare at for a moment and enjoy the scenery.\nI doesn't focus on the storyline much so you could say it is just run 'n' shoot game, but here it doesn't matter at all.\nI recommend playing this by 1-2 hour parts before sleep/work/school...
