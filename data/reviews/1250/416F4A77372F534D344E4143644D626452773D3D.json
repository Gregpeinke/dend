Vous gagnerez de l'argent à chaque fin de vague ainsi qu'à chaque frag ; autant dire que ça se bastonne pour tuer le moindre petit zombie paumé.\n\nUne fois que vous aurez compris que la devise utilisée est la Livre Sterling, une vendeuse (et oui, même pendant l'apocalypse, on ne crache pas sur le beaf) apparaitra dans un endroit aléatoire de la map, dont la position vous sera indiquée par une flèche en haut à gauche de l'écran ainsi que par une trainée rouge pour vous guider, histoire de ne pas se perdre tant certaines maps sont des labyrinthes.\n\nVous aurez alors la possibilité d'acheter des armes diverses, dont la quantité est limitée par un indice de poids. Mais comment choisir son arme ?\n\nIl existe des perks (des classes). Selon celle que vous selectionnez, vous aurez des bonus liés à un type d'arme: armes incendiaires, explosifs ou encore armes de corps-à-corps, il y en a pour tout le monde. Chaque perk possède un compteur lié à un type d'actions que vous devez accomplir (infliger des dégats avec le type d'armes lié au perk par exemple) qui, lorsqu'il passe un cap, vous octroie un niveau et augmente les bonus. Il y a 6 niveaux pour chaque perk.\n\nGraphiquement, c'est super pour un jeu de zombies et on n'en attendra pas plus, si ce n'est quelques rares endroits dans certaines maps qui sont glitchés et parfois bloquent un mob, ce qui obligera à venir jusqu'à lui pour en finir au lieu de l'inverse.\n\nMusicalement, c'est jouissif. La BO est majoritairement constituée de métal, et c'est le pied lorsqu'on démembre des chauves pleins de sang à coups de chevrotine ! J'ai tout de même remplacé certaines musiques assez agacantes (comme celles des maps Noel) par des chansons de Metallica, et ça s'intègre merveilleusement bien.\n\nIl existe 5 niveaux de difficulté qui vous mettront à l'épreuve: Débutant, Normal, Difficile, Suicidaire et Enfer sur Terre (pour les énumerer en français). Lorsque vous entendrez la voix de la marchande d'armes en français, vous la changerez tout de suite, faites moi confiance. Enfin, il existe pas mal de types de zombies, tous avec leurs propres attributs; c'est riche et difficile, on aime.\n\nCe jeu requiert un teamplay parfait car on peut se faire littéralement défoncer dès la 3e vague si les joueurs merdent. Détail important : à la fin des 10 vagues, une 11e vous oppose au Patriarche, sorte de bureaucrate zombifié à l'origine des zombies, en guise de boss.\n\nCependant, il y a malheureusement trop peu de servers du fait de la désertion de beaucoup de joueurs pour le numéro 2. Les hitbox des têtes déconnent parfois, ce qui fait que vous n'infligez pas toujours de headshots même si vous visez au sniper à deux mètres de votre cible et enfin, certains succès sont bugués.\n\n\nEn conclusion, nous avons ici un excellent jeu que je ne peux que recommander. A vous de jouer désormais.","timestamp_created":1447030955,"timestamp_updated":1659206350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614751696586608887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18955689","author":{"steamid":"76561198079721583","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6266,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5538,"last_played":1558375957},"language":"russian","review":"norm tak cho))","timestamp_created":1447000561,"timestamp_updated":1447000561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18952933","author":{"steamid":"76561198058098244","num_games_owned":363,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1505064151},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyunda karı zombi var, Kesinlikle alınmalı 10/10","timestamp_created":1446991258,"timestamp_updated":1446991258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18952592","author":{"steamid":"76561198002420670","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7847,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7790,"last_played":1446101547},"language":"spanish","review":"Desde que conocí este juego mi vida cambió.\nCada vez que necesito plata grito DOSH\nY cada vez que vienen a robarme grito ONE IN THE PIPE","timestamp_created":1446989954,"timestamp_updated":1446989954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":25,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653175473213195801","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18948935","author":{"steamid":"76561198185520325","num_games_owned":355,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1465252250},"language":"english","review":"I love this game.

And that's a good thing!\n\nWhat I was expecting:\n\nA game similar the other well known Zombie Shooter, but slower-paced and with all the UT stuff I've come to love, like Bots, Double Jumping, and Damage Bonus pickups, and things like that. Like the other Zombie Shooter, but more 'arcadey', yet slower.\n\nWhat I got:\n\nA wave-based Zombie Shooter with an insane amount of maps, with many many free updates, but without Bots, Double Jumping, or any type of pickup (beyond weapons and ammo). It's very important to know the enemy type, especially the Special types, so that you can act accordingly.\n\nAs well as a basic 'waves' mode, there's also Objective Mode. This is basically the same, but a LOT more linear, and with objectives beyond 'kill stuff'. For instance, in one of the Objective maps, you have to use a welder to open safe doors and carry some gold bars to a certain place. Enemies just keep spawning while you do this, and while you're carrying the gold bars, your movement speed is slowed down.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nHere is a typical map play session for me, as a single player (because my people skills suck exactly as much as my internet connection does):\n\n- Pick a map\n- Pick a game difficulty (how hard the enemies will be) and game length (how many waves you want).\n- For this example, I pick Normal difficulty, and Short. That means that the enemies will be reasonably tough, and the match will last for 4 waves + 1 boss wave.\n- Start the gameplay session.\n- Wait (a small amount of time) for loading\n- The session has loaded! Time to choose a class (they're called Perks in this game).\n- I pick Commando, because I want to be good at using automatic weapons for most of the session.\n- I start the actual session, with the standard starting equipment of a Knife and a Pistol. If my Commando Perk was higher level, I'd get to start with an automatic weapon. But it's not, so I don't.\n- Wave 1 appears. During Wave 1, I kill Zeds (the zombies) while keeping an eye out for an automatic weapon, or some armour (and yes it's spelt like that, because it's a British game).\n- Wave 1 finishes. I now have 1 minute to get to the Trader so that I can buy an automatic weapon, or some armour. This is made easier by the fact that a red line appears between me and the Trader, and I just need to follow it. However, it's made annoying by the things that the Trader says. I think she thinks it's funny, or sexy. It's not. It's also irrelevant, so I can just ultimately ignore it.\n- I get to the Trader. Do I want an automatic, or armour?\n- I pick the cheapest automatic, because the armour is more likely to spawn on the map than an automatic.\n- I've finished at the trader, but still have some time left, so I roam around waiting for the next wave, when I come across an automatic which spawned on the map. I facepalm until I hear the next wave arrive.\n- Wave 2 begins. Tougher enemies appear this time, but I don't care, because I have an auto. If only I could have dual wielded the other one I saw! This reminds me that I can dual-wield pistols - which doesn't really help me right now.\n- I finish wave 2, then get to the Trader. I buy the armour this time, and also buy more ammo.\n- I've got, like 45 seconds left. I spent this looking for nearby item spawns so I can sell them to the trader. I find some armour has spawned, because OF COURSE I DO. I should point out that this isn't normal - but it's not rare, either. Just luck, is all. However, I still facepalm until the next wave, all the while reminding myself to check item spawns ON THE WAY to the trader next time, instead of AFTER.\n- Wave 3 starts, which includes tougher enemy types again. I wish I had bought a better auto (instead of armour), but then I remember that we have grenades in this game. I use them and my auto to survive until the next round.\n- I finish Wave 3, and forget to check item spawns on the way to the trader, because I am a moron.\n- at the Trader, I sell my old auto and buy a much better gun.\n- I don't bother buying armour, because I'm sure I'll find more body armour as an item spawn, which, of course doesn't happen.\n- Wave 4 starts. I see one of the toughest enemies in the game, the Fleshpound. I nearly quit in sheer terror, but I manage to take them out. It only cost me most of my ammo, armour, and health. This is because I don't listen to the community about the correct way to take out a Fleshie, and just try to treat it like a normal enemy. This is because I am a moron.\n- I (barely) defeat Wave 4.\n- I make my way to the Trader, while she informs me that 'something really big is coming'. Given her previous comments, I think nothing of this at all, and just chalk it up to her stupid sense of humour (which is also spelt that way, because it's still a British game).\n- I upgrade to a better auto, and replenish all armour and ammo (including grenades).\n- I think to myself \"Wait, I just finished 4 waves. Aren't I done here?\" Then I remember about the final boss wave.\n\nAnd if you want to know what happens in *that* wave...\n\n...well, the game is still for sale. ;)\n\n(Also, 'YouTube exists'. But I'm mainly concerned with the 'BUY THIS GAME' thing.)","timestamp_created":1446881377,"timestamp_updated":1553612827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504119813442230225","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18923501","author":{"steamid":"76561198013873028","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":5421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1411,"last_played":1596604450},"language":"english","review":"The game is pretty nice, being a british lad while wining hot dosh by killing australians is nice.","timestamp_created":1446875461,"timestamp_updated":1446875461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18923292","author":{"steamid":"76561198058994988","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3170,"last_played":1446599000},"language":"english","review":"The floor is not alive, and cannot be killed.
