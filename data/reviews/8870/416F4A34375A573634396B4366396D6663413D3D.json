[i]I have not got many hours on this game as of making this review, I have only recently bought it on Steam. I have played this game 8 times over, including the DLC, and I am about to begin my 9th playthrough soon.[/i]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nBioShock Infinite is an incredible game that I never thought I'd like. This game can take you through a rollercoaster of emotions; there is never too much or too little action. The AI is possibly the best you will ever find. The graphics are absolutely stunning. The gameplay is flawless. The sounds are addicting to hear and never get annoying. Every playthrough feels different in the same way... if you catch my drift.\n\n[b][u]See the bottom for my rating.[/u][/b]\n\n\n[h1]Full Review - Top to Bottom[/h1]\n\n[b]Let's talk about the story.[/b] As mentioned in \"My Story\" (at the bottom of the review) BioShock Infinite has a very confusing but also very intriguing story. This mix made me replay it even more and focus more on the details of the story than Elizabeth's... er... features. It took me four playthroughs to understand it so I guess you could say the game has a high replayability factor, especially for a single player FPS game. What makes it seem even better is the fact that each playthrough is the exact same story but it's the fact that it's like a book. It's always the same story, but a story you can read repeatedly and still feel the same emotions; you just learn more about it. It's hard to say much else without giving away the gameplay so that's all I will say. If you are planning on buying this, I can assure you that the story is god-like.\n[b]Note:[/b] [i]As you go through the game, watch out for voxophones. You'll learn lots about the story that way and even learn about enemies. One specific one you may even feel bad about, it's a sad story how that enemy is developed.[/i]\n\n[b]Let's talk about the gameplay.[/b] The gameplay in this is addicting. The skylines must be the first to bring up. I loved riding up and down the skylines hip-firing at multiple enemies and dodging bullets. The satisfaction of jumping off a skyline, meleeing an enemy off the platform and proceeding to fire the sniper rifle and performing a smooth headshot on an enemy was the best feeling I could have. Each playthrough I have tried a different combination of weapons. Trust me, they're all great for different situations and there's no perfect gun, just personal preference. BioShock Infinite also tries to force you to use different guns and ammo can run short if you're not careful. \n\n[b]Let's talk about the AI, and more specifically, Elizabeth.[/b] I noticed how Elizabeth was very different to your average BOT. She never felt like a BOT. Elizabeth will [i]never[/i] be doing in-human actions and you will throughout the game begin to forget that she's not even a real person. And the timing for the actions she takes is complete perfection. I managed to play the entire game with out dying once across all difficulties (believe it or not) and I would not have done that if I couldn't rely on Elizabeth to save me; whether I'm low on ammo, health or salts she would throw the one that benefits me the most at the time. Elizabeth is a character anyone could find lovable. And somehow the developers performed a miracle to make her always in the scene but also not annoying. The work that Ken (lead Dev) and the team (Irrational Games) has put into Elizabeth is phenomenal. Elizabeth certainly puts the \"main\" in \"main character\".\n[b]Note:[/b] [i]I could go on about Elizabeth all day so to get you the important information that I feel will interest more people I cut out quite a bit and tried to make it as short as possible.[/i]\n\n[b]Let's talk about the enemies used in the game.[/b] I will try my best not to spoil anything here but feel free to skip if you'd rather find out about the enemies for yourself.\n[spoiler]First off is the handymen. I absolutely love the handyman. Why? Because I am forced to hate it. Other people don't have the same views, instead all the people I've talked to have different opinions each. I seem to feel frightened and intimidated immediately when the handyman enters a scene. Perhaps it's the 1999 mode that made me even more worried?[/spoiler]\nEither way, the enemies are very well developed and every person seems to have their own personal favorite. Even the common soldier can be effective in battle.\n\n[b]Let's talk about the negatives.[/b] In fact, let's list them considering there's next to no negatives.\n[list]\n[*] The DLC is pretty much required to fully understand the story.\n[*] Controls are rather... odd.\n[*] The beginning can drag a bit (until you first meet Elizabeth).\n[/list]\n\n[h1]My Story - Beginning to End[/h1]\n\nBack on Xbox 360 this game came out for free a few years ago. I played about 20 minutes in and stopped. I'll admit, the beginning of the game wasn't very appealing as I hated the whole steampunk style. The concept seemed strange. Now? Now I wish I had played it then. I missed out on [i]so much[/i]! I'm going to be 100% honest and say, yes; I bought BioShock Infinite because Elizabeth was pretty hot. And that's kind of the only reason I downloaded the Remastered version on PC when it came out. I had also heard a lot of praise for the game but for me it looked like \"just another FPS.\"\n\nAfter playing about 2 hours in, I soon found that this game had more too it than just a hot character. I noticed that there must have been something else keeping me interested. This was the gameplay mechanics. Then I began to realize that the graphics were another satisfying feature keeping me playing, much more attractive than the original BioShock Infinite. The further I went through, the more reasons I had to keep on playing.\n\n[b][u]My Eight Playthroughs[/u][/b]\n[b]1)[/b] Upon completing my first playthrough, I felt really sad. Not just because of the ending, but because I had no idea what on earth had just happened. The whole time I had played, and I was actually paying attention, I had no clue what had happened. \n[b]2)[/b] I replayed it a second time, but this time on normal. I began to understand a little more. Then I watched a YouTube video explaining it. Then I realized that I thought I knew it but I had no idea. And even from the YouTube video I still didn't understand. \n[b]3)[/b] So I played it through for a third time but on hard. This difficulty was fine but I was only slowly learning more and more about the story. \n[b]4)[/b] I watched a YouTube video, from what I remember being over 2 hours long including the Burial at Sea DLC (when I say I completed the game I do mean the DLC included). This helped me catch on to it but to make sure that theory was fitting I played it through a fourth time on hard difficulty again. At the end I understood it finally. [i]I couldn't believe it! It took four playthroughs to understand the story[/i], with the help of YouTube videos. \n[b]5)[/b] On my fifth playthrough I began the 1999 mode. My God this was well and truly stressful considering I forced myself not to die. I'm pleased to say I completed it without dying, topping off BioShock Infinite by playing all the difficulties consistently without dying what so ever. (I have died as of today, screw Clash in the Clouds for that one). This achievement made me want to further play the game. \n[b]6, 7, 8)[/b] On my sixth, seventh and eighth playthrough I believe I succeeded A* in my knowledge of BioShock Infinite.

Суть игры заключается в том, что вы путешествуете в череде бесконечных пародоксов во вселенной Bioshock с механикой серии Borderlands. Нет, ну правда, захожу в \"Биошок\", а такое чувство, будто играю в \"Борду\" с теми же щитами, высокими прыжками, механикой стрельбы, только с аэротрассами и суперспособностями в виде напитков, изменяющих вас на генном уровне. Даже NPC ведут себя в бою, как в \"Борде\", а конкретно я играл во вторую часть. А теперь по порядку...\n\nПлюсо-минусы:\n\nСюжет \nКак я упомянул ранее, в этой игре всё завязано на путешествиях в тех или инных ирреальностях. Как мне кажется, это же в какой-то мере и косяк игры. Было чувство, как после просмотра 5го Терминатора, но это лечится после повторных прохождений. Также в игре есть право выбора, но на концовку это никак не влияет, только на то, окажитесь ли вы расистом или нет и будете ли вы ходить с замотанной рукой до конца игры.\n\nГеймплей \nВсё играется так же бодренько и весело, как и в Borderlands 2. В добавок из развлечений специальные воздушные рельсы, дабы упростить путешествие по Колумбии, а мир между прочем полуоткрытый.
