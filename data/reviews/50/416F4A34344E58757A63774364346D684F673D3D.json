This time you take the role of Corporal Shephard, a soldier sent on a government cleanup mission at Black Mesa. This is an interesting viewpoint on the events of Black Mesa, and everything is tied in nicely to the events of the original game. For example, the player at one point is in the same room as the military announcer saying \"Forget about Freeman!\", and you even get to see Half-Life's main hero, Gordon Freeman, just before he goes to Xen. \nAlthough not developed by Valve, Gearbox did a decent job in the creation of this game. It's around 7 hours long and introduces several new weapons, enemies, features, and followers. One of these new weapons is a detached Barnacle, which is used as a sort of grappling hook. There are a bunch of new, unique, and difficult aliens and black-ops personnel (who are cleaning up the initial military cleanup, a little redundant) that the player goes up against. New features include rope climbing and night vision instead of the typical flashlight, as well as fellow servicemen followers with unique abilities (such as a medic, engineer, or just a firearms man).\nOne issue with this game is that it seems unbalanced. At one point there's a short segment of dark, creepy tunnels full of large creatures which is followed by an annoyingly long combat segment. It's not like this the whole time, but some parts are too long and others are too short.\nOpposing Force also contains many glitches. Here's a few that I encountered:\n[*]During battles, allies will walk into your line of fire as you're shooting, and then they will turn and shoot you.\n[*]After battles, allies would still be firing/throwing grenades, sometimes hurting the player.\n[*]Following allies randomly stop, requiring the player to go back and retrieve them.\n[*]In a few loading screens and/or elevators, the player will get stuck in the floor, unable to move.\n[*]Sudden, unreasonable deaths; I assume this is a fall damage glitch.\n\nHowever, I don't mean to knock the game. As long as you don't mind dated visuals and occasional frustrations, this is a quality shooter, especially if you enjoy the Half-Life series as much as I do! For the price, this is definitely worth a shot.","timestamp_created":1433018343,"timestamp_updated":1433018419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16080854","author":{"steamid":"76561198176559385","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":531,"last_played":1468670944},"language":"english","review":"Solid expansion pack, do recomend.","timestamp_created":1433004430,"timestamp_updated":1433004430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16073563","author":{"steamid":"76561198057298622","num_games_owned":429,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":532,"last_played":1428436841},"language":"turkish","review":"Half Life oyunun ilk genişleme paketi.

Была когда-то такая маленькая команда, Rebel Boat Rockers, и делала она игрушечку Prax Wars, которую должна была издавать Electronic Arts. Но чем-то этот спецназовский 3D-action не приглянулся господам издателям, и кислород RBR’ам перекрыли. А надо сказать, что ребятки в студии были далеко не с улицы. Многие из них делали сначала Duke Nukem 3D, а потом и Sin. И поэтому не повесили хлопцы свои головушки, не закручинились, а мигом переназвались в Gearbox Software и подрядились делать аддон для Half-Life (по мнению кучи авторитетных источников, в том числе и нас, лучшей игры 1998 года). И чтобы далеко не отходить от своей линии, которую RBR’ы гнули в Prax Wars, они назвали аддон Opposing Force и сделали главного героя самым настоящим спецназовцем. Так что сбылась мечта... Мы имеем отличный аддон от небольшой команды. Хотя он и вышел спустя год после оригинальной игры, прошедшее время не давит на него тяжелым грузом. Смена врага часто позволяет влить свежую кровь в нашу жизнь. А если врагом становится бывшее альтер эго в лице Фримена... В общем, если вы в свое время протащились от Half-Life, то Opposing Force — штучка явно для вас. Играть, черт возьми, интересно, не менее интересно, чем просто в Half-Life.

Half Life Opposing Force takes you on the role of Corporal Adrian Shepard where your helicopter crashes just before you've been given orders and now you run like hell trying to escape the Black Mesa facility. I gotta admit this is a pretty intriguing setup as you now have a new perspective of the Half Life universe. \n\nThe story is quite good as a whole and the pacing is nice. The tutorial, now that's probably the best tutorial I've ever played. Training in a military academy and being barked at by my commander, it really sets the mood. Graphics I won't go too much into detail but I used the HD texture pack that was included with Blue Shift and I don't mind either personally so it's entirely subjective whether you prefer the old or new textures.\n\nMusic is minimal but very good, a little obscure but I like that. It makes it unique in a good way. In terms of gameplay it's Half Life with some new enemies and weapons just as an expansion should work. The new aliens are cool, a couple you get to use certain organ parts as weapons which is pretty sweet. You even get to have a Barnacle Gun which is used pretty well for some puzzles. The Black Ops soldiers later on get pretty annoying and they're placed in some pretty cheap spots you'd never react to in time on your first try.\n\nThis time not only do you get help from the Black Mesa staff but also your HECU brothers. You'll need to stick with them in order for them to help you since Black Ops soldiers have been ordered to target any grunt marines in the facility. As for their A.I. They're okay but a bit static but they do the job in healing and opening doors for you.\n\nI ran into a couple of glitches like in the original Half Life but they didn't do too much to hinder the game. \n\nShould you get this standalone expansion? Hell yeah it's only $5 and you could spend much worse these days. The cool story along with the good pacing, puzzles (oh yeah the puzzles are better now) and awesome aliens to shoot makes this a well made package.
