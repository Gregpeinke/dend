This expansion takes place during the same Black Mesa Incident that Half-Life, Half-Life: Opposing Force, and Half-Life Decay all take place in.\n\nSadly, while gameplay is still a blast, the most notable thing about this expansion for Half-Life is its relatively short length. Someone who has played other games in the series should have no problem beating this expansion in around 3 Hours. Unlike Opposing Force, this expansion does not include any new enemies, weapons, or expansive set pieces making Blue Shift seem somewhat bland. \n\nThe reasoning for Half-Life: Blue Shift's lack of content and length is due to it's reason for existing at all: It was meant as a short addon for the cancelled Sega Dreamcast version of Half-Life. Thankfully, after the Dreamcast version of Half-Life was scrapped, we received Blue Shift for PC, which also brought the new HD weapon and character models from the console versions of Half-Life.\n\nDespite its lack of content, short length, and rough upbringing; Half-Life Blue Shift is still definitely worth picking up on sale or as part of a bundle. Fans who enjoyed the main campaign of Half-Life or its expansion Opposing Force, will enjoy Half-Life Blue Shift for sharing the same addictive combat loop as its predecessors.","timestamp_created":1632607648,"timestamp_updated":1632607693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99960909","author":{"steamid":"76561198006162756","num_games_owned":344,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1632706160},"language":"english","review":"Never finish Half-Life or played Opposing Force but honestly enjoy playing through this despite how super short it was and considering that this was originally an exclusive add on for the cancelled Dreamcast version, the levels do feel like they were made for a console controller in mind. \n\nNow I should REALLY finish Half-Life or play Opposing Force...one of these days at least üëÄ","timestamp_created":1632607328,"timestamp_updated":1632607328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99960653","author":{"steamid":"76561197976699032","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1632606865},"language":"english","review":"Nice little back story into Barney.

It also has lots of marines and they're basically the main enemy, so if you like gunning down lots of marines then you should get this. It also has more characters/story moments than the original (later in-game), which can or cannot be ideal based on your opinion. It could've used a boss of some sort, maybe a mini gun wielding marine who could be supported by a squad or a helicopter as least.
