It's that high for a reason. Half life is coming close to 2 decades old, and you can still have a good time playing the game. The mechanics and half-life engine are the reason we got games like Counter-Strike and Team Fortress Classic. Even today the mechanics leave the game fun to play (even though it takes me an unbelievable number of shots to kill those army guys, the hell is that armor made of?) and the level design ages even better than those.\n\nAt this point, the game has been out for about 18 years. It's highly renowned as one of the best games of all time. If you're reading reviews wondering if you should get it, well just buy the damn game already.","timestamp_created":1452822164,"timestamp_updated":1452822164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503834009170532227","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20532059","author":{"steamid":"76561198271438640","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3921,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1512,"last_played":1502460992},"language":"english","review":"my gosh this is good it looked like it might not be but this is awesome","timestamp_created":1452820365,"timestamp_updated":1452820365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20530918","author":{"steamid":"76561197993817220","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1343890800},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life - игра просто супер!

Perhaps it was the serviceable but definitely outdated controls  I had to deal with, along with some annoying bugs and glitches. It didn't click for me. But after about an hour of getting used to everything, here's what I realized: Half-Life is real nice. Almost everything wrong with the game comes from technological limitations of the 90s. Graphics really start to show the wear-and-tear of 18 years; but they aren't bad enough to distract from the general gameplay. \n\nI can't make any more complaints about Half-Life simply because the sum of its parts makes it such a good game. The story still entertains and is delivered well, throwing out lengthy cutscenes and text crawls in favor of gameplay-based storytelling. Enemy AI was amazing for its time and still functions well today; a variety of weapons and unique, challenging level designs keep things interesting through the course of this game. Most importantly, Half-Life retains a remarkable sense of immersion. You do things of your own volition - you never feel like the game is telling you to do something. \n\nThe best and most surprising aspect of this is its genuine difficulty. Make no mistake about it, scrubs: Half-Life is HARD. The game will throw you in tough situations that make you get off your silly high horse and think; try to play this game with the Doom mentality of run-and-gun and you'll get instantly wrecked by its puzzles and smart enemy placement. Playing through Half-Life in 2016 was a chore; it was a struggle. Most importantly, though? It was a genuinely fascinating, enjoyable little 10+ hour trip into the world of an FPS that revolutionized EVERYTHING in the world of video games upon its release. If it were remastered and retweaked today (read: Black Mesa), it would still be one of the best shooters of any generation of gaming.\n\nA definite must-play if you want to stop being a filthy scrub.\nRating: 7 spooky alien baby-heads out of 10.","timestamp_created":1452452131,"timestamp_updated":1453083152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20452107","author":{"steamid":"76561197988008100","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":4507,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3365,"last_played":1558812998},"language":"spanish","review":"Sin duda un clásico donde los haya, como Quake y otros títulos similares.

Oh man, this is the huge one. The big juggernaut that I can say still holds on somehow.\nWARNING EXPECT SPOILERS:\nSerious Version: You play as Gordon Freeman, a 27-year old C.I.T Graduate working in Black Mesa. You are about to insert a pure Xen crystal and a resonance cascade, causing all of Black Mesa to go into chaos. You fight against the following:\n-Headcrabs\n-Houndis\n-Zombies\n-Marines\n-Bullsquids\n-Vortigaunts\n-Alien Grunts\n-Flying Brain Aliens\n-The Black Ops\n-Giant Vortigaunt looking things\n-Barnicles\n-AND SO MUCH MORE!\nThe Marines comes in, want you, wants answers, makes assumptions, attacks you. They're a bunch of dicks. Hell, you're left for dead in a trash compactor (*insert witty reference to Star Wars here*). You then go to Lambda Core and talk to scientists to flood a reactor, leading you to Xen. Killing a bunch of aliens, inhabitants of Xen. Then going to Nihilanth, the last of his' kind, killing him, then takes you the G-Man, who now owns Xen, and offers you a job to do stuff, or death. Death makes you fight a bunch of Xen Enemies; It is non-cannon. Accepting G-Man's offer is the cannon ending, this leads to Half-Life 2. Overall, as I've said before, Half-Life still holds ground as a big game and is amazing in difficulty, gameplay, and story.\n\nNot Serious Version: You play as Gorgeous Freeman, a 27-year old C.I.T (Cambridged Institute of Technololgy) Graduate working in White Mesa. You are about to insert a yellow crystal and shit happens, causing all of White Mesa to become a scary place where scary stuff happens. You go up against this stuff:\n-ALIENS N' STUFF\n-MILITARY PEOPLE\n-THE WHITE OPS\n-A GIANT FUCKING BABY\nThe Military are a bunch of poo-poo heads. You then go for revengance after being nearly turned into a pancake (which would taste delicious). You then go to Half-Life Symbol Core, then going to Zen, a world of evil aliens and stuff. COMITTING MASS GEONOCIDE AGAINST AN ALIEN RACE IS FUN! YOU LISTEN TO AN EVIL BABY WISPER STUFF AND THEN makes you fight him. After opening his' mind, you are taken to the GG-Man, who now is in control of this place. And offers you a new boring job, or a fight against CUTE FLUFFY BUNNIES. Waiting too long takes you to the CUTE FLUFFY BUNNIES. Taking GG-Man's new job gives you a job with no wage, and the ability to fight stuff for the rest of your life. And in the end, Gorgeous Freeman is a sexy man with a sexy face and a sexy butt with an arsenal  that would make just about every video game badass shit their pants made of gold.","timestamp_created":1451970492,"timestamp_updated":1451970492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20313818","author":{"steamid":"76561198044881290","num_games_owned":434,"num_reviews":126,"playtime_forever":1184,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1184,"last_played":1451968269},"language":"spanish","review":"Con razón es uno de los juegos imperdibles de Valve.\n+ Trama hasta el infinito y más alla.\n+ Muy buena banda sonora.\n+ Armamento variable.\n+ Te sumerges y no lo dejas de jugar hasta el final.","timestamp_created":1451969053,"timestamp_updated":1451969053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20309999","author":{"steamid":"76561198116119787","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1208,"last_played":1533640467},"language":"english","review":"A pure Masterpiece.
