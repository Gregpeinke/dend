The immersion and atmosphere is second to none. Coming into Rapture after a plane crash, seeing a destroyed city, a broken utopia. Splicers scrounging around for scraps, addicted to their over use of plasmids and how they effect the body. It really felt like another world. With each new plasmid felt I was one step closer to their level, one more step away from humanity. \n\nI started Infinte with such wonder, I couldn't wait to see this new world that was built. Seeing the first building float in and connect to the street with a sign \"Open from X time to Y time\" I though to my self: Well that will be a cool game mechanic, having to wait and plan my actions based on the schedule of locations. I sure was wrong about that one.\n\nI continue on and see a mechanical horse and a handyman, those should be interesting fights I figured.  I wonder how they will handle plasmids in this game. With such strong religious overtones there is no way they will just flat out give you God like powers. Such a emphaisis on control as well, maybe these rebels and this \"False Shepherd\" who I assume will be me, come up with plasmids ( Vigors i know ) as a act against such oppression by gaining godlike super powers. \n\nOh whats that? Vigors are not only on every counter everywhere, but they just flat out give me one at the start? One that allows me to control people and machines? They will then kill themselfs after? And no one else but me and a few enemies use them, even though you practically trip over them around every corner? Well thats pretty dumb.\n\nI then come across the first \"shock\" of the game, a very lame attempt at racism. Do I hit the white guy? Black girl? Or the host? Oh doesnt matter everyone is shooting me now. Cool, I got a sky hook, why doesnt everyone have one of these? Seems pretty use full. But so are these Vigors that are everywhere, yet no one uses them.\n\nOh whats this Order of the Raven, sounds 2spooky4me. Why is all this food rotting? Oh i bet something crazy happened here during a feast. Looking forward to digging into this story. \"Protecting our race\", oh its a racist group, and they are having a meeting. Maybe they will try and get me on their side, give me some big speech or something. I should go down and now they are all shooting at me for no reason. I can now shoot crows at people so thats something. Who thought that would be a good idea for a vigor? To shoot crows. More like the Order of the Boring.\n\nEvery level is pretty much that same Order. Some what interesting premise that gets phoned in. Oh you think Songbird is going to stalk you like a hunter trying to get Elizabeth back? Lol nope. Hoping for some cool stories and memorable boss battles? Lol think again. For a game that was ment to seem so open and Infinite it sure felt very rushed and linear. \n\nWhat really caused me to put down the game for a long time was Finkton. Here I am walking around loaded with guns and god powers and no one seems to look twice. That is until I step on someones ship, or cross the wrong invisable wall and then all hell breaks loose. Or im tasked with getting a bunch of guns for a revolution. Why dont they pick up the hundreds of guns and ammo thats just laying around on the streets? Why dont they just catch people on fire with the Devil's Kiss bottle thats on every table. \n\nThere is no logic in this game. There is no story. There are no interesting characters. Its as close to a on-rails shooter as one can get. Everything felt so linear and boring. Even writing this review bores me. It reminds me of Bioshock Infinite.\n\nGood:\n+ Elizabeth isn't useless.\n+ The idea is cool\n\nBad:\n- Elizabeth just so happens to find the one thing your low on.\n- The idea was wasted.\n- Its so linear and boring.\n- No memorable characters.\n- The feeling of wonder left quickly.\n- The Vigors are dumb.","timestamp_created":1414559366,"timestamp_updated":1414559366,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.41812095046043396","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12678000","author":{"steamid":"76561198097602722","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":1109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1109,"last_played":1387062920},"language":"english","review":"pretty good","timestamp_created":1414559272,"timestamp_updated":1414559272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12677985","author":{"steamid":"76561197961703695","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":852,"last_played":1414559101},"language":"english","review":"SPOILER ALERT:  THE ENDING IS LAME.","timestamp_created":1414559123,"timestamp_updated":1414559123,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457523256540298462","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12677607","author":{"steamid":"76561197970941986","num_games_owned":1193,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":1105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1105,"last_played":1409708096},"language":"english","review":"Definitely the best BioShock.

I say that only because my expectations were not colored by the original Bioshock (which I immediately played as soon as I finished Infinite).\n\nThe generic dark-haired grizzled protagonist (sort of) Booker Dewitt was refreshingly not-silent. He actually has a history that is important to the story and is relevant to what is happening in the game (....uh, in a way--hahaha). I found his interactions with Elizabeth to be surprisingly realistic--given how most of these Escort Relationships seem to go. Elizabeth was kind of annoyingly arrogant at first--but after she realized that things have gotten bad and she's gonna have to grown up fast--she chills out. I found their dynamic more interesting than I expected. \n\nOf course, I think it helps that Elizabeth endears herself to the player by not being useless. Typically Escorts are useless, they whine all the time, can't heal themselves and can't use weapons--I have intense resentment for them because they are not fun. But here, Elizabeth keeps out of the way in combat, she can't be injured so you don't have to worry about her. She helps you scrounge up supplies, even. She's USEFUL. And I found myself getting emotionally attached to the two of them (which was why the DLC of them in Rapture was kind of a disapointment). \n\nAnd then of course the ending happens and blows your mind and I'm left with all this conflicting emotion. This game is story-rich and I LOVE that. I have replayed this game a dozen times, easily. And I love it just for the story.\n\nAnd then along with the story---the gameplay is really fun! I LOVE the combat system in this game. It's great! It's balanced, it's got fun Vigors, the melee weapon is cool, the sniper rifle makes me feel like a badass. I love the magnetic shield thing (I always mack that out first).   It's challenging but not rage-quit inducing. Cause that's when a game stops being fun. \n\nSo for me, I was seeing everything--with the gorgeous graphics and settings--without knowing I was looking at references to Bioshock. I knew about Big Daddies and Little Sisters---because my first thought was Big Daddy....Booker Dewitt--I wonder if that was intentional? But otherwise--I didn't know a whole lot.\n\nSo when I finished, I was pumped to play Bioshock--and I loved it (though it is extremely unforgiving while you're learning how to play). And then when I went back to Infinite--I started catching things that I had missed. I love exploring the world of Columbia and Im always looking out for things I missed in the previous playthrough. There's TONS of replay value. \n\n\nSo I love it. Is there anything I don't like?\n\nWell....I found the portal travel a little disconcerning. Because leaving their own universe kind of brings up the question of what matters if they can just take off. \n\nAnd then DLC in Rapture---I was so excited for! So....it was kind of a dissapointment how Elizabeth treated Booker during the first DLC. Which brings up--if you have no knowledge of what you've done--are you still guilty? Do you deserve to be punished? For Elizabeth, the answer is yes--brutally. And then in the second DLC, Liz returns for some girl that the audience doesn't know and has nothing invested in. I thought her 'delusions' of Booker were very telling and sweet and very emotionally engaging (and I was curious about how her delusions might relate to the sterile, weird version of Paris at the beginning). It just would have been nice to see some of that in the first DLC. \n\nAlso, the silliness of Elizabeth not wanting to kill splicers? That was stupid. What would be the point of that? Why knock them out with a crossbow---so that they can wake up later and try to kill you again? That was just dumb. Just because she's female doesn't mean she's an idiot.\n\nThe character of Sally was also so disjointed from the two characters I was actually invested in (Booker and Liz) that at the end of DLC 2, I thought that I must have missed something.

Здесь много захватывающего и интересного, однако для меня это игра явно на один раз.\nИз плюсов  -  это, конечно же, замечательная графика, отличная детализация, проработка игровых моментов и потрясающая винтажная атмосфера, которая пронизывает плоть игры. Сюда можно добавить хороший набор трешевых историй, которые в сравнении с изначальной идиллией города выглядят особенно неожиданно, и оттого неплохо доставляют. \nМинус  -  однообразный геймплей, чередующиеся локации, похожие между собой настолько, что в какой-то момент перестаешь замечать тонкости игры и сюжета; также вид от первого лица (но это уже личные заморочки) и скучные враги. Автосохранение без возможности выбора выбешивает однозначно, и не дает возможности получить удовольствие от процесса. \nВ остальном Биошок  -  это хорошая возможность погрузится в нетривиальную атмосферу и полюбоваться работой геймдизайнеров. Наверное, этого достаточно для того, чтобы рекомендовать его как красивую игрушку для проведения свободного времени. \n","timestamp_created":1414523207,"timestamp_updated":1414523207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12672239","author":{"steamid":"76561198050192387","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1334,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1334,"last_played":1388057468},"language":"french","review":"Il est bien mais déçu par rapport au 1.

If you have never played any of the Bioshock games then ignore this. If you a massive fan of the Bioshock franchise then keep this in mind. I personally love the Bioshock Franchise including this game but I do feel that it is different to the first and second one.\n\nThis game is absolutly fantastic: the graphics are amazing (while also not punching a hole into your graphics card), the atmosphere is vibrant, and the action is exhilarating.  Trust me when I say that this is by far the best purchase I have ever   made on steam and i'm currently running the game on a laptop having to play on lower graphics (still waiting to play on higher graphics). You will not regret this game, although lacking in side missions, it does have a campaign that you (or at least I haven't) won't get bored playing over and over again. This games storyline is amazing, its really clever and one that you wont see coming (well, I didn't).\n\nThe game's Vigor system allows the player the ability to take out enemies with their prefered playing style by combining vigors or just strategically using them (for example, placing traps on enemies walk path). Then combining vigors with the different guns can then change everything.\n\nThe game's main DLC(s) allows the player to return to Rapture which Bioshock fans will love, the only Con to this is somehow there are hooks (like the sky hooks) in rapture which makes little sense.\n\nThe only Con to this game is that it does lack the Bioshock feel to it (dark and scary).
