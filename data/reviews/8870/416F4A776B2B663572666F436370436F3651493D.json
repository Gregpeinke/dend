This game feels inferior in every aspect to the previous games. I could find moments of both Bioshock 1 and 2 that I really enjoyed and found incredibly memorable. I cannot say the same for Infinite. I do not care for any of the characters, besides Elizabeth, and her story feels so contrived and up its own arse. The plot seems like it believes its smart because it uses time travel/quantum jumping along with two characters that bean you over the head with \"this is smart and we're smart the game is smart\". The ending is so ham-fisted that I can't bring myself to care in the slightest for these characters and the trials and tribulations I had just witnessed them go through. The twist was awful, the resolution means nothing, your choices never mattered from the start and it feels annoying. Choices in Infinite don't matter because \"that's the point\", but that's not the point of BIOSHOCK. The gameplay feels worse than the previous games, I don't know if I just prefer it to be clunkier but it just doesn't feel like I earn crits or I feel cheated out of them. The vigors are lame and pale in comparison to the plasmids of the predecessors. Plasmids had far more personality and didn't feel awkward or pointless to use. The vigors become useless once you've gotten the last one as it trivializes everything from then on. Limiting the player to only having two weapons at a time doesn't feel like a balance issue but rather an inconvenience more often than not. Infinite suffers from the same issue as the second game that it closes off past segments of the game after they've been completed and can only be returned to via chapter select. The second game got away with this because you didn't need to collect EVERY audio log, just a certain amount. Infinite not only requires you to get all of them for the achievement but also requires you to backtrack via chapter select which gets incredibly annoying. The game doesn't even tell you what you're missing in terms of the sightseer achievement. So if you want it you'll need to jump from chapter to chapter select with a guide or just combing over everything because you missed one propaganda machine. Handymen are just bad enemies, they're overly annoying, they don't show up often and when they do it feels like such a chore to fight them. Enemies now have no personality other than \"generic soldier\" and \"generic rebel\". No matter how much time I've put into this game over Xbox and PC I just never have fun with it. That becomes even more true once you're trying to just see what everything the game has to offer. CitC is so horribly implemented I have to wonder how it got passed QA. How do you make a wave based test of skill that is simply made easier by buying the vigors and upgrades needed to trivialize the waves and criteria. On top of that, how are you going to set rules for challenges that are then easily done but force the player to restart everything because they messed up once? Are they supposed to be easy/hard? A chore/challenge? Make up your mind as to how you wish to implement things before you ship it off. I've been told time and time again by everyone that the real seller of Infinite is the Burial at Sea DLC. I haven't touched it yet, but from what I've seen it's just Infinite gameplay in the setting of the first two games. If the selling point of Infinite is GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL GAMES, why would I bother getting this one? I'm going to attempt to 100% it only because it has Bioshock in the name and I have some form of autism that won't let me NOT do so. I can guarantee that once I so 100% it I won't feel a sense of accomplishment like I did with the previous games, I'll only feel a sense of relief I never have to play this dog-water game again. 4/10\n\nAddendum: I have now played through the Burial at Sea DLC episodes. I can say that this DLC was absolutely not worth the price of the game. The twists of the DLC are as ham-fisted as the main story, in some places more so. There is a total of ONE absolutely new \"vigor\" in either of these, as any other \"new\" ones are simply rehashes. The first DLC is incredibly quick and offers nothing in terms of attachment to the characters present (remember, there's INFINITE Bookers and Elizabeths, so these SHOULDN'T be the same ones), that ends with a poor resolution. Leading into the second DLC episode, the story goes off the rails and then just splatters on the concrete with how insane and contrived with how everything is supposed to \"fit together\". It feels as though they thought they were tying up loose ends with this when really they just frayed more of the poorly secured rope that is the narrative. They attempt to have everything circle back to the first game, Bioshock, but the entire time I couldn't help but laugh because of how RIDICULOUS AND ASININE it was. The entire thing felt like a petty \"REMEMBER BIOSHOCK???\" with the additions of certain characters, locals, weapons, etc. While it may seem like it's supposed to be taking some liberties because it IS taking place in Rapture, it feels more like a crutch made of toothpicks. Any time I had even a smirk on my face because of something interesting the game added or did it immediately fell from my face because I was let down not long after. The DLC has made me even less happy to play this game. I'm lowering my score further. 3/10","timestamp_created":1625176433,"timestamp_updated":1625891843,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507319033145904541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94840709","author":{"steamid":"76561198315145931","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":703,"last_played":1627540996},"language":"english","review":"good\n","timestamp_created":1625175841,"timestamp_updated":1625175841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94840071","author":{"steamid":"76561198291265912","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":2178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1521,"last_played":1625453673},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1625175073,"timestamp_updated":1625175073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94839465","author":{"steamid":"76561199034121932","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":976,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":976,"last_played":1624954160},"language":"english","review":"This game and franchise is a master piece...this game has a great story and the graphics are over the top.

It contains great world building, gun and magic first-person combat, excellent chemistry between both protagonists, and an intriguing puzzling narrative that leaves you with many questions when you are done.\n\nPresentation (for 2007): 5/5 - Excellent graphical engine and not very demanding to your graphics card considering how beautiful the game is. You really escape your mind to this fascinating fantasy utopia/dystopia with an interesting blend of futuristic and retro elements. The details surrounding the politics of the society are well thought out - you even get to fight robotic machines that look like U.S. founding fathers with a warped uber-patriotic representation. The character designs are very detailed and the main companion has expressive facial expressions. The game also has excellent sound design and features excellent voice acting for all characters. The characters really come alive and you can feel attached to them.\n\nStory/Dialogue 5/5 - Narrative blends complex science fiction, politics (they really nailed it), sociology, and the human element of the 2 protagonists. Combined with the outstanding way the world is presented, you play for the story, for the development of the characters and the father/daughter type of relationship and tension between the two protagonists. What makes things even better is  that the gameplay is incredible.\n\nGameplay 5/5 - The gameplay is far superior to Bioshock 1 and 2. It is dynamic, challenging, allow customization (with flexibility to try different styles of play), and manages to remain intuitive and simple all the way through. Battles tend to be exciting, not repetitive, can even involve zipping through 'sky-lines' while shooting\n","timestamp_created":1625089372,"timestamp_updated":1625089372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94762932","author":{"steamid":"76561198262682256","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":791,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":791,"last_played":1617381093},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock infinite was a great game when it came out and it is still a great game.

The game makes use of really cool mechanics, the main mechanic being normal fps gameplay, with different varieties of guns to use. Guns can get simple upgrades, for the damage, or the clip size, or even to decrease the recoil. There are also vigors, which enable you to use a wide variety of abilities such as posessing an enemy or an enemy robot, shocking someone, bringing someone closer to you so you can bonk em on their head, or even absorb enemy fire to repel it back. There are also hooks and skyliners as a method of transport. This game started off looking like just a normal fps with a twist, but it ended up also being a horror game to me lmao, there were a few jumpscares and a ghost (siren) that i ended up fighting, which did scare me a little bit to the point where i pressed the escape button and tabbed out of the game while swearing but overall i kinda liked it. I needed to go to the wiki to actually understand the whole thing though, just because my smol brain couldn't understand the ending part which was the space-time sci-fi part of the game.
