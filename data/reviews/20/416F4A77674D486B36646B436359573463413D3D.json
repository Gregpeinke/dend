He was always a Sniper or a Soldier. The servers he played on mostly consisted of his friends.\n\nFast forward a decade later. I finally get this game along with the Valve Complete Pack for Christmas. I go in, and well, not surprised to see how many servers are open and the most I can ever find is 10 people in just one. But goddamn, the nostalgia. That booming voice, the triumphant music, the grenades... All sounds just spamming together into one huge orgy that even porn websites can't compete with.\n\nThe game is really fun, has mechanics so different from Team Fortress 2, that it will be confusing for those who only play its sequel. Grenades are so fun to mess around with until you throw one at yourself. I suggest actually finding a server to practice with each class and all features that each class has, and obviously, must read what the default key binds are. You don't want to be spending 4 minutes trying to find the grenade button or the Medic button.\n\nI recommend new players or curious TF2 players to try this. But don't think just because you're good at other shooting games or good at TF2, that you're gonna do well in this. Oh, and also:\n\nYOUR TEAM CAPTURED.
