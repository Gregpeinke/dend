Pretty sure it’s a sign of a really good game. Of a really good story. From Schrodinger’s cat and Gilliam’s Twelve Monkeys to ancient Ouroboros, Spierigs’ Predestination and recent Arrival, we heard this story so many times, yet Irrational Games told it perfectly by messing around with time and multiverse. Flip this coin, it has an endless number of sides.\n\nIt’s all about balance. There is balance between shooting faceless enemies and thinking of possible scenarios, worrying sick about this amazing girl and fighting for someone else’s ideas, between this colorful bright world and darkness inside every one of us. Fun of killing in many different ways, fun of doing magic, fun of running around with such an usual companion and yet this strange unsettling feeling that bodes danger are all distributed equally. But it is not the danger it bodes, it is the tranquility of knowing things, of understanding that everything has its own place and time and everything should come to its logical end, except an infinite number of infinite universes. It’s all about balance. And balance means comprehension, comprehension means acceptance, what leads us to harmony. Equilibrium of forces in this and other realities and the serpent biting its tail. You know how it’s gonna end and it’s not you who is driving this train into the cold dark void but it doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the ride or at least the view from the window. You only live once (in every world) so make it count despite the fact you have no choice only fate.

Lembro que foi meu primeiro BioShock e não sabia o que esperar do jogo, mas com certeza não fiquei decepcionado, pelo contrário, fiquei extremamente impressionado com o quão imersivo, bem feito e divertido o jogo é.\n\nDentre os muitos pontos positivos os que pra mim mais se destacam são: o mundo do jogo, no caso, a cidade voadora de Columbia, que é tão bem feita e criada até os mínimos detalhes que você se imagina lá. Imagina como seria viver lá. \n\nIsso é fruto da brilhante combinação de uma trilha sonora linda + as músicas de época (1912) com a direção de arte impecável, que conseguiu dar ao jogo um visual único e marcante sem necessidade de fotorrealismo no gráfico, que continua muito bonito.\n\nO gameplay é fluído e divertido, graças aos diversos vigores (poderes especias), a vastidão dos cenários e a mecânica dos sky rails. Além da performance do jogo ser muito boa, desde que ele saiu em março de 2013 até hoje o jogo roda muito bem em PCs high-end, mid-end, low-end.\n\nE um dos melhores e mais importantes aspectos desse jogo é sem dúvida sua história. A narrativa é intrigante do início até o fim e a química que existe entre Booker e Elizabeth é tão boa que dá gosto ouvir as conversas deles, já que os personagens são bem pensados e muito bem dublados.\n\nEnfim, BioShock Infinite é muito bom, muito recomendado.\n\nNota: 9/10","timestamp_created":1479516207,"timestamp_updated":1561775006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587114334106445313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26674324","author":{"steamid":"76561198142220476","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":864,"last_played":1481399611},"language":"turkish","review":"Çok güzel bir oyun size mühteşem bir hikaye ve paradox sunucak kesinlikle oynayın.","timestamp_created":1479485675,"timestamp_updated":1479485675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26670971","author":{"steamid":"76561198048991480","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":6173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2305,"last_played":1482031730},"language":"brazilian","review":"Esse jogo é fantástico!!

I truly enjoyed my time spent there just as I did in Rapture from the original Bioshock games. The story kept me interested troughout, which says something as there is not many games that can do so today. I was never a big fan of having to search for small pieces of the story by finding audiotapes though especially when the story is this good. But that is just a minor detail and does not take away from the great story and world that has been created in this game.\n\nWhen it comes to the gameplay I have to say it is fun. There has been some complaints about it and I don't really see why, in my opinion the gameplay is better then the first two games. Especially the use of ADAM. The abilities looks great and feels rewarding. The gunplay also feels pretty smooth and is not clunky at all. I will say that towards the end of the game it gets a bit stale as you I never liked having to shoot an enemie in the head multiple times to get the kill. That might just be me thought as I am a big fan of long range sniping weapons as the sniper rifle and the hand cannon.\n\nOverall the game is great. If you are going to get it I would reccomend getting the dlc's as well. They might be a bit short, but they really sum up the bioshock series in a nice way and end it how a great series like this deserves.","timestamp_created":1479419853,"timestamp_updated":1479419853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26649646","author":{"steamid":"76561198336716380","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1370,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":313,"last_played":1638273175},"language":"russian","review":"The BEST","timestamp_created":1479411607,"timestamp_updated":1479411607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26642418","author":{"steamid":"76561198147256730","num_games_owned":768,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1007,"last_played":1480124964},"language":"schinese","review":"Masterpeice ! 9.8/10\n\n几乎没有短板，样样都是顶级。\n最impressive的三样：（不剧透请诸君自行感受）\n人物塑造\n故事深度\n艺术风格\n\n\n非要挑点不足的话：\n游戏性ok。基本战斗系统很丰富，可以玩出很多花样。但往往实际战斗时可能就用两三种比较好用的组合，游戏后期会略感重复\n枪械和近战手感都有点硬，但游戏背景是20世纪初，确实也不能要求更多","timestamp_created":1479380957,"timestamp_updated":1479426868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26634937","author":{"steamid":"76561198077300363","num_games_owned":557,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1564,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1488,"last_played":1479255042},"language":"english","review":"Just another good review\n\n\n\n\nkeep scrolling\nnothing special to see here","timestamp_created":1479327609,"timestamp_updated":1479327609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26634353","author":{"steamid":"76561198098283549","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59,"last_played":1608936560},"language":"english","review":"Anna\nWhat's up?

Slight spoiler alert, be advised.  The storyline is strong, and I was impressed by the complexities that were thrown in using variations of characters from multiple timeline/dimensions.  The floating city of Columbia is absolutely gorgeous...quite dreamlike.  I would have loved to have even more time to spend wandering the city before everything fell to ****.  The storyline is in the same universe as Rapture (and has some ties to events and characters in Rapture) but is mostly independent.  The DLC (Burial at Sea), however, is an awesome connection between the events in Rapture and Columbia.  Burial at Sea (1 and 2) is an excellent add-on to Bioshock Infinite, and I strongly suggest you play the DLC, too.  Seriously, get it.  Burial at Sea takes place in Rapture, for the most part, and gives you additional perspective on how the events in Rapture and Columbia are tied together, via multiple dimensions.  \n\nThis game makes you think, and that's a good thing.  There aren't too many of those nowadays, it seems.  \n\nI strongly recommend this game.  I simply caution you that the story is not really a continuation from the first or second Bioshock.  The feel of the game is a bit different, too.  It's Bioshock, but it is in a different city and a different time.  Remember that, and this will be one of your favorite games, as it is mine.","timestamp_created":1479179292,"timestamp_updated":1479179292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26608258","author":{"steamid":"76561198073798490","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2611,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2280,"last_played":1504573893},"language":"spanish","review":"10/10\nSin palabras...","timestamp_created":1479169810,"timestamp_updated":1479169810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574879229068756104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26604949","author":{"steamid":"76561198163300035","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":869,"last_played":1479155579},"language":"english","review":"Great story with a sad ending.\n10/10, would cry again.","timestamp_created":1479152634,"timestamp_updated":1479152634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26604134","author":{"steamid":"76561198048518634","num_games_owned":412,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1395597375},"language":"russian","review":"вы всё усугубили","timestamp_created":1479149493,"timestamp_updated":1479336526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499220788478851318","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26603781","author":{"steamid":"76561198072120428","num_games_owned":666,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":2165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1473,"last_played":1623077653},"language":"english","review":"Amazing story telling and mindblowing plot with brilliant game mechanism and level design.\n\n10/10-----\"It's all a matter of perspective.\"","timestamp_created":1479148198,"timestamp_updated":1479148198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26601430","author":{"steamid":"76561198166768803","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":1399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":502,"last_played":1618500450},"language":"schinese","review":"把妹把了这么久，突然告诉你她是你女儿！我……我……\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n不介意鬼父#(滑稽)","timestamp_created":1479138477,"timestamp_updated":1479986338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26600105","author":{"steamid":"76561198063375390","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1657,"last_played":1570611755},"language":"french","review":"Un jeu superbe, le monde est -comme ses prédecesseurs- vraiment immersif, on pourrait y vivre.

a good game, a mediocre Bioshock, it could have been much better if it didn't follow certain trends and they didn't forget to prioritize it being a videogame over a compelling story, and it shows\n\nThe Good:\n*The setting is the game's strongest point, a vibrant ultra-nationalist Edwardian era city floating in the sky, the feeling is similar to exploring Rapture for the first time\n*The Vigors are pretty good, but Charge and Undertow could have been expanded better, its sad to have a water tentacle power and not being able to pummel enemies with it\n*The story is pretty good even though it feels kinda weak late game because they tried to cram too much themes into it\n*The revolution subplot doesn't sticks to the \"revolutionaries are the good guys\" cliche, which is a breath of fresh air\n*Booker is a pretty good protagonist with an interesting past, I liked that better than the previous games tradition of making the protagonist a silent almost-blank slate\n*It has some pretty good characters even if a lot like Fink and Fitzroy were not explored enough and were thrown to the sidelines\n\nThe Neutral:\n*The game is pretty linear in comparison to the previous entries, I don't think this is neccesarily a bad thing but it can be to a lot of people\n*The way the story handles racism and religious fervor is pretty clumsy, all the white bystanders seem to talk of almost nothing but their prophet and the evils of the other races, wherever it's despiction of these themes works for the game or not is pretty subjective, and to be fair the first two games treated Ryan's and Lamb's philosophies with little subtlety too\n\nThe Bad:\n*As i said above, the story got too convulted for it's own good, by late game the conflict of the founders vs the vox populi seems like a trivial quarrel completely alien to you concerns\n*The actions and choices you make in the game ammount to no difference, even though the dialogue of some characters and the advice messages keep suggesting otherwise, likewise at the beginning of the game you get to choice different actions at certain situations, this feature completely dissapears after a little while\n*The weapons by far are the worst aspect the game, they handle more similarily to every other generic shooter, and instead of haveing a few realiable weapons with different ammo types that allow you to adapt to the situation, you get a plethora of mediocre and similarily functioning weapons from which you can only carry two at the time, I guess this is supposed to provide variety and force you to be creative, but in reality you will probably just end up specializing in whichever two close and long range weapons suit you better, the sniper rifle is laughably more useful than the rest of the weapons too\n*The armored RPG-wielding enemies are just a pain the ass, they take as much damage to die as a hard-hitter enemy but always spawn in hordes as normal enemies and have ridiculously good aim\n*Apart from the upgrades that reduce reload time all of the upgrades are insubstantial and the cool feature of the appearance of your weapon changing as you upgrade it is completely gone\n*The meele sky-hook attack is just pathetic, it's hard to land and barely does any damage, even if you are directly in frotn of the enemy you are better off using whatever weapon you have at hand or using a vigor than using it at all \n*Sky rails are hardly ever used outside of necessary island to island transportation even though it's one of the most prominently advertised aspects of the game\n*You never actually fight the Songbird nor there is any kind of final boss, because the creators thought it would make the game too \"videogamey\"

Всё это время я откладывал на потом её прохождение, потому что думал, что она не зацепит меня. Но как же я ошибался))\n\nИз плюсов:\n+Сюжет. Это именно тот стиль сюжета, который я обожаю: увлекательно, но очень запутанно, а в конце перед тобой раскрывают все карты. В схожести идеи приходят ассоциации в виде таких фильмов, как \"Остров Проклятых\", \"LOST\", \"Эффект Бабочки\";\n+Колумбия. Это очень красивый и проработанный город, который летает в небе и живёт по своим порядкам и законам. По началу он представляется нам как настоящий Новый Эдем, в котором красивая архитектура, всюду яркие и теплые краски, а также позитивные жители города. Но по ходу повествования сюжета Колумбия представляется нам и с другой стороны, более мрачной;\n+Элизабет. Красивая девушка, чей образ взят за основу с нашей любимой и прекрасной косплеершы Анны Молевой. Это такой персонаж, в котором есть то, что тебя цепляет, что-то прекрасное и невинное. Мало того, что это идеально проработанная героиня, так она еще и главный твой спаситель. Всегда подкинет деньжат, даст патроны, соли, аптечку или откроет разрыв с полезной шнягой, которая поможет в бою;\n+Персонажи. Игра полна интересных персонажей. Помимо основных двух, меня очень впечатлили \"Близнецы\" Лютесы и огромный киборг Соловей;\n+Графика. Игра 2013 года, казалось бы вроде графончик должен быть не очень, но как бы не так. Я играл и получал удовольствие от такой красивой картинки и мельчайшей детализации;\n+Музыка. Музыкальное сопровождение создаёт свою позитивную и местами угнетающую атмосферу;\n+Геймплей. Несмотря на линейность сюжета, можно так же проходить дополнительные задания, не менее интересные.\n+Философия. У сюжета Bioshock явно есть некий скрытый посыл. И как я считаю - это выбор. Вся последующая наша жизнь может зависеть лишь от одного нашего выбора, который порой может оказаться не самым простым. Опять же вспомнился фильм \"Господин Никто\".\n\n\nИз минусов:\n-Стелс. В таком хорошем шутере можно убивать врагов сломя голову или более аккуратно, но устранять их бесшумно игра не позволяет, хотя предпосылки к такой возможности есть в одной из миссии;\n-NPC. Никакого взаимодействия с местным окружением, и местами никакой реакции от них, печаль;\n-Затянутость. Порой казалось, что были ненужные моменты в игре, которые нужны, чтобы расстянуть часы геймплея. Ну это очень мелкая придирка.\n\nПосле прохождения Bioshock Infinite меня просто переполняли эмоции. Это была именна та игра, которой мне давненько не хватало. Она надолго останется в моей памяти. Можно долго над ней думать и рассуждать. Биошок - это как шикарное кино, над финалом которого следует поразмышлять. Тебе нужно пересмотреть его, чтобы все непонятные моменты встали на своим места, и только тогда ты получишь максимум удовольствия. Своих денег игра стоит определенно. Не купить её и не пройти - это себя не уважать, если вы любите шутеры от 1-го лица с глубоким сюжетом.\n\n9.5/10","timestamp_created":1479058266,"timestamp_updated":1479058266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26584108","author":{"steamid":"76561198056062529","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2042,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1638,"last_played":1479052928},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game, played it again for the second time!

In 1901, against the government's wishes, Columbia brutally and violently put an end to the Boxer Rebellion in Peking. This event revealed the floating city as a heavily armed aerial battleship, capable of unleashing devastation across the world.[8] The American government subsequently demanded Columbia's return to sovereign soil, and, in response, Columbia seceded from the United States and disappeared into the clouds, its location soon lost to everyone else.Free from outside influence, Comstock now had complete control over the city, transforming it from a floating world's fair to a theocratic police state.\n\nUnder Comstock's rule, Columbia became a militant pseudo-Christian utopian society that worshiped him as a divine prophetic figure and the Founding Fathers of the United States as religious icons. Despite Columbia's apparent utopian exteriors, it is soon revealed to be a hidden dystopia.Institutional racism and elitism are widespread in the city, with white supremacy of the upper and middle classes heavily enforced by the government as law.Despite the drive for racial purity in Columbia, people of minority races are brought in to the city as a source for cheap labor. They are the underclass of Columbia, and serve mainly as slaves or indentured servants. As a result of this subjugation, minorities are largely relegated to menial and hard labor with no obvious opportunity for upward mobility. Racial segregation is also heavily enforced within the city, to the point where interracial couples face the risk of a public stoning.\n\nBy the time of the game's events, racial tensions have risen to the point where Columbia is on the verge of civil war that's waged between the ruling \"Founders\" and the insurgent \"Vox Populi,\" two factions with strongly opposing ideologies. The Founders, led by Comstock, are the prevailing political faction in the city, and are the rulers of Columbia. The city's ruling class, they are the racist ultra-nationalists who seek to keep Columbia's privileges purely for White American citizens while denying the same right to foreigners.The Vox Populi (Latin for \"Voice of the People\"), led by Daisy Fitzroy, are a rag-tag anarchist-communist resistance group who fight to restore the rights of Columbian citizenship to people of all races and religions. However, years of bitter struggle have driven them to fight the opposition more out of blind hatred, resulting in more violent and brutal methods.\n\nIn addition to the internal strife, Columbia is ravaged by \"Tears\" in the fabric of space-time.Being the result of past scientific experiments, these Tears reveal alternate universes, and allow for interaction with them. While most Columbian citizens regard these Tears as mere curiosity, some individuals have exploited the insight offered by them to create radically new weapons and technologies, while several others have replicated futuristic music and songs heard from the Tears, bringing anachronistic elements into the Columbia of 1912.\n\nAs with BioShock and BioShock 2, the player is able to locate audio logs—Voxophones—and film projectors—Kinetoscopes—that will expand on the history and nature of Columbia beyond those events occurring within the game.Though the game takes place before the events of the previous two BioShock games (occurring in 1960 for BioShock and in 1968 for BioShock 2), the question of whether Infinite occurs within this same timeline remains unanswered.","timestamp_created":1478997693,"timestamp_updated":1478997693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26569681","author":{"steamid":"76561198131358621","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":458,"last_played":1506300075},"language":"english","review":"what a amazin game, i was so thrilled to buy this and no word of a doubt i didnt regreat buying because of good the story line was. it was a mind-blowing experience to see how it all began and ended.","timestamp_created":1478993316,"timestamp_updated":1478993316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26569453","author":{"steamid":"76561198056399160","num_games_owned":292,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1023,"last_played":1479927396},"language":"russian","review":"Игра вышла 3 года назад и поразила нас самая лучшая серия игр из всех которая была на мой счет.

Лютес, \"Преграды на пути между измерениями\", 1889.\n     Покупал эту игру, потому что в тот момент все про неё только и твердили, мол: \"Биошок отлиная серия, в неё стоит поиграть, и вообще что это не игра, а шедевр\", и заете что? не зря твердили. С самых первых минут игры я не совсем понимал что к чему (имея ввиду сюжет, конечно). Зачем этот мужик, за котрого мы играем, плывёт на лодке с двумя такими же неизвестными мне людьми к какому-то маяку? (Потом-то пройдя первую часть трилогии игры до меня дошло, что маяк это некая фича) Почему этот маяк отправляет нас куда-то в космос в небесный город? Зачем какому-то четвёртому мужику какая-то девушка для уплаты долга? Почему? Зачем? Что это? Как? - примерно такие вопросы  вы будете задавать проходя эту игру, ну да ладно... Естественно по мере прохождения вам всё объясняется и повествуется. Игра поистинне сносит вам крышу, ибо сюжет здесь нереально качественно проработан, хотя что это я, тут всё нереально качественно проработано: графика, геймлей, разнообразие оружия и энергетиков (местные заклинания), персонажи, да просто всё, но сюжет я выделяю особенно ярко, ведь в суть всей концепции сюжета лично я вник только с четвёртого прохождения, и то немного почитав на вики некоторые нюансы. Я не понимаю, ты что, всё ещё читаешь этот обзор? Ты просто обязан купить игру в которой прекрасно всё. Это не просто игра, это игра - легенда, она не забудится, ведь в наше время мало выпускается игр, где разработчики делают упор не на деньги, заработанные с покупок игры, а на интерес со стороны игроков.\n      Игра однозанчно стоит своих денег, и я ни сколько не жалею, что потратил кровно выпрошанные у мамки 1000 рублей (ну ладно пиз*жу, я по скидке покупал) и потраченные 80 часов геймлея.\nP.S.
