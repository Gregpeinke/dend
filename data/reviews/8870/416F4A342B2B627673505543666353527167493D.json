If you've ever played Bioshock before, I highly recommend this game as well as the season pass. If you've never played a Bioshock game before, this game will still make sense, however the DLC's may not. I would recommend holding off on playing the season pass until you play the first Bioshock. A summary is available for the game but playing through the first game would make the DLC's better than just listening to a summary of the events. Onto the main game, I love pretty much everything about it, the gameplay is just as fun as the previous 2 Bioshocks and the settings in my opinion is 10x better than Rapture.

bin mit BioShock Infintite in die BioShock-Reihe eingestiegen und habe mir dann im Nachgang auch gleich die ersten beiden Spiele geholt. Besonders angetan haben es mir die Story und die Charaktere von Infinite, die mich mit Blick auf die Wendungen und das Ende überzeugen konnten. Hinsichtlich der Story eines der besten Spiele, die ich bisher gespielt habe.\nIm Gegensatz zu den ersten beiden Teilen spielt Infinite allerdings nicht unter Wasser, sondern in den Wolken der Stadt Columbia. Als Booker DeWitt erhalten wir den Auftrag eine Person Namens Elizabeth zu retten, was sich allerdings leichter anhört, als es letzten Endes ist. Über die Story hinweg erfahren wir mehr über Elizabeth und Booker und schlussendlich auch, was es mit ihrer Rettung auf sich hat. Das ein oder andere Fragezeichen bleibt allerdings auch noch nach dem ersten Durchlauf bestehen, was in meinen Augen den Wiederspielwert noch einmal steigert. Gleiches gilt für die beiden Dlcs, die mir ebenfalls sehr gut gefallen haben und uns in das Setting der ersten beiden Teile entführen.\n\nDer gewählte \"Grafikstil\" gefällt mir ebenfalls sehr gut und steht ein Stück weit im Widerspruch zu dem von Rassismus, Religiösen Fanatismus und Ausbeutung geprägten Setting der Stadt Columbia. \n\nDas Kampfsystem bietet Dank dem Zugriff auf die Fähigkeiten von Booker und Elizabeth (sofern sie euch gerade begleitet) eine gute Abwechslung zu den vorhandenen Waffen und ergänzt das Ganze noch einmal.\n\nEinziger Kritikpunkt ist die fehlende Möglichkeit selbständig zu speichern.\n\nAlles in allem kann ich das Spiel mit Blick auf die gelungene Story und die Charaktere allerdings nur empfehlen.","timestamp_created":1603802845,"timestamp_updated":1606662916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78232104","author":{"steamid":"76561198100076491","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1505,"last_played":1484833935},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1603801656,"timestamp_updated":1603801656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78231454","author":{"steamid":"76561198280975790","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":111,"playtime_forever":754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1623659930},"language":"english","review":"i
