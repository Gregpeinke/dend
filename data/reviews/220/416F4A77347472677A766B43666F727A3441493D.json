привет,сегодня я бы хотел рассказать свое мнение об игре Half-Life 2,сразу говорю в Half-Life 1 я играл,но полностью его не проходил и также дополнения(Opposing Force,Blue Shift,Decay),но и без этого смог полностью погрузиться в игру.Что касается сюжета,мы будем играть за Гордона Фримена(это главный герой серии игр Half- Life,имеет учёную степень доктора философии в области физики).спустя несколько десятилетий после событий Half-Life загадочный G-Man пробуждает Гордона Фримена из стазиса, довольно туманно намекнув, что тому предстоят великие дела.И после этого в игре начинается полный хаос и экшен.В этой части по мере прохождения сюжета будут появляться персонажи которые присутствовали в Half-Life 1,а также новые,некоторые странные и безумные личности.Что касается графики?Я такой человек что вообще не привередлив к графике,я могу играть хоть в самом низком разрешении и с самыми  низкими настройками и мне будет нормально),некоторые играют в игру чтобы насладиться графикой,некоторые чтобы получить эмоции от сюжета,лично я играю в игру чтобы в большой степени получить эмоции от сюжета,а не от графики.А если смотреть на то что игра 2004 года,то графика здесь хорошая.Также в игре есть много разнообразных врагов,которые ясное дело будут пытаться нас убить.Многие враги, знакомые по Half-Life, появляются и в Half-Life 2 — это хедкрабы, барнаклы и зомби.Но в основном мы будет сражаться с войсками Альянса( это вымышленная организация из вселенной серии игр Half-Life).Помимо всего выше упомянутого мне понравились композиции к Half-Life 2, вроде простые мелодии,но вызывают какие-то  ностальгические и особенные эмоции.Вдобавок ко всему на 2008 год игра была продана в количестве более 6.5 миллионов, не учитывая продажи через сервис Steam.В придачу ко всему игра получила огромное количество,такие как:   Лучшая игра десятилетия — Spike VGA 10,Лучший сюжет — Игромания,Игра года на PC — GIGA GAMES AWARD 2005 и так далее.Чтож думаю следующий обзор сделаю по продолжению Half-Life 2,а именно Half-Life 2: Episode One.Всем спасибо за прочтение и удачи!)","timestamp_created":1621936604,"timestamp_updated":1621940516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92562710","author":{"steamid":"76561198823707953","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":835,"last_played":1613389540},"language":"schinese","review":"吊炸天","timestamp_created":1621935653,"timestamp_updated":1621935653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92561591","author":{"steamid":"76561198029084786","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7553,"last_played":1649156595},"language":"koreana","review":"겁나

Un FPS único que, a pesar de sus mas de 10 años, ha envejecido de maravilla. No solo por sus gráficas, que son increíbles a comparación de otros productos estrenados el 2004. Al jugar Half Life 2, gozaras de escenarios bien diseñados, usualmente abiertos y llenos de detalles. No solo eso, pues estos escenarios están repletos en vida y desafíos para los jugadores, los cuales tendrán que enfrentarse a varios enemigos con un completo armamento que se ira recolectando por todo el gameplay. Ravenholm, Nova Prospekt o Ciudad 17, todos son escenarios donde se desarrollan las batallas de nosotros, el heroico Gordon Freeman. \n\nSoy consiente que este intento de \"reseña\" es corto, pero quería evitar Spoiler y no alargarme mucho para una reseña de Steam... \n\n","timestamp_created":1621907591,"timestamp_updated":1621907591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622425615787506104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92549792","author":{"steamid":"76561198145179897","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":55,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1624840999},"language":"spanish","review":"Al re pedo la Reseña, no hay nada que criticar de este juego.
