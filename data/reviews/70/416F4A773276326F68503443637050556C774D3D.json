Bez Half Life, nie byłoby Valve, a bez Valve nie byłoby Steama, CSGO, TF2 i wielu innych gier.\n========\n Fabuła \n========\nJesteś Gordonem Freemanem, dwudziestosiedmioletnim naukowcem pracującym w Black Mesa - tajnym ośrodkiem badawczym. \nRutynowy eksperyment okazał się katastrofą; spowodował on tzw. Kaskadę Rezonansową, czyli fikcyjne wydarzenie które oznacza rozdarcie czasoprzestrzeni. W ośrodku Black Mesa (później na całej planecie) pojawiają się kosmici z Xen (lub Świata Granicznego). Pojawia się też wojsko, którego zadaniem jest zabicie i kosmitów, i naukowców, wliczając Gordona, który próbuje przeżyć.\n=========\nUzbrojenie\n=========\nUzbrojenia w Half Life nie brakuje. Od najzwyklejszych MP5 i strzelb do potężnych broni laserowych. Wytłumaczeniem, dlaczego Gordon może przeżyć eksplozje, postrzał i inne obrażenia jest to, że nosi on Kombinezon HEV, czyli kombinezon ochronny zapewniający bezpieczeństwo i wygodę użytkownikowi.\n=========\nPrzeciwnicy\n=========\nA jest na czym używać naszego arsenału. Między innymi Headcraby, próbujące zamienić gracza w zombie, Vortigaunty, rażące Gordona prądem czy żołnierze, używający skomplikowanych taktyk. Każdy przeciwnik ma swoje słabości, na przykład Vortigaunt musi ,,naładować\" swój atak przed wystrzałem, pozwalając graczowi na strzał. Przeciwników jest dużo, wymienienie ich zajęłoby dużo czasu. Najlepiej zagrać i dowiedzieć się o nich samemu.\n=========\nMultiplayer\n=========\nHalf Life oferuje też niesamowity tryb multiplayer typu deathmatch, znany z Quake czy Doom. Po mapie porozrzucane są bronie, każdy na każdego.\n=========\nOcena końcowa\n=========\nSą błędy, i okropne części, ale jest to wciąż niesamowita gra. Absolutny klasyk, w który każdy szanujący się fan fpsów powinien zagrać.\n8.5/10","timestamp_created":1640901429,"timestamp_updated":1640901429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.687562823295593262","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106936105","author":{"steamid":"76561198112387911","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1728,"last_played":1640912428},"language":"english","review":"I should have not waited decades do play this game.

It's one of the those rare games that it's attempt at what we know as the modern fps format was legendary at the time, but has caused it to be left in the dust as time moves on. If it were even older I feel like it wouldn't feel this way (goldeneye/doom) but sadly it does.\nThat being said I played it without accessing the console whatsoever, so i didn't noclip to get out of spots where i'd get stuck in the wall or if there was a bug or anything. Played it totally vanilla. And If that's how you choose to play it then my rating should be Not Recommended instead. That playstyle truly reveals how much wrong there is in this game. I got glitches or stuck in the wall damn near a hundred times by the end of the game. Extremely frustrating. It was overall an enjoyable experience when it functioned however. And I think the overall world and story was worth playing, pretty neat. But I won't be playing it again, at least not in this format. I am excited to move on to the second game as it will be my first time seriously playing that game all the way through.\n\ntldr; Great game for the time, but it's dated of course. Lots of bugs...

The gun play is clean if you get creative and try to use all of the weapons and think out actions the way a theoretical physicist would can make the game really fun and enjoyable. I think the only downside is the graphics are hard to get past for some people. Try this game again and don't play it like doom. As the tag line on the box said. RUN. THINK. SHOOT.

However, many people probably won't think so. There's a lot of jank in terms of level design and the shooting  is kinda unforgiven.

If anything don't let the things I don't like in the game overshadow your interest. It's just small flaws I found when playing it. it's also not that bad for the price of the game.\n\n Overall, this game is a 9.5/10 for me. Go ahead and purchase a copy for yourself if you have some spare money like $10 or over and if you are interested in it.","timestamp_created":1640822468,"timestamp_updated":1640822468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2v2ohP4CcpPUlwM="}
