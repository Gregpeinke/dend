Most of my difficulties were with the physics of jumping/landing, ladders, and getting killed by fans/turbines that I was seemingly well clear of.

No decorrer do jogo, com o objetivo de não morrer, você acaba matando vários HECU e Black-Ops, os deixando enfurecidos e sua cabeça colocada como \"prêmio\".\nAdorei esse tipo de situação, sobreviver em um lugar fora de controle e cheio de destruição onde todos querem te matar.\n\nO que não gostei no jogo foi a IA, o inimigo nem te vê e já sabe sua localização, porém, gostei do fato deles não serem burros a ponto de ficarem parados tomando tiro, já não basta eles procurarem proteção, eles também jogam granadas e, às vezes, perto de morrer, colocam granadas no chão com a esperança do jogador chegar perto, o que acaba acontecendo quando não notado a ação. Eles também possuem lança- \n -granadas, esses projéteis são muito rápidos e letais e os inimigos quando te vêem reagem muito rápido para lançá-los na sua direção. Joguei na maior dificuldade e está sendo uma experiência agradável, mas sofrível ao mesmo tempo.\n\nAs escadas são bem chatas, não possuindo um botão de ação para essa situação, você acaba ficando em dúvida com forma correta de descer. No decorrer do jogo há um tipo de \"trampolim\" que parece uma pereba e acaba sendo chato, na primeira vez, descobrir como aquilo funciona, tem situações em que você vai ser perseguido e vai precisar não cometer deslizes, ou então é game over.\nComo mencionei antes, sobre o inimigo saber sua localização, tem um maldito helicóptero que sabe onde você está, mesmo você entrando em túneis e tudo mais, parece que a HEV Suit de Gordon ter um dispositivo de localização foi só uma desculpa, esse jogo não tem furtividade, nem mesmo headshots funcionam.\nOutro fator que me deixou decepcionado foi a música não durar muito, há partes em que a música gera uma certa adrenalina, a música do jogo é excelente, uma pena não durar muito, eu salvo o jogo em partes que toca uma música legal, como a quando você pega a Tau Gun e a quando você sai de um cano que liga a um penhasco e passa um caça e toca o tema da Valve.\n\nA história de Half-Life é muito bacana, os gráficos não são um problema para mim, mas se você se incomoda com isso, você pode comprar a versão feita por fãs chamada Black Mesa.
