Отличная графика для своего времени, а это был 2004 год. Проходил игру не раз. Сюжет потрясающий, но для полноты нужно проходить эпизоды 1,2 (это не минус, а плюс). Звуковое  сопровождение тоже отличное. Игра по своей сути ещё и хоррор.\nЕдинственное то, что немного деревянно как-то все как в шутерах конца девяностых или начала 2000-x - типа call of duty...имею ввиду открытие дверей и взаимодействие с окружающим миром. Например, чтобы открыть дверь я жму кнопку действия и дверь открывается сама - нет анимации рук. Персонаж перемещается деревянно, не видно что во время ходьбы он бы как-то двигал руками - оружие в руках и оно не движется.\nОдин минус - деревянность.","timestamp_created":1480225482,"timestamp_updated":1480225482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27777231","author":{"steamid":"76561198066092394","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":925,"last_played":1466916362},"language":"brazilian","review":"História, jogabilidade, ação, física.\nnota 10\n\nCadê \"Half-Life 3\"?","timestamp_created":1480225266,"timestamp_updated":1480225266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27776207","author":{"steamid":"76561198169153531","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":430,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1482354528},"language":"spanish","review":"Necesitamos Half Life 3","timestamp_created":1480224478,"timestamp_updated":1480224478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27774985","author":{"steamid":"76561198027591545","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4304,"last_played":1374082039},"language":"english","review":"What else is there to say?

Os cenários são sua fonte de conhecimento, as informações estão dispersas por onde você passa. Ninguém te diz o que a Universal Union faz, já fez, ou almeja alcançar. E nem precisa, você descobre sozinho. E, não é só o enredo que segue essa lógica, as mecanicas do jogo são introduzidas de forma similar. Coisas extremamente relevantes são ensinadas a todo momento sem ficar na cara.\n\nOs exemplos são incontáveis, mas há um interessante bem no inicio do jogo: Você está próximo de um corredor infestado de Barnacles (aka puxa com a lingua), matar todos para prosseguir seria tedioso e gastaria muita munição. A solução correta é jogar barris explosivos no corredor e deixa-los puxar com a lingua. Mas, estamos no inicio do jogo (e um jogo com física sem precedentes na época), como introduzir essa noção ao jogador? O mais comum são tutoriais ou companions jogando essa informação na sua cara, provavelmente através de dialogos. HL, no entanto, se baseia no learn by experience: Há uma sala, pouco antes da citada anteriormente, na qual você esbarra em um barril não-explosivo. Tal barril está num plano inclinado, o que o faz rolar downhill, na direção de dois Barnacles. Inevitavelmente, um dos barnacles puxa o barril (e logo cuspe, sem efeitos colaterais). See? O jogo acabou de te ensinar uma mecanica!\n\nEsse é o exemplo mais cabal, em um dos primeiros capítulos do jogo. Agora imagine isso pelo jogo inteiro, visto que mecanicas novas são introduzidas a todo momento. É genial. Em suma, esse é um dos jogos mais bem elaborados de todos os tempos, se nunca jogou, vale a pena.","timestamp_created":1480222313,"timestamp_updated":1480229685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623882174491882324","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27773248","author":{"steamid":"76561198200229337","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":124,"playtime_at_review":728,"last_played":1660568378},"language":"koreana","review":"빠루","timestamp_created":1480222029,"timestamp_updated":1480222029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27772962","author":{"steamid":"76561198007818234","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1587823381},"language":"russian","review":"игра норм, ждем продолжение )","timestamp_created":1480221785,"timestamp_updated":1480221785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27772626","author":{"steamid":"76561198255673063","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":583,"last_played":1600960279},"language":"english","review":"pen is  balls","timestamp_created":1480221510,"timestamp_updated":1523499935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27772584","author":{"steamid":"76561198207453379","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":571,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1527095118},"language":"english","review":"Very awesome and Unique game, the plot is layed out so nicely and its constantly leaving you in deep thoughts and leaving you to think outside the box, along with throwing yourself into deep thought with constant questions about the game that force you to connect the dots,  and figure things out yourself!

Each weapon is extremely fun to use, and offers different playstyles. You can be a long range sniper with the crossbow, an up close and personal monster with the shotgun, an explosive deviant with the Rocket Launcher or Grenades, or you can just walk up and smash a Combine Soldier's head in with a crowbar. Gameplay is smooth, flawless, and the power of the Source Engine makes it feel like a real battle. Easy mode is easy, Hard mode is hard. Then, Valve does what revolutionized gaming back during Half Life 1, with a perfect blend between story and gameplay, OBLITERATING the use of Cinematic cut-scenes as they mold them into the game itself. Verdict: 10/10\n\nStory: Half Life 2's Story, is VERY good. You wake up, twenty years after the Black Mesa Incident, and the entire world is taken over. Wait, what? You beat the Nihilanth, you SAVED Earth, what happened? Don't fret, Half Life 2 brings a PERFECT reasoning for it. You walk out of the train station, after witnessing the brutality of the Civil Protection that inhabit it, only to come face to face, with the monolithic Citadel, the symbol of the Combine's power. It stands far up in the sky, and you can see it from most out door areas in the game too! The story puts in a sense of urgency as you have to do the impossible, defeat the Combine Empire. Verdict: 10/10\n\nMusic: Music in Half Life 2 is phenomonal. You see, a problem in a lot of games is that they try to be TOO good with their music. They make the music so independent of the game, that it almost seems like a different part of it, a droning tune in the background while you slaughter demons or conquer a City. Half Life 2, on the other hand, perfects it. Ambience is a HUGE part of the soundtrack. The music isn't just music, it's the game itself. For instance, there comes a point where you must traverse under a huge bridge, trains roaming over head. With each train comes the rattling of the metal supports you climb over, a tense moment, and then the ambience kicks in, a slow overtone as it heightens your senses, making you pray that you don't fall to your death. But of course, ambience isn't the only part. There come plenty of moments where the music is active, action packed, and with high intensity as you fight off Headcrab Zombies, or mow down Overwatch Soldiers. Verdict: 10/10\n\nBugs/Glitches: Bugs, are always existent in games. Some games have more than others, and some are harder to find, or may require exploitation to discover. Half Life 2, like all games, has its bugs and glitches. However, you can go throughout the entire game without experiencing a single bug. Now, there is only ONE bug that can be quite a problem, and that is simply because the game is not exactly optimized for modern software, which includes a graphical error which removes a lot of lighting details. This is easily fixable. Verdict: 9/10\n\nGraphics: This game was made in 2004, and yet, at the Highest Setting, this game still looks VERY nice for 2016. It has aged very well, and it has good graphics in the first place! While they aren't phenomonal compared to now, they are certainly good for their time. Verdict: 8/10\n\nSummary:\n\nThis has to be one of, if not, THE BEST game I have ever played. It revolutionized the FPS genre and DESTROYED the challenge of being a worthy sequel.\n\nFinal Verdict: 10/10","timestamp_created":1480200993,"timestamp_updated":1480200993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27744384","author":{"steamid":"76561198205015283","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1547,"last_played":1615210273},"language":"english","review":"Gud","timestamp_created":1480200956,"timestamp_updated":1500075854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27744177","author":{"steamid":"76561198050390077","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":528,"last_played":1610041861},"language":"english","review":"Do a fu**** sequel!!!!","timestamp_created":1480200841,"timestamp_updated":1543191394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27743472","author":{"steamid":"76561198062202606","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":3233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3233,"last_played":1467771213},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games to date.

Да и к тому же способ его подачи  - фишка всей серии.   \n[*] Дизайн локаций продумывался ДЛЯ сюжета и игрового процесса. \n[spoiler]Это признак правильного подхода.

Когда все в игре сосредотачивается на истории (и нтересной его подаче)  -  это чревато  появлением многих и многих сценарных и геймплейных находок. Вот и здесь так. Уже упомянутый подход к повествованию; физика объектов  и то, что её можно применять не только для красивых взрывов; лицевая анимация (даже сейчас прилично смотриться); по делу применяемая музыка (саундтрек к тому же самодостаточен + отлично слушается отдельно) и много еще чего.
