You can play and make your own chambers by yourself or with another person. The options are almost limitless.\n\nDid I mention this game only costs $9.99 when it’s not on sale?

It is.)\n\nThis is a contributing factor to why we in the PC community just love Valve. With many releases over the years from Counterstrike to Half-Life, this seemed different and rightfully so. When Portal one was released we'd had very little in the way of first-person puzzle games so naturally Portal was an instant success. When Valve announced a second Portal, some were sceptical that it could live up to the height of it's previous incarnation. But much like other things made by Valve, the second version was even better. \n\n[b]Positives for a Valve Fanboy/girl[/b]\n- Everything here is fantastic work\n[b]Negatives for a Valve Fanboy/girl[/b]\n- Nothing here could be classed as bad. Everything is perfect.\n\n[b]Positives[/b]\n- The dialogue from the characters is some of the funniest I've ever heard.\n- The voice acting is absolutely perfect. Ellen Mclain is as menacing or perhaps moreso than she was in the first Portal, Stephen Merchant's Wheatley is possibly my favourite AI in history, and J.K. Simmons as a certain other character is hilarious as well. I think the real highlight of the reel though is Chell's voice actor. On point.\n- The testing is more fun than in the previous game with more interesting testing elements such as Gels, Light bridges and those polarity funnel... things. Oh, and you can make your own tests. Not in the fashion say Valve would make them, but in a simplified fashion. Though if you really want to see how it was done by Valve search [i]\"Portal 2 Hammer\"[/i] in your web browser.\n- One of the best soundtracks you could listen to, and it's free to download when you buy the game.\n\n[b]Negatives[/b]\n- Sometimes, the story and the gameplay kinda crash into each other. Through no fault of it's own, the game becomes inconsistent with its timeline. Sometimes you're given mad rushes as you are sent flying through the air, but then you fall flat on your face. Portal one never had a problem with this and although I'm all up for a change in pace, I'm not confident that some of the times the change of page was appropriate. [spoiler] During that escape sequence with Wheatley, I just wanted to tell him to, you know... \"P**s off\" so to speak. I just wanted to play the actual game and eat the cake, I didn't want the icing (I mean the story) at that time.[/spoiler]\n- F**king plotholes everywhere!\n- The removal of Energy pellets. Look, I know they weren't fully removed but they weren't there as testing elements. I thank the creators of the *BEE MOD for giving the user more testing elements such as NRG pellets to put back into the game.\n\nI give this game a 10/10, though. \n\"Hey, that's pretty good\"\n\n\nIf you're new to the PC platform there's no doubt this is one of the best games for you to get. If you're looking to get into the FPS genre but don't want to be thrown in at the deep end instantly this serves as some excellent practice. I may have listed some minor quibbles I have with this game above but the last two shouldn't be paid attention to if you're new. \nIf you're not new to PC, excuse me for being unsure why this isn't in your Steam library yet.\n\nThank you for reading this long.

Portal 2 edges over the first game in ratings - but you won't get the jokes and you will miss out on the story - and some pretty neat puzzles. Besides it's only a few hours. Play both and it's probably a 6-10 hour game all up. \n\nPortal Two. Absolute classic game - I replay it every now and then to feel clever. Yea I just re-read that in the Wheatley voice. And what an awesome character Wheatley is - truly one of the funniest you will see in a game - that's if you don't count Glados and Cave Johnson. It's a fun puzzle game - looks stylish - great level design - great story - great characters and great bonus of being able to make your own 'test maps' - and play a billion other peoples 'test maps'. Review done - the rest is ranty garbage.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that it may be THE reason that Half Life 3 - has been shelved - permanently.  Nobody foresaw the success of the first Portal game and I'm betting Valve (the developers) shat their pants at the overwhelming positive response to the second Portal game (in a good way). Having both Apecture Science and Black Mesa linked in a common universe means there's NO WAY you cannot include the hero from Portal in the NEXT Hallife game SOMEHOW. In terms of story narrative and gaming mechanics - I'd be betting that'd be a nightmare. In my opinion - given the already HUGE weight of somehow finishing the story of Half Life 2 - PLUS - the ridiculous success of the Portal series - AND the impending 'crossover' that NEEDS to happen for both - Valve just 'let it go' - and went - \n\n\"Well how's about we do nothing? - that's a WAYYY better option than risking the integrity of BOTH series Isn't it?\"\n\nAnd as much as I wanted to see the 3rd game in both series on the calendar - I kinda LOVED that call. Games are so disposable now - an estimated 15 hour game gets beaten in 2 hours by some maniacs.  \"NOT WORTH THE MONEY\" \"What a piece of Shovelware!\" \"PS2 graphics lol\" ... Valve releasing games have been cornerstones in gaming history - and I'm betting they are waiting for that next opportunity to hit that 'cornerstone' - trouble is - that day isn't coming. VR will NOT be the release format of HL3 - things aren't going to be much better than Unreal4 - or whatever thier rivals - that tech has plateaued - until the days we can get a proper data-jack to brains - and who knows when the hell that will happen? So Half-Life 3 would have to be released in a (modified) current format - and not some super-special new engine - and just be able to stand on it's own - something that would include BOTH the gameplay of Half-Life AND Portal games. The narrative would have to include both game series and 'tie up' - what the combine are - what the Nostralis ship is - what happens to Chelle, what happens to Freeman and Alex - how Earth is saved - and how the G-Man has been integral to the whole story.\n\nPLUS HALF LIFE 3 HAS TO BE BETTER THAN EVERYTHING EVER! So... no pressure eh? \n\n","timestamp_created":1474799338,"timestamp_updated":1474799338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25689078","author":{"steamid":"76561198028339889","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":608,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":507,"last_played":1567261080},"language":"english","review":"no need to check the reviews.
