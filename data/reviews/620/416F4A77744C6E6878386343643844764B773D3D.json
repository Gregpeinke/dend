Auch den Humor fand ich noch etwas besser als in Teil 1.\n\nIch empfand die Story als ziemlich lang, manche Rätsel sind dann auch ziemlich knackig (für mich jedenfalls. :D), wobei ich da dann teilweise auch mehrere Anläufe gebraucht habe. \n\nDazu kommt noch der Co-Op-Modus, der sich wahlweise mit Freunden oder auch mit Wildfremden spielen lässt. Beides kein Problem, man kann sich auch ohne Headset über kleinere Emoticons unterhalten, auch die Rätsel funktionieren mit einer Art Bildsprache auch sehr gut.\n\nUnd dann natürlich noch der Steam-Workshop. Ich finde es großartig, was die Community immer noch für Portal 2 entwickelt und welche Arten von Rätsel, aber auch Rennen usw. man dort finden und spielen kann. \n\nAlles in Allem würde ich das Spiel auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen! Wenn man allerdings nicht mal den ersten Teil gespielt hat (was er definitiv wert ist!!!), dann sollte man auf Portal 2 auch lieber verzichten.

Knifflig, jedoch sehr gut im Thema \"Balance zwischen Kniffligkeit und Spaß\".\n\nMeine ABSOLUTE Lieblings Feature in den Spiel ist der Workshop. Einfach zu wissen, dass man in sein Spiel seine Vorstellung von Kniffligen Tests veröffentlichen kann, ist WOW!\n\n\nIch würde das Spiel ein 9/10 geben.\n\nDanke für's lesen!","timestamp_created":1406908132,"timestamp_updated":1480351791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11506320","author":{"steamid":"76561198041598166","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1409584848},"language":"russian","review":"Крутооооооооооооооооо!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n","timestamp_created":1406899830,"timestamp_updated":1406899830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529411792755126953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11505530","author":{"steamid":"76561197970873393","num_games_owned":705,"num_reviews":236,"playtime_forever":221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1380408587},"language":"german","review":"[  → Must Have  ← ]","timestamp_created":1406895679,"timestamp_updated":1421731596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11505433","author":{"steamid":"76561198142001891","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":936,"last_played":1604816146},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game!

Whitch alows you to share your mind-burning puzzels with the world!\n\nChallenge maps are back! Challenge mas let you play bits of the game with a goal, like being a cheapscape by placing the least amount of portals, or you could have a heart of a Speedrunner by completing a chamber in the least amount of time possibal. Your score will be public wouldwide. Coop also has challenge maps.\n\nIts a good game in my opinion 8.9/10\n","timestamp_created":1406865914,"timestamp_updated":1406865914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11500840","author":{"steamid":"76561198135653377","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4776,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":367,"last_played":1637983283},"language":"english","review":"Very fun recommend to anyone who wants to play a game!
