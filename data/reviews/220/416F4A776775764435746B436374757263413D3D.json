There is so much more that plague this game with the progression while being interesting in approach still revels in its own filler. The story is the only saving grace from the terrible gameplay which is unfortunate. 2004 is an amazing year of grand titles like DooM 3, Butcher Bay, San Andreas, Far Cry, Halo 2, UT2004, and what was to come in 2005. I prefer any of those over Half Life 2. Half Life 2, while being overtly dated with graphics was much more enjoyable and grasping then what is Half Life 2 and its cliff hanger episodes. In that regard, we dont need a Half Life 3 and Half Life 2 defines those problems.

The controls were fluent, the A.I was decent, and the story (although confusing from an outsiders point of view) was good! I liked a lot about the game, and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun first person shooter with about a 9 hour (casually playing) story.\n\n     There wasn't much I disliked about the game in all honesty. One of the biggest and only things I can think of is the squad based A.I. It's definitely one of the better ones I've seen in most games of this catergory, especially for the squad aspect to be minuscule in this game. With that being said; it is extremely annoying when you have A.I that don't know the meaning of personal space. One of the biggest problems this causes is when you are crammed into closer quarter battles like [i]Nova Prospekt[/i], and or the return to [i]City 17[/i]. Trying to clear out room to room with the Combine soldiers waiting behind doorways is all that much harder when you have a squad of 4 literally in your back pocket. Most of the time even if you send them to \"wait\" at a certain position they don't hold the position long. It seems like if they break line of sight with you, they immediately get put back into follow mode.\n\n     Well if the header doesn't say it enough, I do recommend this game. Like I said in the header, if you're a fan of [i]Doom[/i] or [i]F.E.A.R[/i] you will like this game. You can definitely play it a second time without it being extremely boring, but like most first person shooter games there is only so much you can do.\n\n     [b]PS: shout out to good friends who gift you games you've never played before.

This game has given me purpose in life - literally. It's the amazing atmospheric ambience, the stunning sound engineering, the ingenius level design and the dark themes accompanied by subtle and intuitive storytelling that have inspired me to become a game developer. It's this extremely grim world and attention to detail that forms the horrifying yet beautiful feeling and experience of playing this game. From humanity's slavery, the often depressing graffiti, and abandoned canal tunnels filled with rotting corpses of escapees now zombified, screaming in pain with what little conscience they have left as their mutated bodies are forcibly controlled by parasites, to the massive inter-dimensional empire draining Earth's resources until a point where the planet could no longer sustain life, Half-Life 2 is a trully remarkable experience and a gamer's must-play, a game that is deserving of all the praise it has gotten and keeps getting nearly 15 years after its release.","timestamp_created":1485266996,"timestamp_updated":1516919892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29461936","author":{"steamid":"76561198337744431","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":94,"playtime_forever":3842,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1128,"last_played":1639688435},"language":"english","review":"Fun","timestamp_created":1485263711,"timestamp_updated":1574624131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533917725086212158","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29458804","author":{"steamid":"76561198281626668","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":4500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":659,"last_played":1610751115},"language":"polish","review":"Najlepsza gra gdzie jestes Gordonem Freemanem!!","timestamp_created":1485250611,"timestamp_updated":1485250611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29458762","author":{"steamid":"76561198137602583","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":71,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1653915144},"language":"schinese","review":"中文语音好评","timestamp_created":1485250466,"timestamp_updated":1485250466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500499486923217773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29458124","author":{"steamid":"76561198123110771","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1381,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1381,"last_played":1483883322},"language":"schinese","review":"经典神作，无需多说","timestamp_created":1485247437,"timestamp_updated":1485247437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500499486923217773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29457385","author":{"steamid":"76561198161375027","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":519,"last_played":1533803409},"language":"russian","review":"В шта совсем ?
