And I am happy to say that its is. And maybe it maybe even better in the way it is paced Gearbox has some how managed to keep the original feel and flow of half life intact with out no compromises. You play as Adrian Shephard one of corporals/soldiers sent to Black Mesa to eliminate the Xen invaders and to silence the witnesses, especially the scientist named Gorden Freeman, as part of a classified mission.\n\nThe game is much more shorter than the original Half life it could only take you 2 hours if you know what you are doing. But I feel like this benefits the game as there were a lot of annoying chapters in the original Half life that seems out dated and hinders an overall amazing game i'm looking at you on a rail. \n\nOverall if you like the half life series and what to play something that is in the same vane Opposing Force is a good option.","timestamp_created":1639767796,"timestamp_updated":1639767796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105974894","author":{"steamid":"76561198260562472","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1639748388},"language":"latam","review":"Es un buen juego en la saga Half-Life, aunque su campaña y su final deja algunos cabos sueltos, como la aparición de la Raza X, o la bomba termonuclear en Black Mesa.

Usually these types of games, where you play as the villains of the previous game, try to make the ‘bad guys’ look good since they either don’t have a choice or simply don’t know the full story, but I admire that this game just goes with the fact that they did not care and only you the player can truly act like a human being.\n\nIt’s nice to see the G-Man actually do stuff, as we’re all used to him just creeping around Black Mesa following Gordon in both games doing nothing but standing still and walking away - but here, in this game, we actually get to see him being this character they showcased him to be in Half Life, a being that works for someone who has higher power over everything else.\n\nThe enivronment annd bosses remind me of the encounters Gordon has in the original game and the way they’re executed is just plain old fun - I also just wanna remind you that although they feel similar, they aren’t (something that the later game, Half Life: Blue Shift fails to do). Overall, the game is worth playing through and it’s just as fun as the original Half Life…\n\nJust F U C K the nightvision.","timestamp_created":1639689034,"timestamp_updated":1639689034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105938550","author":{"steamid":"76561198996244641","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":394,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":127,"last_played":1639776288},"language":"english","review":"I strongly recommend it because its good at all, its much better than Blue Shift, like the stages of the levels are better/very good and the multiplayer is very nice too, its like hl1 but more weapons.","timestamp_created":1639686490,"timestamp_updated":1639686490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105925196","author":{"steamid":"76561199132648334","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1082,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1082,"last_played":1632359502},"language":"brazilian","review":"Tenho 18 Horas sapoha num consigo ooo gabe newel me ajuda ae kkk","timestamp_created":1639668435,"timestamp_updated":1639668435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105917906","author":{"steamid":"76561198997559551","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1639669319},"language":"russian","review":"игра бомба прям супер класс сюжет топ а ещё тут есть классные пингвины!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1639657919,"timestamp_updated":1639657919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105913642","author":{"steamid":"76561198154912651","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1023,"last_played":1639032575},"language":"english","review":"faster-paced, and with a superior arsenal compared to the original half life, i definitely prefer this, adrian shepard needs to come back","timestamp_created":1639650148,"timestamp_updated":1639650148,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105905219","author":{"steamid":"76561198991119297","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":887,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":887,"last_played":1639630257},"language":"spanish","review":"Esta bastante bien, nuevas armas, nuevos enemigos, buen diseño de nivel, dificultad relativamente elevada, bastante mas corto que el original pero lo compensa con todo lo anterior.
