Portal kann vor allem durch eine starke Story mit einem zynisch, ironischen Roboter namens GLaDOS als Gegenspielerin punkten, die mit unglaublich genialen Dialogen die Story vorantreibt.\nDazu kommt das geniale Gameplay welches auf Puzzlen aufbaut, die mithilfe von Portalen und einfachen Dingen wie Würfeln, Schaltern und Druckplatten gelöst werden müssen. Dabei ist mehr als einmal Köpfchen und Geschick gefragt um die Tür der Testkammer zu öffnen und dem versprochenen \"Kuchen\" einen Schritt näher zu kommen.\nIm Verlauf des Spiels erfährt der Spieler auch stückweise immer mehr über das Aperture Science Enrichment Center, in dessem Inneren sich das Geschehen abspielt und über einen Mann namens Ratman, der einige der Testkammern mit merkwürdigen Symbolen und Warnungen vollgekritzelt hat, die eine beängstigende Wirkung ausüben.\n\nEine nette Ergänzung sind die Challenge Maps und die \"Advanced Chambers\", in denen der Spieler in bekannten, leicht modifizierten Kammern aus dem Hauptspiel sein Können an das Maximum treiben muss, um das Puzzle so schnell wie möglich, mit so wenigen Portalen wir möglich oder mit so wenigen Schritten wie möglich zu beenden.\n\n[h1][b]Fazit[/b][/h1]\n\nAuch wenn die Story nicht allzu lang ist, dieses Spiel ist jeden Cent wert!\nEinfach nur perfekt!","timestamp_created":1364860445,"timestamp_updated":1550695042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5181470","author":{"steamid":"76561198046052235","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":314,"last_played":1435509638},"language":"spanish","review":"A quienes hayan jugado a Portal 2 antes que al 1 quizás les parezca soso, falto de argumento, de personajes o de objetos en general, pero el simple hecho de conocer cómo empezó todo, con una historia alternativa y nuevos logros, hace que valga la pena jugarlo.

Dans le cas contraire, Portal a de très fortes chances de vous séduire.\n\nHistoire d'expédier rapidement les points faibles du jeu : c'est court, très court, trop court. Même en prenant son temps, le jeu se fini très rapidement. En règle générale , on peut tabler sur 3 à 4 heures de jeu, sachant quand même qu'il existe des cartes \"avancées\" (remix de salles de test déjà proposée en jeu mais avec une difficulté supplémentaire) et des cartes challenge (à faire en un minimum de temps, en marchant le moins possible ou en utilisant le moins de portails possible) pour prolonger l'expérience de jeu. Mais malgré cela, on aura du mal à dépasser la barre des 10 heures de jeu.\n\nC'est très dommage, car le jeu a tout du chef d'oeuvre. Le principe même du jeu est tellement simple et à la fois tellement novateur qu'on se demande pourquoi personne n'a eu la même idée avant... Le jeu en lui même est extrèmement simple à prendre en main : clic gauche = portail bleu, clic droit = portail orange. Et on s'efforce de garder à l'esprit la devise du jeu : \"think with portals\" (\"pensez avec des portails\"), devise qui nous rappelle que Portal est avant tout un jeu d'énigmes et non un shooter et que, du coup, il faut oublier tout ce à quoi les FPS ont pu nous habituer : la violence est inutile, sauter partout est inutile et si vous perdez de la vie, c'est que vous vous êtes planté. Et ça marche.\n\nD'un point de vue graphique, il n'y a rien d'exceptionnel et pourtant, on a le sentiment qu'il n'y a pas besoin de plus. Attention, je ne dis pas que ce jeu est laid, juste qu'il est minimaliste. Et ça rend très bien cette ambiance dépouillée et asceptisée dans les salles de test.\n\nDe ce côté-là, la BO n'est pas en reste : la musique est minimaliste au possible. Toujours concernant la BO, on décernera une mention spéciale au doublage de GLaDOS, qui, en VO, est tout simplement parfait. Bon, et puis \"Still Alive\", hein !\n\nConclusion : bien qu'extrèmement court, ce jeu est un must-have absolu. Afin de ne pas trop avoir l'impression de s'être fait avoir, on évitera cependant d'acheter Portal en dehors des périodes de soldes ou en dehors d'un pack de jeux (Pack Portal, Orange Box ou Valve Complete).","timestamp_created":1363253192,"timestamp_updated":1386877837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.670113086700439453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2862299","author":{"steamid":"76561198013735252","num_games_owned":798,"num_reviews":210,"playtime_forever":421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1362902400},"language":"english","review":"Portal is a fun and challenging puzzle game.
