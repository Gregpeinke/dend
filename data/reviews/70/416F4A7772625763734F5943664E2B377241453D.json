You play as Gordon Freeman, an MIT graduate working at Black Mesa at the wrong time at the right place. After meeting many Barney Calhouns and Dr. Kleiners, you eventually unleash the Resonance Cascade, an event that triggers the start of an alien invasion from the Xen dimension. You'll pick up your trusty crowbar and many dangerous weapons, meet many allies who'll either help shoot off baddies or inject healthy syringes to regain health again, and also come across enemies that'll want to bite your face off or shoot you to pieces. The mysterous G-Man also lingers around once in a while, so you should keep on eye on the guy too while you're at it.

Foi um jogo que revolucionou o seu gênero para a época e abriu as portas para milhares de clones. Seu brilho foi com certeza ofuscado pelo tempo pelas diversas inovações de jogos sucessores, mas ainda é um pedaço histórico da indústria dos jogos que ainda deve estar no vocabulário de um jogador. \n\n\nPrimeiro de tudo, shooters podem ser uma experiência bem cansativa, mais do que outros gêneros. Sim, é divertido acertar um foguete na cara de um demônio de três andares, mas pela vigésima vez você provavelmente deve estar cansado, e sem diversidade você acaba eventualmente desistindo. Half-Life foi um dos primeiros jogos a ensinar que shooters não são sobre atirar, curiosamente, mas sim sobre manter um gameplay fluído. \nO level design é bem misto, mas não que seja mais ou menos, mas num sentido que ou existe capítulos muito bons, ou *muito ruins*. We Got Hostiles, Surface Tension, Blast Pit são exemplos ótimos de capítulos cheios de ação, enquanto Apprehension, Unforeseen Consequences, são capítulos mais tranquilos e focados em outras partes do game, capítulos como Office Complex, Lambda Core e os últimos capítulos são simplesmente exagerados. Felizmente, pelo menos na minha humilde opinião, existem mais capítulos bons do que ruins como mostrei, então sua experiência deve fluir naturalmente.\nO arsenal do jogo é no mínimo, interessante. Você tem armas que seriam genéricas e que poderiam vir de qualquer outro jogo da época: Pistola, escopeta, metralhadora, arma de energia, fim. Mas aqui, você tem tiros alternativos, como um lançador de granadas para sua metralhadora, um tiro duplo da sua escopeta (Cujo segundo barril não existe), tiros rápidos da sua pistola em caso de desespero, e por diante. Você também tem as armas menos convencionais, como o revólver que funciona como uma sniper de bolso, uma crossbow que é uma verdadeira sniper, e algumas outras que já são território de spoiler. E mesmo com tantas armas, você nunca sente que alguma arma não é utilizada o suficiente; A pistola é boa para tiros certeiros contra inimigos menores, a metralhadora é boa para distâncias médias, escopeta obviamente contra distâncias menores, e por assim vai. Não é sobre ter armas o suficiente, mas sim armas úteis o suficiente para cada encontro.\nE por falar em encontros, não são poucos inimigos que você encontra pelo caminho: Headcrabs, Vortigaunts, zombies, por diante. Esses tipos de inimigos requerem mais concentração para serem derrotados, e fazem melhor para as partes mais tranquilas do jogo. E então, você tem os soldados.\nOs soldados são, para falar a verdade, algo que eu não sei o que sentir sobre. Você vê, eles tem uma AI muito avançada, que ainda bate de frente com muitos jogos de hoje em dia, e eles fazem decisões taticamente, como te flanquear, jogar uma granada se você se esconder muito atrás de cobertura, etc. Por outro lado, são um saco de enfrentar pois eles resistem para c*ralho a dano, você tem que literalmente descarregar o tiro duplo da escopeta de perto em um para matar, então o combate é menos realista e mais “pule feito um idiota tentando acertar granadas”.\nUma das características notáveis do jogo é algumas cenas scriptadas. Embora para ser honesto, eu seja bem preconceituoso com a forma que cenas scriptadas são usadas, aqui elas foram usadas bem até; Elas nunca te tiram do controle, e servem mais para dar vida ao mundo ao seu redor, como um Alien Grunt quebrando uma parede na sua frente, ou algum monstro aleatório vindo atrás de você: Momentos como esse te deixam tenso e fazem você querer você pensar além do tempo, e para mim uma pressão sempre é boa.\nE por falar em pressão, esse jogo é bem difícil, se não lhe caiu a ficha ainda. A maioria dos tiros [b] vão [/b] pegar em você, dano ambiental é uma coisa (Radioatividade, calor ou frio extremo, etc.) existe também um plataforming que é horrível, então você esteja preparado. Dica, F6 e F7 dão quicksave e quickload, use bem os seus poderes.\n Uma das coisas que passam despercebidas são os pequenos detalhes que o jogo contém, como o fato do sistema de anúncio poder dizer literalmente qualquer coisa, como os soldados tem um sistema de fala que pode ajudar você a previr o que eles farão em seguida, como Bullsquids tem um [/b]senso de cheiro [/b].  Existe uma série no YouTube chamada Half-Life Fact Series que mostra esses e mais detalhes que mostram o amor que a Valve teve por esse jogo.\n\n\nSe você conseguir passar pelos elementos mais datados, como os gráficos e a dificuldade, Half-Life vai ser uma ótima experiência. Dê uma olhada em alguma gameplay, e esse jogo vai parecer nada especial, mas confie em mim: Você precisa jogar para entender como esse foi um passo revolucionário para o gênero e como o jogo faz para ser uma quasi-experiência engajante e refrescante a cada momento.

My only real problems with the game are that sometimes health stations and ammo pickups are placed too far away from eachother, putting you in difficult situations that will make you want to pull your hair out, and also sometimes the game bugs up and breaks, forcing you to either reload an older save, uninstall and reinstall the game or make a new game.

Empezé a jugar a este juego a la edad de 15 años, en ese primer encuentro con él tuve bastante interés y no me dejó indiferente. La trama era interesante pero por aquel entonces yo no pude jugar el juego completo ya que era una demo, así que ahora que he podido jugarlo, me ha dejado impresionada. La trama especialmente llama la atención porque es bastante enigmático todo y eso hace que te den más ganas de jugarlo. Los personajes no son nada del otro mundo pero son importantes en el desarrollo del juego, los enemigos, el boss final y la dificultad es lo que le da vidilla a este videojuego y están  bastante logrados. La jugabilidad no suele ser gran cosa, es algo tipíco en este tipo de juegos.

Now years later, I am discovering just what a masterpiece the original game is and Im glad contemporary critics are going back and reappraising this game, compared with its amazing sequel. \n\nThe first half life is an atmospheric shooter that tells its narrative through its environment, each encounter feels more random and terrifying then the last. The game excels at not only its platforming and puzzle segments but making the Black Mesa facility a character in its own right. This seedy industrial site feels like it is finally getting its revenge along side the random portal storms inadvertently caused by you. All the while you are being hunted down by seedy government contractors and US wet works assassins. There's this air that you aren't really sure of who this Gordon Freeman really is, a mild manored scientist gifted with incredible tenacity and luck, or something that otherworldly forces and the government has to silence at all costs. Just another great element that fuels this games plot. While the revolutions this game pioneered have changed and evolved to make this game pretty dated, its still, after 20 years, one of the best narrative stories told. I just wish the NPC interactions were a little more nuanced.","timestamp_created":1539216354,"timestamp_updated":1539216354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrbWcsOYCfN+7rAE="}
