Také přibyly nové herní systémy, např. lasery, jejichž paprsky budete lámat sklem, či tekutiny různých barev, které budete rozstřikovat po okolí a budete díky nim mít bonusy k rychlosti, k délce skoku a podobně. Hrací doba je mnohem delší, než byla u prvního dílu. Konečně. Dále je hra propojená se Steam Workshopem, takže stahování nových map je extrémně jednoduché. Také řešení hádanek bývá v porovnání s prvním dílem obtížnější. Hlavní příběh je v podstatě extrémně jednoduchý, ale díky vtipnosti GLaDOS a Wheatleyho ho budete se zájmem sledovat. Grafické zpracování je pěkné, alespoň na to, že se jedná o logickou hru.

The game is not bad but had several issues.\nActually in most areas I would give the game a 7/10. I don't see any one single aspect that I would rate at 9.\n\n- Technically the game is OK, the 3D 'Source' engine is serviceable but a bit dated. Most items and environments have very geometrical shapes, don't expect fancy light or particles effects. More annoying are the many loading times even for small levels. Before AND after each level there is a similar 'lift' sequence, which quickly get repetitive and boring, and only add extra loading times.\n\n- The designers made commendable efforts on the gfx style and story telling. The robotics voice acting are a mix of joke/taunt/background story/hint, however I don't find they were relly funny, but rather annoying. Nevertheless you shouldn't turn the voices off for fear of missing a helpful hint. Overal I wasn't captivated by the atmosphere and the plot, and all the cutscenes was more a distraction than anything else\n\n- There are no manual or tutorial, instead there are some visual and speech hints, but this is the kind of game where understanding the rules and mechanisms is part of the puzzles. Not a big issue, but sometimes a cause for irritation.\n\n- Basically each level is a small closed room where you must open and reach the exit. Rooms are mostly empty, and only contain a very few items relevant to the solution. Indeed the first puzzle are rather easy once you get the idea of the game.\nThen in the second third of the game, the levels become larger and more open, and feels like an abandonned factory. This introduce an element of exploration. Unfortunately the environment is completly passive (except for a very obvious levers), and even if you explore every remote corners you won't find anything of interest. In the end you roam long corridors and scaffolders, which only dilute the puzzle solving aspect of the game. And most of this part is pretty linear and boring with many repetitive puzzles, and some dexterity challenges. \n\n- The final part of the game revert back to the puzzle rooms and is more interesting with some good and challenging puzzle.\n\n- The single player mode took me 11h to complete. There is also a cooperative 2 player mode which is a different experience (of little interest for me as I have a poor connection and play mostly solo). Additionaly there are many users created contents which add to the experience.\nConsidering the price this is a decent amount of content. But overal I find the game didn't lived up to the hype and there are other puzzle game that I found more enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1410789887,"timestamp_updated":1410973922,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":36,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.348738312721252441","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12107422","author":{"steamid":"76561198063441245","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":9180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6679,"last_played":1626791499},"language":"russian","review":"Про эту игру можно сказать ооочень много.

Portal, however, is an exception, Every track is memorable and enjoyable. Even the ambiance noise is nice to listen too.\n-- Great characters (for what few there are). GLaDOS and Weatley are very memorable characters.\n\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to pick up this game. The game was made by Valve, and shows a level of polish and quality we rarely see today; even years after it's been out, it's still a great game. This game has so few flaws, it's hard to think of anything aside from nitpicking. This game is one of my favorite games, as it is for so many others. Give it a bash: it's cheap, habitually on sale, and inclusive for gamers of any gender or age (within reason. If they can beat a stage in Super Mario, then can probably play this).","timestamp_created":1410760061,"timestamp_updated":1410760061,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520345866680145264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12104947","author":{"steamid":"76561198123145416","num_games_owned":985,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1410243970},"language":"english","review":"Has to be the third or fourth time that I have completed this game, and I will be back for more again.

Which means this game is really good, because Portal 1 was still very fun.\n\nPortal 1 was mainly fun because it introduced (at least, I haven't heard of any earlier games with this) the concept of shooting two portals to complete levels. You shoot two portals, walk through one, come out the other. It's a fairly simple concept, but it opens all kinds of new puzzles. However, a downside of Portal 1 was that the average gamer would pretty much be done playing it after finishing the campaign, because there wasn't much more to offer. And the campaign wasn't very long.\n\nThis is where Portal 2 shines. The main new feature is the level editor, where you can create your own test chambers. And if you aren't very creative with creating test chambers, Steam Workshop has thousands of test chambers created by other users. So you'll probably never run out of puzzles. Also, the campaign is longer, so that is good as well.\n\nIn summary, if you enjoyed Portal 1, get this. If you haven't played Portal 1, you should still try it out; maybe get it at a Steam sale since it goes on sale often. You'll probably like Portal 2 no matter what genres you enjoy. 4/5 stars.","timestamp_created":1410733853,"timestamp_updated":1465342505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12102930","author":{"steamid":"76561198141660739","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":630,"last_played":1561065406},"language":"italian","review":"gioco a dir poco eccezionale, pieno di colpi di scena e test a non finire. mi ha letteralmente colpito e spero con tutto il cuore che uscirà il 3. lo consiglierei a tutti. 10000000000/10","timestamp_created":1410732187,"timestamp_updated":1410732187,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12101038","author":{"steamid":"76561198115808694","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2052,"last_played":1473690668},"language":"english","review":"one of the best games i ever played!","timestamp_created":1410720195,"timestamp_updated":1410720195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12100292","author":{"steamid":"76561198093517872","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":735,"last_played":1503131290},"language":"schinese","review":"神作！喜欢解谜的玩家绝对不能错过！","timestamp_created":1410715977,"timestamp_updated":1410715977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12100005","author":{"steamid":"76561198102247419","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":706,"last_played":1638618701},"language":"french","review":"Super jeux !!!","timestamp_created":1410714558,"timestamp_updated":1410714558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12099812","author":{"steamid":"76561198015670413","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":572,"last_played":1412879828},"language":"russian","review":"Стоит поиграть!!!","timestamp_created":1410713610,"timestamp_updated":1410713610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8azFusgCdI6ULg=="}
