The graphics are stunning for a game made in the early 2000s. The only issue I really have is that the combat gameplay is very basic, the shooting mechanics are the most simple in the genre: hit-scan combat with supposedly several weapons but only really two that are very useful(pulse rifle and shotgun), and enemies that are fairly basic, soldiers and zombies. There can't be any review of this game without the mention of the physics engine, which plays a very large role in the puzzles of the game. The physics in this game are well done, if not a bit overdone. Almost any item that exists on the ground can be picked up or moved, and most puzzles rely on this, being simple move the plug to the socket puzzles or see-saw puzzles(placing items on one side to be able to jump off the other). Not to say that these puzzles aren't enjoyable, because this was a revolutionary system for the time, I wouldn't expect the puzzles to be elaborate physics stuff. In all, this game is good, not perfect, but a good game and worth the buy. It's also worth it for the mods too, the modding community for this game being massive and creating ever more interesting mods.","timestamp_created":1593402191,"timestamp_updated":1593402191,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71622459","author":{"steamid":"76561199021363199","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":128,"last_played":1651984349},"language":"english","review":"You can kill people with chairs.","timestamp_created":1593401450,"timestamp_updated":1628975551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71621655","author":{"steamid":"76561199033330389","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":266,"last_played":1651286868},"language":"koreana","review":"개인적으론 길찿는데 조금 어려웟다 그래도 재미는 있어다\n.","timestamp_created":1593400389,"timestamp_updated":1593400389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71620176","author":{"steamid":"76561198175909843","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5086,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3778,"last_played":1624510823},"language":"english","review":"Amazing story line, crazy twists, lovable characters, and I love the half life series","timestamp_created":1593398467,"timestamp_updated":1593398467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71618449","author":{"steamid":"76561199068769380","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":248,"last_played":1649357192},"language":"latam","review":"que memorizable","timestamp_created":1593396243,"timestamp_updated":1637454261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71617526","author":{"steamid":"76561199013430117","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":1457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1647976586},"language":"english","review":"not as good as half life 1 but graet game","timestamp_created":1593395085,"timestamp_updated":1605341059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71617131","author":{"steamid":"76561198283775780","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1594239495},"language":"english","review":"its fun","timestamp_created":1593394579,"timestamp_updated":1593394579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71616922","author":{"steamid":"76561198012800136","num_games_owned":502,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":602,"last_played":1538358163},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores games First Person que existe com toda certeza.

Probably some of the stuff I'm about to say - seeing as I'm an actual gamer not a paid shill. \nHalf Life 2 was what gave birth to the Valve Gaming Rental Service they innocuously named \"Steam\" - annoying almost every gamer when it first appeared due to it's demand that you be connected to the internet to play the game - at a time when a lot of people were still getting by with dial-up (a good number of people still did not have ANY internet), and couldn't understand why the game wasn't actually on the disc that you were sold with it. This was further compounded by the fact that Steam was still a work in progress upon release. So you had the double delight of a game that you were unable to play unless you had the internet, released with a platform that wasn't even ready at the time the game that went with it was released. Valve released a statement at the time aimed at all disgruntled and enraged gamers: \n\n\"Oh well\" ~ Valve, 2004\n\nTo date I've never completed Half Life 2 but I HAVE ploughed a lot of hours into it - not shown on this account - my previous account was stolen, and Valve make you jump through so many hoops that it's actually less stressful just to write off the theft of nearly 100 games and just start again - they make it very clear that when trying to claim your own account back you're guilty unless proven innocent.\n\nIf you've never played Half Life 2 and it's now the year 2020, the first thing you'll need to do is look up some texture/graphics mods. The thing is, another game was released a couple of months after Half Life 2 - Vampire The Masquerade : Bloodlines. This game also used the Source engine, but despite development running almost alongside Half Life 2, the Vampire game makes better use of the Source engine which is...a bit embarrassing for Valve. So it will look a little clunky but luckily it's one of the games they CAN be bothered to ensure still works on their Games Rental Service. \n\nAs well as the shooting Valve need you to understand that they've coded all these fancy physics, so you're going to have to deal with a lot of piling up of boxes to reach some areas because \"look, see you can move boxes now - yeah we did that! See?!\". Tech demo show pony aside the physics in general are pretty good - and the AI is also really good - enemy soldiers do flank you as per all the most impressive shooters out there (F.E.A.R. is another one very well regarded in that area - the original game in the series at least). There are most of the various monsters from the first Half Life game back again - this time of course re-imagined and looking a bit less clunky than before. There is also a War of The Worlds tripod...sorry \"Strider\" which it has to be said is quite terrifying and creepy. \n\nLevel design is exemplary. Valve aren't the ultimate masters at it but they do have competence for sure. It does get a bit boring when you get lost in a big area and have already cleared out all the enemies as often you're covering and re-covering old ground on foot. There are also vehicles in the game but obviously not on every level. \n\nThere really isn't much more to be said of this shooter. Yes it deserves its place in history but it's as infamous as it is famous due to it being THE game that removed ownership of games from gamers - putting you at the mercy of account hacks, Valve deciding your account is suspicious and terminating it, or whatever else. And of course, destroying any excitement of PC game sales in the shops - as what's there to get excited about anymore when you know you're just paying for a code and won't be able to just play the game you've just paid for immediately. It also of course removed the ability to lend the game to your friends or give to a charity shop. Ah yes, not looking quite so \"awesome\" now, is it. \n\nBut yes, Half-Life 2 is decent. There won't ever be a Half-Life 3 - why would there be? The Valve team don't even need to turn up for work anymore to make pots of cash every day. So don't read too much into all those rumours. But expect a couple more show pony tech demos like Half Life : Alyx.","timestamp_created":1593390643,"timestamp_updated":1593390643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71613723","author":{"steamid":"76561198057326646","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4118,"last_played":1596062326},"language":"english","review":"Best game of a generation!
