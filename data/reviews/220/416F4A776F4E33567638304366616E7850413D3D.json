A lot of first-person-shooters that share many tropes with HL2 came out after 2004.\nNot to say those aren't good, too. I mean, I play CoD on occasion, but HL2 is the best FPS I've played yet.\nIf you want to play this first without the original, here's a quick backstory (spoilers ahoy!):\nThe player character, Gordon Freeman, was performing an experiment in the Black Mesa Research Facility that caused a \"resonance cascade,\" causing aliens to start teleporting in from an alternate dimension. The only reason he didn't die is because he was wearing an \"HEV\" Suit. He hacks his way through the facility, aliens, and the military to get to the Lambda Complex, where he teleports to the alien homeworld Xen, where he kills the alien's leader: the Nihilanth. Then,  a mysterious figure known as the G-Man offers him a new job. Freeman accepts, and he is put in stastis.\n\nHe wakes up on a train, arriving in one \"City 17\". This is where Half-Life 2 begins.\nNow, why don't you put down $10 (or less, if you get it on sale) for this slice of gaming history?\n\nP.S. Also download the Half-Life 2: Update mod, which pretties up the game extensively.","timestamp_created":1432740717,"timestamp_updated":1432740717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16019418","author":{"steamid":"76561198127884219","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1262,"last_played":1653216365},"language":"english","review":"this game is 11 years old and I still play it and love it to the core!","timestamp_created":1432690708,"timestamp_updated":1432690708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16017368","author":{"steamid":"76561198184481173","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3978,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":988,"last_played":1612375724},"language":"english","review":"It is better than Half Life 1.\n","timestamp_created":1432677548,"timestamp_updated":1432677548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504541695117950439","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16016681","author":{"steamid":"76561198062000150","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1689,"last_played":1604730872},"language":"english","review":"On the surface, it just seems like a story driven fps game.

Whether you like it or not, this game was a trend setter for how FPS games from that point on were developed. Valve really struck a gold mine with this series.\nThe entire game is set from the perspective of one Gordon Freeman, the same one from the pervious Half-Life game(also an amazing game which I reccomend). You \"wake up\" to a vision from none other than G-Man himself, telling you you are needed again. You wake up in a train and see what life has become after the events in Black Mesa Laboratories. Combine comb the streets and everyone lives under martial law, with their sexual urges repressed, and constantly being transported around. It gives a real bleak and depressing tone, akin to being a jew in the holocaust. From their you are quickly helped out by Barnie, a previous security guard at Black Mesa. You wander around, being chased by police onto a rooftop before being completely outnumbered. Fortunately, Alyx Vance, daughter of previous work mate Eli Vance, saves your ass and takes you to Dr. Kleiner, also one of your previous work mates. He gives you your HEV suit and teleports Alyx to a resistance base. He attempts to teleport you before he is interrupted by his \"pet the freakin' HEAD HUMPER\" as Barney so accurately proclaims.Lamarr, as the creature is called, knocks some wires loose and you are teleported all over. You eventually teleport about 20 feet, right outside the building where you run for your life.\nAnd such begins your great journey.\nThe campaign combines gun play, environmental play, vehicle play, and puzzles all into one unqiue atmosphere of a game. There are about 11 unique weapons, each equipped with its own usefulness and abilities(my personal favorite is the shotgun). \nThe only downside I have for this game is its lack of story outside its own game. I want to know more about the combine and what has been happening and I feel it should be explored. I also wish to see Portal and Half-Life combined in the meeting of the two main characters in some way.","timestamp_created":1432654010,"timestamp_updated":1518918510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16011860","author":{"steamid":"76561198098980621","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4958,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1817,"last_played":1576504104},"language":"czech","review":"Hra mi přišla velmi dobrá jak cenově tak graficky.","timestamp_created":1432651709,"timestamp_updated":1432651709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16008573","author":{"steamid":"76561198020604009","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1457724123},"language":"english","review":"it,s a cool game","timestamp_created":1432629713,"timestamp_updated":1432629713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16006269","author":{"steamid":"76561198028670663","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125,"last_played":1587770636},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente juego, muy buenos escenarios muy detallados, excelente historia, buena IA, al menos la de Alex, Excelente juego muy recomendado uno de los mejores juegos que he tenido el placer de jugar!!!","timestamp_created":1432607300,"timestamp_updated":1432607300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16003641","author":{"steamid":"76561198081887872","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":2067,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1547,"last_played":1647351426},"language":"german","review":"Eines der wohl besten Singleplayer-Egoshooter überhaupt!

далёком 2005 году,мой одноклассник пришёл ко мне с каким-то непонятным диском.\nЧто это?-Спросил Я.\nСейчас увидишь-Сказал он\nПосле где-то 2-х часовой загрузки мы наконец запустили эту игру.И знаете что?Это было просто охеренно!!!Я думаю у всех было такое,когда они играли с друзьями:\n\"Так,играем по смертям\"\n\"Э слышь!!Не трать ракеты/болты/энергосферы от АР2 мне ж ещё дальше проходить!\"\nТы:\"Так,ты олько что помер,давай сюда комп!\"\nТвой друг:\"Ща,кое что попробую и дам\"\n-спустя ~ попыток-\n\"Ну сейчас 1 раз и всё\"\nДа уж,это было круто...\nНо простите,что-то я отвлёкся от главных тем.А именно:Сюжета,геймплея,дизайну уровней и т.д.\n\nСюжет:\nСюжет в HL2 подаётся довольно неплохо.Играющий в 1 часть игрок выходит из поезда и видит такую картину:Повсюду хмурые или испуганные люди,странные люди с дубинками в руках и белыми противогазами,непонятный мужик на огромных мониторах,огромные пугающие треножники бродящие по улицам(страйдеры).Что же произошло за то время,пока g-man держал нас вне пространства и времени?Всё это можно узнать,пройдя дальше по сюжету такой замечательной игры,как Half-life 2...\n\nГеймплей:\nГеймплей тоже претерпел значительные изменения.Конечно,некоторые виды оружия из оригинала вырезали.Зато их пустующее место заполнили некоторые другие полезные оружия.Например вырезанную Тау-пушку заменили,пожалуй,наиполезнейшей Грави-пушкой.Или маленьких жучков заменили феромонами муравьиных львов.\nТакже добавили винтовку Альянса AR2,которая по моему мнению довольно неплоха собой.\nПомимо основных видов оружия,Гордону на помощь приходит смекалка игрока и окружающие его предметы.\nПредставим ситуацию с ракурсов оригинального Half-life и его преемника:\nИгрок входит в комнату с кучей солдат.Патронов у него почти нет,а здоровье колышется на отметке 40%.И какой нибудь солдат кидает в тебя гранату:\nHalf-life:Игрок увернётся от гранаты,а потом,мансуя,прыгая и т.д ,будет убивать солдат,тратя на них патроны и здоровье.\n\nHalf-Life 2:Игрок поймает гранату грави пушкой,кинет её в солдат,и добивая раненых,продолжит своё путешествие.\n\nДизайн:\nValve постарались на славу.Так сказать,вложили в дизайн всю душу.Вот ты сошёл с поезда,и видишь перед собой мрачный город, кучей солдат,баррикад,мрачных неразговорчивых жителей,синтетов и так далее.Позже,ты бредёшь после неудачной телепортации по городским каналам,отстреливаясь от хедкрамов и полицейских.\nПозже,уже надоев от надоедливой стрельбы,игроку дают катер,на котором он с весельем катается по каналам и крушит полицейских.А когда игрок получит пулемёт на катер,тут враги уже боятся ку нам даже лезть...Вертолёт не побоялся,и помер...\nУстав от стрельбы и каналов,игроку дают передышку.Но она весьма небольшая.Игра превращается в хоррор и слэшер зомбей.\nПосле того,как игрок минёт тёмный город,наводнённый зомби,ему любезно представляют машину,на которой он преодолевает берег.\nВ общем,разрабы постарались на славу!\n\nАтмосфера:\nЧестно сказать,я поражён hl2.Некоторые игры,сделанные в Двухтысячных забываются.Но забыть эту игру-грех.Страшный грех.\nПоначалу нам демонстрируют атмосферу деспотии и унижения.Атмосферу угнетения и безысходности.Люди,быть может, доживают свои последние дни,и потом будут истреблены альянсом,и стёрты из истории как раса.\nПозже,игра меняет атмосферу с шутера на хоррор.\nМрачный,опасный Рейвенхолм,думаю запомнился каждомуу игроку ХЛ2.Куча зомби и хэдкрабов,и единственный выживший сумашедший священник Григорий.Чудно\nС 6 главы и до конца,игра внови становится шутаном.Но не линейным типо КоД.Другим...Совершенно другим.\nОсобенно мне запомнились главы 10 и 11 главы игры.\nЛюди,двигаемые присутствием Гордона Фримена,восстают против Альянса.Атмосфера на этих главах просто отменная.\nОсобенно битва на площади против страйдеров.\n\nСобственно,плюсы игры:\n+Хорошее продолжение сюжета оригинала\n+Неплохой арсенал\n+Атмосфера,опять же\n+Дизайн\n+Саундтрек\n+Ненадоедающий геймплей\n+Грави-Пушка :D\n+Для 2004 года,такая отменная физика была просто чудом\n+Разнообразный бестиарий(враги)\n\nНо,как говорится,в каждой бочке меда есть ложка дёгтя:\n-Кривой ИИ врагов,они просто прут напролом,не используя укрытия\n-Кривой рандом в ящиках с предметами\n-Кривые анимации НИП(Неиграбельных персонажей)\n-Баги\n_Бывают некоторые проблемы с физикой\n-Тупой ИИ повстанцев\n\n*Заключение*\nЯ думаю,что игра оправдывает своё звание \"Игра на все времена\" от РС gamer!И пусть выходит сколько угодно Кризисов и Ассасинов.Я буду верен только одной вселенной

Comparto tecnico: ancora stupendo, ricordiamoci che ha introdotto anche tecnologie per la gestione della luce come l'HDR.\n2. Fisica: la cosa che mi ha più colpito. La possibilità di prendere oggetti, spostarli, il modo in cui reagiscono alla spinta e all'attrito e la facoltà di utilizzarli contro i nemici in qualsiasi momento è una cosa che ancora non ho visto in altri fps in cui la fisica risulta davvero blanda\\inutile.\n3. Trama: Molti considerano la trama di Half-Life piatta, questo perchè secondo me il gioco la espone in una maniera mai utilizzata da altri tipi di giochi cioè senza l'utilizzo di cutscene; infatti noi osserviamo l'evolversi dei fatti dal punto di vista di Gordon senza mai un cambio di scena.\n4. Soundtrack: davvero ben fatta comprende alcune tracce meravigliose come \"Apprehension and Evasion\", \"CP Violation\", \"LG Orbifold\" e \"Triage at Dawn\".\n5. Atmosfera: alcuni livelli come \"Non andiamo a Ravenholm\" sono ben realizzati, con un ottima gestione delle luci e posizioni dei nemici.\n\nAspettando il terzo capitolo che dovrebbe collegare l'universo Portal (Aperture Laboratories) all'universo Half life (Black Mesa) in quanto le Aperture Laboratories stavano sviluppando delle tecnologie riguardo l'utilizzo di portali; per questo risultavano rivali con Black Mesa ai tempi di Half Life.\nQuindi si, Half Life 3 ci sarà poichè la storia deve finire.
