Начну, пожалуй, с самого начала.\nДавным-давно, в 5-ом классе я заядло играл в КС. Как в 1.6, так и с большой радостью в спираченный в то время Соурс. Жил и не тужил, и вдруг, как-то дядя мне сказал, что есть игра, от которой и сделана КС-ка. Я, естественно, тогда не поверил. Спустя пару дней у меня появился первый Half-Life на компе - решил попробовать чисто из-за интереса. Да, всё было очень похоже на КС, и сему был рад я. \"В Халве есть и другие оружия: нормальный дробовик, пулемёты\" - слова моего дяди. Играл с большой радостью, но из-за того, что тогда в другие игры, кроме КС я не любил играть, то был вынужден удалить её. К Халве я более и не возвращался...\n\nКак итог: впервые первую Халву я прошёл аж в 2019-ом году. И то потому, что купил Оранжевую Коробку в стиме по скидке. Честно - понравилась настолько, что я прошёл два дополнения к ней и принялся за вторую часть. По началу было очень приятно играть. На этот фактор сыграла замечательная графика для 2004-ого года, которая может удивить и по сей день, и приятная физика, ради которой, как мне кажется, добавили грави-пушку. И ещё, кажется, я понял успех игр от Valve - их движок. Он универсален по-своему. Но всю игру меня не покидало ощущение: \"когда же всё это закончится?\". Дело в том, что геймплейно она весёлая и интересная, но сюжетно - совсем наоборот. Да, я полюбил эту серию сполна. Что-то такое загадочное есть в Халве, что привлекает многих фанатов к ней. Тяготеет меня больше к ней сам главный герой: молчаливый физик-ядерщик, в странном костюме, с ещё более странным оружием ближнего боя, про которого мы совершенно почти ничего не знаем. Ну, и музыка, пожалуй, классная. Сам сюжет меня не затянул, из-за чего в Халву играть я шёл неохотно. Но после того, как закончилась вторая часть, я побежал скачивать своим медленным интернетом два дополнения к ней. Почему же я не остановил прохождение на второй части? Потому что мне действительно было интересно узнать, что же будет дальше.\n\nИ, вот, я сейчас сижу и пишу этот пост прямиком после прохождения второго эпизода. Конец впечатлил, честно скажу, и я с большой охотой жду продолжение. Пусть не третью часть, но хотя бы третий эпизод. Уж больно многого нам не сказали. Valve не настолько глупы, чтобы забросить такую огромную и ожидаемую фанатами серию. Прогнозирую: продолжение - будет. Халва, ❤\n\nHL2 - 11ч.\nHL2E1 - 3ч.\nHL2E2 -

bitiremediği ve üçüncüsünün bir türlü çıkmadığı efsane Half Life 2...\n\nBu oyun çok abartıldı, yoksa hani ciddi anlamda her şeyi çok mu abartıldı da ben mi fazla zevksiz bir avelim anlamadım.\n\nÇevreyle etkileşim\n------------------------\nGerçekten en iyi işlenen konu olabilir bu, dostlarım çamaşır makinesiyle bulmaca tamamlıyorsunuz size o kadar diyeyim yani.\n\nKarakterler\n---------------\nAna karakterimiz Gordon Freeman, sessiz ve soğuk bir karakter olsa da bu oyuncuya iyi yansıltılmış, çoğu oyunda bu sessizlik oyuncunun canını sıkıyor fakat bu oyunda sanki ana karakter BİZMİŞİZ gibi işlenmiş ve gayet gerçekçi hissettirmiş, ne denebilir, tebrikler.\n\nAlyx Vance gibi karakterler de oyuna renk katmış, fazla üstünde durmak istemiyorum.\n\nHa bu arada Zombiler, Headcrapler, Combineler, Kısırlaştırılmış siviller onlar bunlar falan filan gayet iyi ha haberiniz olsun bunlara lafım yok yani.\n\nHikaye ilerleyişi\n-------------------\nArkadaşlar bu konu gerçekten abartıldı, tamam bulmacasıydı osuydu busuydu iyi güzel falan ama bir zaman sonra tamamen karşına çıkan düşmanı vur, o silahta mermin mi bitti diğer silahla vura dönüşüyor, arada farklı harita yapısı can sıkıcılığını azaltıyor ama, yetersiz.\n\nHarita dizaynı\n----------------------\nGüzel, sadece güzel, başka bir tanım
