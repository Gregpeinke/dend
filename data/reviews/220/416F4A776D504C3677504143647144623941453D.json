It collected [i]Game of The Year[/i] awards left, right and centre, quickly cementing itself among the gaming industries giants, whilst setting a new bar for future first-person shooters, both in storytelling and gameplay. But, how did time treat our dear friend? Quite well, actually. So feel free to skip my review and buy it. The rest of the text is just me explaining in depth why you should buy it. \nTLDR; [b]It's just a damn good game.[/b]\n\nBefore we begin the review, I have a funny story involving [i]Half-Life 2[/i]. As some of you may know, Slavs generally can't fully develop their brain until they reach the age of 12, [i][b]the drinking age.[/b][/i] Thus, me being 9 at the time of buying a boxed copy of [i]The Orange Box[/i] was a recipe for disaster. As you see, I didn't comprehend how to instal the game. I installed some weird thing called Steam, and somehow entered the code associated with [i]The Orange Box[/i] somewhere. But then another problem arose - [b]how do I install and play this game[/b]? Being sober, I wasn't capable of tackling such a highly intellectual task. So, I sadly had to accept defeat for the time being. Later, I ended up lending a friend the game, again, not knowing that the disc was useless since I used the code on my account. He never returned it tho, still a bit salty about that. And well, I forgot the details of the account and email I created just for [i]The Orange Box[/i], and now, it's all lost in space and time. You see, while our brains do reach peak performance between age 12 and 13, our memory from that point on is quite short. Nobody knows why. Some say it's because of drinking copious amounts of alcohol at such a young age. But no definitive proof has ever been found by our scientists. They always seem to misplace the proof for some reason.\n\nNow, those who decided to stick this far, I thank thee. So let's jump into the story first. Unlike many of its predecessors and subsequent successors in the FPS genre, [i]Half-Life[/i] never shied away from telling an interesting story, full of twists, turns, and a whole lot of G-Man. Speaking of G-Man, he is back, with more polygons in his face and better animations, making his delivery extra sinister and yet comforting at the same time. Very weird. Also, our beloved orange man, Gordon Freeman, is free once more to dispense some crowbar justice upon the world. This time there is no lab coworkers to save or experiment to fix. No. [i][b]Now you spark the flames of revolution,[/b][/i] for the evil gas mask-wearing dudes took over and subjugated people to prevent them from littering on the streets. Tyranny of the highest calibre, I must say. Oh, and there is a minor plot about humans enslaved by weird space aliens.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2651057239\n\nThe story sadly ends on a massive cliffhanger, one retconned in [i]Half-Life: Alyx[/i]. And I am referring to the ending of [i]Episode Two[/i] here, as I ain't writing no separate reviews for each episode. This ain't keeping up with the Freemans.\n\nSo, besides being a host to an incredible and well thought out story, [i]Half-Life 2[/i] also has excellent gameplay. No surprise here, since the gameplay from [i]Half-Life[/i] still holds up pretty well, responsive, fast and fluid as ever. Unlike the modern regenerating health, [i]Half-Life 2[/i] comes from a different era; One where health and armour were a thing, and you couldn't just squat behind a box and completely retore your armour and health. No. Act the fool and you end up dead. And I like this system more, as it presents more of a challenge if you can't magically heal your wounds anytime you please. The guns do what they are supposed to - [b]kill stuff[/b], and grenades go [b]boom[/b]. What more does a first-person shooter need? And I love the absence of extra fodder. All you get is cool guns to exterminate enemies and a simple quest - [i][b]kill the bad guys.[/b][/i] No side quest. No XP farming. No robust but shallow skill tree. Just good old fashioned genocide through the lens of a mute hero. There are also no restrictions when weapon carry limit is concerned. Gordon Freeman can carry all the guns he desires. And more guns undeniably equate to more fun. [i][b]It's elementary, my dear reader.[/b][/i]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2650303431\n\nSo, while gunplay stayed the same - [i][b]shoot bad guy to kill bad guy[/b][/i], the arsenal did get some [i]nice[/i] fashionable additions. It's mostly just standard military-grade weaponry, but there are some fun exotic ones as well. You can use some weird pheromone balls that let you sic giant insects on your enemies. The environment now offers plenty of items to interact with and use against the enemy. But, the most significant change from its predecessor is in its level design. Gone are only linear corridors, as we get some lovely open-ended levels with plenty of flanking options and verticality for surprise attacks. The enemy variety is also much better, both for Xen and human enemies. You even get to fight those big daddy long legs looking things later on and some weird larva looking spaceships. \n\nAnd lastly, some quality physics-based puzzles are introduced. They offer a pleasant change of pace, giving your brain some fun little challenge to overcome after going on a [strike]murder[/strike] saving rampage. Plus, it allowed Valve to swing their massive dong around and show how great their Source Engine is. And a magnificent specimen it is, I must say. Almost two decades later, and it still holds [i]firm[/i].\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2651062262\n\nBut the visuals do show the age of the game. Still, for a game released in 2004, it still holds up with only minor eyesores. Some textures can be muddy, blurry and not in super ultra instinct 4k UHD, but what Valve achieved, at the time, with their in-house Source engine, is amazing. It's all about the vibes, my dudes and dudettes. I particularly liked exploring City 17 and The Citadel. City 17 reminded me of the old Eastern Bloc, with its \"[i]gorgeous[/i]\" buildings, both on the outside and inside, and how the police do their best to [strike]kill[/strike] help its citizens. There is an \"update\" that functions as a standalone game done by the community. It's available on Steam for free if you own the game. It keeps the original [i]Half-Life 2[/i] vibes while also providing graphical enhancements.\n\nThere were some decent audio tracks, but I didn't really take notice of any particular one. It felt generic. There was a bug or something tho; Sometimes, there was no audio track in the background, not even during gunfights. It didn't ruin my enjoyment, but it did feel awkward as the silence was broken by the stifled cries from the gas-mask dudes as my bullets met their foreheads. The audio effectş were ok, and I did like the one for recharging your armour. It just goes beep beep bzzzbzzz beep beep bzzzbzzz. Very soothing. The voice acting was also great, and the best one was my man Michael Shapiro, the G-Man himself.\n\nAnd with that, our short time together has come to an end. [i]Half-Life 2[/i] is still a great game. You get an excellent first-person shooter with responsive controls and movement, plenty of exciting gunfights, great level design and an interesting story. I really didn't picture myself playing the [i]Half-Life[/i] franchise anytime soon, but life is full of mystery and wonder. Also, it was free for a time. I did need to buy it to 100% it since Gabe decided to launch a stupid gnome to space. \n\n[quote]If you enjoy this review, come and read more wisdom from the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40407656-Gospel-of-Sv.-Prolivije/]Gospel of Sv.
