There were promised stealth, Plasmids (at that time they were usable together with the weaponry, as it was clearly intended from the beginning and how it was starting from BioShock 2)...\n\nBut the most important thing they promised was freedom. We were promised Rapture - the place where is no god (linear design), no king (scripted scenes that are required to proceed), only man - the player!\n\n\"It's all about choice, it's all about options.\" - Ken Levine\n\"[URL=\"http://youtu.be/FuKFAGa1wfs?t=9m47s\"]It's all dynamic, none of this is scripted[/URL]\" - Ken Levine\n\nNow, what we see in the game that was released to the market? An Xbox-crippled corridor shooter with the plot full of self-irony about [I][B]no freedom at all[/B][/I]. And do you remember why the Teleport Plasmid was cut out? Because it would let the player to avoid scripts that made the whole game instead of AI and game world.\n\nBut that was okay. It was a good, very good Xbox-crippled corridor shooter. I like it very much even like this.\n\nBut years passed, and we moved many kilometers up. Project Icarus a.k.a. BioShock Infinite. We were promised free exploration on the dynamic city in the sky (while fleeing the free-roaming Songbird and hiding from him). [URL=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HANw9DJu6h8\"]We were promised civil war[/URL] and ability to participate. We were promised all-new vigor system [URL=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2EGC0HQoKQ\"]with separate charges for each of them, [B]lots [/B]of choices[/URL] and really groovy abilities (just look at that telekinesis gun use!). Just for protocol: I know these trailers are fully scripted, but the were a promise the developers made to all customers of the first release.\n\nAnd what we see now? We see good graphics. Is that all? Yes, it is. Vigors turned out [B]worse[/B] than Plasmids, the only big change was inability to store hypos and inability to get \"one use while there is still some EVA\", the principle that was the foundation of Hypnotize Big Daddy price and overall Vigors are weaker and bleaker than Plasmids (so what we can make a trap from almost each of them? I would gladly trade this ability for Security Beacon and Natural Camouflage. And oh, Telekinesis. We don't have it anymore). Also, we don't have as much weapon choice: No additional ammunition, no upgrades, only two guns to have - Keep It Simple and Stupid. But do you think it was the worst thing?\nI don't I think the worst thing was the fact that when in the first BioShock we at least had some choice that affected at least the ending, now we have none. throw or not was not a choice, you couldn't do neither. Cage of bird? It didn't affect anything than the neck of Elisabeth that you can never see up close as she avoids aim reticule.\nAnd the epic plot about the fate of Floating city became a story of interdementional, but all the more petty squabble about parental rights with both of the fathers being crazy, stubborn [B]and[/B] stupid.\n\nI must still admit - this one isn't always a corridor shooter. At times it is a different type of FPS - a bridge shooter, where you make a step to the side and faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall.\n\nI sincerely believe that if Andrew Ryan were with us, he would surely ask the developers:\n\"Are you men or slaves of [URL=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox\"]a machine[/URL]?\"","timestamp_created":1388602474,"timestamp_updated":1388602474,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545271813869476318","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8487249","author":{"steamid":"76561198034574711","num_games_owned":596,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1293,"last_played":1597293233},"language":"english","review":"A fun game to play through, but I feel it doesn't live up to the original in Rapture.","timestamp_created":1388602377,"timestamp_updated":1594444985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8487036","author":{"steamid":"76561198055760742","num_games_owned":423,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":177,"last_played":1440122284},"language":"english","review":"A modern classic (With an amazing port) 9/10 (I have only gone about 3 hours in as of writing this review, but via the wonderful place called the Internet I have already found out the twist, and I have seen the last 20 minutes because what else did I have to lose?)\n\n+A great plotline (with a twiiist)\n+Beautiful graphics that push the U3 engine to its limits (but it can run on a toaster)\n+Incredibly well written/Well acted\n+somehow, doesn't feel like an escort mission\n+most of the guns feel satisfying\n+the skyhook feels great to use\n+the world is incredibly detailed\n\n-a simple checkpoint system would have been better than the same revival animation over and over and over again\n-a sharp difficulty curve about 1 1/2 hours in\n-some of the special enemies feel a bit bullet sponge-ey\n-the villain seems cartoonish\n\nverdict: a great game, but get it on sale","timestamp_created":1388601946,"timestamp_updated":1388601946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8487002","author":{"steamid":"76561198060893124","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":382,"last_played":1395849887},"language":"english","review":"This game is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1388601878,"timestamp_updated":1388601878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8486994","author":{"steamid":"76561198062971267","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":76,"last_played":1408383411},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic addition to the series, however only tidbit i would add is that you have to pay special attention to the story and doing the side quests will give the story and game more power :) but overall fantastic :)","timestamp_created":1388601861,"timestamp_updated":1388601861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8486723","author":{"steamid":"76561198065378736","num_games_owned":460,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":8070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3419,"last_played":1511791798},"language":"english","review":"Loved loved LOVED Bio 1 & 2, and Bio Inf was no let down!

I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level. \n\nAnother thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.\n\nOverall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:\n\n10/10\nBUY THIS GAME.","timestamp_created":1388598777,"timestamp_updated":1441559512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546279489994049072","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8485506","author":{"steamid":"76561198072136220","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":430,"last_played":1386266042},"language":"german","review":"geil","timestamp_created":1388598667,"timestamp_updated":1388598667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8485460","author":{"steamid":"76561198007089554","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1898,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1577274222},"language":"russian","review":"!!!!","timestamp_created":1388598536,"timestamp_updated":1388598536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8485208","author":{"steamid":"76561198024503368","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1081,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":842,"last_played":1554401874},"language":"english","review":"This game was just astounding.\n\nBUY IT NOW!!!","timestamp_created":1388597922,"timestamp_updated":1388597922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8484965","author":{"steamid":"76561198065444528","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":668,"last_played":1657565299},"language":"italian","review":"Dolce e amaro allo stesso tempo.
