Поэтому спуск в воду был непредсказуемый. Никогда не было понятно нападут на тебя или нет, т.к. разглядеть было невозможно. А тут она прозрачная. Сразу можно напулять противнику.\nВ третьих: баги.\nВ четвертых: есть места где убрали некоторые предметы.(например в заминированном лазером помещении. Там есть лифт. На нем должен был быть ящик. Если лифт поднимался вместе с ящиком..то он задевал лазер и помещение полностью взрывалось. Тут же этого ящика нет..тем самым упрощая задачу.\nИтог: просто неоправданный труд. Как бонус к покупке Half-life 2(при старте продаж было такое предложение) вполне годится. Но как отдельная покупка - это просто лишняя трата денег.
