It was a long time since I played Half-Life, but still vaguely remember  from 1999 how tricky, difficult and fun it was.  SO as I begna to play this I was in the mind set that the game would be excellent, which it WAS!  Half life 2  I think brings a hold another whole  prepective to Half-Life in that it in coporates the fundametals of the first game, but allows it to expand greatly to another realms and new exiciting maps.   What I was really impressed with is that the games 's story doesn't get corny like most video game storyies line do. This game is well sought out and hopefully they will release a third.

Half Life 2 is an incredible game with stunning graphics and great AI - for its time.  \n\nThe gameplay is fun and with the use of Developer Mode, players that are playing the game through for a second, third, or fourth time can enable fun gravity settings or thousands of other commands.  The story line in the game itself is the classic FPS Hero vs The World.  \n\nI would rate this game a 9.2/10 because it is still a classic, a benchmark to gaming, a sequel to one of the best games ever made and still one of the highest META rated games in the world.  Half Life 2 is worth the few dollars to purchase - as well as all of the other Valve titles.","timestamp_created":1392068621,"timestamp_updated":1392068621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9044924","author":{"steamid":"76561198048104541","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":818,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":598,"last_played":1459532736},"language":"english","review":"deze spel heeft die gewkste story en veel skiet/rees/vaar/vlieg plezier :D","timestamp_created":1392051073,"timestamp_updated":1392051073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9044600","author":{"steamid":"76561198059479207","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1513,"last_played":1376310384},"language":"spanish","review":"mejor que el primerooo..","timestamp_created":1392048779,"timestamp_updated":1392048779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9044002","author":{"steamid":"76561198031584256","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":742,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1392044713},"language":"spanish","review":"Grande!!!!","timestamp_created":1392044755,"timestamp_updated":1392044755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9042774","author":{"steamid":"76561198111943050","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":413,"last_played":1438063476},"language":"schinese","review":"It's a good to play game, if you feel wrong , i can f@ck me !","timestamp_created":1392035630,"timestamp_updated":1392035630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9041119","author":{"steamid":"76561198106899827","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":883,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":838,"last_played":1502361265},"language":"english","review":"incredibly amazing, play half life 1 to get the general setting though","timestamp_created":1392017032,"timestamp_updated":1392017032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9040834","author":{"steamid":"76561198105815627","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":119,"last_played":1398216067},"language":"english","review":"this game is extremely boring. no charcater developement, no time line developement, and over all it's just one huge level. if you are thinking about getting this game, don't, it's terrible.","timestamp_created":1392013297,"timestamp_updated":1392013297,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.383652359247207642","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9040439","author":{"steamid":"76561198117415156","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":309,"last_played":1601532429},"language":"english","review":"Still after a decade Valve's masterpiece remains a must have.

The dificulty, pace and scale progression are fantastic and make for great replayability. While all this may seem standard in any modern FPS, this is where it was originally mastered.\nStory is huge in this game. It follows on from the original, Half-Life, set in a future after the events of the original game advanced from the on-site effects to a global change. You are the central character in potentially fixing the situation. The techniques used to tell the story are all through observation. Your only input is with your weapon or to prompt the action of a device or NPC. Exploring or speed running through the game, it's an experience with a lot of depth.\nGraphically this game has aged, though it was ground breaking when it was released. The model rigging and animation was beyond anything else for real-time rendering. Now, it's less detailed but still better executed than most games on the market.

The biggest down-side to this game was me, admitting I could have played this for years now, but stubbornly I ignored all the high praise and did not buy it until recently. Even for 2014 the game feels and plays just as nicely as many current titles (if not better), and the true greats transcend time and technology. You have vast choices for difficuly, play-ability and so on, yet it gives you the feeling of real-time danger and urgency and ways to figure a way out that never gets old or feels out-dated. It gives you great FPS feel, RPG feel and is just as relevant as a game today as it was when released, and there are times when I lost sleep trying to figure out in my head ways to get past a puzzling stage or two. For those of you going back-and-forth on whether to buy this game even if it came out a near-decade ago...at least get the game to see how when a game is done right, release date doesn't matter. Plus, you get to see the influence this series had on countless games that have been released since.

Gunplay, movements, and weapons are what makes up some of the best things about the game. Its storyline is as good as any other, but with very choppy and boring dialogue it really throws all of it off. Some of the characters are quite dull or annoying along with not very surprising plot twists. Also some of the levels you really want to be over soon last for 2 hours with cool concepts at first with interesting vehicles, but gets overused in the first 15 minutes or so and becomes a chore. Those levels sre few with many other more action filled ones.\n\nNow for the good things, like all the artfully done gameplay. What the game lacks in character, dialogue, plot, and vehicles it makes up for in its always altering enemy and weapon types. The arsenal they give you is one to never get tired of using, for it has great diversity. Most the on ground missions are fun and intense with some little puzzles here and there that really get your brains gears going. All the prop dynamics, movements, and gravitational animations are so fun to mess with, as you can grab things and throw them along with breaking them. With the gravity gun it is an amazing tool to fling yout surroundings at your enemies. Its gunplay is simple and fun along with its devastating weapon attachments (such as the grenade launcher and proton launcher). While in combat there is always some kind of twist they throw at you to keep things sparked up. Altogether, the gameplay is extravagent, its storyline lacking, so play it for the fun of it, not the content.","timestamp_created":1391708254,"timestamp_updated":1391708254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477941185235977173","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8996359","author":{"steamid":"76561198125386953","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1234,"last_played":1602629852},"language":"italian","review":"è fantastico! fantastico dalla trama ai nemici, dalle armi alle ambientazioni...
