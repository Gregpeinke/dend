This expansion focuses on Adrian Shepherd, a HECU Corporal and his journey through Black Mesa to eliminate Gordon Freeman. Although it is shorter than base game (4-5 hours average for first timers) it still packs enough content to satisfy your thirst for more Half-Life gameplay and plot. \n\nPros:-\n->Whole new arsenal of weapons as well as returning ones from original Half-Life.\n->Really good side-story.\n->New Levels.\n->New Enemies and mutated forms (including some previous ones)\n->A new way to maneuver the map.\n->2 Boss battles.\n->Everything else that was good about Half-Life\n\nCons:-\n->Annoying Bugs\n->A (kind of) Linear way to defeat final boss, rendering already acquired weapons not of much use.\n->Overused enemies towards the end (laser/plasma bolts shooting aliens).\n->Mouse Flicker issue (check the guides for a fix).\n->Questionable friendly A.I.\n\nHighly recommended for any Half-Life fans out there.

Gives you a new story line, perfectly supplements the events in Half-Life and throws in some new things that offer a different experience.\n\nInstead of being the protagonist Gordon Freeman, you now take place as an antagonist known as Adrian Shepard, a soldier tasked with hunting down Gordon Freeman while fending of aliens at the same time. It soon turns out that in general chaos everyone fights everyone, including new alien species and black ops soldiers. The story is fantastic, showing a different perspective.\n\nThere are a few new weapons (alien lightning gun, Desert Eagle) and some new features. You get to lead other soldiers with various specialties: engineer who can cut doors, medic who can heal you. You learn to climb ropes and at one point you can use alien technology of grappling gun.\n\nGraphics is not great, but it's cool enough and the level design with brilliant color schemes and lighting styles makes up for it.\n\nOverall, this game is a splendid masterpiece and I would recommend anyone buying.","timestamp_created":1578174313,"timestamp_updated":1578174358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61303073","author":{"steamid":"76561198348101213","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":539,"last_played":1629995249},"language":"russian","review":"Лучший аддон для Half-Life!","timestamp_created":1578163389,"timestamp_updated":1578163389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61301855","author":{"steamid":"76561198868482656","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":672,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":548,"last_played":1649335250},"language":"english","review":"The Best Classic Game of the Classics","timestamp_created":1578162147,"timestamp_updated":1578162147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61297677","author":{"steamid":"76561198138852906","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":258,"last_played":1578157859},"language":"polish","review":"Polecam.. przyjemnie się grało.. dużo nowych rzeczy i spoko nawiązania do fabułki z half lifa... ogólnie to gicior ale pod koniec nudy totalne..","timestamp_created":1578157975,"timestamp_updated":1578157975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61293132","author":{"steamid":"76561198035812307","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1578153431},"language":"german","review":"Das schwerste von den HL1 Expansions Packs.

Eres el cabo Adrian Shephard. Lo han enviado al Centro de Investigación de Black Mesa para localizar y eliminar a Gordon Freeman. Como en el original, las cosas inmediatamente salen mal, se cometen errores, la gente muere y su plan inicial se reemplaza por una lucha complicada por la supervivencia. Es un testimonio del éxito de Half-Life que su historia realmente merece ser contada nuevamente. Los desarrolladores saben que si bien Adrian Shephard no tiene idea de lo que Freeman está haciendo, tú sí, y empaquetan el juego con pistas sobre dónde estás en relación con el héroe de Half-Life. Su camino inicialmente converge con el de Freeman, luego toma algunos desvíos inesperados.\n\nAl igual que Half-Life, la mayor fortaleza de Opposing Force es su éxito en brindar sorpresas constantemente. Puedes sentir el entusiasmo de los diseñadores a medida que se desarrolla una escena memorable tras otra, y te obliga a seguir jugando. Aunque Opposing Force solo tiene un tercio de su predecesor, está repleto de contenido original. No hay mucho relleno en el juego, por lo que si bien puedes terminarlo en poco más de 3 horas, la experiencia se siente mucho más completa y satisfactoria que muchos juegos más largos, que tienden a completarse con horas de tiroteos terriblemente similares.","timestamp_created":1577759710,"timestamp_updated":1578202477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60954079","author":{"steamid":"76561198211170557","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1577753956},"language":"schinese","review":"争锋相对是真的难啊
