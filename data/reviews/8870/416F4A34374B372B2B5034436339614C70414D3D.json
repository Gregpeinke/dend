I watched all the trailers like 30 times each, and was just so ready to play a new Bioshock game, set in a new city as the first two Bioshock games, are some of my favorite games of all time! Fast forward to now upon replaying it, I do definitely still love this game and appreciate its gameplay mechanics, but it is my least favorite of the three games. \n\nOn the gameplay side, this one does lean a lot more into action, run & gun gameplay compared to the first two that were more survival horror mixed with action. Its still a fun and satisfying gameplay loop, especially when you throw plasmids (or in this game: Vigors) into the mix, to make it still feel like a Bioshock game. There is the gear system in place of Gene Tonics, where you pick up different clothing that gives your character passives buffs and abilities, which I do like. And I do the inclusion of the shield as a third resource pool to manage, along side health and salts. \n\nHowever, my main issue is how they over streamlined the gameplay and limited to how much you can carry. Gene Tonics for example in the second game you could increase how many you could have equipped to more then 4, as opposed to a 4 piece gear limit here. You can keep all your gear unlike weapons, and swap them out whenever you want to which is at least nice. Weapons have the issue of you being able to only carry up to two guns, which I'm just not a fan of in FPS games, even though its the standard now a days. I just don't like it when you have a series that allowed you to carry all the guns in the game, to then go to a 2 weapon limit like every COD and Halo game as it just feels like a downgrade to me. I think Irrational Games realized this, as with the Burial at Sea DLC, it allowed you to carry more then 2 guns, and fixed of the issue I had.  What I ended up doing in the base game, was just use a machine gun for long range and a shotgun for close range, and only swapped to guns like the Sniper Rifle and Hand Cannon in some specific instances. I guess the reason why I'm harping on this, is that Bioshock 2 did a perfect job of streamlining the first games gameplay systems, without sacrificing the core aspects of it. And it ended up having the best gameplay in the series in my opinion. Bioshock Infinite's base game, just over streamlined and dumbed down a lot of the aspects, but again like I said earlier, I do still like Infinites gameplay, I just wish they didn't overhaul it as much. \n\nAs for the story, I do like it, and I do enjoy both Booker and Elizabeth as characters. Booker is a cool protagonist to play as and Elizabeth is a very useful companion, throwing you ammo and resources in the heat of combat, and opening tears to bring things into combat to help you, which is very cool. Elizabeth as well is one of my favorite characters in the whole series, and her turn from being a very naïve girl, to a more hardened person, is great to see. I did like the twist at the end and it definitely shocked me the first time I played this game. I do understand people's complaints about your choices throughout the game not having any impact on the ending. The Bioshock series always thrived on players choices in the story, whether it was saving or harvesting Little Sisters, or finding secret endings based on your choices. I understand they wanted to do multiple endings, but ran out of money and resources to do so. My stance is I do like the story of this game, but I agree it could have been a lot better had Irrational been able to give us the full game they envisioned. And while I do love Columbia as a setting and they definitely made it feel unique, the original Rapture setting will always be one of the greatest worlds I have ever explored in a video game, and its almost impossible to top that really. \n\nBut overall, I still love this game and was glad I replayed it after so many years. I've replayed the first two games a dozen times, but this one not so much until now. I look forward to finally properly diving into Burial at Sea, as I never finished episode 2 fully.","timestamp_created":1644943698,"timestamp_updated":1644943698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110302675","author":{"steamid":"76561198389688064","num_games_owned":352,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":890,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":890,"last_played":1626457867},"language":"russian","review":"топовая игра с интересным сюжетом. честно говоря не ожидал такой концовки. как по мне было много забавных моментов игре, в целом однозначно стоит поиграть.","timestamp_created":1644942618,"timestamp_updated":1644942618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110297949","author":{"steamid":"76561198427113374","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":4141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4025,"last_played":1656760670},"language":"schinese","review":"好的","timestamp_created":1644937858,"timestamp_updated":1644937858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110297235","author":{"steamid":"76561199098403697","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":541,"last_played":1645093729},"language":"schinese","review":"我不管，伊丽莎白就是我老婆，我没有卖掉她，不是我干的！！！！！","timestamp_created":1644937124,"timestamp_updated":1644937124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110294724","author":{"steamid":"76561198320475094","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":153,"last_played":1646090899},"language":"brazilian","review":".","timestamp_created":1644934522,"timestamp_updated":1644934522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110291580","author":{"steamid":"76561199223200972","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":383,"last_played":1642943045},"language":"schinese","review":"没意思啊，无聊的战斗，剧情几乎莫得","timestamp_created":1644930731,"timestamp_updated":1644930731,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.360442489385604858","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110286587","author":{"steamid":"76561198208530309","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":147,"last_played":1616493866},"language":"russian","review":"Atlas Shrugged...","timestamp_created":1644923756,"timestamp_updated":1644923756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110285484","author":{"steamid":"76561199035660492","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":692,"last_played":1644879388},"language":"english","review":"Its a good game.\nBut, ITS NOT A BIOSHOCK GAME!\nTo say its a bioshock game is to hurt the legacy of the previous bioshock games.\nPlease don't angry on me.\nHad to say what needs to be said.\nIf you want an FPS game, go ahead and play it.
