Потому что если в одиночной игре, со временем, становится скучновато, то в мультиплерее с друзьями можно рубиться огромное количество часов, каждый раз создавая индивидуальную тактику, наиболее подходящую под ваши типы оружия и под различные карты.\nИ если вам нравится все вышеперечисленное, то я однозначно рекомендую вам купить ее!","timestamp_created":1419502380,"timestamp_updated":1419502380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580421388149261475","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13584492","author":{"steamid":"76561198048230280","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1886,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1576,"last_played":1594851546},"language":"english","review":"ZOMBIE KILLING....AND MORE ZOMBIE KILLING!!!","timestamp_created":1419497977,"timestamp_updated":1419497977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13584315","author":{"steamid":"76561198024821964","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1351,"last_played":1429397567},"language":"english","review":"Kill all zombies!","timestamp_created":1419497037,"timestamp_updated":1419497037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13583727","author":{"steamid":"76561198134030786","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1524077978},"language":"russian","review":"Посмотрел все обзоры к этой игре я не могу понять как игра нравиться им ЭТО ЖЕ ТАКОЙ БРЕД ГРАФА КАЛ УПРОВЛЕНИ КАЛ А ЕЩЕ ЭТИ ЗАМЕДЛЕНЫЕ МОМЕНТЫ.Ну зато есть норм музыка 5/10 игра не окупает свои деньги","timestamp_created":1419493000,"timestamp_updated":1419493000,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13582361","author":{"steamid":"76561198161388807","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2419,"last_played":1622894039},"language":"japanese","review":"I would have gone up bug most kill also too many level also gose from the beginning","timestamp_created":1419484006,"timestamp_updated":1419484006,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13582294","author":{"steamid":"76561198043068614","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2892,"last_played":1480683925},"language":"tchinese","review":"練等有點麻煩,但是很好跟朋友一起殺時間!","timestamp_created":1419483632,"timestamp_updated":1419483632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13581568","author":{"steamid":"76561198045684847","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":411,"last_played":1373641013},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor is in my opinion an okay game.\nIt's nice and fun to play with friends and even alone but it gets\npretty fast boring since it's actually the same thing over and over again.\nHowever it has got a huge armory, a lot of different zombies with different\nabilities and many maps.\n\nIt's fun to play but gets pretty fast boring.\nIf you got some money left.- Buy it\nIf not.- It's not a \"must-have\" so you don't need to.","timestamp_created":1419479419,"timestamp_updated":1419479419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13580718","author":{"steamid":"76561198020448093","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1029,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":992,"last_played":1429946492},"language":"english","review":"Great stuff!

Its fun to play with your friends, but other than that, meh.\n\nSo buy this if you want to play CO-OP with friends.\n\nI would give it a 7.5/10","timestamp_created":1419417848,"timestamp_updated":1419417848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13564969","author":{"steamid":"76561198011055960","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":21957,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21229,"last_played":1487375711},"language":"english","review":"very fun to play","timestamp_created":1419415487,"timestamp_updated":1419415487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501557648181915283","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13563398","author":{"steamid":"76561198142249543","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":58668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3215,"last_played":1656871106},"language":"english","review":"This game is literally my addiction.","timestamp_created":1419407093,"timestamp_updated":1419407093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13563237","author":{"steamid":"76561198150340779","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6261,"last_played":1641860768},"language":"english","review":"Its very amazing game  well who doesnt what a gun shooting game and zombies in it and it has cool DLCes unlockable characters weapons and all that other stuff and it has perks my favorite perk is a berserker , commando , support specialist, fire bug i believe those are the strongest perks i played on i usally play on commando because it is a assult rifle man that knows the health of the ZED and can see stalker (invisible girl) and thats it","timestamp_created":1419406199,"timestamp_updated":1419406199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13562040","author":{"steamid":"76561198089437641","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4553,"last_played":1558522287},"language":"english","review":"nice game","timestamp_created":1419399897,"timestamp_updated":1419399897,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13561723","author":{"steamid":"76561198018795255","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":11410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3604,"last_played":1514999083},"language":"english","review":"AWESOME game","timestamp_created":1419398277,"timestamp_updated":1419398277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13561703","author":{"steamid":"76561198093678273","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":406,"last_played":1561266876},"language":"english","review":"it great","timestamp_created":1419398157,"timestamp_updated":1419398157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13561665","author":{"steamid":"76561198065752125","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5636,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3974,"last_played":1491236881},"language":"english","review":"I shot someone in the face and popped","timestamp_created":1419397973,"timestamp_updated":1419397973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13561586","author":{"steamid":"76561198120302566","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":351,"last_played":1430539640},"language":"english","review":"Once you pop it you can't stop it........oh wait........those are abortion pills.

Make sure you get a bunch of friends though, it's the only way to have fun. The only con I can say is that if you're usually the server host, there's a bunch of ports you'll need to forward.
