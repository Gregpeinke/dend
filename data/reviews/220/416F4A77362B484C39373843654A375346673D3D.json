Undeniably one of the most groundbreaking, diverse, and revolutionary games, of all time. Half-Life 2 is, at the time of writting this review twelve years, nine months, and five days old. I see it fit to mention that after twelve years, over an entire decade, this game still holds up. I have played through this game so many times, too many to count. And with all the hours i have on this game. I can't seem to find any significant problems with this game. Theres the occasionaly loading screen delay, the occasional buddy sound glitches. Nothing major. On of the things I really love about this game, is the way it teaches you. Other games will straight up tell you how to do something through tutorials, some will give hints through dialouge, but this game does it perfectly. A great example of this is during Chapter 6: \"We Don't Go to Reavenholm\" You walk into a room and see a decapitiated zombie stuck to the wall by a sawblade. You must walk through a doorway in which you must remove a sawblade from the wall. At this time, a zombie walks out of another door. And you imediatly notice you must shoot the saw blade at the zombie with the gravity gun. Another thing I love about this game, is freedom. There are no cutscenes during this game. I totally recommend this game to really any gamer.","timestamp_created":1374668507,"timestamp_updated":1503778170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5347796","author":{"steamid":"76561198048296982","num_games_owned":441,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1373858527},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2.
