Das ist nichts anderes als der spezielle Fokus auf bestimmte Fähigkeiten. So bekommt der Sprengmeister günstigere Sprengstoffe, der Berserker einen Bonus auf Nahkampfwaffen und der Sanitäter verbesserte Heilungsmöglichkeiten. Man kann nach jeder Welle diesen auch beliebig wechseln.\n\nUm das Ganze etwas schwieriger zu gestalten, kann man die Perks leveln. So beginnt man bei jeder Spezialisierung auf Level 0 und steigt nach erfüllten Auflagen im Level auf, was wiederum die Boni verbessert. Eine Auflage für den Sanitäter ist zum Beispiel, dass er eine bestimmte Zahl Lebenspunkte von Teammitgliedern heilen muss um aufzusteigen.\nNachdem du nun einen Perk ausgewählt hast, beginnt die erste Welle, in der du schon dein erstes Geld sammelst. Ist diese zu Ende, wird dir der Standort des Händlers auf der Karte bekannt gegeben. Dort kannst du  gegen das gerade verdiente Geld neue Waffen, Rüstung und Munition kaufen. Sind alle Wellen überstanden, folgt eine Extra Welle, die mit dem Auftauchen eines \"Patriarchen\" - also eines Bossmonsters - beginnt und erst zu Ende geht, wenn dieser getötet wurde.\n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ Langzeitmotivation\n+ jede Runde anders\n+ Solo auch spielbar\n+ viele Maps verfügbar\n+ 4 Schwierigkeitsgrade \n+ Multiplayer\n+ gute Grafik\n+ stimmiger Soundtrack\n+ gutes Kampfsystem\n+ verschiedene Perks\n+ Errungenschaften und Trading Cards\n\n[h1] Kontra [/h1]\n\n- andere Spieler spielen nicht immer im Team\n- manche Maps zu dunkel und unübersichtlich\n\n[h1] Fazit [/h1]\n\nWer Left 4 Dead mag, wird Killing Floor lieben.
