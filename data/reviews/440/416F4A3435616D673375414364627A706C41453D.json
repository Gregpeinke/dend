Я не являюсь ветераном этой замечательной игры, и познакомился с ней совсем недавно. Шапки не влияют на геймплей, и без них можно было бы играть (если бы не 8 летние школьники которые ебут тебе мозг ИЗА ТАВО ШТА У ТИБЯ НЕТУ ШАПАК А У НИВО ЙЕСТЬ И ОН КРУТОЙ А ТЫ ДАУН).

Valve pre-2007 really went all out on their creative side, the characters are dynamically designed and easily separated from each other. You dont see that kind of creative input anymore.\n-Very good VAs. Voice acting in this game is amazing! Each character have their own personality through their voices alone. The VAs did an amazing work on this game and Valve in 2007 really knew what they were doing when they hired those talented individuals.\n-Super optimized on all computers. The vanilla 2007 version non updated pre mann. co version of this game was designed to run even on windows 98 and on the oldest hardware you can find! If you've been playing HL1 or Descent 2 on your device and its 2007 and TF2 just got released, you'll find lots of fun with this game.\n-Lots of things to collect! If youre rich and have lots of income to spend, this is the game for you! Rare items galore to fulfill all your e good needs so you'll have the coolest gear on the server!\n\nCons\n-One of the main reason why Valve isn't making single player games anymore. Single players games cost lots of money to make and don't profit the game company 11 years after its release, Hence why instead of making Episode 3 or Portal 3 Valve made DOTA 2 and CS:Go instead so they can leech off the games forever through microtransactions just like Team fortress 2, the first game they made with MTX.\n-Current build is very unoptimized. Dont be fooled by the recommended specs written on this page. You need at least an intel i3 equivalent or above, 30 GB storage space, 4gb RAM, a medium range gaming GPU and Windows 7 or above just so the game can load a map. Otherwise have fun dealing with framerates in the single digits when theres more than 2 players on the server.\n-Pay to win microtransactions. You dont start out with all the weapons and have to collect them trough random drops or through purchase in the in game MTX store. Several cosmetics make it hard for you to aim at your targets especially the ones wearing unusuals with particle effects floating everywhere obscuring their hitbox.\n-\"friendlies\". Due to the high amount of cosmetics and taunts you can show off to people in the game, dont be weirded out if youre kicked from a match because youve killed non aggressive players. Valve has no moderation on these people, it can be troublesome at times, when youre just looking for a normal game and wound up getting on a server where everyone is screwing around.\n-No relevant updates. Most updates this game is getting are just a bunch of cosmetics stuff, no attempt at improving the graphics or optimization of the game whatsoever. Current build isnt TF3 by a longshot, as a matter of fact, some things got worse such as the Medic's medigun and spy's revolver that used to spin after every shot.\n-The game costs more than it looks. This game will siphon your wallet. The MTX is very addictive and will make you spend hundreds of times the game's original worth ($19.99). Remember in game currencies such as Keys and Refs, youll be buying lots of these to get the cosmetics you want.\n-Lack of a vanilla mode. If you crave for a match where nobody is wearing cosmetics and everyone just want to do what the mercenaries are meant to do (kill your adversaries and win a game), forget about it. Such a mode is non existent even on community servers.\n\nOther than that, this game is really fun! I can see Gabe really cares about it more than anything else on Steam since everytime you click on someone's inventory, their TF2 inventory will show up first.\n9/10 game really changed the gaming world post 2010 and game developer's priorities as we know it. \n\nHave fun

But there is also a \"3\" which is about the recent (last 1-2 years) patches:\n3) Last but not least (this one is actually the \"most\"), all the updates applied to the game for the last few years only lead the game to be a TF:GO. The availablity to chose the gamemode, the map, and the server you want to play is not a thing now. You can still decide the mode and the map, but if you chose only one map (and if it is an underrated one like sd_doomsday), you will suffer from old age while waiting for the game to actually connect to a server (it is because matching system is now a thing). The UI was also changed and the menus became different over time but I don't have either a good or a bad feeling about it. Furthermore, the matches you finished now ends in a voting screen to chose the next map you want to play instead of repeating itself until it reaches the server timeout. It is a bad news to people who like playing a specific map for about an eternity. The matching system is now also official and it might seem something good to people. However, it has only a minor benefit while the time the player spends trying to find a server is considered too. Finally, the trolling, dancing and chatting stuff, which were the actual funny part of the game, has started to be replaced with more serious gameplay and competition.\n\n[b]Important Note:[/b] The comment you just read was written by a player who has over 450 hours in the game. It is adviced to notice the potential boredom caused by the game to the player before considering every single detail in the criticism.
