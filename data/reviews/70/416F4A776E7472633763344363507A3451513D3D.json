If you're used to FPS games, or games in general, by today's standards, this will take a lot of getting used to. Objectives are not clearly marked and you will often find yourself wandering around trying to figure exactly where you should be going next...which is fine if you're ok with a little exploration. Aiming is weird...it's sort of automatic, but still feels weird compared to newer games. There's no base controller support and aiming/moving with keyboard and mouse just doesn't quite feel right. The character often feels like he's walking on ice. Walking along small ledges and stuff or trying to make some jumps is a total nightmare. You literally cannot see your character's feet so it's also impossible to tell exactly where you are when trying to get around laser sensor things or the radioactive waste until you set off a mine, activate a turret, or start taking damage from the radiation.\n Basically, it's a pretty good game, and, as far as I can tell, really set the bar for FPS type games going forward from it, but it also feels really dated and can be really aggravating.\n \n-Edit-FML. I can't bring myself to finish the game. Got to Gonarch and just simply can't get through it because it keeps glitching out and the combat and stuff in this game just isn't fun so I have zero desire to pick up from an earlier spot, especially just to start the Gonarch fight all over again. :( I have failed in this undertaking, but it's just not worth it to me right now to continue on.","timestamp_created":1439705691,"timestamp_updated":1439961416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17562198","author":{"steamid":"76561198085178397","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1835,"last_played":1585548201},"language":"english","review":"its good c:","timestamp_created":1439705344,"timestamp_updated":1439705344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17548516","author":{"steamid":"76561198066271573","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":9303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1118,"last_played":1655195951},"language":"turkish","review":"Kendimi bildim bileli eğlenerek ve severek oynadığım oyun.

In case you've been living under a rock for the last 17 or so years, Half-Life is Valve's flagship series, and one of the most significant developments in gaming of the late 90s. What makes it so important? Does it hold up? Well, let's see...\n\nHalf-Life is the story of one Dr. Gordon Freeman and a particular day at his workplace at Black Mesa Research Facility in Arizona. During an experiment involving interdimensional teleportation, something goes wrong. A portal is opened, but an army of transdimensional creatures swarms through, sparking a vicious three way battle between the aliens, the Black Mesa staff, and the military, which has been sent in to clean up... which means no witnesses. Overall, the story is entertaining but not amazing. It does its job and creates an intensity that benefits the game. One of the reasons this game is remembered so fondly is that the game doesn't rely on cutscenes or ever remove control from the player. The story is conveyed by the other members of the cast, but rather than relying on lengthy exposition, each speaking section is brief and gives you just what you need to keep going. In addition, Gordon never speaks. This was to create an immersive atmosphere (Gordon is you), but it can be detrimental to certain players.\n\nGraphically, Half-Life shows its age. The textures are blurry, the character models blocky, the speaking animations hilarious, and the explosions sprites. Even so, while it isn't pretty by modern standards, everything does its job and nothing is particularly offputting, at least for me. In fact, it's got a lovely little 90s aesthetic that pushes all the right nostalgia buttons for me. If you purchase Blue Shift, the second expansion, it comes with a High Definition pack that overhauls the character models and textures, although I'm torn on this, as it makes certain changes I don't care for, such as replacing the MP5 with an M16. It's an option though, if the game has aged too poorly for your taste.\n\nThe gameplay is a combination of platforming, combat, and basic puzzles. The combat is pretty standard for the time, with a large arsenal ranging from your basic pistols, submachine guns, and shotguns to more futuristic weaponry. Most everything has its use, and all are fun to use and feel solid. The enemies are equally varied. You'll be fighting zombies, headcrabs (God, they're annoying), a number of types of aliens, and human marines. In addition there are a number a boss battles interspersed throughout the game, some of which are puzzles and other which are straight up brawls. \n\nThe best thing about the gameplay is the pacing, something I like to call the Valve See-saw. By this, I mean that with a few exceptions, you'll either be in a combat section or a puzzle section, and just as one starts to get old, you'll move to the other. After an intense battle, you can be sure that a few moments of peaceful crate pushing will follow. As a result, the game never feels tedious, despite being a little on the lengthy side, between 10-15 hours. While some may not like the linear nature of the game, it benefits in that you are always moving forward, maintaining the pace. \n\nAll in all, Half-Life was and remains a great game. It looks and feels its age, but if you can look past that (or if you're like me and actually like it), what you get is an absolute blast of a First Person Shooter that's tightly designed and paced, with great atmosphere and shooting.

I did not enjoy this game. Now before the torches are lit and Im sacrificed in the Whicker Gabe let me be clear about this. Im not saying its a bad game per'se Just that in the 21st Century I dont believe that this game has held up as well as it's younger siblings. I first had any dealings with the Half Life Series in the Orange Box for PS3 and I must say it was an absolute joy Cutting edge graphics (For the time) brilliant physics gameplay and a difficulty curve that was fairly progressive, a wonderful set of games (2, episode 1, episode 2) but i'd always been curious about the first game in the series...having played the first 4 levels I personally have come away very dissapointed. the controls are slippery and lacking precision (Key to the success of a platformer in my opinion) and while the plot is engaging the difficulty ranges violently between rediculously easy and painfully hard. \n\nThere are also Glitches, a LOT of glitches. from NPC's floating in mid air to sticking and wall clipping. I will however say the story is fantastic a really solid story that matches the wonderful atmos in Half life 2 easily. Now dont get me wrong for 1998 Im certain that this was utterly breathtaking but having played it for the first time in 2015 I can honestly say I just dont get it. I was hoping to play through all the half life games in order to finally see the story in full...but due to it's utterly frustrating controls I just cant bring myself to struggle through this game to the end...I feel like Im wearing oven mitts in controlling freeman around the level.Having played Most of Valves output post this game  I know they have corrected the controlling of characters in there games so this doesnt prove to be the case in later games... but this game just controls terribly...if your a half life 2 fan and your wondering if you should try it give it a go you may have more luck than me...but I just couldnt crack it...I wont be playing it further.","timestamp_created":1439071129,"timestamp_updated":1439071129,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":30,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.390320092439651489","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17449241","author":{"steamid":"76561198063513424","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":747,"last_played":1438456844},"language":"english","review":"Great story, good campaign.\n\nSven Co-Op makes multiplayer even better.

I'm not going to count the graphics against the game because due to its age, that just wouldn't be fair. Anyway, it does a lot of things right that so many games today really, really struggle with. For starters, you never feel like you have the whole picture. Throughout the game, you'll meet characters who clearly know more about the situation than you do, and just expect you to go along with their instructions. You feel vulnerable and scared, and every tiny little victory you can find is one you will savor for hours until the next one. This game understands good pacing, and demonstrates the difference between gameplay/level variety (this entire series), and  gameplay/level discord (Halo 3). The gunplay is smooth, vicious, and satisfying, the sound design is (to quote a popular phrase) \"hella dope af bruh\", and the story, characters, and atmosphere are all intriguing. However, as I said, it's not perfect. Some of the puzzles are a bit misleading (you'll often go into a room designed to look like you're supposed to move a bookcase, when you're actually supposed to pick your nose and wipe it on your ass), there's just a little TOO much mystery and vagueness surrounding the game's events, which in turn make the player feel alienated (pun not intended), and sometimes the game decides to reinvent the rules without telling you, and take advantage (it's like everyone deciding to play king of the hill when you think you're still playing tag). Still, at least you won't have to read a book. 8/10.","timestamp_created":1438765074,"timestamp_updated":1438765074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17389842","author":{"steamid":"76561198180569046","num_games_owned":887,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1545,"last_played":1630340131},"language":"english","review":"Just play this now, cry about Half Life 3 later.","timestamp_created":1438723569,"timestamp_updated":1466481123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17388518","author":{"steamid":"76561198207155811","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2559,"last_played":1438707745},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game. after playing the demo over 15 years ago it feels good to actually play","timestamp_created":1438718350,"timestamp_updated":1438718350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17388177","author":{"steamid":"76561198041195325","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":16333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11442,"last_played":1569191392},"language":"english","review":"A normal day turned into a nightmare. A normal man turned into a hero. Valve Software's (Presently, Valve Corporation's), 1998 game, Half-Life, is a masterpiece of gaming that never lets up from start to finish. A masterfully, perfect balance of storyline, pacing, action and atmosphere, don't pass this one up! The premise of the story, sees its protagonist, Seattle, Washington, native, Gordan Freeman, a graduate of MIT and having a Ph.D in theoretical physics on his first day of work at an undisclosed location in the New Mexican desert, known as the Black Mesa Research Facility. On a normal day of work, (wouldn't you know that it had to happen on his first day) devastation ensues when a science experiment goes horribly wrong by his own hand or at least partly by his own hand. He doesn't really know what's going on because everything has happened so very quickly, but all he knows is that he must rise to the occasion. He must take on a sense of responsibility for his own actions and attempt to escape the Black Mesa Research Facility, alive, all the while fighting off dimensional aliens and the military forces that have been sent in to clean up the evidence (mess lol). He also enounters the mysterious, G-Man, along the way. A mysterious and eerie figure with a suit and briefcase. One can only assume that Gordon Freeman, because of being a silent character, is constantly questioning what is going on as a result of his actions. He doesn't know but he does it, anyway. Quite the hero! When the player gets to the end of the game, he finds that there's time for only a bit of relief and none for celebration of actually being able escape the facility and Xen, alive, as the mysterious G-Man offers to either hire on Freeman or offer him \"an anticlimax\". There's also quite a bit to say about the G-Man but very little at the same time. Whether the G-Man is a person, some sort of an entity or a figment of the imagination brought on by some sort of attempted mind control or experiments (possibly, government-owned), is not, yet, known. Perhaps, the in-game character of G-Man could even be a reflection of his real life counterpart. On the topic of the soundtrack. The entire soundtrack was brilliant and fit extremely well into the entire atmosphere and storyline of the game. My favorite OST from the Half-Life Original Soundtrack, was Sirens in the Distance. Sirens in the Distance encompassed a sense of eerieness, mystery, perseverance, and was a firm reminder that an average person turned hero now has a sense of duty to take responsibility for his own actions, to not only fight for his own survival but little does he know at the time, the fate of the world as well. The OST begins with hearing the sirens blare twice, over and then the music begins to mimic the sirens and it seems to kind of merge with them at the same time, which was a very creative, move. To me, this OST marks the beginning when his present predictament finally sinks in to Gordon and he really begins to wonder if his actions may not be contained solely within the confines of the facility, itself but may have spread to the outside, world as well. What's happening out there? Is it the same that's happening in, here? Could it be worse? These are imporant questions for when we get to the second game, Valve's Half-Life 2 (2004), things start to be brought into a perspective a bit clearer than, before. We now know that the disaster has made a significant spread into the world, outside of the Black Mesa Research Facility, that the predicatament is worse than originally, thought. The brilliantly developed, protagonist, Gordon Freeman is the single greatest video game character in history. What I really love about Gordon Freeman, above all the other traits, is that the player knows quite a bit about him but also really nothing at the same time. His silent demeanor speaks volumes and allows the player to constantly question what is on his mind. We never really know for sure. He is also a humble reminder that one person, one man, can be enough to make a difference in the world. In a way, Gordon Freeman, is us or at the least a reflection. Of what could happen at any given moment when we least expect, it. Would we rise to be the hero? Again, this is a masterful game with a wonderful main character. A transition, from average person to Hero of the moment and eventually of the world, a man who continues his fight for survival against overwhelming odds, regardless of what comes before him, the ability to take responsiblity for one's own actions, etc. There are so very many motifs and without Half-Life, gaming wouldn't be where it is, today.

With the aid of fellow scientist, Gordon Freeman goes around the facility seeking to stop the invading aliens who seem to be teleporting onto Earth. Simultaneously, the military has come to silence all Black Mesa workers in hopes of covering up the castastrophic incident. Traveling through the insides of the facility to the mountain sides to the strange alien world, there is always danger around the corner along with a few puzzles to get around. Even with a variety of weapons to get ahead of others, you may find yourself in a tough situation from time to time. The story behind all this is full of amazement as it goes on to the sequal.\nMulti-player is also an enjoyment with several maps to choose from, custom or otherwise. Players can always find an enjoyment when playing against each other whether it be underground with water traps to a bomb testing facility to Homer Simpson's house.\nOne thing I would like to point out is the over-powered Tao Gun, a lazor weapon capable of killing people through walls with one charged shot and catapulting yourself across the map.","timestamp_created":1438407482,"timestamp_updated":1438407482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522293031215667725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17323141","author":{"steamid":"76561198013580528","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":102,"last_played":1461884544},"language":"english","review":"//-_à\\\\","timestamp_created":1438379468,"timestamp_updated":1438379468,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17317297","author":{"steamid":"76561197989799735","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":71,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"First real experience with Valve, the game which was founders to everything\n10/10","timestamp_created":1438356523,"timestamp_updated":1438356523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17308176","author":{"steamid":"76561198110146617","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":2077,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1569121346},"language":"english","review":"Honestly, I don't realize why this game is still popular. I mean, back when it was first made I suppose it was groundbreaking. But today, it's nothing special. I believe many people are just sort of brainwashed into thinking it's a really good game...because everyone else thinks it's a really good game. Let's look at why I don't think it's really that good shall we? First of all, there's really no replay value, after you finish the game...that's it man. Nothing else really unless you want to play it again. I don't really mind this though, since it was made in 1998, I don't expect it to have that much extra. Also, everyone says the story is flippin' amazing! Well, I'm sorry to burst your bubble...but it's really not good....in the least...at all. I'll tell you the story right now: You are Gordon Freeman working in a cliche sciency place that accidentally creates a portal to another dimension which sends many strange beings through, you have to survive this while the government tries to cover it up. That's the story folks! I know super amazing! Oh, and at the end they throw in a giant monster! Oh uh...spoiler alert? I mean...to me that just seems lazy. The only good thing about this game is the gameplay, it is actually fun, sometimes, but other times it can just get annoying and repetitive. So overall; meh story, no replay value, semi-good gameplay. But you know what annoys me most about this game is? THEY KEEP REMAKING IT! Look, they have like three different half lifes now. There's Half Life, Half Life source, and Black Mesa. These are almost completely the same, except Black Mesa has better graphics. PEOPLE STOP REMAKING THIS! Make some more original games Valve! *facepalm. Ugh, if you're going to get this game just get the original, don't get Black Mesa...it's just more expensive.","timestamp_created":1438304844,"timestamp_updated":1438304844,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.371895939111709595","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17301376","author":{"steamid":"76561198036904213","num_games_owned":375,"num_reviews":223,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":532,"last_played":1527321209},"language":"english","review":"yes :)","timestamp_created":1438276438,"timestamp_updated":1609959988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.433793127536773682","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17291723","author":{"steamid":"76561198152213920","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":885,"last_played":1623533227},"language":"english","review":"It's Easy To See Why Half-Life is Said to be the Best Game Of all Time.","timestamp_created":1438224302,"timestamp_updated":1438224302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17291459","author":{"steamid":"76561198077260364","num_games_owned":464,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1406,"last_played":1558835718},"language":"english","review":"is good","timestamp_created":1438222572,"timestamp_updated":1511388471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17287104","author":{"steamid":"76561198204898395","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":3821,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1149,"last_played":1551465694},"language":"brazilian","review":"alguém consegue usar o controle do xbox 360 nesse jogo?","timestamp_created":1438200812,"timestamp_updated":1438200812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwntrc7c4CcPz4QQ=="}
