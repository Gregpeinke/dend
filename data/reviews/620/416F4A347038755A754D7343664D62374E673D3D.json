The game mechanics and graphics haven't noticeably changed (nor did they need to) and the storyline picks up more or less from where it left off. But with more ways to solve new puzzles, more AIs to contend with, and more areas to explore, the very simple goal of the game - getting to the exit with portals - doesn't get stale. The game goes about tying up loose ends while providing new tidbits to speculate over, none of which feel like cliffhangers. Co-op has been added both gracefully and quite cleverly. The co-op courses expand the storyline and the partners are given an effective shorthand to communicate with, meaning the chat function is only used in extreme cases. Put simply, Portal 2 really is everything the first was, a solidly great, immersive puzzle platformer, with a bit more of everything.","timestamp_created":1423870687,"timestamp_updated":1423870687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14454665","author":{"steamid":"76561198060937126","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5068,"last_played":1424484852},"language":"brazilian","review":"[h1]MINHAS IMPRESSÕES[/h1]\n\nPortal 2, o meu jogo favorito.\n\nCom certeza um dos melhores jogos da Valve, com uma história rica, uma timeline incrivel e uma OST excepcional, esse jogo vale a pena ser jogado.\n\nO jogo em si se trata de você resolver puzzles, mas o que existe por traz é muito maior.

With Portal 1, there wasn’t much of a storyline that was associated with it. So for Portal 2, I was greatly satisfied that the game had a storyline. This game was a huge hit in my mind, and it wasn't too difficult to 100% the achievements. To follow this up I will now compile a list of the pros and cons of Portal 2.\n\nPros of Portal 2: \n-Great storyline.\n-The levels were quite tough towards the end.\n-The character voices were great in it.\n-The co-op was quite possibly harder than the actual game itself.\n-There were more achievements to complete than Portal 1.\n\nCons of Portal 2: \n- The only real con I have about this game is that the achievements were easier to get than the achievements in Portal 1. With Portal 1 the challenges were extremely difficult to work through, using the least amount of step or portals. I was hoping for some of that in Portal 2, but was mildly disappointed when it didn’t happen.\n- I still didn’t get my cake. (Curse you GlaDos)\n- I lost part of Canasta playing time because of exposure to something.\n\nOverall 10/10 would should portals and kill my co-op partner again.\n","timestamp_created":1423856676,"timestamp_updated":1423856676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14451502","author":{"steamid":"76561197990987847","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4121,"last_played":1495308275},"language":"hungarian","review":"(Y)","timestamp_created":1423856150,"timestamp_updated":1423856150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14450780","author":{"steamid":"76561197974755781","num_games_owned":332,"num_reviews":117,"playtime_forever":3568,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3097,"last_played":1546548676},"language":"german","review":"gutes Spiel... manchmal zu einfach...

The original Portal was a great game. It combined the feel of a first-person shooter with puzzles. The concept is so simple it's genius. You shoot one portal here, shoot another there, and you can walk between the two. Use that to solve the puzzles presented to you. I don't want to spoil much, but Portal 2 provides a few more features than just being able to create Portals. It provides gooey gels that allow you to run faster, jump higher, and shoot portals where they otherwise could not be shot. It also has some anti-gravity elements. \n\nMy goal at playing Portal 2 was to beat it without having to check a walkthrough once. While I did get stuck a time or two. Some heavy thought got me out of it. Sometimes you make the puzzles much harder than the should be, when in reality, the answer is literally right in front of you.\n\nThis game has story, graphics, gameplay, and it will make you laugh your balls off. Definitely play the original Portal first.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1423787203,"timestamp_updated":1423787203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14439071","author":{"steamid":"76561198159758642","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":589,"last_played":1545651979},"language":"spanish","review":"Bueno,acabo de escribir el analisis de portal 1 y ahora toca de este.Me parece igual que el 1 pero 100x.La jugabilidad sigue estando muy pulida,perro lo bueno esta en el nuevo contenido.Más villanos,mas ironía y mas diverisón.La historia me parece mas solida que la de portal 1 y encima es un juego que te incita a explorar hay muchos easter-eggs y en lo que respecta rendimiento,igual que el 1 lo mueve culaquier PC multi nuecleo asi que no os preocupeis por eso.Solo digo que da igual si esta en ferta o no COMPRAOSLO YA!.Adios y hasta otro analisis :)","timestamp_created":1423784799,"timestamp_updated":1423784799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14438943","author":{"steamid":"76561198067874402","num_games_owned":529,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":887,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1020,"last_played":1409514015},"language":"english","review":"This game is just awesome.

Oproti svému prvnímu dílu, Portal konečně nepůsobí jako nudná modifikace, ale je to 100% AAA hra s vynikajícím příběhem.... a ano, příběh je obrovský tahák celé hry. Nejen že nenudí, ale dává vám motivaci hru nevzdávat a žene vás kupředu s tím co se může stát v další části hry. A že se stane... Jinak přibyly různé vychytávky jako sliz, světelné mosty a hromada dalších věcí, které příjemně zpestří hru. I přes krátkou herní dobu a \"němou\" hrdinku jsem si hru užil dosytosti. Hra také nabízí skvělý coop a komunitní mapy, které určitě stojí za vyzkoušení :) Portal 2 je přesným důkazem toho jak by měla dokonalá, sakra zábavná a kvalitní hra vypadat.

Valve took the simple game of Portal, and created an ENORMOUS universe full of fun, secrets, lore, amazing characters, great gameplay, and of course puzzle perplexing portal action. The art design is remeniscient of the first game, and still manages to add both a 50's esque design, and an even late future layout. With the edition of our lovable friend Wheatley, and the return of our all time greatest enemy the \"Genetic Life and Disk Operating System\" or GLaDOS, you know this can't go wrong. Portal 2 completely redefines the genre of puzzle game by adding a memorable plot as well as an even more memorable array of tests and puzzles littered throughout \"Aperture Science\". I give this game all five stars for its ingenuity and creativity in both level design, playthrough, and final execution. I reccomend this game for all people, first person shooter fans, puzzle gamers, and even people who just want a good laugh. Portal 2 has really changed the way I think about Valve and their abilities and I look forward to viewing their other games soon.","timestamp_created":1423547884,"timestamp_updated":1423547931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14412925","author":{"steamid":"76561198065576114","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1440,"last_played":1439241996},"language":"english","review":"Portals 1 and 2 are probably the best games because they are so much different from any other fps.
