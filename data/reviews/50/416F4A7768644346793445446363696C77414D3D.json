off you must know that Half Life: Opposing Force is a standalone DLC for Half Life so play that game first!\n\nExpect the same gameplay as the other Half Life titles with cool interactive puzzles and lively NPCs. Enjoyment of this game will be similar depending on your experience with Half Life. What sets Half Life: Opposing Force apart from the others is the inclusion of a teleportation gun that will send you to the Alien world depending on your position to collect some extra loot which I thought was a clever way to let the player scavenge resources in a pinch if they were in trouble.\n\nUnlike in Half Life and Half Life: Blue Shift where you rely heavily on friendly scientists to achieve your goals, Half Life: Opposing Force felt more like a solo mission where you sometimes meetup with your squadmates purely for some extra firepower. This of course makes sense given the direction of this game to focus more on the action sides of things and did not detract from this path. With the inclusion of many different weapons and additional new types of enemies to kill, Half Life: Opposing Force is worth your time.","timestamp_created":1656697161,"timestamp_updated":1656697161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118007074","author":{"steamid":"76561199286495948","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":45,"playtime_at_review":201,"last_played":1660066788},"language":"english","review":"final level is very strong!","timestamp_created":1656695489,"timestamp_updated":1656695489,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482887715101242065","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117994458","author":{"steamid":"76561198921038097","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":630,"last_played":1656681842},"language":"english","review":"definitely play if you liked half life","timestamp_created":1656681900,"timestamp_updated":1656681900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117976008","author":{"steamid":"76561198861612885","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":74,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1656819346},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1656655879,"timestamp_updated":1656656594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117971019","author":{"steamid":"76561199047715552","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":34,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1660097596},"language":"english","review":"hi","timestamp_created":1656647466,"timestamp_updated":1656647466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117966359","author":{"steamid":"76561198032837237","num_games_owned":364,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":360,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":360,"last_played":1656639213},"language":"english","review":"You're playing as Corporal Adrian Shephard, which is initially assigned to eliminate Gordon Freeman in the Black Mesa Research Facility.

There's plenty to like about it. But I find that its gaggle of ambitious ideas falls flat in practice. New enemy types are obnoxious bullet sponges in all the moments you want them not to be. The handheld barnacle barely gets any use, due mostly to the fact that it is limited by only being able to latch onto organic matter. It's easy to miss certain new weapons entirely with how out of your way you have to go to find them. The boss fight at the end plays like a Mario or Zelda boss--read into that what you will.\n\nPart of why Half-Life was so revolutionary was that it let a whole story, beat by beat, play out around you as you maintain the in-control first-person perspective. Meanwhile, there's barely any real narrative Corporal Shephard has to call his own outside of G-Man deterring him from escaping to tell the tale and stopping the nuke. What a dated notion, by the way, that G-Man needs to minimize witnesses as though his employers were the US government--clashes a bit with the enigmatic endgame of galactic proportions he clearly attends to from HL2 onwards, don't you think? It's a copout, but I guess the interests of his employers are just always unknowable.\n\nIf you want a broader issue that goes more fundamental, though, Opposing Force emphasizes combat over puzzle-solving, and is less forgiving with ammo and recovery. I find that by turning down the brainteasers and room to breathe, the experience loses a lot of what makes it feel like the Half-Life name belongs on it. At a certain point, I got so impatient with the game giving me so much bull all in a row that I turned on godmode and actually enjoyed that experience more.
