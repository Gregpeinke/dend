There will be negatives believe it or not.\n\nYou see, dear reader, when a game is being developed compromises must be made because money is finite. So we end up with games with good stories and crap gameplay or vice versa. This is not the case with Half-Life 2. All aspects of the game are almost equally good to one another and to other games from 2004 (hell even 2017).\n\nPositives:\n\n+ Delightful characters. Well written and designed.\n+ Very good gameplay. Weapons are responsive and it's nice and satisfying when you use them. \n+ Very atmospheric! Seriously, the designer(s) have purposfully used a communist style architecture so you'll get the dystopian feel. There's a level where the horror is nailed much better than dedicated horror games! This is Half-Life 2's strongest aspect - the atmosphere.\n+ There is a lot of diversity (when this word was associated positivley) into the game. You'll be on the run, being almost defensless, you'll be a resistance fighter, you'll drive a boat through toxic wastes, you'll go on a journey with a car visiting abanddoned (or not) settlements, you'll play a pseudo platforming if you don't want to get eaten, you'll see how horror should made in a infested village, you'll be a beastmaster commaning deadly animals.. The game bleeds of effort. (The different stages are not chronological to not spoil).\n+ The story is nice and mysterious. There's philosophy and morality. You have no choice but this game isn't about choice. You're a listener and receiver. Few FPS games have such intriguing story.\n+ The A.I. is good so you'll be challenged. They use tactics.\n+ The gravity gun and physics as a whole. The gun is fun and practical to use. It encourages creativity and freedom. Physics makes the game feel much better. Object react to you and it's fun to blast enemies away. Note the game came out in 2004 so this was a big deal back then.\n+ The sound is very subtle and it does a great job at amplifiying the feelings of the current situation. it's atmospheric. Just like the rest of the game.\n\nNegatives (you didn't believe me did you?):\n\n- When you've recruited enough followers they'll start getting pretty annoying when they block you from exiting rooms. For instance if you enter a room to explore, all of them will follow you in and it will become a clusterfuck at the door. They won't move because they are following so you'll have to push them or you'll have to get deeper into the room so they'll make space for you to exit. But most room you enter aren't that big so you'll have to push. Note this isn't that big of a deal. You'll start getting followers towards the end of the game and only on some levels so this is a minor problem.\n- Another problem is that the dialogs between NPCs' are unskippable so if you do multiple playthoughts or want to speed throught the game you'll be annoyed. A minor problem, especially for first timers.\n- Lastly, except the gravity gun and the crossbow the other weapons are kinda standard. Pistol, submachine gun, shotgun etc. You have a pulse rifle with a neat secondary ability but still.. Considering the positives of this game I feel bad for mentioning this :(\n\nNeutrals:\n\n+/- The driving sequences can be seen both as good and bad. For some this might be an awesome example of diversity of gameplay, for others it might be an inconveniece.\n+/- It has puzzles. Again some might feel this is just annoying and unneeded padding, for others it might be a good time to use the gravity gun.\n+/- Silent protagonist. Many (including myself) consider this lack of feature to actually deepen the game because you can easily project youself into the character of Gordon Freeman. Others might find it dull and weird their character hasn't uttered a word all game and has no personality.\n\nAs you can see the game isn't perfect but it sure is close to it! The negatives are minor inconeviences while the positives encompass big aspects of the every video game. The quality of those aspects, at the time, were better than other dedicated games at just one aspect. Hell some if them are rivaling even todays' games.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a game which shows effort, dedication and quality while sacrificing almost nothing in return.","timestamp_created":1502822014,"timestamp_updated":1504041034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34254556","author":{"steamid":"76561198393050608","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":809,"last_played":1646386282},"language":"russian","review":"Легендарная игра, Она будет вечной.","timestamp_created":1502798270,"timestamp_updated":1647093259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477707028388977051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34253463","author":{"steamid":"76561198297534731","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":898,"last_played":1588072047},"language":"spanish","review":"HALF LIFE 2 + 1 : 3\n\nBuen juego :)\n\nGood game.\n\n11/10","timestamp_created":1502793721,"timestamp_updated":1502793721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34253391","author":{"steamid":"76561198051510063","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":835,"last_played":1584558666},"language":"russian","review":"нравится очень это не сорказм и у меня низкое чуство юмора удачи...","timestamp_created":1502793444,"timestamp_updated":1502793444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477707028388977051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34253360","author":{"steamid":"76561198282603072","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1651940245},"language":"russian","review":"топ\n","timestamp_created":1502793286,"timestamp_updated":1502793286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52046501636505127","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34252963","author":{"steamid":"76561198061627195","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1650,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1540,"last_played":1610404351},"language":"english","review":"Sell your kids, wife, house, whatever it takes.

I know I have played it more than 10 years after the release date, but I still enjoy FPS classics such as Unreal, Duke Nukem 3D, whereas Half-Life 2 was a \"not bad\" experience at best. I don't get why the story is found so spectecular, which in my opinion is not. Yes, the graphics are good, gravity gun is interesting but the game gave me the feeling of \"hey, now we are using the gravity in our games and this is very innovative. so you should appreciate it as a classic\". No... Half-Life 2 is not the best game ever made, it is not even a classic. It is, however, a fairly good game with good sound and atmosphere, average story and shooting physics and some spectacular graphics for its time. There are some chapters that are too long, such as the ones where you use an airboat, in which the game feels more like a tech demo where the devs are trying to impress. And the worst thing about the game, a huge minus, is that Half-Life 2 will likely give you nausea. I have been playing shooters forever, never have I suffered a nausea in a game, which I believe indicates some serious design mistakes. \n\n[b]7.5/10[/b]","timestamp_created":1502557968,"timestamp_updated":1502557968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34195231","author":{"steamid":"76561198041182490","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1131,"last_played":1502556174},"language":"english","review":"Epic classic.

Selbst \"Halo\", \"Bioshock\" oder sonst was kann da einfach nicht mithalten. Noch nie hatte ich in einem anderen Spiel dieses unvergleichliche \"Mittendrin Gefühl\". Warum dies nur HL2 gelingt kann ich gar nicht so richtig erklären. Vielleicht liegt es einfach daran, das hier alles perfekt ineinander greift:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1130714787\n- unerreicht dichte Atmosphäre\n- Gameplay fühlt sich einfach super an\n- die Geschichte und die glaubhaften Charaktere\n- alle Locations sehen glaubwürdig aus (sehr selten in anderen Spielen)\n- viele interaktionsmöglichkeiten mit Objekten\n- abwechslung durch Fahrzeug Abschnitte\n- die gesamte Präsentation\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1169839262\nIch habe das Spiel nun schon etliche Male auf drei Systemen durchgespielt, ohne das es langweilig wird.

Непонятно лишь одно, а хотя наверное понятно, почему не была сделана 3 часть. Все потому, что существуют 2 очень прибыльных проекта: Дота 2 и КС: ГО. Хотя, зная, какой ажиотаж бы вышел вокруг выхода 3 части игры, можно было бы рискнуть для такой-то игры.
