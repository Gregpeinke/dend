Every single line of dialogue hits its mark. The humor and comedic timing is flawless. This game only has four main characters. One of them doesn't even talk and the the other is dead long before the events of the game actually even start and yet, these characters are so realized in their personalities. There are also no cutscenes which means you can still move around while important events play out so that's nice as well. \n\nThe gameplay and level design is so good and playing the co-op mode on this game is a blast. Reflecting lasers back at your friend, making them go into a portal to their deaths, throwing the cube away that your friend needs to open the door to the next level. Actually, don't do that/ You'll probably lose that fore-mentioned friend and break open their sanity.\n\nStephen Merchant is in this game. You know, that one really British accent dude. He co-directed 'The Office'. He, um, was in Logan. He played that Albino hunchback dude.\n\nJ.K Simmons is also in it. He won that Best Supporting Actor Oscar for playing an angry music teacher in Whiplash. He was, uh, also Grunkle Stan's brother and J.Jonah.Jameson in Spiderman.

It's easily one of my top five favorite games.\n\nThe gameplay consists of using the game's various objects to complete the test chambers or, in some cases, navigate around Aperture. This gives the game a very \"Puzzlesolving\" sort of feel. It's extremely satisfying when you finish a test. As you progress the game will open up a ton of different ways to use the items in the chambers and the items in them. This makes a difficulty curve that requires you to think harder as time progresses, making the later Chapters oh so satisfying.\n\nThe graphics are really nice and detailed, and most computers that are worth any sort of a crap will be able to run the game at high settings. For a game from 2011, Portal 2 still manages to hold up graphically to this day. It looks great. The sound design is equally as great, with the way the sound changes depending on what the player is doing, and the stellar voice acting. The voice actors give the characters a lot of charm.\n\nThe story is good, as it takes what Portal 1 established and creates a whole world with it. Where Portal 1 was just you and GLaDOS going through tests, Portal 2 introduces new characters, backstory, and introduces the player to Aperture's \"humble\" beginnings.\n\nThe Co-op, while not the main part of the package, is still an enjoyable experience. It takes advantage of the fact that there are 2 players, which, by extension, means 4 portals. Most chambers require both players to use their brains to come up with the solution together. The Co-op also has its own storyline, though not exactly important. The only significant thing that truly happens is the end scene, but past that there's not much important story details to be found here.\n\nSo what happens when you're done with both the Single player and the Co-op campaigns? There's and endless amount of custom chambers via the Steam Workshop. I haven't played many of them but the ones I have played have been solid. Definitely worth a try. It's also worth mentioning that this game has many achievements for both the campaigns, and while I haven't completed them all on Steam yet, I did 100% the game on Xbox 360 and it was a blast to get every achievement.\n\nTLDR; Buy it, it's a really good game and deserves your attention.","timestamp_created":1507331189,"timestamp_updated":1600719107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35529213","author":{"steamid":"76561198090583682","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":374,"last_played":1574886320},"language":"brazilian","review":"Talvez o melhor jogo de puzzle da história!","timestamp_created":1507330230,"timestamp_updated":1507330230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35528717","author":{"steamid":"76561198130709096","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1624092710},"language":"turkish","review":"Oynadığım en iyi oyunlardan biri.Hayatımda ikinci kez; keşke biri beynimde bu oyunun kaydedildiği yeri silsede şu oyunu tekrar oynasam dedim. :D:D:D\n\nNOT:1.si portaldı. :D:D:D","timestamp_created":1507328179,"timestamp_updated":1507328179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35527021","author":{"steamid":"76561198101040135","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1285,"last_played":1528746247},"language":"french","review":"Un chef d'oeuvre.

This is entirely subjective, though, so some of you may dissent from this view; and\n- The co-op mode provides more content to enjoy with a friend.
