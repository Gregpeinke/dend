In my opinion it's one of the best games of the 20th Century, and dare I say it, of all time (and I'm sure many will agree with me).\n\nThe quirky characters and voices, the repeated models of scientists and cheesy lines are some of what makes this game brilliant, as well as the enemies, the weapons, the plot and the idea that you're one with this game, experiencing it all. For at the time of Valve being such a small organisation, this was a hell of a good job at a game.\n\nI'd highly recommend anyone to play this game, whether you're a CoD hardcore fan or a Minecraft fan, this game is worth a shot.

In 0.5-Life you play as Gordian Firmman who is a scientist working at Black Nasa research facility. One day scientists are doing some test in which you are forced to do very dangerous, simple task that obviously robot could perform even more accurately, though you are proably not very liked by your supervisors, your next task would be proably testing new anti-personell mines by walking on them.\nAnyway during test something goes wrong (I bet it's bug that valve forgotten to fix before release) and it leads to resonance echo wave reverberance pulsative reaction cascade (as you can see it was completely unforeseeable consequence) which open portals to science fiction dimension and brings aliens (proably those ancient ones history channel keeps talking about) to earth. And as if that wasn't enough those stupid grunts from the marines (that were sent to facility to kill everyone because why not) want to show you their war face and prevent you from becoming a free man. Fortunately though after graduating from MIT and spending years studying quantum physics your war face is beyond comprehension of these stupid, mechanicaly thinking, proably supporting copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics grunts which results in their literal extinction. Later during your surreal journey remaining scientists inform you that you have to meet scientists at lambda department of black nasa because for some reason they are the only people that can save world in this situation (why I don't really remember, but considering that lambda is logo of the game I guess it needs to be somehow tied to its story) So you go and meet them and without any waste of time they force you to jump into some portal (but not too early, firmman you fool!) which transports you into shadow realm where you have to... well you don't really know what you have to do, but somehow you manage to find some fancy level transitions that lead you to some of the worst levels you will ever play in this game. What else to add? Well during your stroll through black mesa you will discover that scientists there were also working on sophisticated torture methods (*cough* on rail *cough*) and you will also frequently encounter very mysterious man in a suit with flat head and suitcase who is very mysterious and important to the game (or rather iconic, because no one really knows why is he important and devs never bothered to explain it, instead they wrote famous scenes with him and made him speak quotes that even your grandkids will know)\nSo as you can see 1/2-Life is game worthy of playing and replaying, though I hope one time they gonna fix that resonance avalanchescade bug that always sends you to unforeseen consequence chapter and forces you to play accident% route.","timestamp_created":1419689436,"timestamp_updated":1649410714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13624045","author":{"steamid":"76561198126308963","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":750,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":377,"last_played":1607736714},"language":"english","review":"You don't need to hear this, you're a trained professional.","timestamp_created":1419638505,"timestamp_updated":1434490843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13617639","author":{"steamid":"76561198061133015","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1586646599},"language":"brazilian","review":"Não sou nenhum fã das antigas nem joguei isso quando era pequeno, comprei por saber que era um grande título por que o preço estava ótimo(rsrsrsrs).

In 1998 Half-Life took everything that was great about the FPS and revolutionised the genre in a way Half-Life 2 did in terms of story-telling in 2004.\n\nThe graphics don't hold up well in terms of today's standards, however the gameplay, story, and AI certaintly do. The story whilst cliched was told in a revolutionary way, showing how a story could be done in games without the need for cutscenes and thereby allowing full player immersion. The gameplay never stays the same and showed other developers how to vary the gameplay in each stage, introducing new weapons/enemies, allowing you time to experiment before unleashing a number of enemies at you. The latter stages of the game are a bit of a let-down in comparison to what came before, but it barely detracts from an awesome game.\n\nThe AI holds up just as well as the gameplay and story. The aliens are standard fare, but know when to charge and when to hold back if injured. It is in the Marines that you encounter where the AI shines through. The Marines know how to flank, take cover, throw grenades to get you out of cover, place traps when running away, and fall back when injured. Rarely will you encounter AI as intelligent in most modern games.\n\nIf you want to play a game that many recognise as revolutionary in 1998 and had a profound effect on the games you play today then play Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1419589566,"timestamp_updated":1419589566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13603849","author":{"steamid":"76561198127714549","num_games_owned":418,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":891,"last_played":1419541792},"language":"spanish","review":"Menuda joya!

Half-Life sits in a chair in a vast and golden hall along with only the highlords of the first-person-shooting genre. There we can find the likes of DooM, Wolfenstein, Quake, Unreal, BioShock, GoldenEye, Battlefield 2... Yes, Half-Life is that noble.\n\nGordon Freeman is a physicist gone survivor/gunslinger in chaotic circumstances surrounding the accidental opening of a dimensional portal that brought about alien hostile presence into the Black Mesa Research Facility. The tension can be felt through every sensorial fibre of the narrative, from the stable low-pitch melodies of the soundtrack to the sudden appearances of creatures throughout the many corridors and laboratories found in the maps. The level design is extraordinary, and intelligent in progressively revealing the labyrinthine network of tunnels and ducts that hide vital items for the adequate fast-paced action of a quintessential shooter. However, such a network also provides the player with the strategic edge to approach danger and conflict, something innovative in itself for a genre that is - usually - sadly stigmatised by the shortcomings of linearity.\n\nIts daring features are a testament to the prime product of an age that it was. Half-Life subtly overcomes limitations of its time: it pioneered non-cutscene dynamic action and continuous immersive narrative, allowing the player to actually be part of everything s/he watches from behind the screen. Gordon may never be seen or heard in the de facto game, but the initial display of routine in Black Mesa (the famous tram sequence) drowns the player in unsullied immersion, not presenting any perspective bias or character automation. Gordon Freeman is as \"free\" a protagonist as it gets in a game of this kind.\n\nBe it for the strategic patience necessary to solve its puzzles, or for its compelling themes of cosmic conflict and the possible rough edges of scientific discovery, one shall find satisfaction in Half-Life. The dozens of Vortigaunts, Headcrabs, and Alien Grunts are there to remind the player that different kinds of shooting and approaching are necessary in order to survive both Black Mesa and Xen. How far into the dimensions of suspense and cunning one can get - is up to the player's willingness to brave this gaming gemstone from the late 1990s.","timestamp_created":1419409950,"timestamp_updated":1419950145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":39,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.710833430290222168","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13562309","author":{"steamid":"76561198101471630","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":955,"last_played":1618353972},"language":"english","review":"When critiquing this game, one must bare in mind the age of this piece. A game that dates to a time when I was barely sentient will, unfortunately, mean that there is an abundance of dust that has collected on the proverbial shelves of the core aspects of this game. These eat away at the once prevallent polish of this game.\n\nDespite this, I still find the game fun to play. One must admit, with the level of saturation prevallent in the FPS genre as of my writing this, that even this shooter has more brains than some modern shooters. At the very least, the community of people who actually still play this game regularly is far more mature than the modern shooter community.\n\nWith it's age accounted for, this is still an amazing game. It looked beautiful for the time, it had a great story, the characters were believable, the controlls were pertty good in comparison to other games from it's time, and I actually felt like I got something slightly different out of it each time I did another playthrough.\n\nToday, the game is still rather solid. It still handles relatively well(aside for the ladders), and retains that great story and atmosphere. The pitfalls, when compared to modern games, is the ovbious graphical gap and severe lack of intelligence in the A.I. The animations aren't terrible, but I've seen someone do better with a flash game. It's still nice to play once in a blue moon for a nostalgia trip.\n\nIn short, don't expect this to be a ground breaking experience if you don't have any nostalgia towards it. You will probably still have fun with it if you're not so much of a graphics whore that you can't stand ps1-esque graphics.","timestamp_created":1419401242,"timestamp_updated":1419401242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13561244","author":{"steamid":"76561198096010642","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":716,"last_played":1625272921},"language":"english","review":"Amazing!

I went weeks without doing my homework or watching hentai which are usually my two favorite things to do so my parents knew something was wrong. They asked me if I was depressed and being the young alpha male I was I told them to fuck off and continued to throw myself down the stairs as I read on the internet that was the best way to kill myself. Weeks became months and it became aparant to my family that there was something wrong. They told me if I was going to kill myself I had to do it right, so they gave me two double A batterys and told me to eat them. I spent the whole day trying to crack those batterys open but it was just too hard and I was ready to give up on giving up on life but then my Dad shouted at me from across the hall \"Gonah you fucking retard either kill yourself now or i'll fuck your mother in front of you!\" That horrified me as I hated watching the video of my own contraception so much I knew I had to kill myself then. I quickly swallowed the two double A batterys whole and as I choked on the batterys and started to black out my father started to jerk off onto my writhing body. I ended up waking up in the hospital and the first thing I saw was a doctor leaning over me. I felt weird and clichely asked \"what happend...?\" to the docter. He said \"Gonah i'm sorry to have to tell you this but you have been in a coma for 40 years. It's not all bad you still have Half of your Life left.

A game.... that is still alive somehow after 20 years and people still waiting for new series about it...","timestamp_created":1419007020,"timestamp_updated":1608147432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13451210","author":{"steamid":"76561198041301317","num_games_owned":355,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":955,"last_played":1434125154},"language":"english","review":"First time playthrough and it's as amazing as I thought it would be!

I've just survived critical points with 3% health more often than not after dying numerous times. \n\nPLAY THIS GAME ON WINDOWS XP!
