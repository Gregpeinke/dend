If you've played Portal 1, please pick up this game too.\n\nLike Portal 1, this game is a must have for any puzzle gamers out there, plus one of many games good for newtime Steam users to pick up. Also like Portal 1, I mooched this game off of my brother's Steam account until I got my own account and bought this game for myself. Unlike Portal 1, however, this game has more of a story to it. If you haven't played Portal 1 before, the main antagonist and what they say might be confusing, as it alludes to the first game, so play Portal 1 before you touch this game.\n\nThe story takes place some years after the first game. How many years that is, some fans still speculate, but its probably a minimum of 10 years later, with my guess. You've been incubated after the end of the first game and you've finally woken up. Wheatley, the talking British Sphere, slides on in (literally) and tells you some things before helping you escape and finding your fated Portal gun, then end up meeting Her again. Wheatley becomes your medial sidekick, popping up here and there as a comedic relief. That's probably the best I can do without twirling into spoilers of both games.\n\nThis game is really good. Like, [i] really [/i] good. Not because it's made by Valve, but because it perfectly blended in puzzles and a capturing storyline at the same time that made you wanna play on. The puzzles also naturally get harder as you play on, so it isn't like a fangame where its easy one level and then Valve turns a complete 180 and spikes the difficulty with no reason nor warning: no, the difficulty graduates very well. There are still puzzles that, even though I've completed them so many times, I'd ask my brother for help because I can't figure out what to do. First time players might average out a 10-15 hour gameplay time per completed playthrough, and old time players might average out to 4-5 hours of gameplay time per completed playthrough. I have 10 hours logged through around 2-3 playthroughs.\n\nAll in all, although this game is old news now, please pick it up anyways. It a goodie, it's a classic, and I'm sure you'll love it.\n\n[b][u] Music: [/u][/b] 9/10\n[b][u] Storyline: [/u][/b] 8/10\n[b][u] Gameplay:[/u][/b] 9/10\n[b][u] How is the Price??
