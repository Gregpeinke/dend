O jogo é simplesmente um dos melhores jogos já criados!\n\nHalf Life 2 é exatamente aquilo que os jogadores querem. Uma continuação da história totalmente plausível, com uma jogabilidade muito bem melhorada e gráficos espetaculares. \nA história em si é uma obra à parte. O jogo de forma maestral, te conta os eventos desde o prólogo até o final dentro do próprio jogo (claro, algumas coisinhas realmente tem que serem vistas antes de começar). E Half Life 2 não é diferente.\nA jogabilidade é MUITO boa, com recursos novos em relação ao HL1 e obviamente com armas novas. Ah, mas o velho \"pé de cabra\" de sempre.\nO mecanismo de tiro da franquia Half Life não segue os FPS + modernos (BF, COD e etc). 90% das vezes você realmente mira no inimigo e o projétil não o acerta (em média/longa distância), mas é totalmente irrelevante diante dos altos e intensos confrontos \"corpo a corpo\".\nA dublagem é excelente, gráficos que até hoje são inegávelmente um dos melhores.\n\nFranquia Half Life mudou para sempre e inovou o jeito dos jogadores jogarem FPS, co-op e o sistema \"WASD\". \nMerece nossos aplausos e reverências pelo extraordinário trabalho que a Valve fez com este jogo, inclusive com o Half life 1.\n\nComo eu já disse, você não precisa motivos para comprar esse jogo, Half Life é quesito OBRIGATÓRIO na biblioteca de jogos. São lendas como Half Life que merece aquele canto separado especialmente para ele.\n\nSão jogos como Half Life, Bioshock, Soma......

It's time for me to find out if the game still holds up. \n\nThe story takes place some years after the events of the original Half-Life. Gordon Freeman is woken up by G-Man to find out that the world had been taken by the alien Combine. Gordon is then joined by resistance fighters to find a way to free humanity. \n\nThe gameplay itself is a mixture of shooting, puzzle solving and exploration much like the first Half-Life game. However, all of this is differently executed in Half-Life 2. In Half-Life 2 everything is even more dynamic, because of objects being destructible and having physics, which can result in some memorable chain reactions. \n\nThe world felt to me like a real open world game, while it is still a pretty linear game. This has to do with the fact that you are mostly outside and you can explore the different areas and interact with npcs. The world you play in is around the same city area, which means that this time you aren't going to other alien dimensions. \n\nWhen you think about it there aren't actually that many new things in Half-Life 2. But the things that are new still deliver new gameplay. For instance, the gravity gun that you get can grab and shoot objects which is great for murdering and puzzle solving. The gravity gun really adds a playfulness to the game. The other real new weapon is the bug bait which is a ball that you can throw on enemies or destinations, which will result in a group of your own aliens going to it and attacking the enemies. The only problem I had with this is that you can only use this weapon in a certain section.  \n\nThe other new gameplay feature is that you can now drive a buggy at certain parts. I read people saying that it was the worst part of Half-Life 2. In my opinion even though the buggy feels clunky I loved that part the most. It really gives that open world explorer feeling, because of you have to get out of the vehicle to look around. \n\nThe sounddesign in this game was also done by the same team as the one that worked on the original Half-Life. I can say that I liked this soundtrack even more than the previous one, because of it having more of its’ own style. The epic music sometimes felt a little off though, but they are still fun to listen to. The sound effects add a quirky feeling, and the voice acting is also professionaly executed. \n\nThe storytelling of the game was mostly well executed, with also including storytelling through gameplay. Sadly, unlike in its’ predecessor, you are forced at certain parts to listen to conversations. This can be pretty annoying if you have to listen to it again, without the option to skip it. \n\nI have to say that overall the world, story and gameplay doesn't feel as flawlesly connected as it was in the previous Half-Life. That probably has to do with the fact that the game also wanted to show everything impressive that the engine could do. \n\nThe game took me 12 hours to complete so it was shorter than the original Half-Life, but I guess that also has to do with the fact that at the beginning I unknowingly played on the easiest difficulty. Later I found out I could actually change it in the options menu. \n\nEven with the complaints I have with Half-Life 2 compared to Half-Life 1, I can still recommend it. The game like its’ predecessor was greatly ahead of its’ time, and at some parts maybe still is. While playing I realized that every futuristic game that I played that came out after Half-Life 2 all had big 'inspiration' from the game.  Half-Life 2 is still adventurous enough that it still holds up. \n\nReviews of the other Half-Life games:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/70/]Half-Life[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/50/]Half-Life: Opposing Force[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/130/]Half-Life: Blue Shift[/url]","timestamp_created":1470397595,"timestamp_updated":1470397874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.633445441722869873","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24723715","author":{"steamid":"76561198092288588","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":2481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":963,"last_played":1569989883},"language":"english","review":"A heartwarming tale about a man and his crowbar.","timestamp_created":1470397164,"timestamp_updated":1470397164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24722933","author":{"steamid":"76561198245636438","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":63,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24,"last_played":1477354067},"language":"brazilian","review":"Continuando o incrível HL original, HL2 segue a linha de exclusividade.","timestamp_created":1470393290,"timestamp_updated":1470393290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24722518","author":{"steamid":"76561198017094508","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":196,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":137,"last_played":1512219080},"language":"schinese","review":"经典中的经典，最早玩的半条命除了CS就是蓝色行动，所以玩这一作完全不用看攻略，没有遇到什么阻力。虽然发行时间比较早，但是开高特效后一些水面细节和远景还是有很高水平的。推荐","timestamp_created":1470391106,"timestamp_updated":1470391106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24722480","author":{"steamid":"76561198171749905","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":634,"last_played":1645462894},"language":"russian","review":"Легенда","timestamp_created":1470390931,"timestamp_updated":1470390931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24720465","author":{"steamid":"76561198035066646","num_games_owned":388,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1105,"last_played":1510925594},"language":"schinese","review":"一周目很好，一切都很好。\n但为什么二周目就出现到达固定位置游戏直接卡死没有响应的情况？\n而且是重装很多遍都无法解决 不管换了多少安装盘都无济于事\n我只想刷完几个成就而已","timestamp_created":1470379298,"timestamp_updated":1470379298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503066599369049072","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24720368","author":{"steamid":"76561198303733370","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":24,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24,"last_played":1470377496},"language":"english","review":"(English)\nHalf-Life 2, it's not just a game, it's a masterpiece....\n\nHalf-Life 2, the atmosphere apocalyptic, abandonment, totalitarianism and dystopia, mixed in different proportions to obtain the desired effect.\n\nHalf-Life 2, this is a world where people are no longer the kings of their home world and forced to share him with alien creatures and monsters from other worlds and dimensions. Some aliens helping hand in the fight against the powerful Alliance that has seized the Land, while others continually strive to try human flesh tastes like.\n\nHalf-Life 2, this diversity of gameplay. Now we're just looking around in the city, along the way asking questions plan “What's going on?” and “How does humanity come to this?”. Then we run through the sewers to escape the police. Then roll on a canal boat, simultaneously firing all the living and mechanical-flying that tries to stand in our way. Then the game turns into a Survival-Horror with shooting zombies in a Ghost town when your allies become a mad priest and a trusty shotgun. After that, we will drive the buggy on the desert coast, in company with insect age, trying to eat the main character for lunch. And at the end of all adventures, we will have a revolution and war against the invaders. \n\nHalf-Life 2, is the abundance of enemies and the representatives of different alien races. Insects overgrown crowd Bouncing for the player should he step on the sand. A giant synthetic, one gulp crumbling building. Marines of the Alliance, which recognized the people of yesterday, and now it is the soldiers without feelings and emotions. Headcrabs – creatures-parasites that make people zombies. The allies of humanity in the face of the Vortigaunts. In General, the imagination of developers do not know borders...\n\nIn Half-Life 2 is not something recurring, we are constantly surprised by something new. Skirmishes with opponents are diluted with puzzles with the use of basic knowledge of physics, Hiking in confined spaces at times are replaced by the adrenaline of the race along the coast or sunken channels, and then throw us to the streets of a bombed city 17 straight to the enemy loopholes. Characters appear and disappear, and not having time to clarify the complete picture of the events occurring in the world. \n\n(Русский)\nHalf-Life 2, это не просто игра, это шедевр….\n\nHalf-Life 2, это атмосфера апокалиптики, заброшенности, тоталитаризма и антиутопии, смешанные в разных пропорциях для получения должного эффекта.\n\nHalf-Life 2, это мир, где люди больше не цари своего родного мира и вынуждены делить его с инопланетными существами и чудовищами с других миров и измерений. Одни пришельцы протягивают руку помощи в борьбе с могущественным Альянсом, захватившим Землю, а другие то и дело норовят попробовать человечину на вкус.\n\nHalf-Life 2, это многообразие геймплея. Сейчас мы просто осматриваемся в городе, попутно задаваясь вопросами плана “Что вообще происходит?” и “Как человечество до такого дошло?”. Затем мы бежим по коллекторам, спасаясь от полиции. Затем катимся по каналам на лодке, попутно отстреливая всё живое и механическое-летающее, что пытается встать на нашем пути. Затем игра превращается в Survival-Horror с отстрелом зомби в городе-призраке, когда твоими союзниками становиться лишь безумный священник и верный дробовик. После этого, нас ждёт поездка на багги по пустынному побережью, в компании с насекомыми-переростками, норовящие съесть главного героя на обед. А под конец всех похождений, нас ожидает революция и война против оккупантов. \n\nHalf-Life 2, это обилие врагов и представителей разных инопланетных рас.

\"By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.\" [/b]\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\n[b] Half-Life 2 is the direct sequel to the award-winning original, Half-Life, released on Nov. 16, 2004. The story continues the adventures of past-Black Mesa researcher and scientist, Gordon Freeman. After being put in stasis by G-Man after the Black Mesa incident, Gordon is sent out again almost 20 years after the event, greeted by the barren, desolate, and oppressed world that is planet Earth. The event that was the Resonance Cascade, which opened up a portal from Xen to Earth, allowed the creatures from Xen to flood in, killing scientists and marines alike. The aliens of Xen were followed by a greater, even more powerful race, called the Combine, who started and ended the Seven-Hour war, declaring the creatures of Xen and humans of Earth as their own. They took control of the Earth, and started funnleing out a never-ending stream of soldiers, who beat down and controlled the human populace. When Gordon steps out of stasis, he joins the Resistance, a human and alien force who constantly battle the Combine to once again free the Earth. [/b]\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\n[b] Half-Life 2's Gameplay is centered around the use of weapons in combat, as in the original. Yet, as not seen before, you are now given the oppurtunity to explore your surrondings completely, finding tucked-away areas and hide-aways brimming with secrets and discoveries. The game is set in a first-person view, with your character, Gordon Freeman, not talking or reacting to the enviroment in any verbal way. This gives You, the player, complete immersion and focus, letting you feel, see, think, and do exactly how you want and the way you want. Valve, the creators of the Half-Life series, have created one of the best realistic-physics engine to date, the Source engine. This means that any and all items, vehicles, furniture, materials, weapons, creatures and people will react to the enviroment realistically, such as weight, visibility, health, and more. There are many weapons to use, such as the SMG, Rocket Launcher, and brand-new Gravity Gun. The Gravity Gun can pick up objects in the game, even the heavier ones like barrels and dressers. You can use the Gravity Gun to pick up objects out of the way, punt them great distances, and use them as blunt weapons when thrown. And, yes, the crowbar is back, which can be used for breaking obstacles and killing enemies. [/b]\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\n[b] The Graphics of Half-Life 2 are made by Valve's game engine, Source. With this, the enviroment can look fresher then ever, with swaying grass and rope, white clouds and bright suns, and shiny, polished floors, and rough, cut wood. The graphics of Half-Life 2 are not, in any way, a showcase of today's games, but do feel surprsingly realistic and crisp, and look quite good even after all these years. [/b]\n\n[h1] Overview [/h1]\n\n[b] Half-Life 2 is a masterpiece of a game, winning over 39 Game of the Year awards, among others, and is widely considered to be the best game of all time. The characters are unique and quirky, like rebelious Alex, nervous Dr. Kleiner, and confident Eli. The enviroments range from city streets, to zombie-infested rooftops, to a Combine-controlled prsion. Weapons are powerful but require precision and focus, battles are challenging but have to be examined and tactically played, and the enviroment is breath-taking but deadly and dangerous. This is the kind of game every person should play at least once, from indie-game casuals to multiplayer tryhards. So, put on your H.E.V. suit, grab your trusty crowbar, and become The One Free Man.
