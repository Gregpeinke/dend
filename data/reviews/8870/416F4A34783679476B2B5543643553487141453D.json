Herní svět je opravdu krásný a barevný, ale i dost brutální. Vše je spojeno kolejemi pro velké dopravní prostředky nebo na dopravu nějakých věcí, ale i vy nebo vaší nepřátelé na ně velmi brzy naskočíte a budete je sjíždět jako skluzavky (obzvláště v soubojích). Jsou v něm i nějaké vedlejší úkoly, ty jsem ale nesplnil. Našel jsem jen dva, ale možná jich je více. \n\nŘekněme tedy, že je to opravdu střílečka. Jak se vyvedl soubojový systém a zbraně?\nNejprve bych řekl, že hra rozhodně není procházka růžovým sadem. Na střední obtížnost jsem dost často umíral, ale na druhou stanu nejsem úplně skvělý hráč.\nŘekl bych to takhle, soubojový systém je založen nejen na tupém znásilňování levého tlačítka myši, ale souboje vyžadují i dost přemýšlení. Nepřítelé jsou dost silní, a když nebude hrát takticky, může se vám taky stát, že budete jen pobíhat po mapě, protože ta obrovská mechanická obluda je pár metrů za Vámi a Vám došly náboje. Můžete využívat vigory, což jsou takové superschopnosti, které obdržíte při průchodu hrou, a ty můžete použít, když máte dostatek soli. Každý vigor stojí jinak, ale i ty nejlevnější se rozhodně nevyplatí vyplývat. Stejně jako zdraví si soli můžete dokoupit v nákupních automatech. Také si můžete zbraně a vigory vylepšit.\n\nNyní k příběhu. Příběh je plný zvratů a nečekaných události, ačkoliv jedna událost, když se odehraje už asi potřetí, začne být otravná, ale dost možná to udělali autoři schválně. Obzvlášť ke konci už budete dost nechápat. V podstatě vše, co se na začátku i během děje řekne, se dost pravděpodobně rozvine ke konci. Během hry potkáte i společnici Elizabeth (vy se jmenujete Booker DeWitt, to jsem možná mohl zmínit), se kterou se budete snažit utéct. Proč a jestli se to povede, Vám nebudu prozrazovat.\n\nKdyž už jsme byli u té Elizabeth, je nutné zmínit umělou inteligenci. Ta je podle mě jednou z největších kladů hry. Nepřátelé jsou postupem času chytřejší a chytřejší, mají dobrou mušku a najdou si Vás. Elizabeth Vám ale většinu času pomáhá, a to i v soubojích. Například Vám může hodit náboje, zdraví, soli i peníze. U těch peněz jsem přišel na jediný problém, a to, že Vám je může hodit v naprosto nesmyslnou dobu. Třeba když se schováváte za rohem, máte poslední čárku života, ani kousek soli, pět nábojů do pistole, ale několik tisíc dolarů, hádejte, co Vám Elizabeth hodí? Velký problém to ovšem není, automaty jsou téměř všude. \n\nV celé hře mně vždy dost vytrhlo, jak náhlý byl přechod mezi dobrou, ale stále střílečkou, a skvělou příběhovou hrou. Bylo to vždy trošku zvláštní. Někdy jsem dokázal dost přesně odhadnout, kdy se začne střílet, a kdy se naopak začne mluvit. Je to škoda. \n\nNa hudbě jsem nic moc zvláštního neshedal, až na tu v titulcích, protože byla prostě skvělá.\nHru jsem koupil ve slevě za 7 eur, což je dost málo. Ovšem čtyřicet nebo kolik eur, to už je na mě moc.\nV recenzi jsem nezmínil spoustu věcí, ale chci, aby jste si užili hru aspoň trochu jako já.\nHru jsem dohrál za osm hodin, ale víte, ty vedlejší úkoly. Ale bylo mi smutno, když hra skončila. \n\nNebudu tu teď vypisovat klady a zápory, prostě tomu dám 10/10 a řeknu Vám, že je to jedna z nejlepších her všech dob! Masterpiece!!\n\nPS. Ten bapstismus na začátku má dost velký smysl.","timestamp_created":1534657796,"timestamp_updated":1539512613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44240745","author":{"steamid":"76561198090488090","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1924,"last_played":1534549901},"language":"spanish","review":"muy recomendado.","timestamp_created":1534637829,"timestamp_updated":1534637829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44240715","author":{"steamid":"76561197988531423","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":767,"last_played":1554565043},"language":"english","review":"visually stunning and great creativity and gameplay\nincredible story","timestamp_created":1534637684,"timestamp_updated":1536185040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44239666","author":{"steamid":"76561198085916592","num_games_owned":322,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1298,"last_played":1534706097},"language":"english","review":"This is no doubt one of the best games I've ever played. Just.. holy fucking shit, what an experience!\n\nCompared to the previous BioShock titles, this game differs quite a lot; The first thing that I noticed is that the main character talks and he has a personality, and a backstory. The gameplay has been improved from the previous games quite a lot too, and it was so much fun playing this game. Without spoiling much, the storytelling and the idea was a top notch. I never expected this game to have THIS GOOD story. It's really interesting and it makes you think. Not that many games do that as successfully as this one. Also, compared to the previous games, BioShock Infinite takes place in Columbia; a floating steampunk city (which is fucking awesome btw). It was refreshing to see some other setting than Rapture for once, but I gotta admit, I think Rapture was a better setting than Columbia, and I wish there was more Rapture in the main story.\n\nAlso, Burial At Sea DLC is amazing! It blends together the timelines of Columbia and Rapture perfectly. Especially the part 2 of it, because it has more of a sneaking Dishonored kind of gameplay, that hasn't been explored in BioShock before, and I really enjoyed it. I also like that you can actually see what the Rapture was like before shit hit the fan lol.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone, but especially for those who are into steampunk, time travel and thinking about existential stuff. Even though this isn't directly connected to the previous games, I still recommend playing the first two before this. I really can't stress this enough, this game is SO GOOD!

Don't get me wrong, this is an insane, amazing, beautiful, and otherwise masterpiece of a game, but I don't know if I can call it Bioshock. I replayed Bioshock 1 and 2, both were very similar in their mechanics. There was hacking that took time, security cameras that triggered alarms on you or if you hacked it, your enemies. Weapons, ammo, upgrades were scarce and you had to delegate a lot on conserving ammo or conserving eve. Finding weapon upgrading stations made you feel more in touch with the game as you wanted to explore every nook and cranny to get your weapons to their full potential and stock up on ammo and supplies. Bioshock Infinite was, more or less, easy. Ammo was everywhere, upgrading anything took money which, as well, came in abundance and wasn't hard to come by. I'm like 5 years late but whatever, just been on a Bioshock binge. \n\nBioshock Infinite is very fun, don't get me wrong, but it's also very easy. Mid-way through the game I had only used 2-3 guns that I fully upgraded, the plasmids I used were fully upgraded, eve capacity was maxed out, and I just blew through the rest of the game. The inclusion of the shield really made you careless in this game, in my opinion, never upgraded my health just my shield and eve. You can rationalize the game however you want, with the lore, developers, whatever. I think the developers wanted to create a game that was suited more for the generation of gamers who are used to being practically invincible and overpowered. That doesn't mean I think they skimped on the story and background, this game is full of lore and interesting plot points you wanted to find out so bad. Why this had happened, when did this happen, how am I involved, who are these people, the game barely answers these questions until the very end where it can still be left vague. Leaving you wanting for more and to understand.\n\nAll and all, this is a very fun and nice game with one of the best storylines in the past 10 years of gaming. Mechanics are solid and gameplay makes you feel more like the DOOM guy as time goes on. I don't think the $30 price point is too high, but there should be a NewGame+ option to add more replayability. There is a 1999 mode, which is fucking insane, honestly feels more like Bioshock considering the game is much harder and you play much more selectively. Read up on 1999 mode if you're masochistic.\n\n11/10","timestamp_created":1534513627,"timestamp_updated":1534513627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44205602","author":{"steamid":"76561198301430851","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1013,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":808,"last_played":1556226485},"language":"turkish","review":"\n  İlk Hikaye;\n\n Oynadığımız karakterin adı Booker Dewitt'dir.

Borç'landıığı kişiler de Booker Dewitt'e ''Sen kızı bize getir, Borç ların silinsin'' der. Ama bahsettikleri kız da Gök teki Columbia adlı bir şehirdedir. Evet GÖK TE.

It comprises countless topics and criticisms in its story such as inhumane experiments, utilitarianism, a criticism of the American Dream, criticising bad aspects of American society, their pioneer myths and strange fruits of religious freedom (cults which are registered as official religions and care to propagate a white-washed image but are actually the contrary), last but not least religious fanatism mixed with racism. The whole setting of a city in the sky is already a comment on sky-high hypocricy, how there is a beautiful facade with deep shadows lurking behind it, how there are big contrasts between the upper and lower class, the goals propagated to the public and what reality really looks like, drowning everyone in traditions and activities which will make people divert their interests from what is actually happening. \n\nFor the observing player, this setting is abundant in comments, quotes, criticism to the point of shocking you and making you question / think on dynamics in any society, not only American. Let alone for this very inspiring world, the game deserves highest praise! This is as far as I can remember the only mainstream title which ever dared to be so outright sarcastic of current developments. Compared to BioShock 1&2, which were a dystopia of scientific freedom, lacking any moral and ethic limitations, BioShock Infinite on the contrary is a protrait of a society being controlled and manipulated by worshipping fake idols, saints and values, a society so fanatic, that slightly different thoughts are heresy. \n\nThe atmosphere, soundtrack, design of the world all contribute perfectly to this theme and still look quite nice even years later. Quests are diverse, keeping you entertained all the way. At the end of the game the story will become very philosophical leaving a lot of space for interpretation, but also comprises some very complex scientific theories which are still today discussed by elite scientists. \n\nThe story has a few twists and the only negative point I have to write down is, that it becomes a bit chaotic as soon as you step through the first portal to alter the course of actions. It's rather hard to follow the time line and development from there. Also the story is missing some explanation on the implications of what has happened. \n\nOtherwise I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a profound social, religious and scientific discourse on our present time together with a fast-paced FPS (9.5 / 10 points).","timestamp_created":1534249569,"timestamp_updated":1534249569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44139977","author":{"steamid":"76561197991177649","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1838,"last_played":1534317143},"language":"russian","review":"Букер - Пророк","timestamp_created":1534245959,"timestamp_updated":1534245959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.434782594442367554","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44139809","author":{"steamid":"76561198401195738","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1534315289},"language":"schinese","review":"无可争议的叙事神作！它值得你花的每一分钱！\n游戏具有令人惊艳的剧情，剧情深度很高，在后期开始爆炸，游戏结尾我一直没有把嘴合上。\n另外，游戏的画面的美学表现非常好，许多画面可以直接作为壁纸。\n游戏的缺点在战斗上。尽管游戏提供了很多装备，但我一直用霰弹+狙，异能基本上没用过。不过游戏紧张的音乐一部分弥补了乏味的战斗。\n建议一同购买DLC海葬\n\n我们需要中文。\nWE NEED CHINESE.\n","timestamp_created":1534245436,"timestamp_updated":1534245436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44138190","author":{"steamid":"76561198249876408","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":708,"last_played":1652189922},"language":"schinese","review":"我永远喜欢伊丽莎白。","timestamp_created":1534239634,"timestamp_updated":1534239634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44137401","author":{"steamid":"76561198140980376","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":3587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2311,"last_played":1589897179},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun çok güzel.

You work as a private investigator, trying to find a kidnaped girl in a flying city, Columbia. The city itself looks breathtaking, perfect in every possible way. It seems like nothing can go wrong in a place like this. You will probably explore the city for a while before something happens, visit the local carnival, enjoy some food and wine, try out some vigors and talk to big number of (a bit too friendly) people. But once shi* hits the fan you will change your opinion. Columbia will look dark and dangerous all of a sudden and you will feel like everyone is trying to kill you. Columbia is ruled by a religious madman, who believes that you are a \"false shepherd\" who needs to be exterminated. As soon as he realised that false shepherd is pretty good with a gun he starts sending elite units after you, like handymans, firemans or motorized patriots who serve as the game's mini bosses. At first this was just another job, but soon it became personal. You had to protect that girl and get her out of there, no matter what. :D\n\nDLCs are well made, 2 of them take you back to our beloved Rapture, under the sea. The third dlc is a type of an arena, where you fight waves of enemies using different guns.\n\nA classic that shouldn't be missed.","timestamp_created":1534005099,"timestamp_updated":1542912000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44072596","author":{"steamid":"76561198067583559","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1419,"last_played":1569883554},"language":"english","review":"What's that?

You started out not knowing what this bounty hunting job was all about, and ended up confused as to how any of this could have happened in the first place... [spoiler]Or maybe I'm just dumb, in which case please forget about what I just said lol. [/spoiler] However, for me personally, the cutscenes were still fun and intriguing to watch even though I didn't understand a damn thing...\n\n[b][u]Gameplay (mostly gunplay) is decent overall.[/u][/b] I'm a glutton for shooter games, so I played mostly without all the fancy abilities, and I liked the gunplay quite a lot. One thing worth mentioning is that [b][u]the more I played, the less excited I was for a good fight.[/u][/b] There is really not much variation to the gameplay, so I would say the gameplay is the most engaging at the start, and will likely become less and less so as you progress through the game. Enemies may get super tanky in the later stage of the game, so be prepared to shoot your LMG aimlessly (pun intended) at a pillar-sized target and watching his health bar dropping at 0.0001cm/s.\n\nTo be very honest, [b][u]the PC mouse&keyboard controls are pretty trash, and you are given very few options to customize your controls.[/u][/b] [spoiler]You can't really blame the game for that because it was released 5 years ago - it can't be perfect by today's standards. So again instead of judging the game, I just want you to know what kind of problems you may run into when playing.[/spoiler] Things that I found annoying include: 1) mouse sensitivity is significantly lower when you are sprinting; 2) sometimes you press [shift] and the character just doesn't sprint [spoiler] if this happens to you when you are being chased by some giant machine, good fucking luck[/spoiler], gotta mash [shift] several times; 3) can only toggle (can't hold) sprint/aim down sight/crouch, etc.; 4) cannot adjust aim down sight sensitivity; 5) any action that requires you to hold some key may randomly stop working [spoiler]usually at the most inopportune moment[/spoiler]; \n\n[b][u]User Interface is not user-friendly.[/u][/b] Among all the games I've ever played, this game has the most confusing navigation mechanics[spoiler] especially when you are near the skylines [/spoiler], not to mention that at some point in the story, there is just straight up no navigation at all, which I suspect may be a glitch. If I'm not wrong, there is no map or mini map, either.\n\nPerformance-wise: running on my beast desktop with i7-8700k and 1080, game crashed twice, glitched once [spoiler]the last enemy was invisible (probably stuck somewhere) and I couldn't end the combat and had to restart [/spoiler]. And I also had some stuttering and FPS drops in the early stage of the game.\n\nI don't know why I'm still giving it a positive review after complaining so much about it. It's hard to say; I actually still had quite a stunning experience with this game despite all the issues, for some reason[spoiler]I finished the game basically in one sitting - couldn't really stop[/spoiler], and I by no means would advise you against trying it out.
