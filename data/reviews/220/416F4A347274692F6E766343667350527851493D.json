Gordon Freeman was nowhere to be found, yet here he was 20 years later in the place where he was needed the most-Citadel 17. The game is about Gordon getting escorted to Eli Vance to destroy the Combine (Eli Vance was with Gordon in Black Mesa), but it doesn't work out as planned so he has to travel by alone and sometimes with Alyx. So Gordon Freeman travels through many obstacles the main obstacle is The Combine who have invaded Earth. United States of America seems to have been completely destroyed (according to Half-Life Alyx) by The Combine.  Gordon's partner is Alyx Vance the daughter of Eli Vance. Gordon somehow is as young as he was 20 years ago (he is 27). Gameplay: From the start you will have the HIV suit and a crowbar, progressing through the game you'll get more and more weapons such as the Gravity Gun, Shotgun etc. The game is revolutionary because of it's physics engine, because the physics are so greatly made you can use the Gravity Gun to kill enemies with obstacles that are nearby the puzzles use the physics greatly too...\nImmersion: The sound effects of the game are absolutely fantastic it is very immersive. Some enemies are back from the first game but also there are new enemies (such as the Combine) and the AI is very well made but it is far from perfect because this game is forgiving to you, in the first game you have to ALWAYS think about your surroundings and move or you will die, but in the Half-Life 2 you can stand in one place and not die... The atmosphere is very well made too, the game has a lot of iconic places for example the Citadel itself or Ravenholm. The characters such as Wallace Breen or G-Man, Barney etc. Make the game even better because this game has sublime voice acting...\nOverall: The game is a masterpiece with amazing characters, a great story, groundbreaking physics, greatly made places that have amazing set pieces, gameplay in some parts can get a little bit boring, music is great and I give it a 9.5/10...It has little something for everyone.","timestamp_created":1611741412,"timestamp_updated":1611741412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.638093471527099609","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85431274","author":{"steamid":"76561198200029775","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":1322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":607,"last_played":1639057496},"language":"english","review":"gramvity

Добро пожаловать в Сити 17.\n\nСами вы его выбрали, или его выбрали за вас — это лучший город из оставшихся. Я такого высокого мнения о Сити 17, что решил разместить свое правительство здесь, в Цитадели, столь заботливо предоставленной нашими Покровителями. Я горжусь тем, что называю Сити 17 своим домом.\n\nИтак, собираетесь ли вы остаться здесь, или же вас ждут неизвестные дали, добро пожаловать в Сити 17. Здесь безопасно.\n\n\n\n\n\nМне стало известно, что в последнее время меня называют коллаборационистом, как будто сотрудничать — позорно. Я спрашиваю вас, что может быть лучше стремления к сотрудничеству? В нашей беспрецедентной ситуации отказ от сотрудничества — это отказ от развития, равный самоубийству.\n\nОтказывалась ли двоякодышащая рыба от воздуха? Нет. Она храбро ползла по суше, тогда как ее сородичи оставались в черной бездне океана, вглядываясь во тьму, невежественные и обреченные, несмотря на вечную бдительность. Станем ли мы повторять путь трилобитов? Неужели всем достижениям человечества суждено стать лишь осколками пластика, разбросанными на окаменевшем ложе между Бургес-Шейлом и тысячелетним слоем грязи?\n\nЧтобы не изменять себе и своей судьбе, мы должны стремиться к большему. Мы выросли из своей колыбели. Бессмысленно требовать материнского молока, когда истинная помощь ждет нас среди звезд. И лишь всеобщий союз, который люди недалекие именуют «Комбайном», поможет нам достичь их.\n\nПоэтому я заявляю — да, я коллаборационист. Мы все должны охотно сотрудничать, если хотим пожать плоды объединения. И мы определенно пожнем их.\n\n\nПозвольте мне зачитать письмо, которое я получил. «Уважаемый доктор Брин. Почему Альянс подавляет наш цикл размножения? Искренне Ваш, обеспокоенный гражданин».\n\nСпасибо за письмо, гражданин. Конечно, ваш вопрос касается основных биологических потребностей, надежд и страхов за будущее вида. Я вижу и несколько невысказанных вопросов. Знают ли наши Покровители, что для нас лучше? Что дает им право принимать такие решения за человечество? Отключат ли они когда-нибудь поле подавления и позволят ли нам размножаться?\n\nПозвольте мне развеять сомнения, лежащие в основе вашего беспокойства, чем отвечать на каждый невысказанный вопрос. Сначала давайте рассмотрим факт того, что впервые в истории мы стоим на пороге бессмертия. Этот факт влечет за собой далеко идущие выводы. Он требует полного пересмотра наших генетических потребностей. Он требует планирования и обдумывания, что идет вразрез с нашими психологическими установками.\n\nВ такое время необходимо, может быть, напомнить себе, что наш истинный враг — это инстинкт. Инстинкты воспитывали нас, когда мы только становились. Инстинкты заботились о нас и оберегали нас в те тяжкие годы, когда мы делали первые орудия, готовили скудную пищу на костре и вздрагивали от теней, скачущих на стенах пещеры. Но инстинкт неотделим от своего двойника — суеверия. Инстинкт неразрывно связан с необдуманными импульсами, и теперь мы видим его истинную природу. Но инстинкт знает о своей бесполезности и, как загнанный в угол зверь, ни за что не сдастся без кровавого боя. Он может нанести человечеству смертельную рану. Инстинкт создает своих тиранов и призывает нас восставать против них. Он говорит нам, что неизвестное — это угроза, а не возможность. Инстинкт хитро и незаметно уводит нас с пути изменений и прогресса. Поэтому инстинкт должен быть подавлен. С ним нужно нещадно бороться, начиная с основной потребности человека — потребности в размножении.\n\nМы должны благодарить Покровителей за помощь в борьбе с этой всепоглощающей силой. Нажав на переключатель, они изгнали наших демонов одним движением. Они дали нам силы, которые мы сами не могли найти, чтобы справиться с этой манией. Они указали нам цель. Они помогли нам обратить взоры к звездам.\n\nЯ уверяю вас, подавляющее поле будет снято в тот день, когда мы овладеем собой, когда мы докажем, что больше в нем не нуждаемся. И этот день превращения, по сведениям из надежного источника, недалек.\n","timestamp_created":1611643010,"timestamp_updated":1611643010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85365664","author":{"steamid":"76561198107558384","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":907,"last_played":1610784376},"language":"english","review":"I FINALLY played that game I missed because I was too busy with Halo 2 in 2004.\n\nHalf Life 2 presents you with a fascinating dystopian world, complete with a novel physics engine and well written and designed characters (inculding enemies).
