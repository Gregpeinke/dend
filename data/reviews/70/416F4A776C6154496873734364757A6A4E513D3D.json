Muzyki przez większość rozgrywki nie ma. Od czasu do czasu się pojawia, są to elektroniczne rytmy, które idealnie pasują do klimatu science-fiction. Half-Life posiada ciekawą, aczkolwiek momentami słabo wyczuwalną fabułę. Przez całą grę idziemy przed siebie, nie bardzo wiedząc gdzie i dlaczego. W grze jest dużo rodzai przeciwników, od żołnierzy HECU do najbardziej dziwacznych kosmitów. Również nasz arsenał jest bardzo bogaty, oprócz standardowych broni mamy do dyspozycji eksperymentalną broń Black Mesy i technologie obcych. Choć większość czasu spędzamy przemierzając korytarze ośrodka badawczego, zabijając napotkanych Xenian i żołnierzy,  to czasami musimy rozwiązać zagadki czy wypróbować swoje parkourowe możliwości. Produkcja Valve dla niektórych może się wydać trudna i rzeczywiście tak jest. Wiele razy próbowałem przejść dany fragment gry tak, żeby stracić jak najmniej życia, energii i amunicji. Momentami jest to frustrujące, ale gdy nam się już uda, to satysfakcja wynagradza trudy.

Prior to HL, most games required roaming around corridors in predetermined paths shooting monsters and grabbing keycards. People loved it (and still do). But then HL came out and totally took things to a whole new direction. FPS were not just simple gimmicky shooters, they had puzzles, platforming sections, multiple paths and smart enemies. HL did all of this when nobody else did and it was a step forward in gaming. That was then. \n\nToday, Half-Life has shown it's age quite a bit. The AI is less smart, and more just frustrating. The enemy respawns, which were once terrifying, are now just a grind. The graphics, which were years ahead at it's dawn, are definitely aged. Then there are bugs. Bugs galore now. You can get by without ever playing half-life and just go straight to it's sequel, (which is arguably more frustrating in areas). But doing so you would miss out. Because despite all of Half Life's frustrations, it still remains a fun and challenging experience. \n\nYou should play Half-Life. More so, you should have played it 15 years ago.","timestamp_created":1422810451,"timestamp_updated":1422810451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14278365","author":{"steamid":"76561197995183809","num_games_owned":735,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":31,"playtime_at_review":97,"last_played":1660491975},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor série de jogos de todos os tempos!","timestamp_created":1422794310,"timestamp_updated":1422794310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14275270","author":{"steamid":"76561198071928767","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1430,"last_played":1658958622},"language":"spanish","review":"¿Que tengo que decir? \nBueno, esta es la joya de valve, lo que empezo todo esto ¿sabes?

I knew that the original would be different, but I was still struck by surprise.  This isn't a bad thing; kinda like expecting something to taste delicious, and it [i] does [/i]--but in a different way than you expected.  Where playing HL2 felt like a cool, robust, rich and yet pleasantly mild drink of milk or the like, this original is like a super-carbonated beverage, constantly assaulting your senses with little bubbles and bursts of stimulation, maintaining a certain overall heat and intensity.  It's also got a pretty good deal of caffeine or sugar or something like that, because it is [b] HIGH-OCTANE [/b].  It's got the feel that instantly lets you know it's still somewhere among the ranks of those classic, balls-to-the-walls, pure-twitch-reflex heart-pumpers that pioneered the FPS genre: there are headcrabs (much faster and deadlier than their fat, sluggish regular counterparts from Half-Life 2) around [b] [i] EVERY [/i] [/b] corner, in every vent and crevice, behind and atop many boxes; WAVES of deadly alien creatures teleport/spawn in around most areas--if, that is, these areas haven't already been hard-claimed by incredibly aggressive (AI-wise; no waiting it out behind a door frame like the Combine) Marines cleaning up the evidence of the catastrophe using mounted .50-cal and rocket-launching turrets, laser-tripmines and laser-activated robo-turrets, oh, MY!!  Not quite as much time to stop and smell the atmosphere as the sequel, ladies and gentlemen!\n\nHowever, those happily familiar with Half-Life 2 can enjoy noticing a lot of the subtleties in this first game that point in the direction the second went: elements of immersive storytelling, atmosphere, background, answers to continuity nods you didn't even know were [i] there [/i] in Half-Life 2, and the evolution of the whole universe between the events of this and 2.  Inside jokes, origin stor(y/ies), and little things that would become elements of the next installment abound; Barney's beer-debt to Gordon, the strange speech of the G-Man, the original noises the vortigaunts made that helps the player put together [i] why [/i] they have that weird, hypnotic accent and cadence in the second game, and some illuminating facts that make their cryptic fortune-teller-ominous-type dialogue lines in HL2 a bit clearer.  There are some familiar monsters, like barnacles, headcrabs and zombies and vortigaunts, but [i] a bit [/i] different from those [b] you [/b], Half-Life 2-only newcomers to the series, have known.

You will die many times and will spend many hours playing this masterpiece. Sometimes you need stealth. Sometimes you need to run. Fast. Really fast. Sometimes you need to go very slowly. Sometimes going in guns blazing is the right move. Sometimes you need to pick off your enemies one at a time. Sometimes you need to figure things out and solve problems.

futuristic/alien), big variety of enemies/bosses and levels (even for today's standards), a bit of mystery/horror and an engaging story, left open for a sequel.\n\nAfter all those years and despite having been outdated by many modern games, it still holds up well today, you can see what made it great at the time!\n\nThe game's \"man with a gun\" (or crowbar), the scientist Gordon Freeman, also became quite an iconic protagonist, boosting the belief that \"nerds can be cool too\"!\n\nSome influences seem to have been taken from Wolfenstein 3D/Original Doom, though in their turn the latter games's sequels seem to have taken influences from Half-Life, showing how important all those games were for the FPS genre.\nThe whole \"protagonist in a robotic suit, fighting a variety of aliens and marines\" plot, makes me think that Halo probably also got some influences from here.\n\nThe addition of the G-Man as an antagonist, who watches your progress as you march further and further in the game and only those who pay attention will notice, was also great!\n\nFinally, if I had to name just a minor flaw that would be that I didn't find the music addictive enough, it seemed almost non-existent to me (Return to Castle Wolfenstein for example had a great soundtrack and totally immersed you in the game), but don't let this small factor drive you away from this gem of a game, you

Revolutionized the FPS genre and how it handles story telling. Is it still worth playing? Fuck yes it is. The guns are loud, powerful and satisfying, the enemies are fun to fight, have decent AI and look really cool, the story is somewhat minimal but handled in a way that communicates sufficient information to the player and simultaneously doesn't interrupt the gameplay too much which lets the game keep a very fast pace and has a slight air of mysterious freakiness about it, and the level design is solid aside from some first-person platforming and most of Xen. Might be worth waiting for Black Mesa to be finished, but Half-Life 1 is still a pretty fun, excellently designed and tight game on it's own.","timestamp_created":1421992919,"timestamp_updated":1421993054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521542012691497803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14120885","author":{"steamid":"76561198171193973","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1605,"last_played":1449678186},"language":"italian","review":"SURRENDER FREEMEN","timestamp_created":1421984065,"timestamp_updated":1421984065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14112868","author":{"steamid":"76561198003008491","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":58406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57118,"last_played":1616759622},"language":"spanish","review":"Me encanta este juego.
