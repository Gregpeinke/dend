Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact.\nThe gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well.\nOne of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay.\nCo-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player.\nI highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter. \nOverall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n[quote=author] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198319818104/] 🐾Wʜιтє Kιтѕυиє☆ ([/url] [/quote]","timestamp_created":1486278961,"timestamp_updated":1486279519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29711866","author":{"steamid":"76561198205539268","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2597,"last_played":1653231242},"language":"koreana","review":"값어치한다. 최고","timestamp_created":1486278149,"timestamp_updated":1486278149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29711101","author":{"steamid":"76561198223080760","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1035,"last_played":1521380832},"language":"english","review":"Just Finished Portal 2, Best game i have EVER played. no joke. i highly recommend getting this game!","timestamp_created":1486274565,"timestamp_updated":1486274565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29710838","author":{"steamid":"76561198096599185","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1539348817},"language":"schinese","review":"TM游戏还能炫技！你敢信！","timestamp_created":1486273365,"timestamp_updated":1486273365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29710833","author":{"steamid":"76561198325896850","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1606,"last_played":1551516124},"language":"english","review":"best game i have ever played!!!","timestamp_created":1486273345,"timestamp_updated":1486273345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29710831","author":{"steamid":"76561198207983339","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":731,"last_played":1562931489},"language":"schinese","review":"意犹未尽","timestamp_created":1486273344,"timestamp_updated":1486273344,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29710118","author":{"steamid":"76561198284210836","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":867,"last_played":1645918415},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 is a MASSIVE upgrade from the original Portal. If you just [spoiler] tore GLaDOS to pieces [/spoiler] in the original and got your mom to buy you the sequel, it's not just an expansion pack with a new story as you will see. There's new elements to puzzles [spoiler] (lasers, bridges you can control with portals, ruins you have to get through, etc.) [/spoiler] In Portal 1 you are in a room with a ceiling and walls for the whole game. Never do you get to see the outside (to an extent), move around without being guided by walls etc, or have any idea where you are besides inside a testing chamber or whatever. The graphics in the sequel are AMAZING, almost too much to take in after playing the original, which looking back is pretty lame compared to this. I have not beaten the game in full, I am currently on the 6th chapter going through Cave Johnson's tests. That's another thing. What is this \"Aperture Science\" nonsense, who owns it? The original game may even have you believe it's [spoiler] a massive deception created by GLaDOS [/spoiler]. Now we get to listen to Cave Johnson and through his advertisements get an idea of what's going on. Unless that's a huge lie, not sure hahaha. Wheatly is an awesome character and addition to the game [spoiler] but you're gonna get pissed off at him when you find out what he really thinks of you [/spoiler]. At the beginning of the game you actually get to see the ruins of GLaDOS [spoiler] after you destroyed him in the first game. [/spoiler] You can tell it's the same room from [spoiler] the nostalgic staircase and the incinerator [/spoiler]. As for the negatives, the loading screen. It's too long and you get it each and every time you die. But that's really it. The first game is a lot more cryptic and I find this one a bit less stressful to play. I highly recommend this game to anyone but ONLY after playing the first game or you'll be confused by the first chapter.\n\nEdit: I have just beaten the game. The final boss is AWESOME. So many times did I expect to have to fight another boss, but nope. Game just ended. The final song is good too. Almost unbelivable this would happen. Not only that, the boss itself is the absoulute best. It's like [spoiler] the Portal 1 boss in complete reverse. [/spoiler] You should know what I mean if [spoiler] you've fought that boss. Then again don't think of it too deeply, it's still Portal and still follows the overall gameplay concept.... But anyway, [/spoiler] 10/10.

anyone.","timestamp_created":1486270045,"timestamp_updated":1486587116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29709929","author":{"steamid":"76561198124186464","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":361,"last_played":1541217551},"language":"schinese","review":"和好基友买了个20的优惠包，一起玩了一段时间，很好玩啊。期待3，4个人一起玩的时候。","timestamp_created":1486269229,"timestamp_updated":1486269229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29708765","author":{"steamid":"76561198206369212","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1129,"last_played":1436306744},"language":"english","review":"Amazing,

You can at times, forget that you're playing a puzzle game as you work your way through each dynamic section.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are far more involved, theres many new ways to approach levels including: propulsion gel, lazers and so many more. This game starts with a very short tutorial so I'd recommended that you start with Portal 1 first as the learning curve could be difficult. In this game portals take a back seat to the new mechanics at work. Every solution is clever but the tests themselves always seem fair and understandable. \n\nIf there is a fault, it is only that so many new concepts are explored that you it's possible to forget to use portals in their normal way and could overthink sections.\n\nThe story, characters, soundtrack, and atmosphere are all wonderful. Every element of the game is compelling until the very end. To say more is to spoil the suprise. Play this game and its prequel now.
