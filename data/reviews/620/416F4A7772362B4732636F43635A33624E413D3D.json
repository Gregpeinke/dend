I loved the first Portal and have repeatedly played it over the years I've owned it. Portal 2 stepped things up about 10 notches. Not only are the puzzles challanging and the co-op mode a blast but it's legitimately funny. Glados no longer tries to hide or ignore her emotions and so the character development and interactions are by far my favorite aspect of this game. She's such a snarky little bitch and I love her so. It's subtle and you have to look closely for it, but you also learn how Chell ended up a test subject in this game, too, which is nice to know. \n\nMy favorite part, without a doubt, is getting to traverse the lower sections of Apeture and learning about/listening to Cave Johnson. Again, that stuff is so freaking funny and twisted. I highly recommend playing the first game before this one due to how good they both are and so you get all the references but if you haven't played it that's okay as the game does a great job explaining things so you won't end up lost.","timestamp_created":1420520288,"timestamp_updated":1420520288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13859143","author":{"steamid":"76561198041925011","num_games_owned":356,"num_reviews":58,"playtime_forever":310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1609748918},"language":"english","review":"Brilliant.","timestamp_created":1420517316,"timestamp_updated":1420517316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13859016","author":{"steamid":"76561198107208973","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1858,"last_played":1606652255},"language":"russian","review":"игра так затягивает сюжетом что после 1 годнего перерыва когда я сыграл слёзы потекли от настольгии при виде концовки\n","timestamp_created":1420516280,"timestamp_updated":1420516280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13859008","author":{"steamid":"76561198047731535","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1064,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":598,"last_played":1621457548},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game! a great way to test your brain :)","timestamp_created":1420516256,"timestamp_updated":1420516256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13858636","author":{"steamid":"76561198089517247","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":654,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":501,"last_played":1534122019},"language":"spanish","review":"Simplemente el mejor juego que he comprado y jugado.
