I understand how revolutionary HL1 was for the FPS genre and I really respect it for that. But the game is really showing its age imo. I was really into HL1 when I first started it and played through the first few chapters (especially when you first got the HEV suit and that catchy theme started to play) but once I reached about close to mid way in, I just couldn't play it anymore.\n\nAside from the large and confusing environments (that barely give you any indication on where to go), the terrible platforming (I can't tell you how many times I died by falling off of a ladder because Gordon just wouldn't cling to it properly from a jump), that dreadful section with the green 3 tentacle monster (this part can burn in hell, the sneaking mechanics didn't even work properly), the terrible enemy placement (There's literally a section where you're going up on a lift and 3 soldiers begin to immediately shoot at you without warning, and you can't even properly take cover during this section. This was pretty much it for me.),and just the extreme difficulty in general (I was playing on normal and would get destroyed in most fights, and the fights I would survive I would be low on health. And I felt like the soldiers were just too op. Not only would they always be super alert to you to the point where you'll literally come around a corner and they'll fire at you instantly, but they would also hit you with perfect aim 90% of the time too. Hell, they can even one hit kill you with a grenade. They would also usually charge at you too and rush you. At that point, you would just have to pray and hope you'll kill them before they kill you.).\n\nSo yeah, I just couldn't get behind HL1.

It isn't as good as people say, but its still amazing. Why I say it isn't as good people say is because there are a couple issues I have with the game, the issues I have with the game are the game doesn't do the best at directing you the direction you need to go to progress, and Xen, its not as fun as Black Mesa and the surface, but its still kinda fun. Other than those two things the game is amazing and you won't regret purchasing it.","timestamp_created":1611103708,"timestamp_updated":1611103708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85004236","author":{"steamid":"76561198123679661","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":759,"last_played":1611100915},"language":"english","review":"Yore Dead Freeman","timestamp_created":1611101018,"timestamp_updated":1611101018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85001545","author":{"steamid":"76561198169810410","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2439,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2439,"last_played":1611096690},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo tem problemas recorrentes com a inteligência artificial dos inimigos. \n\n","timestamp_created":1611096649,"timestamp_updated":1611096649,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84998631","author":{"steamid":"76561199045535682","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2389,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":318,"last_played":1635619060},"language":"norwegian","review":"Me got hooked.
