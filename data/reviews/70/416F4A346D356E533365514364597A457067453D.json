Half-Life is one of those games that you either played before it became so popular among the community or 10 to 20 years after it came out. One which you kill hordes of aliens with your crowbar and vast arsenal that you can somehow carry inside of a not so spacious H.E.V suit, climb ladders backwards with no hands and still shoot a fully automatic weapon, and somehow have a PhD in \"Theoretical Physics\" which grants you knowledge of every gun in existance, even those of alien origin.\n\nPROS:\n\n➤ It's a classic, you're almost obligated to play it.\n➤ Very creative and original concept and story.\n➤ Insane amount of mods and games adapted from original engine.\n\nCONS:\n\n➤ The game has not aged well if you compare it to todays graphics.\n➤ Can get repetitive if you are playing for the first time.\n➤ Controls are a bit different from what most games have today.\n\nIn conclusion I rate Half-Life a solid 8/10 (2018 standards). On a side note, if the graphics are too old for you then the \"Black Mesa\" mod is avalible for free download or the \"Black Mesa\" game is avalible on the Steam store for $15 at the time of this review.","timestamp_created":1532401200,"timestamp_updated":1532402063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43707737","author":{"steamid":"76561198096883396","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":2121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":666,"last_played":1660482319},"language":"english","review":"greatest valve game :)","timestamp_created":1532393190,"timestamp_updated":1532393190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576205134391784668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43707340","author":{"steamid":"76561198843098886","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":439,"last_played":1650063987},"language":"english","review":"Just buy the damn game already.

The combination of being a silent protagonist and a common man really helps with immersion. Since Gordon has no prior character, you are free to create one yourself. The story is basic (bad science leads to aliens and government tries to hide it) but well told. You and the fellow scientists are pretty much in the dark about outside events for most of the game, creating a sense of chaos since no one knows whats going on. You can make out some of the miltary's struggles through radio messages. [spolier] Eventually, you meet a strange man who may hold all the answers. [/spoiler]\n\n[b] Environments: 4/5 [/b]\nDespite the graphics clearly showing their age, the different parts of Black Mesa are still well designed. Each section has a different \"theme\" to it and are fun to explore as you progress. Xen succeeds in feeling very alien and outlandish, creating a sense of unese in the last levels. \n\n[b] Gameplay: 5/5 [/b]\nBasic FPS style of play with added puzzles. Don't take this wrong, the game was very fun to play. One of my favorite things of the Half-Life series is that every kill felt satisfying. Mix that with challenging and diverse enemies, and you got a great shooter. The puzzles were well designed, subtly blending into the surrounding environment and allowing you to see other parts of the facilities. \n\n[b] Enemies: 5/5 [/b]\nThere are two groups of enemies: The Xen aliens and the US military. There is little variation in the soldiers, but they can use heavy weaponry like machine guns and helicopters. They're are also intelligent, being able to coordinate and work to outsmart you, making them a tough opponent. The Xen aliens are more diverse, ranging from the iconic headcrabs to the bulletproof Gargantuas. These variations require you to use different tactics to deal with each different type of alien. \n\n[b] Weapons: 4/5 [/b]\nYou start with a crowbar and finish with the firepower of an Army Battalion. While each weapon is unique and fun to use, there were so many available that I had trouble using all them, and thus relied mostly on the basic SMG and shotgun. They were effective against the basic enemies encountered in most levels. Still, the stonger science and alien weapons were nessecary to deal with the stronger foes in Xen, so they had their type to shine.\n\n[b] Overall: 5/5 [/b]\nThere is a reason this game is classic. Dated graphics do little to subtract from the great gameplay, environments, and story.\nI highly recommend.","timestamp_created":1532311991,"timestamp_updated":1532311991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43690706","author":{"steamid":"76561198026250030","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":1104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1104,"last_played":1499718315},"language":"english","review":"The one shooting game that you must start with, or at least play once.
