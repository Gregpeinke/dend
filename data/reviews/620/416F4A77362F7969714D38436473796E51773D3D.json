I now have a slight aversion to Aperture Laboratories.\n\n--\n\nThis game is great as a game, and as a tech demo to show what can be  done with Valve's source engine.  The puzzles -as always, provide a challenge, and of course, the best thing about this game is Cave Johnson.\n\nThe Perpetual Testing Initiative also offers new challenges not made by the developers -but by us, the community.  However, the architecture can get a little repetitive unless you play the top rated maps which offer more intricate environments.  The PTI tests are tough, but don't require knowledge of exploits.\n\nThere is one drawback to this game, and its the story.  If you look past Wheatley, GLaDOS's witty remarks, and Cave Johnson's inspiring quotes, the story is actually very depressing.  If you are trying to avoid depression, then try not to play the story too much.\n\nOtherwise, this is a great game, and for the best results, grab a friend to take with you into co-op.  You'll have plenty of fun with portals and gels and lasers, pretty much everything.  Except the companion cube, though.  That guy's a dick.","timestamp_created":1440529289,"timestamp_updated":1440529289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17712683","author":{"steamid":"76561198048952955","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":2581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2445,"last_played":1500469129},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 is one of the best co-op games ever made to date, If enjoy puzzle games then this is for you\n","timestamp_created":1440526175,"timestamp_updated":1440526175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17712426","author":{"steamid":"76561198127981964","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":855,"last_played":1520483540},"language":"french","review":"good","timestamp_created":1440525085,"timestamp_updated":1440525085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17710043","author":{"steamid":"76561198124112797","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":774,"last_played":1630667255},"language":"english","review":"OMG,OMG,OMG!!!!!!!!\n\nTHIS GAME IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!!\n\nIF U PUZZEL GET THIS!\n\nIF U LAGH GET THIS\n\nIF U WANT TO FACE-PALM GET, THIS, GAAAAMMMMMEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nOH! and When life gives you lemons, don’t make lemonade.

That's Portal 2.\n \n Portal 2 is the perfect sequel to the original. It uses the same basic elements and gameplay, but adds so much more. New elements like gels, lasers, the excursion Funnel, the Hard Light Bridge and even the Edgeless Safety Cube (among many others), contribute to a fresh and new atmosphere that will never seem a simply copy from the original.\n\n In the solo campaign you play again as Chell, but it's not more of the same. Besides an interesting and brilliant history packed with a magnificent voice acting and challenging puzzles with unique gameplays, the writing of this game is absolutely amazing. The monologues of glados and wheatley and their jokes create a immersive and a really special atmosphere where you feel like the protagonist (despite you being a mute dangerous lunatic)\n\n Besides that, the game brings a extremely well executed multiplayer co-op that grabs everything that is perfect in the solo campaign and adds the perfect element: a friend. The Perpetual Testing Initiative will make you spend hours playing maps from other people or making your own puzzle.\n\nI'll recommend Portal 2 to any creature. If you want to have fun and play an excellent game, BUY IT. One of the best games ever and maybe the best Valve game.\n\n10/10 - Just play it now!","timestamp_created":1440411268,"timestamp_updated":1440412019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17689629","author":{"steamid":"76561198072043123","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":154,"last_played":1607698973},"language":"english","review":"Best Puzzle game ever with a beautiful campain and coop","timestamp_created":1440402118,"timestamp_updated":1440402118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17688360","author":{"steamid":"76561198144099562","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":805,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":601,"last_played":1445003822},"language":"russian","review":"Замечательное продолжение великой игры Portal!\nВсем рекомендую!

Portal was fun, challenging, and had an amazing atmosphere, but for those like myself who found its extremely short if remarkably well-paced two-hour playtime to be somewhat disappointing, Portal 2 is my preferred out of the two.\n\nThe environments and detail make a triumphant return, along with a handful of the old test chambers early on. The atmosphere is a touch less claustrophobic and thus less personal as in Portal, but uses that extra breathing room to open up the setting. The facility feels more alive this time around, an impression only enhanced by getting to see so much more of it.\n\nThe addition of Wheatley adds variety and drive to the gameplay and story respectively. He plays off of GLaDOS nicely and has his own unique charm that I found quite endearing, even if I can't speak for his universal appeal. Cave Johnson's story arc contributes only more to the game, again adding his own flavor to the tests and environments.\n\nLike Portal, the boss fight will provide a sense of closure to the story, but won't be the hardest puzzle in the game by a long shot. It is more complex than Portal's boss fight and can be quite creative at times, but could've been a lot stronger. As far as the test chambers themselves are concerned, the addition of co-op was a great idea provided you can find a friend, and community-made test chambers are where all the amazing innovative ideas still unexplored by the game proper are hiding.\n\nAt cost of Portal's extremely personal feel, Portal 2 expands on the world of Aperture Sciences, providing depth formerly missing, and keeping things interesting with other characters to vary up the gameplay.","timestamp_created":1440223089,"timestamp_updated":1440223089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505300343036651611","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17655428","author":{"steamid":"76561197986619838","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":111,"last_played":1440438441},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I have played.","timestamp_created":1440219266,"timestamp_updated":1440219266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17655144","author":{"steamid":"76561197966520442","num_games_owned":352,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":2074,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2060,"last_played":1646504339},"language":"english","review":"What can I possibly say that hasn't already been said?
