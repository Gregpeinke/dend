Ich brauchte rund 8 Stunden. Die Rätsel hier sind ebenfalls anspruchsvoller. Diesmal wird nicht nur Logik oder auch etwas Physik gefragt ^^\n\nSehr empfehlenswert ist auf jeden Fall der Coop-Modus! Entweder Splitscreen oder LAN / Online.\n\nZur Story kann ich sagen, dass man in einer Forschungseinrichtung erwacht, und versucht zu entkommen, indem man verschiedene Logikrätsel löst, durch die einen eine nette Computerstimme begleitet. \n\nMir gefällt besonders, dass hier mittig des Spiels die Geschichte hinter Aperture Science (also der Forschungseinrichtung) geschildert wird. Wann es entstand und wie es sich entwickelte. Aufmerksames zuhören steigert definitiv den Witz! Darauf folgte dann Portal Teil 1.

As much fun as it is to solve the puzzles, it's the storyline and the characters that excelled most in this game, however simple it may seem!\n\nPros:\n- Very entertaining puzzling gameplay\n- Witty, funny and great voice acting\n- This storyline and plot, wow\n- Has hilarious warning signs\n- Has a talking potato\n- WHEATLEY\n- Has more pros that I cant name without spoiling anything :D\n- Had a surprise for me at the end :3\n\nCons:\n- WHY ISNT THERE MORE OF THIS\n- Too difficult to think of serious downsides\n\nSo, did you enjoy Portal? You HAVE to play Portal 2.\nDid you not? REGARDLESS, you HAVE to play Portal 2. \nSome chapter names and voicelines by themselves are worth the entire playthrough already.\nRating: 10/10","timestamp_created":1422175138,"timestamp_updated":1422175138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524174332618713379","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14157887","author":{"steamid":"76561198139271885","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":799,"last_played":1477409296},"language":"tchinese","review":"就算我沒有玩過1代，但依然深陷其中無法自拔\n不管是劇情還是解謎系統我都很喜歡\n如果有人問起Steam第一款值得入手的遊戲是甚麼，我會說你買portal系列就對了","timestamp_created":1422173999,"timestamp_updated":1422173999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14157516","author":{"steamid":"76561198169444597","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3069,"last_played":1563557789},"language":"spanish","review":"Increible juego, probablemente mi favorito.\nMe encanto la historia; esta llena de misterio, suspenso y comedia,  las graficas no estan nada mal, ademas de que el juego es un reto.
