You will mainly be blasting soldiers, zombies, and a variety of alien-like creatures. You also get to do a fair bit of puzzle solving, exploring, and a few vehicle based driving missions.\n+ Mysterious yet deep sci-fi rich story. Basically, the Combine (An alien-race) have taken over Earth and essentially enslaved the population. You Morgan Freeman are basically the savior, and lead the rebellion for freedom. (Although trust me, there's a lot more to it)\n+ Very large open environments with a lot to explore.\n+ Variety of unique weapons with many that have an alternate fire ability. More importantly the \"Gravity Gun\" which you can use to pick up and launch objects at enemies is just so much fun!\n+ The Physics and Physics-Based Puzzles were fantastic, even for today's standards. The puzzles  just feel very satisfying and are not overly difficult to solve.\n+ Personally, the Airboat and Scout Car vehicle missions were a joy to play with a great sense of speed and freedom along with being very well thought out with some unique obstacles.\n+ Very challenging \"boss\" fights that come in many varieties. You take down helicopters, gunships, Antlion Guards, Striders, and so fourth that are all very exciting and thrilling.\n+ Ravenholm...a level with a dark eerie vibe infested with zombies. In my opinion, this level was amazing and probably inspired Left 4 Dead. This level was completely different from anything encountered before or after, and is truly a fantastic zombie-survival experience...with a comedic Russian companion to help you along. \n+ For a FPS, Half Life 2 has A LOT of content. According to some surveys, the main story takes about 10-14hours. It took me about 9 hours going through pretty quicky, but I was left feeling completely satisfied.\n+ Fantastic soundtrack with many atmospheric pieces that really help emerse the player into the game world. \n+ The controls felt great, making gunfights fun and skill-based.\n+ You get to control companions (including Antlion creatures) for a few missions which is quite enjoyable\n+ Although this game was made in 2004, I need to mention that the graphics still look good to this day.\n\n- I felt like some levels were overly drawn out or a bit too lengthy. Especially Nova Prospekt (The Prison). At some points it felt like I was just going through a very long maze filled with enemies. \n- The story is lacking in some aspects and can leave new players feeling a bit lost. For the majority of the game you are traveling alone for long periods and are told to go from place to place without a good explanation of what you are meant to be doing and why. Even at the end of the game, I couldn't help but wonder what was going on...\n\n~ Just a personal note, but I wish they included some sort of medium range rifle or burst-shot gun. You get pistols, shotgun, pistol, crossbow, and machine guns, but not much to precisely take out enemies from afar. I was also a bit curious as to why they did not give you a sniper rifle as the Combine are seen using them throughout the game.","timestamp_created":1475649238,"timestamp_updated":1475649420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.661788463592529297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25858686","author":{"steamid":"76561198042298885","num_games_owned":475,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":1217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1182,"last_played":1512087041},"language":"brazilian","review":"Sensacional este jogo.

It continues everything what original Half-Life started and does it perfectly. The mysterious and interesting world and characters are what makes this game so good.

2 is fantastic and one of my favourite games ever. Like hl1 it has a great atmosphere and setting full of so many little details. The game is always throwing something unique at you with its gameplay. Things like the gravity gun, the airboat sequence, the bug bait and the jeep. It raised the bar of how video game stories are told and remind us that games are also an experience. The sense of immersion in this game is outstanding with its presentation and characters. It's action packed, scary and tense.\n\nIterms of story like hl1 is told in more subtle fashion which may bother some people but personally I love it. Some may find sections last too long (the air boat sequence) and newer players may be confused of what to do at points. \n\nLike hl1 it also allowed the creation of mods. One of the most popular being Garry's Mod. \n\nYou really don't need to play half-life 1 to understand this game (although I would recomend it anyway)\n\nIf you are gonna play this game for the first time, play it alone.

Lol.... HL2's game play was hardly innovate(physics != game play), and the world was surprisngly empty, and the story, almost non-existant... But the engine, the graphics, the art direction, the colors chosen, and the attention to detail in the textures(low res as they are) are all outstanding. \n\nThe art direction cannot be discounted in why this game was so successful. It's a pleasure look at the palette of colors before my eyes when playing HL2. The level of detail and realness of decay is uncanny. The artists poored their soul into it, and the engineers brought it to life. \n\nThe game design, story and level design are all souly(pun intended) lacking in HL2, or at best, do not mesh well together. While the game play is is pretty much the same as HL1, it doesn't work nearly as well in huge wide open level designs. HL1 worked well because the levels were tight and closed, which intensified the combat and mystery of trying to escape the labyrnith of black mesa. \n\nThe levels are far too big for how empty they feel. I feel like episode one(the sequel to HL2) really tightened up the level design, and is a much more fun experience, but that's for another review.\n\nSo HL2 has the huge, amazing levels, that feel like they span miles, but there' s just not enough objects, stories or well designed fights to make the game play feel warm....\n\nThe game play feels cold, but the surface of the game, is beyond beautiful.... \n\nAll that said, its' one of the most beautiful first person shooter games every created, and many people put their soul into it; it's a real treat to be able to do a play through uninterrupted. I do think HL2 lacks replayabilty, unlike other FPS, such as Doom, but I still recommend at least one play through for any true fan of FPS, or artists. \n\nI can't stress it enough, what HL2 does right, it does perfect, and those strands of perfection are so rare and special, this game needs to get a 9/10, even though, the game play is really a 5/10, ... , it's just those perfect parts of the game, do not miss out on them. \n\n9 out of 10.\n","timestamp_created":1475027421,"timestamp_updated":1475027421,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25733273","author":{"steamid":"76561198170492350","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1575598922},"language":"english","review":"Game of the century.","timestamp_created":1475025178,"timestamp_updated":1475025178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25731962","author":{"steamid":"76561198097357508","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":995,"last_played":1635231320},"language":"spanish","review":"Una experiencia, la experiencia, mi experiencia.","timestamp_created":1475016282,"timestamp_updated":1475016282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507389187812805176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25731251","author":{"steamid":"76561198120259308","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1081,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1077,"last_played":1512786060},"language":"italian","review":"Hai tempi dell'uscita di HL1 e HL2 non avevo il PC e di conseguenza non conoscevo in titolo per niente .
