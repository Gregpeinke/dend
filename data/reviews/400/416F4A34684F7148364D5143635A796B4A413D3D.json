It's fun to analyze a problem step-by-step, often in reverse order, with the confidence that eventually you'll overcome it.\nWhen trying to complete Antichamber, I was tempted to use guides for solving one or two of the problems, but not in Portal.

C'è poco da dire, questo gioco è probabilmente per buona parte (ma non del tutto come dicono alcuni) solo un esercizio di stile, ma lo fa molto bene. Non date retta a chi dice che duri 5 ore o che non abbia trama - la trama c'è eccome, basta rendersene conto. In generale se non si bada solo a sparare portali a destra e a manca ci si gode meglio il gioco (ed ecco che invece di 5 ne dura 10). Portal è un conglomerato di piccoli dettagli, che possono sfuggire ad una prima partita. Consigliata la modalità commento. Dalle illuminazioni alle musiche passando dai monologhi deliranti dell'unico altro personaggio attivo del gioco oltre la protagonista, senza dimenticare quanti forse sono passati prima di noi tra le stanze asettiche della Aperture, Portal è un gioco coinvolgente su tanti livelli. Portal 2 sarà ancora \"peggio\", da questo punto di vista...","timestamp_created":1395180816,"timestamp_updated":1395180816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9554697","author":{"steamid":"76561198121984585","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":432,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1585313282},"language":"english","review":"Great game!","timestamp_created":1395179242,"timestamp_updated":1395179242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9537555","author":{"steamid":"76561198112958362","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":22,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22,"last_played":1395106038},"language":"english","review":"Great game.

In the game, you play as Chell, a silent protagonist who navigates her way through Apeture Laboratories, a testing faucility for the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device (ASHPD), or Portal Gun.\n\n     The Portal Gun shoots two portals: an orange and blue one. If you go through one, you come out the other. You use these portals to solve puzzles, or test chambers. You are commentated on by GLADoS, a seemingly friendly A.I. You are promised cake and grief counseling at the end of the chambers by GLADoS, but as you make your way through the lonely test chambers,  you start to suspect that not only is there something wrong with GLADoS, but with Aperture Laboratories itself.\n\n     The game itself is brilliant, with difficult puzzles and intriguing plot, this game is all around wonderfull. My only complaint is that the game is too short. On your first playthrough, it will take you 2 hours max to complete the game. And that's being too generous. I understand that they had to make it short because the main game in the Orange Box was Half Life 2, but they could have added more puzzles. \n\n      Another interesting feature of the game if you're into video game backstory is the fact that this game fits into the Half Life universe. So if you like finding all the cute little easter eggs that connect the games together, go for it. However, Portal 2 has more crossovers to Half Life. \n\n     This is one of my favorite games of all time, and I will give this game a 9/10 for the shortness. If you haven't played Portal,  fork out the extra ten dollars, enjoy this exellent game, and remember that the cake is a lie.","timestamp_created":1395100447,"timestamp_updated":1395100447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9535100","author":{"steamid":"76561198050477479","num_games_owned":316,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":731,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1476585484},"language":"english","review":"\"Simple\" logic game with a lot of personality. I heard a lot about this game before finally deciding to purchase it (mostly I heard the very catchy song from the end credits that went viral a while ago), and I haven't regretted it. There is a story going on the background, but most of the game's focus is on the gameplay, which consists of several simple elements that have been put together to make progressively challenging puzzles. Many of these puzzles can be solved in multiple ways, and the challenges that are unlocked after beating the game, as well as the achievements, really add to its re-playability.","timestamp_created":1395087301,"timestamp_updated":1395087301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9511361","author":{"steamid":"76561198124649897","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":953,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1577580218},"language":"finnish","review":"loistava peli!!!","timestamp_created":1395061117,"timestamp_updated":1395061117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hOqH6MQCcZykJA=="}
