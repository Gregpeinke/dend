Talvez você pense que o jogo é ruim, pelo fato dele ser tãão antigo, BUT, ele é perfeito.\n\nUma coisa que chama atenção em Half Life, é o local em sí, pois se deram o trabalho de realmente fazer parecer que esta a jogar em um Laboratorio. Inclusive varios outros cientistas e guardas [spoiler](Aparentemente Iguais e-e)[/spoiler].\n\nSe você não é um jogador fluente em inglês, procure saber a historia do game primeiro, entender os personagens e tudo mais, por que sim, o jogo esta 100% em Inglês, o maximo que a Valve/Steam fez por você, é que se a sua steam (creio eu) estiver em português, sera traduzido apenas o nome dos Capitulos/Fases/Levels (Chame como queira) e tambem informações no final do game (\"Emprego Novo\" e-e).\n\nA trilha sonora do HL1 deve ser bem aprecisada. O jogo, a maior parte do tempo é totalmente silencioso em questão de musica, a unica coisa que você ouvira são os alienigenas, como o barulho de seus ataques e seus gemidos agonizantes de dor ao morrer HU3. As musicas surgem em partes importantes do jogo, e normalmente são umas musiquinhas eletronicas, acompanhada de altas batidas maneira ou derrepente algo mais \"NINJA\". Uma musica do game que eu curto demais é a \"Nuclear Mission Jam\".\n\nE voltando a questão do Silencio, ele não vai deixar seu jogo intediante, muito pelo contrario, ja que ele ira colaborar para os sustos do jogo (KABUM, EXPLOSÃO, ALIEN ATACANDO, SOLDADOS, AVIÕES)...\n\nBasicamente é isso, procure entender a historia do game, pesquise no youtube, tem uns videos explicando tudo certinho e tals. (caso não manje muito de inglês, ja que nem legenda tem) e ai é so comprar o jogo e se divertir meu amigo =D\n\nCaso achar algum erro na minha analise, porfavor comentar para que eu arrume =D","timestamp_created":1481153117,"timestamp_updated":1481221294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28238759","author":{"steamid":"76561198086224228","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1529691555},"language":"russian","review":"Чтож, прежде всего хочу сказать, что если вы стоите перед выбором: оригинальная или на движке Source, то без сомнений берите оригинальную, потому что:\n[olist]\n    [*]Частые баги с персонажами (Например тот же учёный в комнате наблюдения у тестовой камеры, который по-идее сидит на кресле, на самом деле висит в воздухе над ним)\n    [*]Проблемы с текстурами. К примеру на локации \"Поверхностное натяжение\", посмотрев на небо, вы в этом убедитесь.\n    [*]AI непонятным образом стали ещё тупее. Т.е ты можешь вплотную стоять перед вортигонтом, а он при этом вас даже не ударит. Вояки, которые так же могут вас прекрасно видеть но при этом ничего не делать. Или же любимые хэткрабы, которые будут вас атаковать только если вы подойдёте к ним на расстояние вытянутой монтировки.\n [*]Так же у вояк есть проблема с оружием. После их смерти, оно может зависнуть в воздухе (что в оригинале не наблюдалось)\n [*]Тут я уже не знаю, недостаток ли это, но переделанны текстуры некоторых оружий (явно использованные в Black Mesa), которые в сочетании с текстурами 98го года выглядят не очень. А так же текстуры персонажей. К примеру, на того же GMan'а смотреть было слегка непривычно и неприятно что-ли\n[/olist]\nВ качестве плюсов хочу всё таки отметить особенности вышеупомянутого движка, т.е это физика, шейдэры. Кстати, касаемо физики. Упавшие частицы, которые исчезают через пару секунд, никуда не делись.
