I was expecting more of the same but this time round, I was greeted by a far superior intro that included likable characters and narrative. I was immediately motivated by the game.\n\nA lot of Half Life 2 is similar in terms of game play such as shooting, puzzles, and environmental storytelling however there's also lots of new features such as vehicles and a heavy physics-based gameplay experience etc.\n\nSTEAM REVIEWS:\n\nAs always, before typing anything for a review I took a look at the games Steam forums and negative reviews to see what people are saying about this game that have the opposite opinion as myself i.e. \"would you recommend\". Since the game is old, the only reason I can think of why someone would be reading reviews on Steam for this title is to help them decide whether or not it'll be a good choice for them when they are sitting on the fence. So next I'll try and debunk the Steam review section.\n\n* It's \"outdated\" and \"gimmicky\" - The fact that Half-Life 2 is symbolic not only of the fact it's literally better than arguably anything else in the genre at the moment, but it managed to and continues to continually surprise and enthrall generations of players in new ways, it deserves recognition far more than a mere \"gimmick\" that's \"outdated\".\n\n* The rest of the \"most helpful\" negative reviews are nonsensical. I mean there's a guy going on about how the story doesn't make sense - I assume he's blind and deaf.\n\nThere's a bunch of comments about different things like shooting is \"just hip fire\" which is factually incorrect - all this shows to players in the know is that he didn't experiment at all... with anything.\n\nOVERALL THOUGHTS:\n\nEverything about Half Life 2 is bigger and better than Black Mesa (I can't compare to Half Life as I haven't played it). The music when playing during a set piece or action sequence is extremely memorable. That fact that there's so many environments in comparison to Black Mesa was a very welcome addition as too were the in-game cut scenes.\n\nAlyx Vance and her Dog = happy times.\n\nOTHER STUFF:\n\nAs stated above I've just recently completed Black Mesa, if it's helpful to you here's a link to the review I typed about that game:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198400190880/recommended/362890/","timestamp_created":1626753763,"timestamp_updated":1626754638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96053322","author":{"steamid":"76561198180923606","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1224,"last_played":1626910794},"language":"english","review":"gordon freeman has ruined my life","timestamp_created":1626752667,"timestamp_updated":1626752667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96051945","author":{"steamid":"76561199136962030","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":193,"last_played":1649478228},"language":"english","review":"better than cyberpunk 2077","timestamp_created":1626750420,"timestamp_updated":1626750420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96049916","author":{"steamid":"76561198226810488","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":340,"last_played":1626747047},"language":"english","review":"one of the greatest games of all time, pretty self explanatory, gone through it multiple times cause its a very re-playable game. if u haven't ever played it smh.","timestamp_created":1626747226,"timestamp_updated":1626747226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96049263","author":{"steamid":"76561198273202006","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1655609583},"language":"spanish","review":"juégalo pana, es una obra de arte!","timestamp_created":1626746180,"timestamp_updated":1626746180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96049228","author":{"steamid":"76561198832187771","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1659127604},"language":"english","review":"In spite not being awfully fond of fps games myself i found this thoroughly engaging for most of it, it does a ton right.

Amazing soundtrack and visual design make this game a banger even in the present year.","timestamp_created":1626667977,"timestamp_updated":1655887790,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95997894","author":{"steamid":"76561199039754644","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":522,"last_played":1626070025},"language":"latam","review":"muy good","timestamp_created":1626667104,"timestamp_updated":1626667104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95996432","author":{"steamid":"76561199190392002","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":873,"last_played":1653417350},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un juegazo 10 de 10, se lo recomendaria a cualquiera","timestamp_created":1626664636,"timestamp_updated":1626664636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95995907","author":{"steamid":"76561198274466854","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1429,"last_played":1626647551},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2 is an all time great. It takes the story of the original and bends over backwards to go into a completely new and fascinating direction. I also love the variety of weapons, each serving their purpose to get the player out of sticky situations. While I found the solution to some challenges to be a bit hard to find, Half Life 2 is a must play for any steam user!","timestamp_created":1626663670,"timestamp_updated":1626663670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95995743","author":{"steamid":"76561199055035811","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":619,"last_played":1626921152},"language":"english","review":"That Good stuff","timestamp_created":1626663371,"timestamp_updated":1626663371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95994361","author":{"steamid":"76561198131218507","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":392,"last_played":1596247240},"language":"english","review":"game gud","timestamp_created":1626661007,"timestamp_updated":1626661007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95990883","author":{"steamid":"76561199168479531","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":147,"playtime_forever":748,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":486,"last_played":1656790091},"language":"english","review":"Its half life 2 do i really need to say anything further for you?..","timestamp_created":1626655096,"timestamp_updated":1656787867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95990881","author":{"steamid":"76561199091051210","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":93,"playtime_at_review":5918,"last_played":1659586952},"language":"koreana","review":"FPS에 선구자답다","timestamp_created":1626655090,"timestamp_updated":1626655090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95990765","author":{"steamid":"76561198073802936","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":434,"last_played":1636778793},"language":"spanish","review":"es la mejor secuela de el mejor juego de todos los tiempos","timestamp_created":1626654900,"timestamp_updated":1626654900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8v+L3voCfb6W7gI="}
