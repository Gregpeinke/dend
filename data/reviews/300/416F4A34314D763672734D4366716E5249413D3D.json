Поначалу вы будете умирать...очень часто. Это не [b]CS[/b], в которой спокойно можно адаптироваться и понять устройство тамошнего боя за несколько каток. Дело в том, что [b]DoD[/b] выглядит скромнее других онлайновых шутеров, что придаёт ему обманчивый вид. В чём суть: противостояние между армией США и Вермахтом, у которых цель захватить и удержать 5 точек (по 2 на свою территорию и одну центральную, у которой постоянно происходят ожесточённые бои). Серверов с мапами много, но самые популярные и пользующиеся спросом - Anzio (по ком звонит колокол), Avalanche (скажи ауфидерзейн своим нацистским яйцам!), Donner (one love), Flash (Оверлорд), Kalt (на любителя). Выбираем сторону (с вероятностью 70 к 100 вы будете играть за нациков, ибо все хотят быть пиндосами-победителями), затем класс (6 специальных классов, со своим уникальным вооружением: M1 Garand (ты тоже её слышишь?) vs Mauser Kar98k; Thompson M1A1 (За Райана и Сашку!) vs MP-40; BAR (орудие тащеров) vs STG-44 (ты ах*нешь от её отдачи); Springfield M1 (они вечно заняты, но легенда гласит, что взяв её в руки ты сможешь прокачать свой скилл, а также заработать репутацию любимчика как у своих, так и ненависть других); 30 Cal Browning M1 - когда хочется почилить на одной точке в течение получаса, раздавая п*свинца выбегающим из-за угла пацанам. Работка ситуативная, можно час просто лежать за этой махиной и складировать боеприпасы, оставленные камерадами в знак доброй воли. Саморитянство во плоти.); M1 “Bazooka” (когда думаешь, что сможешь вытащить катку, а на деле получаешь пулю в лоб); Colt M1 (для настоящих мужчин) vs Walther P38 (немецкая шл*пукалка). \n\nИтак, как это было: бегаешь первое время (за немцев, ибо Wehrmacht vult) за разные стороны и тихонечко сходишь с ума от реализма и его смертей. Затем, после 1-го килла идёшь отмечать в бар. Спустя 10-ток часов начинаешь чувствовать связь с игрой и её происходящим. На 40-й тебе пишут [i]\"DEM is the best\"[/i], а олды в чат грят [i]\"Well done, kid\"[/i]. Начинается половое созревание. Потом, после продуктивного дня, заходишь поздно вечером на любимый и единственный dod_donner, забиваешь место у зелёных и на протяжении 2-3х часов непрерывно воюешь (без преувеличений). На миде один француз орёт на сквад, чтобы тот продвигался вперёд, два других мужика, между делом обсуждают семейную жизнь, попутно раздавая указания нашим и пи*люлей фашикам. Тактика перерастает в битву, битва перерастает в отчаянную резню, затем затишье...10 минут, 20...пока какой-нибудь партизан не решит пожертвовать собой и пробираясь через переулки, не начнёт захватывать вражеские точки. Исход, порой, может оказаться совсем неожиданным. Хорошая игра, которая сделает тебя мужчиной.

you look at the release date for this game July 12, 2010, you'll know it's not true. Released on Sept 26, 2005 this was a great alternative to CS:S. Which I played for many years before DOD:S. This game had something different to offer than other fps games at the time. You picked classes and also allowed you to respawn, which offered continuous gameplay.\n\nIn it's hay day this game was a blast, especially for competitive league players. However this game has lost it's magic and has died. I have played this game for many many years and have 2 accounts with a combined total of 2,763 hours, I have played in many different competitive leagues, on different teams and also had my own team at one point.\n\nOut of all the fps games I've ever played (since Wolfenstein 3D, 1992) this game I have always felt discriminated against for being legitimately good. Over 75 public server perma bans, hence the 2nd account.\nI am not trying to gloat or brag, this is a big issue for almost every league player. Unit and clan public server admins would pretty much just ban me without notice or call me hacker/cheater than perma ban me. I would even use my 2nd account with another name and had to actually hold myself back due to threat of being banned... I just always felt this saltyness from certain servers.\n\nI have in the past uninstalled this game, due to lack of server, player and league quality.\n\nIf you want to purchase an FPS game look elsewhere, this game is outdated and it's hard to find a good server to play on without mods.\n\nPlus the assault is overused and probably one the worst F$%KING weapons made by an actual human being and agreed upon to be released in a game.","timestamp_created":1389723878,"timestamp_updated":1389724144,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496836721897125244","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8702274","author":{"steamid":"76561197993761181","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":13825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":158,"playtime_at_review":6920,"last_played":1660508380},"language":"english","review":"After all these years this is still on of my all time favorite FPS.

I don't see the point of playing any other game than this one when I'm home and have some spare time. It has strategy, action, intensity... I've been playing it and previous versions for what, 10 years ?

Докручивается текстурами и моделями с dods.gamebanana.com до 5.\nЭта игра была первой, применившей метод \"подкрепления\" в течение раунда, поэтому не надо как в контре курить, пока раунд закончится. Небольшой таймаут - и в бой.\nКрайне популярный сеттинг Второй Мировой войны здесь почему-то не набивает оскомину. Тому свидетельство постояное кол-во игровых серверов, а также приток новых людей в игру, чему я сам свидетель. \nТакже существует мод, превращающий американскую армию в советскую. С обмундированием, озвучкой и оружием.\nТипы игры - контроль точек, подрыв объектов и их комбинация.\nКрайне неоднозначная стрельба добавляет интереса, порой рандом с автомата эффективнее прицельного выстрела из винтовки.\nГранаты можно подбирать и отбрасывать, пока они не взоравлись, что добавляет драйва.\n\nИгра подойдет как для релаксатора для мозга, так и для средства для запотевания ладоней и подмышек.","timestamp_created":1388852285,"timestamp_updated":1388852285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578836679458618164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8555166","author":{"steamid":"76561198041302357","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":388,"last_played":1472735646},"language":"english","review":"very good game.\nit is like tf2 in the secont world war\njust buy it if you want","timestamp_created":1388850077,"timestamp_updated":1388850077,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4632587730884552","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41Mv6rsMCfqnRIA=="}
