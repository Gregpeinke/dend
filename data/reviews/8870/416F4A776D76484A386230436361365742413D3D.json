Одна из немногих,  концовку которой и вообще смысловое наполнение обсуждают на Форбс и прочих нетематических сайтах. Кто-то даже находит ярко выраженный политический подтекст, заложенный Кеном Левином, прикрытый сатирой, но это все не важно потому, что игра отличная. Отдельно хочется отметить Элизабет (внешность которой подарила прекрасная Анна Молева), чей характер и роль в игре вызывают неподдельное восхищение. А самое главное, когда играешь нет чувства, что-то что работает не так, чего-то не хватает или есть лишнее - все на своем месте.

Despite some of its faults in gameplay, this game is rich with great characters and a world that breathes story.  A solid final entry into a fanatastic series.  The real selling point of this game is its story which is multifaceted and ties all the games in this series together.\n\nEdit: After having now finished this game again, I love this game even more. PersonallyI feel that Rapture is a more interesting setting for a game, but only just slightly more in comparison to Columbia. There's a lot of great stuff going on in this game. The characters are great, the gunplay feels like a welcome improvement over Bioshock 1 and 2, the plasmids (or vigors as they're called here) are also much improved, though I miss the Telepathy powers.\n\nEven better than the core game is the Burial At Sea DLCs. These let you revisit Rapture after (kinda?) the events of Infinite and provide some much needed closure to the series as a whole. Without saying too much, I think these DLCs are among the best moments of the Bioshock Infinite experience.\n\nI recommended this game years ago and I still very much do today.","timestamp_created":1365422007,"timestamp_updated":1482693489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1544878","author":{"steamid":"76561197994487630","num_games_owned":1004,"num_reviews":86,"playtime_forever":9055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7604,"last_played":1644820684},"language":"english","review":"Throughout the entire game, I wished Booker and Elizabeth would bang.\n[spoiler]But noooo - she has to be your daughter and sh*t.[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1365417444,"timestamp_updated":1558874532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494813323020935059","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3618405","author":{"steamid":"76561198025292777","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":3201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2070,"last_played":1404547829},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is the Half-Life 2 of this generation; a single-player FPS adventure that trades the claustrophobia and horror of the original for the larger-than-life dystopia and unpredictability of the sky.

Second game didn't quite follow in it's footsteps as a whole package. It was extremely fun but the expected narrative was much lacking comparing it to the original.  Rest assured, for this game not only does it meet the high expectations people have put on but it also far exceeds what in both gameplay and narrative compared to the original.\n\nA big design change was that the main character has a name and a voice. This was perhaps questionable prior to people playing the game, however after finishing the game it was the correct decision in retrospect. The game plays out much like the first two Bioshock games. you use guns and special powers which are called Vigors this time around. They are for gameplay purposes exactly the same as plasmids. Using a special resoarce called salts you can do all the various supernatural attacks and utilities that the game introduced in 2007. There are slight refinment to this. Each vigor has two uses and two unique upgrades. This combined with the rather large varitey of firearms and passive abilities called gear one has incredible amount of choice in approaching combat situations. Never throughout the game have I felt that I didn't have enough options in combat. Experiment, specialize and rejoice. If you love shooters like this you will be as a child in a candy store.\n\nThe upgrade system has been standardized. Your guns and vigors are upgraded via vendors using money. Health , salt and shield upgrades are done via item found in game, and passive ability gear items are found throughout the game. It's simple but also limited that you have to specialize somewhat. You surely won't be upgrading everything. For combat this is a great replaybility value.  Only small setback is that you can have two weapons with you at a time (vigors you have all on hand). This didn't deter me much from the game though.\n\nThen comes the narrative. This was a tall order to fill. Especially after how well Rapture with Andrew Ryan was done. You are thrown into a colorful city of Columbia with one purpose \"Bring us the girl and whipe away the debt\".Soon you will get caught in the struggle between the city founder the great prophet Comstock and the racially oppressed Vox Populi. For a large part of the game this felt a lot like war in Rapture between Ryan and Fontaine, except you participated and not just collected the bits from aftermath. In a word that was awesome. But more importantly this isn't necessary the focus of the story. Booker and Elizabeth are. The game makes you care about these characters, and their tale is one that people will remember many years from now. The voice acting, the atmosphere, recorded messages. They are all amazing. One thing this game succedes in is bringing out the small details. People's conversation on streets, posters, signs and adds. There is also a bit there Fortunate Son played and I felt extremely warm inside getting lost in this world. Rapture was breathtaking and one of the best places to explore but it doesn't compare how well Columbia is presented to the player.\n\nSo where does the overall story stands. It passes with flying colors (pun intended). I can say without a doubt that if you have an open mind for a complex and meaningful story this will be one of the greatest stories you have seen in a video game. I only expect  a narrative this good from books. I personally have not seen a finer game narrative since Legacy of Kain and Planescape Torment.\n\nOverall I recommend this game with zeal. Even if you aren't a player of FPS games, you should consider this one for the narrative and experience. Games like this make me feel really good that I play games, and it puts a more known benchmark for story driven games.","timestamp_created":1365388460,"timestamp_updated":1385420406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"697802","author":{"steamid":"76561197975836281","num_games_owned":2130,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":891,"last_played":1398918916},"language":"english","review":"A game worthy of the Bioshock name.

하는 사람이 있다면 미안하지만 슬롯도 겹친다. 아예 원거리 쪽으로 가거나 근접으로 가거나, 스카이라인 회피 기동으로 가는등의 빌드를 못하게 막아버렸다. 하다보면 능력치도 이도저도 아니게 된다. 탄약없으면 무기 딴거 줍거나 근접해야되고, 일일이 활력 돌려가면서 써야한다. \n\n이것뿐이면 모르겠는데, 이 장비들은 어디서 뭐가 나오는게 아니라 나올때마다 종류가 바뀐다. 그니까 랜덤드랍이다! 처음부터 제대로 나오면 게임이 쉬워지는데 개쓰레기 같은것만 나오면 그딴거 없다. 장비는 돈주고 사거나 하는것도 안되니 일일이 찾아내던가 아니면 대충 가까운 체크포인트에 저장하고 원하는게 나올때까지 껐다켜야 한다. 참으로 대-단한 시스템 변화가 아닐수 없다.\n\n다행히 사기템이 없지는 않다. 스카이라인이나 갈고리에 올라타면 50%확률로 무적되는게 있는데. 이거 얻은다음 그냥 실드찰때까지 스카이라인이나 훅 탔다가 내려오는거 반복하고 실드 사라지기 전에 다시 반복해서 채우면 절대 안죽는다. 낙하암살만 노려도 괜찮다. 여기다가 근접때리면 피해 더 받게 하는 장비 + 근접시 전기충격 주는 장비 끼면 사실상 템세팅 끝이다. 이러면 1999고 뭐고 그냥 깬다. \n\n\n게임 시스템이 이따위라서 그런지 여러가지를 반강제한다. 뒤져서 돈까이는게 싫으면 안죽으려고 은엄폐해야 하고, 낭비하면 안되므로 무기나 활력을 아무거나 업글하면 안되며, 소모품 자판기는 사치다. 무기를 2개밖에 못가지고 다니는데 돈이 없다면 강제로 다른 무기 주워써야되며, 조금이라도 오래 버티기 위해 강화약, 장비찾아 맵을 이잡듯이 뒤져야한다. 조금이라도 뒤떨어지는 장비는 절대 껴서는 안되고, 무조건 안뒤지는 빌드로 가야한다. \n존나 게임이 압박을 주는것 같다. \"뒤지기 싫어? 그럼 업글해\" 이렇게 말이다. \n\n레벨디자인이나 GPS도 마음에 마음에 안든다. 무조건 일직선인데 길이도 드럽게 길다. 당연히 2편처럼 뭐 못먹고 갔다. 근데 그게 존나 필요하다. 그러면 조때는거다. 게다가 특유의 거지같은 지도 시스템도 여전해서 길 잃어버리기도 쉬운데 지도 시스템은 또 없다.그냥 방향키 나와서 임무 따라가는게 끝이다. 다른거 말고 지도 시스템이나 고쳐야 하는데 그럴 생각은 전혀 없는 것 같다.\n\n부가설정도 전작에 비해 어설프다. 가량 전작에서 아담은 어떻고 플라스미드는 어떻고 빅대디 리틀 시스터는 어디서 어떻게 만들어지고 특이 사항은 어떻고 이런게 잘  나오는데 인피니트는 그런게 없다. 활력은 어느날 균열에서 뭐 봐서 그걸 보고 뿅 만들었으며, 콜롬비아는 대충 양자역할로 띄우고 어쩌고 하는것 이런게 끝이다. 만드는 과정이라던가, 해프닝이라던가 이런건 없고 그냥 \"균열을 보고 베꼈다.\"\"기술력이 우월해서 그냥 만들었습니다\" 이게 끝이다. 하도 정치, 윤리적인것만 넣다 보니 이런 배경설정이 적어져서 콜롬비아의 문화라던가, 과학, 기술력등 배경설정은 찾기 힘들고 추측해야한다. \n개인적으로 바이오쇼크에서 느끼는 큰 매력이었는데 이게 사라지니 게임에 대한 관심이 금방 식어버렸다.\n\n마지막으로 스토리에 대해 말하면, 일단 시작은 괜찮고 진행도 나쁘지 않은데 어려운 설정이 너무 많다. 새장과 새는 뭐고  평행우주가 어떻고 마지막 엔딩은 어떻게 된거고 설명을 한참을 읽고나서야 알았다. 게임 내적으로는설명해주는 게 없기 때문에 외부정보 없이 게임만 했다면 검색사이트에서 인터넷에서 정보글 뒤적대야 한다. 게임내의 글은 게임내에서만 끝냈으면 하는데 이게임은 그렇지 못하게 만들었다.  대체 왜? 쉽게 이해하게 만드는게 접근성을 낮춰주는거 아닌가? 전작은 그래서 오히려 더 좋았는데 이번작은 그걸 깎아먹었다.심오하게 만들려고 했을지 모르나 같은데 오히려 실패한 부분이라고 본다.\n\n루테스 남매인가 하는것도 거지같다. 켄 레빈과 이레이셔널 게임즈는 대충 전지전능 역할을 하는 사람을 넣고 싶어했었나 본데 자꾸 이 년놈이 개입해야만 스토리가 진행되서 몰입감이 떨어진다. 처음엔 잘 안느껴졌는데 다시 해보니 이 두년놈이 게임진행에 주는 영향이 너무 크다는 것이었다.이 두년놈 때문에 부커 드윗이 콜롬비아에 오고, 범죄좌 된데다, 쓸데없는 차원이동에,  복스까지 적으로 돌렸고 \"진실 알고 싶지?\"하고 엘리자베스에게 떡밥 투척했다가 괜히 컴스탁에게 어그로가 제대로 끌려 결국 부커 드윗은 익사했다. 2회차를 하면 중간중간에 파리로 가자고 하는 부커 드윗이 참으로 애처로워 보인다. 이 두년놈의 목적을 보고 행동을 보면 병신같다고 느껴지는데, 뭐 균열을 여는 그런 위험인물을 자기들이 함부로 만든게 죄니해서 결국 알아서 사라지게 만드는 것이다. 이 두년놈이 조금만 흥미가 없었어도 엘리자베스가 파리로 가서 조용히 살았을수도 있었고, 컴스탁이 지상침공한다고 지랄날 일이 없었으며, 괜히 불행남 하나 인생 작살나지도 않았다. \n\n근데 이 두명때문에 엔딩꼴이 났는데 이걸로 켄 레빈이 대체 뭘 말하고 싶은것 이었는지 의문이 든다는 것이다. 니가 아무리 지랄을 해도 결국 능력자에게는 안됨? 세상에는 절대 피할수 없는게 있고, 넌 그걸 무조건 받아들여야 한다? 게임 중간에 할 수있는 엘리자베스가 할 수 있는 선택 없을까 운운하는걸 보면 둘 다 인지도 모르겠다. \n\n차라리 전작마냥 선택지가 있어서, 두년놈의 말을 씹으면 최종보스로  얘네들이 나오는것도 차라리 괜찮았을거라는 생각이 든다. 마지막으로 자기들이 싸지른 배설물을 치우려고 엘리자베스와 부커드윗을 쳐죽이려함 -> 능력각성한 엘리자베스에게 털리고 영구봉인. -> 그러나 능력을 너무 많이 써서 부작용으로 엘라자베스가 균열 영원히 못쓰게 됨 -> 두명은 파리에서 일반인으로 살아감 \n[결론 :  결정된 운명처럼 보이지만  그렇지 않다.]라는 식으로 말이다.\n\n전작 둘은 굿엔딩이 상당히 희망찬 결말이었는데 본편과 dlc를 보면 더욱 암울해진다.\n\n위에서 겁나 주저리주저리게 적었는데, 전작들을 너무 인상깊게 플레이 하느라 개인적인 감정이 포함된게 많고\n바이오쇼크 타이틀을 달고 나와서라서 불만이 있는거지 그 외에는 딱히 없다. 그래서 추천을 한다.\n아마 이 작품으로 바이오쇼크를 접했다면 감상이 달라졌을지도 모르고 불만도 적었겠지만 현실은 그렇지 못한게 아쉽다.\n\n맨 위에 적었듯이 다른 시스템상의 문제는 없고, 게임이 진부하거나 하는것도 없다.\n본인처럼 전작에 너무 감동먹은 사람이 아니라면 충분히 해볼만한 가치가 있는 게임이다.\n\n\n물론 전작에 미친사람이라면....굿럭- 잘해봐라.","timestamp_created":1365382590,"timestamp_updated":1493229707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6539962","author":{"steamid":"76561198068537367","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":386,"last_played":1382004103},"language":"english","review":"Great game!!","timestamp_created":1365380399,"timestamp_updated":1365380399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2560052","author":{"steamid":"76561198009309257","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1364454000},"language":"english","review":"INFINITELY SHOCKING!","timestamp_created":1365378953,"timestamp_updated":1365378953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1987606","author":{"steamid":"76561198000640025","num_games_owned":1862,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":1355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1037,"last_played":1394222414},"language":"english","review":"It's a really good game, the ratings are so high on it, Myself wouldent of given it best game of all time, They story was really good but too linear, not really enough side quests / exploration from the hype was expecting much much better.

Now a private detective and previously a decorated war hero who is left scarred both inside and out from the battles he's fought. You turn to alcohol and gambling to ease your conscience. Eventually your debts mount up and you are approached by a mysterious man with a proposition. Pick up your weapons once again and save a girl being held by unknown forces in the modern marvel, the flying city of Columbia.\n\nAnyone who knows me knows that FPS is my all time favorite genre, And right now in the middle of my second play through (1999) I can say that despite some small flaws, this is one of the best games I have played in a long time. It's not a 'pure' FPS, but that's okay. I would recommended not playing on anything less than 'Hard' as I have spoken with people and read that 'Normal' can be a little easy.\n\nFirst off, adjustable FOV (110), many custom options for graphics, supports downsampling and looks incredible when done. It's possibly visually the most satisfying game I have ever played. The detail on the textures is just great. The NPC's look like actual people and not porcelain lady dolls. Oddly there is no quick save feature.\n\nIt's obvious that this isn't your average cash cow franchise game. This isn't a game you'll see in the bargain bin 3 months from now. It's clear the game was the planned out deeply. The art, the story, the characters, the city. the voice acting. All are executed amazingly. And combine for a truly first rate experience.\n\nI believed this world. I felt part of it. I was fascinated by it. Obviosusly there are scripted events but they don't take you too much out of your immersion. Most of the scripted events are generated by your lovely companion Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth. Wow. As far as AI companions go. She's got to be the best. \nI'd put her ahead of Half Life's benchmark Alyx Vance. Elizabeth is the original Disney Princess. Pretty, smart, innocent, happy but with a troubled past. Locked in a tower inside Columbia, she has never known the outside world. You can't help but feel connected to her as you adventure and shoot out side by side as you try to get her out of Columbia and back to your employers in New York.\n\nElizabeth can pick locks for the player and will sometimes give you extra ammo for your guns and special abilities. This is sometimes a little conceited but ultimately pretty helpful. Not that ammo is hard to find in this game. If anything,  I would have liked an option to talk to Elizabeth even more. Your interactions with her are largely very satisfying.\n\nThe combat system isn't perfect but it's by no means the worst either. You, Booker, use a mixture of conventional weapons and also in true Bioshock fashion special attacks. In Infinite the special attacks aren't Plasmids but instead Tonics.\n\nBasically the exact same as Plasmids, but instead of getting an explanation on how these Vigors work like in Bioshock 1 - getting your genetic code rewritten etc, in Infinite they are basically explained as some kind of miracle water that grants powers. Do they only work in Columbia? Do they wear off after a few days? or do they rewrite your genetic code like in Rapture. Who knows? I would have liked this explained to be honest.\n\nBut my complaints are small and mostly superficial, scratches on an otherwise outstanding and enjoyable game.\n\nThe subtext of the game for anyone with half a brain cell is obviously the abuse of Religion and it's use as a method of mass control and a tool for justification of certain acts. Zealotry, racism and segregation are all touched upon too. It's nice to see these adult topics being included in a game to be honest. A nice move from the developers.\n\nThere is so, so  much more I want to tell you about, I've been very careful to not drop any serious spoilers in my review. The Songbird was incredible, the Vox were enjoyable, the Skyline, the Handymen, the ending is just amazing and so much more.\n\nThe reality is, you need this game in your reality!","timestamp_created":1365371802,"timestamp_updated":1587844459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1672522","author":{"steamid":"76561197996227617","num_games_owned":1012,"num_reviews":105,"playtime_forever":1245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":868,"last_played":1396454444},"language":"spanish","review":"Es obligación moral comprarlo.

Будем надеется, что дополнения к ней станут не хуже.","timestamp_created":1365319054,"timestamp_updated":1393348892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1953148","author":{"steamid":"76561198000192245","num_games_owned":371,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":880,"last_played":1378509072},"language":"english","review":"Pros \n- 1999 Mode is difficult and engaging \n- The Audio Logs are still a good exploration feed and help explain the story. \n- There is no shitty Multiplayer \n- The story is incredibly deep and the twists will keep you questioning everything \n- PC Settings are not as limited as in previous installments \n- PC Version is optimized alot better than the previous games \n- Bloom is actually used correctly in a video game \n- The AI Design, mainly for Elizabeth is amazing \n\nCons \n- Two Weapon Limit \n- Easy Mode may as well be \"Retard who can't even spell retard mode\" \n- Story is a little short when played on easier difficulties \n- Menu Navigation can be an issue (depending on the menu) \n\nOverall, I say Bioshock: Infinite is a great installment in the Bioshock franchise and it really helps show that you can improve on a game rather than lower standards just for a silly little portion of the \"casual\" audience, it could be much better and have a bigger story, but it decided to go for a clusterfuck rather than a sensible one, still decent though.\n\n7/10 - Buy it if you are bored.","timestamp_created":1365316699,"timestamp_updated":1395215178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458144813776016235","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6072000","author":{"steamid":"76561198058436751","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":716,"last_played":1418573655},"language":"english","review":"Best game i have probably ever played, there are no words great enough to describe it.","timestamp_created":1365316484,"timestamp_updated":1365316484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1094369","author":{"steamid":"76561197986551099","num_games_owned":168,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1021,"last_played":1365490800},"language":"english","review":"Fucked me up.
