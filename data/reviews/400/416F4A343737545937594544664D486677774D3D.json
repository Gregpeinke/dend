Not only will you use portals to reach certain areas, but you'll also have to consider momentum and timing to continue. The first few levels slowly let the player become familiar with the mechanics. The levels don't get too complicated towards the end, but there are additional challenges and custom levels that provide more content. There isn't much of a story, but things do become more interesting as the game progresses. The look and feel of the test chambers give off a clean and unsettling vibe. The lack of music for the majority of the game adds to the creepy atmosphere. I wouldn't say it's horrifying, but it does feel slightly off to me. The main campaign can be beaten in a short amount of time, compared to bigger games. However, I have played this years ago with The Orange Box and Portal: Still Alive on the Xbox 360, so that could have made it faster for me. Anyways, if you enjoy solving puzzles and like games that don't take too long to beat, then I'd check this out.","timestamp_created":1657305188,"timestamp_updated":1657305188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118465373","author":{"steamid":"76561198427521850","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":794,"last_played":1657305099},"language":"english","review":"I like portal","timestamp_created":1657304761,"timestamp_updated":1657304761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118464831","author":{"steamid":"76561199093360679","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1043,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1043,"last_played":1657734572},"language":"english","review":"It is so good all across the board and you need to definitely follow it up with Portal 2.
