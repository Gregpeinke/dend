How can anybody get tired of killing zombies???\nOne thing i like about this games is, if you play alone, maybe you get 20 zombies in the first wave... but y if you play in a team of 3 or 4... it doesn't go to 60 or 80... it goes to 120 or so... the zombies increasing per wave is exponential, what makes it mroe and more difificult with more players. beside this, there are 5 levels of difficulty to set, and you can choose short or long game, for more waves.\nThe perks, will tell you and your friend who is the one to lead, and who is the one to follow. knowing your part in the game as you choose the perk will make the team stronger, and more tactical. Not always is about killing the bad guys, something its about taking care of your teammates.\nKilling floor is a game I've played for ages, and i still come back to it! Now, on steam, even more, as it is easier!!","timestamp_created":1522591040,"timestamp_updated":1522591040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41205217","author":{"steamid":"76561198802753148","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":1148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":595,"last_played":1524917855},"language":"russian","review":"Помню как одноклассник передал мне диск с этой игрой.

You'd be much better served with it's much more refined and updated sequel as they're both essentially the same game. \nGot this on sale and it was worth the paltry amount I paid for it. \n\nSo what's wrong? Graphically the game is terrible and it looks incredibly dated, but that may be a bonus if you're playing on old hardware. It is extremely crude and basic sort of game that looks like it was cooked up pretty quickly in the Unreal engine. There's not much to it, but given that it's easy to get into, it's hard to not have fun with it.\n\nGameplay isn't all that interesting. It is - by all accounts - a mindless shooter. That may be OK if you're looking for a game where lateral thinking isn't required, and some carthartic stress-relief is desired. However, that just opens the door to repetitive play and eventual boredom once you've had your fill. A lot happens on screen and everything turns chaotic pretty quickly.\n\nHaving to run to the traders takes forever after every round gets tiring, and honestly I don't see the point in having to do that either after every wave.\nYou probably won't find as many players to play online with either. The community has mostly moved to KF2.\n\nThere are better zombie games than this one, as this has dated badly.\n\nStill fun in a perverse sort of way, with mods galore, and it was great at the time... but your time is better spent on other zombie games these days.... hence the thumbs down.","timestamp_created":1522473761,"timestamp_updated":1522493445,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.436406075954437256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41170116","author":{"steamid":"76561198166858600","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1315,"last_played":1563384850},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Muy buen juego la unica pega es que es un pedo jugar con amigos. :V","timestamp_created":1522471485,"timestamp_updated":1522471485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41167233","author":{"steamid":"76561198415922950","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1529718499},"language":"russian","review":"Игра класс советую поиграть \n\n","timestamp_created":1522458704,"timestamp_updated":1522458704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41165011","author":{"steamid":"76561198173728926","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":16448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16248,"last_played":1612209424},"language":"russian","review":"Тупа клас.
