As a modded derivative, it's CS:S with a different coat of paint. Today, we're spoiled with built-in game progression, bigger maps, and grindable attachments like camos and sights. There are the types of FPS players who don't care about that and choose to focus on improving their skills on games that lived and died on balanced mechanics and muscle memory. There are also FPS players who focus less on this to grind out objectives and built-in achievements into the game. Maybe there's some crossover, but it leads me to question whether the lively community in this game is nostalgic, falls into the first category of FPS players, or both. \n\nAnyways, the core mechanics, maps, and community of this game - it's the perfect trifecta that keeps the life of Valve games.
