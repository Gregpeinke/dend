Те кто ещё не прошёл игру (таких скорее всего не осталось) скажу что спойлерить я не буду и вы спокойно сами сможете пройти сюжет.\n\nПервое чем меня удивила игра так это своим \"графоном\". Ставлю я значит настройки на максимальные и жду что произойдёт, затем запускаю игру, врубаю Fraps и игра стабильно без всяких там \"скачков\" выдаёт настоящие 30 FPS. Для меня это было некой неожиданностью, ведь я уже хотел купить новый комп, но как оказалось, он ещё спокойно может мне отслужить года так 3. Графика крутая, не режет глаза, ничего не лагает, прекрасная оптимизация, вообщем графодрочеры 2011 года наверняка не прошли мимо и купили её! Да и по сей день эта игра многим удивляет людей, но графике в любом случае - 10 из 10-ти!!!\n\nВторое за что я всегда любил игры Portal - это юмор! Пусть он даже и не везде заметен, но от слов некоторых героев по комнате может разойтись такой громкий ржач, что даже ваши родители могут разволноваться и вызвать врача. Как я сказал, юмор тут мало заметен, но его много. \"Почему?!\", - спросите вы. В этой игре все шутки завязаны в основном на абсурде! Многие его не любят, но в этой игре он очень даже в тему. Особенно при новых прохождениях этой игры я до сих пор угараю над многими словами Кейва Джонсона, ГЛаДОС и Уитли. \nЗа отличное сочетание юмора и головоломки - 10 из 10-ти!!!\n\nТретье - это геймплей. Portal как бы вообще является головоломкой. Но! Иногда эта головоломка может сделаться из самой обычной ситуации, я приведу вам странный пример, но в любом случае такая ситуация в этой игре типична.\nПредставьте, что вам надо пробраться через кучку поршней, которые опускаются примерно раз в 4 секунды, но вы понимаете, что не сможете их перебежать пешком, ведь расстояние там большое. Но чего тупить то? У вас же есть портал-пушка. Пока поршни подняты, можно с лёгкостью создать портал на другой стороне, затем на вашей и пройти сквозь портал! Спустя ещё несколько раздумий вы понимаете, что на другой стороне нет поверхности, на которую можно поставить портал, но на вашей стороне такая поверхность есть! Что же делать?! Вы пробегали мимо того места, где идёт утечка и где со скоростью льётся ускоряющая жидкость и! О, чудо! Портал можно поставить прямо под поток, а второй поставить на вашей стороне! Жидкость разливается по поверхности под поршнями и вы за 2 секунды сможете их пробежать! Profit!\nЗа интересную головоломку - 10 из 10-ти!\n\nВ итог могу сказать, что эта игра одна из тех немногих, которая может привлечь внимание любого человека, который даже в основном и не играет в игры. Игру обязательно стоит купить на распродаже или даже без скидок, если завалялись лишние деньжата. \nИгре ставлю 10 ГЛаДОС из 10-ти!!!","timestamp_created":1404749200,"timestamp_updated":1480005968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11119168","author":{"steamid":"76561197986663502","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1237,"last_played":1499439765},"language":"german","review":"fetzt :D","timestamp_created":1404748788,"timestamp_updated":1404748788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11119089","author":{"steamid":"76561197993626931","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":776,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1479337721},"language":"russian","review":"Пиздатая че)","timestamp_created":1404748409,"timestamp_updated":1404748409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11118887","author":{"steamid":"76561198037463754","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":469,"last_played":1624678565},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite games of 2011.","timestamp_created":1404747414,"timestamp_updated":1404747414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11118570","author":{"steamid":"76561198012237191","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":435,"last_played":1631554435},"language":"russian","review":"Good game!

Первый Portal был оригинальной головоломкой от первого лица, а вторая часть получилась гораздо более масштабной и продуманной. Основной принцип остался тем же: используя портальную пушку, нужно проходить различные испытания. Кто не в курсе: игрок может создавать два связанных между собой портала, чтобы преодолевать всяческие препятствия. Первые уровни очень простые, да еще и с подсказками, но затем прохождение становится все более запутанным: нужно использовать различные предметы, учитывать местные особенности и т.д. Но при этом баланс сложности на мой взгляд очень удачен: не так уж и просто - в некоторых моментах приходится тратить изрядно времени, но и не слишком сложно - ни разу не возникло чувство поискать прохождение, гораздо интереснее было находить выход самому.\nСюжет строится как продолжение первой части. Но при этом он стал более сложным и увлекательным, с неожиданными поворотами. И к тому же открывающий интересную информацию об истории мира Portala. Ну и еще огромный плюс игры - это юмор, не позволяющий скучать во время решения головоломок. От постоянных подколок и реплик роботов не раз хотелось по-настоящему расхохотаться.

This is a very interesting and good thing.\n\nThe graphic is indeed good, mostly based on HL2 engine (well...is a Valve game...lol) and the sounds are pretty nice too (funny the music based/created on the laser beams or in other puzzles you have to solve); and the support of the contoller will put a smile on the console's enthusiast.\n\nThe story is related to the first portal and as I said in the beginning the single player mode is more deeper than a simple game; a very good observer and listener will easy understand what this game wants to tell you...probably in its own way but still it is a message.\n\nOverall:\nGraphics 8/10\nSounds 8/10\nGameplay 9/10\nCo-Op Gameplay 10/10\nLongevity 9/10","timestamp_created":1404637263,"timestamp_updated":1404637263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576784789562225342","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11098175","author":{"steamid":"76561198026803554","num_games_owned":359,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1647961924},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 is one of the games where when you add a 2 to the end of it, it's better.

I never liked first-person shooters to begin with, so I though I shouldn't bother with them. How wrong I was.\n\nLuckily, it was cheap enough during Summer Sale, so I decided to give it a try. I can't describe how much I'm enjoying playing this game. It's the kind of game you can't stop playing.\nYou have to use your brain to \"shoot\" portals and solve puzzles. It seems easy and simple, but things get crazy as you advance the story. The whole setting is intriguing and you meet some fun robots along the way.\nI haven't played cooperative mode yet, but I'm sure it's amazing too. Just don't waste your time reading reviews and buy this game. It's worth every penny.\n\nHurry up and make Portal 3, Valve.
