Where do I start?  Half-Life is one of those games that never gets old.  The physics are one of the highlighting features of this game.  They are spectacular!  For instance, when you throw a grenade at a bunch of enemies, the cover around them explodes and their bodies go into rag-doll form, but it's pretty realistic.  The story (at least to where I've covered thus far) is solid.  You play as Gordon Freeman, who, after talking with G-Man, get's off a train and you see how the world has become.  The way buildings are set out and how lighting is dealt with really gives you a feel as to the mood of the game; very gritty and a sense of hopelessness.  Then, you get help from previous Black Mesa members and you're on your way.  The combat is very great, even by today's standards.   The enemy A.I is also quite smart.  For example, when I throw a grenade at them, they get out of the way.  This game also contains puzzles that are pretty ingenious.  For example, there's a puzzle where you've got to put cinder blocks on one end of a platform in order to get on to the next section.  The sound design is also exceptional for the time.  The sound that Gordon makes when you swing your crowbar at a box or at a door is fairly accurate.  \n\nThe only thing that I would say that hasn't aged well in this game would be the textures.  They can look flat at times and jarring by today's standards.  \n\nOverall, though, this game has still been my favourite FPS and after seeing so many years of derivative crap (i.e the likes of Call of Duty or Cyberpunk), this is a refreshing breath of fresh air.","timestamp_created":1617133699,"timestamp_updated":1617143398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89389110","author":{"steamid":"76561198368925904","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":6559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3025,"last_played":1659281294},"language":"english","review":"Very good game, alot of fun, very well done and more...

I always forget that this game came out in 2004. Favorite chapter has gotta be Highway 17. I like how songs from the first game have made a return, along with a myriad of original tracks that all sound great. I do have a few minor issues. This game is a total power-trip. Every character knows who you are and worships you. Gordon is a theoretical physicist, not Doomguy. The Combine also aren't as fun to fight as the HECU. That's mostly the fault of the dated AI and the abundance of open arenas favoring the player. Other than that, fantastic game through and

It starts off crazy, just like the first, but the momentum keeps going.  It does this by keeping you largely in the dark as to what's going on, but from what you hear, and what happens, you get bits and pieces to put together on your own.  You'll see some of the same old weapons, but some new ones, and the balance is much more fun and interesting.  You also get your hands on the gravity gun, which doesn't use ammo, and has so many fun applications, that on its own, is worth the price of admission; they could've made an entire game based around this thing, and I can only imagine that that was the inspiration for Portal.  It's constantly switching things up, too; almost every chapter throws something a little different at you, which keeps things exciting.  Not all of the gimmicks are fun - the driving controls are pretty bad, though not completely atrocious - but the moments of frustration are worth the ridiculous highs that keep on coming, even at the very end.

I bought it the on release day, but my PC was so ratchet at the time that I couldn't get it to work, needles to say I was pretty salty about this. For one reason or another I either missed chances to play it or simply didn't have the hardware from then till now. After all these years I finally realised that Steam is not exclusive to PC and as the game is 17 years old my 2015 mac mini would most probably be able to support it, lo and behold it certainly was. All I can say is that even though it has taken me this long to finally play it and I've had every next-gen console to fill the intervening 17 years, this game is hands down one of the best games I've ever played, I can see what all of the fuss is about. Even with the dated graphics it is still a fantastically well made game and has stood the test of time.
