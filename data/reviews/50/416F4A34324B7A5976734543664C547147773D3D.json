To get this out of the way: this is a full game, not a short ripoff, and it remains Gearbox's best game to date in my opinion. Not only does it rival the original game, it remains a strong candidate for the best Half-Life game ever made. It's hard to believe that typically with an expansion pack, and the fact that was developed by another team just makes it even more unfathomable. However, Opposing Force gets everything right with Half-Life. \n\nUsually expansion packs don't end up being too special. They often do little else than add more content to a pre-existing game. Stand-alone expansions tend to fare better. Other examples of this type besides Opposing Force include Halo 3: ODST and Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. \n\nOpposing Force doesn't screw up anything. The puzzle solving elements are still great. The platforming elements are still great. What it ultimately improves on besides just the visuals, and this is the main reason why it's so great, is combat and pacing. All of the new weapons are fun to use. There is not a single moment in this game that lacks tension or feels off, and in the end although it stands on its own it gets tied together with Half-Life very cohesively. This is what an expansion pack should be in a perfect world: something that goes beyond what it's expanding upon. And although most don't, this is an exception.","timestamp_created":1390220384,"timestamp_updated":1408863796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533131301403045654","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8752219","author":{"steamid":"76561198073019164","num_games_owned":415,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":528,"last_played":1383825474},"language":"english","review":"Opposing Force shows Half-Life from different perspective, and at the same time introduces a lot of new content and story.

Released in 1999, exactly a year after the original game.\n\nPersonally i like it just as much as the original Half Life, and in my book, original Half Life is in top 10.\n\nIt consists of 12 chapters, but don't let that fool you cause it's not nearly as long as the original Half Life. 6 hours is as much as you can get from it.\n\nThat said, the game has it's own identity. For example, just like any half life game, this one has a tutorial. Gearbox decided to have a bit of fun with it, since you start out in the boot camp.\n\nIt's a typical training mission, but a nicely done training mission. Had a lot of army stereotypes and FMJ references.\n\nUnlike Blue Shift (2nd expansion), this game actually tried to add some things of its own.\n\n[list]\n    [*]Night vision googles instead of the flashlight.\n    [*]Sniper instead of the crossbow.\n    [*]Pistol with a laser pointer instead of the revolver.\n    [*]Wrench and a knife instead of the crowbar\n    [*]2 new alien weapons - one is like a bazooka, the other has infinite ammo (shoots lightning balls).\n[*]Instead of long jumps, your protagonist climbs on ropes.\n[*]1 new Black Mesa prototype weapon, that teleports you to Xen. The location you get teleported in generally have a lot of loot.\n[*]1 completely new weapon, not just an alternative model - a machine gun (M249 SAW).\n[*]There are new alien types as well.\n[/list]\n\nAlso, throughout the game, you will encounter your comrades, the most important ones are medic and engineer. Medic can patch you up, while the engineer can drill through doors.\n\nAs for the story, neither Blue Shirt nor Opposing Forces are canon. That said, Opposing Forces has a lot of cameos. I personally wouldn't have minded to have it in the official lore.\n\nDeep inside it's still the same game, but at least they tried to add a few things here and there. Like i said, it has it's own identity.\n\nI highly recommend it.","timestamp_created":1384972813,"timestamp_updated":1470390929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":127,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.887882590293884277","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7690700","author":{"steamid":"76561198010606611","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":386,"last_played":1480920304},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite FPS","timestamp_created":1384796605,"timestamp_updated":1384796605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7684781","author":{"steamid":"76561198025027748","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":499,"last_played":1342335600},"language":"english","review":"If you played Half Life and enjoyed it, play this too.","timestamp_created":1384722628,"timestamp_updated":1384722628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7674341","author":{"steamid":"76561198006934852","num_games_owned":2881,"num_reviews":111,"playtime_forever":623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":623,"last_played":1384630365},"language":"english","review":"Recommend playing [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006934852/recommended/70/]Half-Life[/url] first.

Les intéractions avec les PNJ sont plutôt convaincantes, l'immersion est réussi. Cela dit quelques bugs et un gameplay parfois lourdingue viennent entacher le périple.

It's pretty lengthy, stretching over 9 hours. Blue Shift is also good, but the new weapons and monsters aren't there, and the length is considerablly shorter due to Barney's story. The Half-Life series is not complete without these expansions.","timestamp_created":1381801567,"timestamp_updated":1400213399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7371457","author":{"steamid":"76561198025674597","num_games_owned":1706,"num_reviews":516,"playtime_forever":2673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1337,"last_played":1637853016},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life: Opposing Force packs the same non-stop action as the original Half-Life, but this time playing from a new perspective: that of Adrian Shephard, a member of the military sent to \"clean up\" the Black Mesa Incident.\n\nThis game features some new weapons, and it shows more areas of the Black Mesa Research Facility. The story is as good as that of the original Half-Life, and you get to see things from the side of the HECU.\n\nAlthough a bit shorter than Half-Life, this is a great game, and, in my opinion, it's slightly more challenging than its predecessor.

This game is old but if u love half life you'll love this with only a price tag of $5 Sure the graphics may be bad but the game play is amazing fun and challenging.
