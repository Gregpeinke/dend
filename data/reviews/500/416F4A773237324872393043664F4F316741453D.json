favorite co-op shooter of all time and easily one of the best still today. Left 4 Dead was such a huge part of the 7th. generation of consoles (and PC's)  influencing many titles to come thereafter as they tried to emulate and recreate the frenzied, chaotic, and fun nature of the orignal L4D but most fall short. Never has a game pushed me to my limits in terms of teamwork and organization, especially on Expert difficulty. Years later I find myself coming back to this and its sequel and I still receive the same level of challenge and overall fun I did on day one. This is without a doubt one of Valve's best multiplayer games.

One things that I do love is the routes in the game change all the time meaning it’s the same campaigne but there are different paths.  I would suggest starting out the campaignes out on Easy and start increasing the difficulty from there just so you can get the machanics down, and hopefully, and I saw this with a grain of salt; MAYBE players online with extend you the same courtesy.  Another thing I did like about the game is the achievements that reference other zombie movies and games.

This left 4 dead is missing features and maps but I still like this one more (atleast for its coop, not versus).

The first one has no overpowered melee weapons, crowd clearing grenade launchers, or bilebombs that can divert them away.  It is also much darker compared to left 4 dead 2 and can be kinda scary to new players.  Many features in left 4 dead 2 seem to be built around versus, it makes sense because this was the first ones weakest aspect.  But the problem is it makes coop in the second one a living hell with zombies that spit acid on campers, or jockeys that ride away from teammates, and chargers that can kill you instantly.\n\nSadly most modders have left the first one because it does not have workshop support and most people play left 4 dead 2.  With no workshop or much of a community not many still play this one.  Granted you can still find a couple servers up during the day, it still is not that much.  \n\nimo you should probably get left 4 dead 2 if you dont care much about what they changed and just wanna play, but you should give the first one a try at some point because it is (and still is) a very well made game.
