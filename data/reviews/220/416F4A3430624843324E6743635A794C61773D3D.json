Время шло, героев становилось всё больше, но я смею утверждать, что Гордон Фримен - лучший из всех.\n\nУ Гордона нет темного прошлого - он живет настоящим. У Гордона нет сверхспособностей - он простой человек (простой ли?). У Гордона нет постоянных рефлексий - он уверен в себе.  У Гордона нет ситуаций морального выбора - он точно знает, что должен сделать и делает это безукоризненно. К слову, то, чем Гордон занимается, даже не совсем его прямая обязанность. Ученый, \"ботаник\" берет в руки монтировку/автомат/гравипушку и идет спасать мир от супостатов. \n\nВо время игрового процесса мы не видим лица Гордона, не слышим его голоса, не погружаемся в его мысли.

попробуй сравнить Халф-Лайф 2 с другими играми того же года!\n-Левел-Дизайн.Умно спрятаные границы карт, необходимость вернуться назад в некоторых местах а также секретки с оружием и патронами делают эту игру достойной апплодисментов за труд дизайнеров.\n-Дизайн Всего, что сделано Альянсом.Блокпосты на улицах, Пласзменные винтовки и станковые пулеметы на их основе, силовые поля, солдаты Альянса, превращенные в полуроботов с их характерными голосами, движущиеся механические стены, друбящие все на своем пути, сама цитадель и Тяжелая Техника, являющая собой гибрид органики с живыми жукообразными существами, всё это являет собой один из лучших концептов всех времен и народов.Тот, кто за всех этим стоял несомненно безумный гений великого масштаба.Я салютую.\n-Персонажи.Ни один из них не является клишшированным, каждый уникален и имеет свой характер.Кляйнер может заговорить о чем-то научном и застрять в деталях на многие часы, Илай Вэнс жизнерадосный и умудренный годами старик, веселый в мирные моменты, но решительный в трудные минуты, Барни-неунывающий полевой командир сопротивления, идущий в первых рядах, невероятно оптимистичный и улыбчивый, А Уоллес Брин-гадкий человек, откровенно боящийся Альянса, но все еще считающий, что ассимиляция Земли это не плохо и не страшно.Даже Гордона немного раскрывают через монологи и диалоги других персонажей как Умного и доброго, но немного странного мессию всея человечества (Да, он может бить монтировкой трупик хедкраба 5 минут и тыкать на кнопку телепортации на мини-телепорте пока он не сломается, но одновременно с этим он собственноручно разрушил Нова-Проспект и цитадель, перебил половину полицейских в Сити-17 лично и ни разу не был зомбирован Хэдкрабом не имея при этом шлема на голове.\n-Паззлы и головоломки.Халф-Лайф всегда славился тем, что это не безмозглый шутер, а умный шутер, где нужно действително думать чтобы пройти с уровня на уровень.Вторая часть заходит с этим еще дальше, ведь теперь у нас есть физический движок, а значит можно задействовать куда больше действий чем толкание и пинание одинаковых ящиков.Каждый предмет имеет вес и может быть использован для решения физических паззлов, и это клево.\n-Достижения.Эта игра была первой в которой появились достижения.Да-да, именно Valve и Габен лично изобрели эти прямоугольчики, выпрыгивающие в углу экрана когда вы нашли пасхалку, убили врага броском унитаза или просто прошли уровень.Лично я их люблю, и раз это стало вводиться практически повсеместно, особенно в тайтлах типа Call Of Duty и Battlefied, их люблю не я один.\nА теперь, как ни странно, минусы:\n-Локализация.Господи, этот перевод и его подача актерами озвучки просто *звук рвотного рефлекса* однако это может задеть только тех, кто не знает английкого и/или не умеет переключать язык в стиме (Переключение языка озвучки не меняется если не настроить параметр через \"Свойства\" в стиме) в остальном я включил английский перевод, озвучку и наконец-то почувствовал какую-то химию с Аликс Вэнс, которая была прекрасно дублирована в оригинале но ужасно дублирована в локализации.\n\n\nОднако все эти минусы можно отнести в разряд вкусовшины, они мешают наслаждаться игрой только таким как я, занудам и придирам.\nЯ ставлю этой игре заслуженную

The story is told in a unique fashion without using cutscenes which is a trope these days. The characters are always enjoyable to listen to and Alex is actually a useful companion to have by your side. Level design is top-notch, AI is smart as hell, and the weapons in this game are some of the most unique I've used. The shooting mechanics and optimization are still better then most games today which is incredible. I really enjoy the puzzles and amount of freedom gives you despite it not technically being an open-world. I just can't get over how well executed every element is done in this game. Some of the levels like We Don't Go to Ravenholm still remain the most memorable ones to this day. \n\nBasically, this is a game that EVERYONE should own and play at some point because there's a reason this game is so acclaimed. At 10 dollars I'd buy it but considering steam always has this game on sale for 2 bucks there is no excuse to not nab at. While you're at it, grab the 2 episodes after as well because they're pretty much on par with this and progress the already amazing story and game much further. \n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1480669680,"timestamp_updated":1557477719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28133028","author":{"steamid":"76561198073335018","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2344,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1734,"last_played":1654745596},"language":"english","review":"its fucking half life 2 of course it's good","timestamp_created":1480657210,"timestamp_updated":1655916495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28131719","author":{"steamid":"76561198202346031","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":282,"last_played":1588292518},"language":"english","review":"This game is garbage I would not buy it I can not give it away or sell it for money so do not make the same mistake I did","timestamp_created":1480649454,"timestamp_updated":1480649454,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.349149912595748901","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28130275","author":{"steamid":"76561198231341852","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1584839183},"language":"english","review":"I was like \"eh this might be an okay game\" but now I LOVE IT!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1480640923,"timestamp_updated":1480640923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28128388","author":{"steamid":"76561198091885066","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1267,"last_played":1643155410},"language":"english","review":"is gud gam 0 out of 10 no half life 3","timestamp_created":1480631403,"timestamp_updated":1480631403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28127700","author":{"steamid":"76561198120469552","num_games_owned":1185,"num_reviews":133,"playtime_forever":1035,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":860,"last_played":1599155408},"language":"english","review":"[h1]Review: Half-Life 2  [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics / Audio:\nThe Game was published back in 2004 using the source engine which is still a good engine for nicely looking games like Titanfall 1 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. For a game that's 14 years old it is still in very good shape. Map design is amazing, City 17 still has that amazing atmosphere, characters do look sharp enough same goes with textures. For a 14 year old game it has quite the attention to small details which i like a lot. Characters Faces are still nicely detailed and can show you emotions which even some current gen games have problem with. Audio and Voice acting are still pretty good even by todays standards!\n\n[ 6,5 out of 10 ]\n\n[*]Gameplay:\nOne of the best games gameplay wise in my opinion. Aiming and Moving feels extremely smooth, huge variety of weapons and multiple enemies which make the whole experience a challange. Combined with the top notch physics of the Source Engine and the Gravity Gun you get one of the best ideas ever. Killing enemies requires tactical approach which i like a lot, they are pretty easy to kill but the AI is just well build and makes smart decisions. The game has a couple of puzzle moments which in most games would be somewhat boring but in Half-Life 2 i loved all of them. Nothing else to say just a great experience.\n\n[ 10 out of 10 ]\n\n[*]Story:\nThere will be no Spoilers, or not any major ones atleast!\nHalf-Life 2 takes part in a somewhat captured planet Earth by the Combine. After coming back to earth mysteriously you are Member of the Resistance trying to start the revolution. The Story is pretty Linear but believe me it isn't boring at all giving you more than enough freedom. There is no Minimap or GPS type of arrow showing you where to go which makes you take decisions or simply just explore the Map. At the start of the Story you can clearly see that Humans are scared and there are multiple 'cutscenes' showing you what Combine does to humans but towards the end you can see the people of City 17 fighting against Combine and gaining pride etc which is a nice touch in my opinion. Another reason why the make has such a great atomsphere is because there are no staged cutscenes which makes everything more realistic in my opinion and doesn't simply lock the camers etc.\n \n[ 10 out of 10 ]\n\n[*]Performance:\nIts a 2004 source engine game so almost any machine can really handle it easily!\n\n[ 10 out of 10 ]\n\n[*]Price:\nIts extremely cheap when the Steam Sales start!\n\n[*]DLC:\nHalf-Life 2: Episode 1\nHalf-Life 2: Episode 2\nBoth are must get additions!\n\nRecommended if you love the Gravity Gun!\n\n[table]\n[th] If you like my Review be sure to Join my Group!

The weapons.Now, you cannot aim downsite with any weapon in this game like you can in pretty much ever shooter in the world, but thats not a bad thing at all.All the weapons ranging from the starting pistol to the shotgun to the rpg feels fantastic to use as they have enough punch to them to make you feel like a badass while killing soldiers and aliens.\n\nThere are a lots n lots n lots n lots n lots n lots n lots nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn LOTS of things truly amazing to say about this game but words aren't sufficient enough.You absolutely need to play this game on any platform you can(pc is the best way to experience it though).Its such a marvelous creation in video games that its still popular today and half life 3 is being delayed and delayed and honestly after Valve stopped making games anymore and care more about slot machines and getting kids into gambling, there's not much hope left for it.Yet you can still just play the first 2 games including episode 1 & 2 of half life 2 and still have an amazing time, though you maybe left feeling that a conclusion is necessary.","timestamp_created":1480518701,"timestamp_updated":1480519896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28099260","author":{"steamid":"76561198152304625","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1648692301},"language":"brazilian","review":"Esse é o tipo de jogo que todo mundo deveria jogar, quem sabe se não sai uma continuação mas ate isso acontecer vai jogando esse!","timestamp_created":1480517269,"timestamp_updated":1480517269,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28098226","author":{"steamid":"76561198113210867","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":300,"last_played":1574426482},"language":"english","review":"<333333","timestamp_created":1480514266,"timestamp_updated":1480514266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28096432","author":{"steamid":"76561198192059945","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":54,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1446723056},"language":"russian","review":"параша, от которой болит голова, пожалуйста, не покупайте её,","timestamp_created":1480508138,"timestamp_updated":1480508138,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.250852346420288086","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28094967","author":{"steamid":"76561198091348641","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1023,"last_played":1646655304},"language":"russian","review":"Игра проверенная временем.\n13/10.","timestamp_created":1480502001,"timestamp_updated":1511374731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28093823","author":{"steamid":"76561198278185284","num_games_owned":559,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":2012,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":739,"last_played":1588767689},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Чудова гра, обов'язково раз в рік перепрохожу, і кожен раз як перший.
