I had only known about Bioshock 1 & 2 through internet reviews and media outlets at the time but had never came around to play neither of them until recently. When I finished Infinite for the first time the story had mind fucked me so hard as a 14 year old kid in 8th Grade that I was mentally affected for two days. The one thing that I still remembered after 7 years since my last play through (besides the ending) was that the outside world of Columbia was so damn mesmerizing and beautiful for its time of release. I'm always surprised to see that it wasn't received as well as I would have expected back then but I guess I was just so enthralled in the story and world that what many consider to be average gameplay didn't deter me at all- I just so deeply yearned for answers at the time. After playing through the remasters and finishing them completely, I only had infinite left to play. I was so excited to play infinite because even though I had only completed it once on the 360, I felt like since I had gotten older and had now played Bioshock 1 & 2 that I would finally get the full picture. After all those years the game really gave me that same feeling It did when I had first played it back when I was middle school. The atmosphere, the story telling, and the graphics is still great and it felt like I was 14 all over again. After finishing infinite and the Burial At Sea DLC, I can now say that infinite (In My Opinion) is the best in the trilogy. Infinite will always have a special place in my heart and is one of the few games to ever make me cry like a baby after finishing the Burial At Sea DLC. I highly recommend this game to anyone and I also recommend Playing thru Bioshock 1 & 2 if you plan on getting the Burial At Sea DLC(that it makes sense to you).","timestamp_created":1657188784,"timestamp_updated":1657188784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118378088","author":{"steamid":"76561198097099758","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3287,"last_played":1657186403},"language":"schinese","review":"极致堆料的美术，虽然战斗方面略有瑕疵，但依然是顶尖水平的单人线性剧情游戏，必玩！\nPS：如果你是伊丽莎白单推人，海葬第二章可以不玩","timestamp_created":1657187618,"timestamp_updated":1657187618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118376502","author":{"steamid":"76561198165933347","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1658052308},"language":"polish","review":"Zajebiste polecam inne części gry, bardziej podoba mi sie jedynka i dwójka bioschok ale to tez jest spoko","timestamp_created":1657186025,"timestamp_updated":1657186025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118373034","author":{"steamid":"76561199184742741","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":9890,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9890,"last_played":1657178557},"language":"schinese","review":"和和睦睦的天空之城 里面的公民之间会进行友好的互动 真不错","timestamp_created":1657180059,"timestamp_updated":1657180059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118368470","author":{"steamid":"76561198323903766","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":391,"last_played":1657213316},"language":"english","review":"aesthetic, intense, annoying and pretty games. kawaii for elizabeth","timestamp_created":1657171801,"timestamp_updated":1657171801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118366107","author":{"steamid":"76561198873978299","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":664,"last_played":1657119099},"language":"english","review":"Great story.","timestamp_created":1657167909,"timestamp_updated":1657167909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118364279","author":{"steamid":"76561198115951417","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":609,"last_played":1657252399},"language":"english","review":"Game play is very good, art style makes this game not feel very old, and story is amazing.","timestamp_created":1657164948,"timestamp_updated":1657164948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118361236","author":{"steamid":"76561197968730476","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":24339,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23056,"last_played":1658003827},"language":"english","review":"This was a good game.
