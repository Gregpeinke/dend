Unlike Half-Life: Opposing Force and Blue Shift, which were more like optional side stories for HL1, Episode One is the direct continuation to the story of Half-Life 2 and is definitely worth playing, but it's very short. It has the same great gameplay as HL2, just in a more bite sized experience.

wrong. \n- Best part was definitely stupid ai/npc's (mainly Alyx) in my way and not being able to move past them while getting f'ed by hostiles and having to wait for doors / the next area to open.  \n no coherent storyline just ambiguous and ambiguous =/= great (apparently).  \n- No clear objectives (this isn't bad within itself just tedious) , so you will easily find yourself not quite knowing where you should go, but your gamer instincts kick in and just end up doing the tasks after exhausting everything in the zone. \n- its just a shame that so many circle jerk and think this is great bec

is a terrible game because it is the worst thing a game can be: simply not fun. A game should, by definition, be something that you enjoy, and this feels like a chore. A shooter game in which half the time you have nothing to shoot enemies with, either because you have no guns or you have no ammunition? Wow, what a great idea!\n\nAnd the repetitiveness is just terrible. Just how many cars do I have to push into holes to stop an endless stream of antlions? That thing got old the moment it appeared, but no, they make you do it again and again.\n\nSo you say you don’t like doing the same stuff over and over again? Great, because we have an electronic door for which you have to find the switch somewhere in the pitch dark. And when you do it, there is another. And another. And another. Yeah, we are really lazy when building levels so guess what? There is a group of people you have to escort from A to B. And when you do it, go back to A, because there is another group to escort to B. Then you will have to do it again. And after that, guess what you have to do? That’s right, the same thing again. And then again, just for good measure.\n\nPlus, present (or rather, absent) are the same things that plague the whole series: no map, no coherent storyline (lack of coherent story is spun to mean “ambiguous” and “ambiguous” is spun to somehow mean great), and often no clear objectives, so you will easily find yourself not quite knowing where you should go, while not quite knowing what to do and definitely not knowing why. Granted, the situation is better here than in the first Half-Life game, but worse than in Half-Life 2.\n\nAnd during the whole time, the game offers you a giant middle finger from developers in the form of “witty” remarks from Alyx, in which she (or rather they) mock you for doing all the stupid repetitive things the game makes you do, while not having any of the things I mentioned in the above paragraph (Alyx, by the way, got extremely annoying extremely fast). “Too bad we don’t have a map”, Alyx says at one point; “Wow, this again”, at another; “Good thing you know what to do, Gordon” in a situation when you don’t know what to do, except that you should somehow stop the core from exploding. On the surface, I guess this is supposed to be tongue in cheek, but in reality it is a giant FU to the player. “See, we make you do stupid things in a lousy game; we make fun of you for doing it; and you are gonna love us and convince yourself that this is a great game.” And sadly, many people do.\n\nPlay this only if you got it for free and you hate yourself.","timestamp_created":1611511655,"timestamp_updated":1611511655,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.609671056270599365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85277394","author":{"steamid":"76561198851255803","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":258,"last_played":1611506888},"language":"turkish","review":"oyun gayet iyi zaten half life yi bilirsiniz sizin gözünüze sokmaz onu size alttan alttan verir anlamayı size bırakır tavsiye ederim yapay zekası kötü olsada yılına göre iyi bi oyun\n","timestamp_created":1611506978,"timestamp_updated":1611506978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85277379","author":{"steamid":"76561198118950371","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":169,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":169,"last_played":1611506879},"language":"english","review":"fuck that last section","timestamp_created":1611506951,"timestamp_updated":1611506951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85274981","author":{"steamid":"76561198874722175","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1612113905},"language":"russian","review":"Найс вери вери гуд)","timestamp_created":1611504043,"timestamp_updated":1611504043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85271516","author":{"steamid":"76561198986427919","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":344,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1627493115},"language":"russian","review":"69","timestamp_created":1611500062,"timestamp_updated":1611500062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85257350","author":{"steamid":"76561199074400897","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1611481917},"language":"turkish","review":"Valve kalitesini her türlü konuşturuyor.
