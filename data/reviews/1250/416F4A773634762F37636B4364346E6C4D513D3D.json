All'inizio l'ho trovato un po' incasinato perchè ti ritrovi all'improvviso con una pistolina contro un orda di zombie. Però dopo qualche partita ha cominciato veramente a piacermi. Devo dire che quando è uscito questo gioco, nel 2009, ha portato un po' di novità nel mondo videoludico. In qualche punto sembra che gli sviluppatori abbiano preso spunto da Left 4 Dead 2 (infatti c'è uno zombie che è molto simile al boomer). Comunque come grafica non è male. Ci sono tantissime mappe diverse tra loro, quindi non ci si stanca mai e ci sono molte armi che si possono comprare al negozio durante la partita spendendo soldi che si guadagnano uccidendo gli zombie.

You get sets of perks (Sort of like classes) That you get to build up on, For example, Feild medic, And sharp shooter. Although most servers are on either Normal or Hard and above. You get used to how the game plays really quickly. It uses source engine. if your computer can handle any other source game such as hl2, dod, css, csgo, tf2, this game will run really easy for you. The team play is great, i've never encountered ass hole players who just leave you behind, there are always players to heal you, give you money when you need it, etc. Not many players use their mic, but the voice commands are very, very, very helpfull. I rate this game 10/10.
