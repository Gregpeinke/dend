I've played bits of it as a kid, but I think I found it to scary so I never played it properly back then. Over the time I just never really cared for it so I didn't play it.\n\nThanks to the Valve sales, I decided to buy it and play it.  Considering the low price, it was worth it. 10 hours spent well.\n\nIt should be noted that the game was quite innovative for its time, and did a lot for its genre. Playing it now, most of it is lost on you, so you just take it for what it is now. Did it age well? Yes it did, aside from enemies taking too many hits at times and every bullet hitting you for sure. Thanks to Quick Save/Load, that's not a problem, you just avoid taking lots of damage, as you can recover health after every bigger section. So I'd say the action is good and not that much broken. \n\nHowever, platforming can be a bit tricky, as the player movement doesn't seem to have been designed for platforming. Kinda like having to jump on platforms in a Call of Duty game. It's just weird, and often you end up missing or jumping on it and falling off. Quick Save/Load fixes this issue as you can just save before tricky jumps. \n\nQuick Saves. They are your best friend in this game, but at the same time you might hate yourself for using them. They make the game too easy as you can save anywhere and anytime you want. Dangerous enemies in the next room? Quick save. Took out one of the big ones without taking much damage? Quick save and attack the next one.  It just makes the game easier than it should be, so the challenge is kinda low thanks to it. It's basically \"legal' save states. Finishing the game without them would be a nice challenge.\n\nCan't talk much about difficulty differences as I played on normal. I don't know how difficult this mode even was, as Quick saves take you right back into the latest action.\n\nThe story was more subtle in this game. You are just a scientist that got involved in a mess. Most of the story you hear from other NPCs (you can't pause the game while they are talking, otherwise the audio gets canceled) and observing what's going on.\n\nAfter 10 hours of fun, I have to say that the ending was really disappointing in my case. It was just a short dialogue with you getting to choose between a good and bad ending. So it's kinda pointless. \n\nOverall, I'll rate this game 7/10, it's worth giving a try, and the game looks really nice with the HD texture pack.","timestamp_created":1412034742,"timestamp_updated":1412034742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501672208309173584","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12293653","author":{"steamid":"76561198088277764","num_games_owned":359,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1436,"last_played":1642368427},"language":"english","review":"End of the world simulator 1998.\n\nNo, seriously, this is how the army would react if something like this actually happened.\n\n","timestamp_created":1412024610,"timestamp_updated":1412024610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12293159","author":{"steamid":"76561198087862665","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":938,"last_played":1449609383},"language":"spanish","review":"Lo primero decir que al haber jugado a este juegazo, comprendo porque marcó una época.\nMe parece un juego excelente, largo pero entretenido, todos los que jueguen a este juego verán que la jugabilidad (movimiento del personaje) no es uno de sus mejores dotes.

Most of the lab (Black Mesa) is destroyed and now there are aliens everywhere.\nYou then travel throughout the lab to attempt getting to the surface. Shortly you find out that you're now fucking at war against the military, who, wants to destroy you, and everything else relating to the Resonance Cascade. \nYou are then set out to find the Lambda Complex which is the last (assuming) funtional site of the Black Mesa complex.\nSomewhere halfway through the game you set off a rocket (which I forget the point of. It wasn't explained on after I actually launched it.)\nOk then after you're actually finished underground, you're tasked with crossing the military zone to reach the Lambda Complex. \nSummary: Blow up tanks and helicopters - No one cares about you anymore cause you're killing everyone so they call in an airstrike to destroy everything, including the aliens which still want to kill you.\nYou go back underground and finally reach Sector F (LC)!!!!\nYou teleport to the planet Xen (home of the aliens.)\nThe remaining scientists told you that you need to kill the ruler of Xen to save the world cause obviously you aren't emotionally scarred yet.\nKill Big Momma and then you kill the final boss that looks like a giant fetus (this was the most annoying boss but I was stupid!!)\n\nFinally the game ends and you see G-Man (yes it's that creepy guy that everyone talks about but doesn't know where he came from.) He's really weird and he says his \"company has let him offer you a job.\" \nMEGA SPOILER: Depending on what you do, if you take his offer then you're hired and you await for your new job (probably referring to Half-Life 2), if you reject his offer then he teleports you back to Xen in a pit filled with aliens without weapons (because the bitch took them cause they were \"government property\") and the game ends.
