It's all much too massive and even fewer surfaces to stick a portal onto.\n\nThe storyline is top notch though, and the co-op alone is definitely worth the price of admission alone.

The gels definitely add a new dimension to the gameplay, but not a great deal and only to about 1/3 of the whole game. As a collection of puzzles, Portal 2 feels significantly easier than Portal. Many times I found that the goal of a puzzle was not necessarily to find a clever solution, but simply to understand what the very simple but slightly obtuse solution was.\n\nCo-op is another story. It changes the game almost entirely and is very fun to play. However, it, almost moreso than the single player campaign, lacks replay value.
