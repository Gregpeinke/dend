It's amazing!\" 10/10\n\nEverything that you've heard about 'Portal' is true. Well, if you've heard nothing but great things about it, that is. Because this is easily one of the greatest puzzle games to ever be created. Hell, it may even be one of the greatest games created, period. It's like 'Half Life 2' but on crack! You thought crack was bad for you, didn't you? Well it turns out that crack is good when combined with elements of puzzle solving and first person shooters. 'Portal' may be short, but it's pretty damn cheap too. And when you take into consideration the difficulty of the added challenges after you've completed the story, it should take a decent amount of time to complete. Nevertheless, it's refreshing to see a first person 'shooter' without bullets and if you haven't picked this game up, along with the rest of the 'Orange Box', that's something that you should probably be doing right about now.","timestamp_created":1426958405,"timestamp_updated":1426958405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14991003","author":{"steamid":"76561198185118355","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":365,"last_played":1459364713},"language":"english","review":"An old time classic.

O jogo é uma mistura de puzzle (quebra cabeça) e ação. Ele se passa no mesmo universo de Half-Life. A protagonista chama-se Chell e ela é muda, o enredo do jogo é basicamente contado por uma \"voz\" chamada GLaDOS, que dá instruções para a protagonista. Pelo fato da protagonista não falar, pode parecer que o jogo tem um enrredo disperso, mas a história vai ficando cada vez mais interessante, até chegar em um final surpreendente.\n\nA Chell usa a \"portal gun\", que é uma arma que lança um portal azul e um laranja, para passar pelas câmaras do jogo.\nA dificuldade, no começo é muito baixa, e vai aumentando bastante conforme você avança.\nEu não vi nenhum bug no decorrer da campanha. A trilha sonora do jogo é muito boa, dando destaque para a música 'Still Alive' que é cantada pela GLaDOS nos créditos do jogo.\nO jogo é curto, dá zerá-lo em uma média de 3hs, em uma segunda jogatina esse tempo diminui muito.\nOs gráficos do jogo são consideravelmente bons, levando em consideração o ano do lançamento.\nO jogo tem uns desafios extras, como passar por uma câmara usando poucos portais, dando poucos passos ou em pouco tempo. E também tem as câmaras avançadas, que são as do modo campanha com a dificuldade aumentada.\n\n\nPortal é um dos melhores jogos de puzzles de todos os tempos e o preço do jogo é muito bom, a Valve fez mais um jogo com qualidade extrema, vale cada centavo.","timestamp_created":1426711346,"timestamp_updated":1651619505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.714259445667266846","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14948340","author":{"steamid":"76561198153722468","num_games_owned":1034,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":143,"last_played":1583679511},"language":"french","review":"juste le meilleur jeux possible dans le genre si vous ni avec pas encore jouer c'est le moment il peu tourner sur un pc peu puissant et le gameplay est parfait","timestamp_created":1426695990,"timestamp_updated":1426695990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14944142","author":{"steamid":"76561198107990802","num_games_owned":789,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":8738,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4574,"last_played":1590622354},"language":"english","review":"It's a pretty cool game!

I certainly wasn't interested in Team Fortress, as I don't play multiplayer games. So, having completed the Half-Life 2 episode, I thought I'd give this a try. Hmm. A puzzle game using the Source engine. No guns, next to no plot and very little in the way of pretty graphics. Didn't sound that interesting, but since I'd already bought it I might as well play it.\n\nWow. I doubt there is anybody who doesn't yet know the twist, but suffice to say the writing in this game is absolutely top notch.

I have finished the entire campaign, done all advanced chambers and I'm now trying to complete the challenges, just so I can uninstall this game with all achievements.\nThe storyline was just SO horrible and unimpressive, while I was told by everyone it is amazing..\nThe gameplay was nothing that impressive and revolutionary, as, again, people always tend to say. Yes, physics were very good and accurate, but they're all for this game. I don't find physics enough for a good game.\nThe final boss was probably easier than a kids' game. Not to mention nothing epic happened even at the end..\n[b]TL;DR[/b] I REALLY tried to give this game a chance! As you can see I haven't uninstalled it yet even after completing, because I keep trying to find that ''something'' everyone says this game has.

Grę charakteryzuje głównie nastawienie na rozwiązywanie zagadek, jednocześnie unikając śmierci na różne, czasami dziwaczne sposoby.  \n\nFABUŁA \nZaczynając grę, pojawiamy się w tajemniczym miejscu, które z początku sprawia wrażenie futurystycznego wiezięnia(tak odczułem to ja). Od naszych pierwszych postawionych kroków towarzyszy nam głos, który po części pomaga nam odnaleźć się w tym otoczeniu. Gra ma kilkanaście poziomów, które sprytnie podzielono na pomieszczenia, a w każdym z nich czekają na nas coraz trudniejsze zagadki. Wraz z posuwaniem się do przodu odkrywamy jednak - po części przez wspomniany wcześniej głos - że coś tu nie gra...Fabuła jest naprawdę niecodzienna, im dalej jesteśmy w grze, tym bardziej chcemy dowiedzieć się co nas czeka za rogiem co tylko napędza naszą chęć do dalszej gry. Kilka momentów naprawdę może utknąć nam w pamięci i za to należy się twórcom wielki plus. \n\nROZGRYWKA \nJeśli chodzi o pomysły rozgrywki zastosowane w grze, największą zaletą jest Portal Gun, o którym słyszeli nawet Ci, którzy nigdy nie grali w Portal. To przede wszystkim dzięki niemu rozwiązujemy większość zagadek lub po prostu się nim bawimy. Mówiąc o rozgrywce, należy również wspomnieć o zastosowaniu praw fizycznych - znaczna część zagadek opiera się głównie na zabawie z grawitacją czy prędkością.  \n\nGRAFIKA \nGrafika tak naprawdę ma tutaj niewielkie znaczenie. Każde z pomieszczeń wygląda bardzo podobnie i mimo upływu ponad 7 lat nie mam jej nic większego do zarzucenia. Wszystko co mogłoby być upiększone, zostało upiększone w sequelu.  \nDŹWIĘK \nOprawa muzyczna nie jest szczególnie bogata w dźwięki, lecz nie jest też wykonana byle jak. Po prostu jest taka, jaka powinna być w tego typu grze, dobrze wprowadza nas w klimat tej gry. \n\nOSIĄGNIĘCIA \nI tutaj grzechem jest nie wspomnieć o wyzwaniach poza główną fabułą gry. Samą grę ukończyłem w około 4 godziny, natomiast zdobycie wszystkich osiągnięć zajęło mi około 12 godzin gry. Wniosek? 3 osiągnięcia zajmują mniej więcej tyle czasu niż przejście fabuły i zdobycie 12 pozostałych osiągnięć. Te pozostałe nie są już tak trudne, są dosyć przyjemne a połowę z nich zdobywamy podczas przejścia gry.\n \nPODSUMOWANIE \nPortal to nietypowa gra logiczna, z naprawdę ciekawą fabułą, w której twórcy idealnie zastosowali wrażenie, że jesteśmy królikiem doświadczalnym jakiejś wielkiej maszynerii. Grze tak naprawdę nie mam nic większego do zarzucenia, ocena w większości pochodzi stąd, iż nie przepadam za grami z tego gatunku, ale jeśli ktoś uwielbia gry logiczne, będzie miał bardzo miłe wspomnienia po ukończeniu jej. \n\n\nNA PLUS: \n- zastosowanie Portal Guna \n-naprawdę wciągająca fabuła \n-fantastyczne zakończenie(cake!) \n\nNA MINUS: \ncałkowita liniowość \n \n \nOCENA: 7.4/10","timestamp_created":1426176670,"timestamp_updated":1426176738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14851002","author":{"steamid":"76561198138941096","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1429217468},"language":"swedish","review":"A bit short but really fun and a pretty great story!","timestamp_created":1426170236,"timestamp_updated":1426170236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14842968","author":{"steamid":"76561198132323237","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":68,"last_played":1546805518},"language":"english","review":"i hat playing this game it's too hard and i dont even care for the extra levels.","timestamp_created":1426107939,"timestamp_updated":1426107939,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.337194770574569702","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14836813","author":{"steamid":"76561198130096332","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1598745642},"language":"russian","review":"Игра хорошая жалоб нет","timestamp_created":1426079460,"timestamp_updated":1426079460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14836286","author":{"steamid":"76561198111454200","num_games_owned":437,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1648914947},"language":"english","review":"Loved this on Xbox 360.
