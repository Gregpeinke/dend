This game is hands down one of my favorite single player experiences on the PC.\n\nThis game is a beautiful gaming experience; it is an amazing sci-fi puzzle game with a wonderfully written story. I think that any one can enjoy this game, whether or not they played the first game. The first game would help in terms of immediately understanding the characters and gameplay mechanics, but it is not necessary.","timestamp_created":1318282354,"timestamp_updated":1398222795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1889190","author":{"steamid":"76561197999350560","num_games_owned":403,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":2609,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2460,"last_played":1369265971},"language":"english","review":"Simply amazing...
