review contains spoilers*\n\nBioshock Infinite is a largely praised game (just look at the amount of positive reviews), but in my opinion is mostly just overhyped and is given too much credit for an attempt at mature storytelling; a failed attempt at that.\n\nNow, I wouldn't say that Bioshock 1 and 2 had the deepest, most compelling stories ever but they made sense and they worked. The first two Bioshock games also had the benefit of good atmosphere and fun gameplay, with a variety of ways a player could tackle a fight. I enjoyed both and would recommend them highly.\n\nInfinite, on the other hand, turned out to be very disappointing. I was expecting something great after constantly hearing how amazing the game was. But I played the entire thing and was never really impressed. First, the gameplay. Especially compared to the other games, it was boring. The limit of two guns plus the lack of weapon variety was an awful choice. Hacking is replaced with a temporary vigor, and lockpicking is Elizabeth's domain. You just get to scrounge up the picks. Exploration is limited. You still have to buy upgrades for your weapons, one by one. The sky rails could have been interesting, if they were implemented better. Vigors in the game needed more variety as well, but at least you could have more than two. Combat is pretty easy, and the enemies also lack variety and intelligence. You don't have a chance to set up anything before engaging in battle. The choices given to you are very superficial, and honestly don't have much of an impact. Sometimes all the combat and gameplay just felt like filler in between cut scenes. Why is the third game in the series so much more limiting than the first?\n\nThe story is hailed to high heaven, but even that was poorly executed. Characters weren't believable. Story events made little sense. I once saw someone describe Booker as having video game amnesia. As in, he doesn't recall anything at first merely because it's convenient for the story that way. They attempted to touch on mature topics, mostly racism, but didn't manage to do so with any depth or flair. It's shallow. And doesn't go anywhere with these topics. We get that racism is bad. If you're going to make it a topic in your game, maybe it should be done with more nuance than LOOK RACISM BAD in a really hamfisted way.\n\nAnd the worst part was they included time travel and multiverses. Both are really difficult to implement in a way that makes sense within the story, and it's usually best just to avoid using them altogether. I wish Infinite had avoided them. It was a cheap attempt at depth, and it's pseudo-intellectual. It's own attempts at explaining story events doesn't work. Like, you're told that there are infinite worlds and yet killing one Booker in one world prevents Comstock from ever existing in any world? How, unless that world is the sole birthplace of every other world and every other timeline? Elizabeth would have to kill every Booker in every world forever. Plus, there's the grandfather paradox, and the 'it was you all along' trope. I won't say much more, but matthewmatosis managed to lay out most of the problems I had if you want to check that out.\n\nI feel like Infinite was written by someone who wanted there to be specific scenes and specific events, but was unable to write the story in a way that allowed these to make sense and come together seamlessly. So they resorted to time travel and multi-worlds to give the game a veneer of intellectualism and cover for it's weak points. It relies on deus ex machinas and contrived occurances. It resulted in an ending that did not feel satisfying. It sounds good on the surface, but falls apart when examined. \n\nI get why people want to like it. It pretended to be a mature story during a time where video games are considered childish. It covered touchy topics. It has a spunky female character. It tries to tug on your emotions. It gave itself a crazy setting (city in the sky). But all of these were just fluff. Flashy without substance.\n\nI wanted so bad to like this game.

It seems complicated, but they made it overcomplicated for the 'wow' effect. I finished the game once, and I just cannot seem to install it again.
