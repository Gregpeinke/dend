Portal has no life in it at all, and no one else in the game at all (the only enemies you will see are the turrets which are only in very few segments). You can't even see the sky, you are completely trapped and deprived  in a colourless building which is why the companion cube, turrets and glados are so memorable because they are the only things you are exposed to in the entire game. Now if this was not done the right way, Portal could have been a very boring game, but since the innovation of the portals and glados and all the other highlights are added in, those things are going to get full attention from the player since nothing else is in focus since everything else is so bleak, which also why the escape sequence is so much fun, because you want to get out of this place and back outside That is fucking genius!!!
