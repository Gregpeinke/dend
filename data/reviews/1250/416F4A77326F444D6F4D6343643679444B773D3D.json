After deleting killing floor and reinstalling it the crashes stop but now I can't filter servers anymore. It doesn't matter what filters I try to put in place because it completely ignores these settings. I am running killing floor on a mac and despite enjoying the game itself I personally won't recommend this game to others because of the many difficulties i have faced and the solutions I found online weren't very helpful either.","timestamp_created":1405651934,"timestamp_updated":1405752637,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11297084","author":{"steamid":"76561198084945187","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":27213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1579387004},"language":"spanish","review":"bastante bueno","timestamp_created":1405648256,"timestamp_updated":1405648256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11296632","author":{"steamid":"76561198036085024","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5352,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4525,"last_played":1500604021},"language":"english","review":"I played alot of Killing floor and most of all, i love it because of the bad***s sound track and of course the reason it is the best zombie game","timestamp_created":1405645355,"timestamp_updated":1405645355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11296330","author":{"steamid":"76561198075466648","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1559530501},"language":"english","review":"i bought this game because it was on sale, and it was worth it. this is one of the games i had the most fun playing.\n\noverall: 10/10","timestamp_created":1405643486,"timestamp_updated":1405643486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11296299","author":{"steamid":"76561198055830815","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1066,"last_played":1398350115},"language":"english","review":"Bloody fantastic.","timestamp_created":1405643211,"timestamp_updated":1405643211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11296298","author":{"steamid":"76561198042666009","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":331,"last_played":1530493179},"language":"english","review":"Uno de los mejores shooters PvE que jugué en mi vida!!

It looks grimy and dingy due to the theme so the graphics still hold up ok. The community is fairly supportive and creates enough user made content to be interesting even now.\nHowever and i cannot stress this enough, the reason i cannot recommend this game is the technical aspect. \nThe creaters of this game give absolutly no shits about the thousands of users who suffer constant crashes due to their awful programming skills. Go to the steam forrums and see what you find. since 2009 report after report of the SAME game breaking glitch has been reported and Tripwire has done NOTHING. So if your a whiz at going to your steam directory and sorting out which specific file is causing the problem go ahead and buy this game, otherwise? Stay the hell away from killing floor. Its not worth the screen punching lvl of frustration you get from playing a match all the way to the 10th wave only to have your game crash.\nSorry for any spelling errors, my keyboard is dying.","timestamp_created":1405547972,"timestamp_updated":1405547972,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2oDMoMcCd6yDKw=="}
