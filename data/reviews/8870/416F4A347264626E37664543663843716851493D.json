Наконец-то ваш персонаж начнет говорить. Наиболее приятный геймплей, ЛУЧШИЙ сюжет среди всех трех частей. Больше стало больших открытых и ярких локаций. Геймплей стал динамичнее. Аэротрассы - приятный способ передвижения. Теперь у вас есть компаньон, который вам время от времени подбрасывает патроны, аптечку или соли, необходимые для использования энергетиков. Концовка просто неожиданная, приятно и неприятно удивляет. Интересные персонажи, у каждого из них своя история, чего только стоят одни близнецы Лютэс. Русской озвучки нет, есть субтитры, но можно накатить с интернета, как и в случае с прошлыми частями. Отдельного упоминания стоят дополнения: \"Битва в облаках\" - режим, где вы зачищаете территорию от врагов, параллельно(по желанию) выполняя задания \"Голубой ленты\", которые усложняют игру, но дают дополнительную денежную награду, есть 4 локации, и в каждой по 15 волн. Деньги, полученные в этом режиме можно обменять на предметы в зале славы, в котором вы сможете услышать музыку из игры, некоторые процессы создания разных сцен, введенные и невведенные в игру модельки персонажей, а также, когда заполните весь зал, вам откроется \"разрыв\", войдя в который вы попадаете в дом, по которому разбросаны голософоны, прослушав которые, вы узнаете немного больше об истории Колумбии - города в облаках, в котором происходят действия основной игры. Дополнение \"Морская могила\" переносит вас в подводный город \"Восторг\" из первых двух частей и делится на два эпизода, которые, я считаю, обязательны к прохождению. Первый эпизод - это лишь завязка для более длинного второго, который свяжет события этой игры с первой частью, опять таки даже здесь будут неожиданные сюжетные повороты. Здесь присутствует тот же дизайн локаций, что и в первых играх. Стоит отметить, во втором эпизоде вы будете играть уже не за главного протагониста игры, а за Элизабет - его \"союзника\", и так как вы физически слабее, вы просто не сможете брать пушку в руки и зачищать локацию, придется дейтсвовать скрытно. Настоятельно рекомендую покупать весь пак из трех игр, так как это потрясающие истории подводного и воздушного городов.\nP.S.

However, three factors prohibit my recommending it:\n\n1. The gameplay. It's not bad, the skyrails are super fun, but the combat which takes up what parts of the game aren't just a glorified walking simulator is simplistic at best. You're limited to two guns at a time when my previous exposure to FPSes (DOOM 2016) allowed you a whole arsenal. This gets fairly frustrating when you have tons of revolver ammo and there aren't any freaking revolvers around and the sniper rifle you thought would be so much fun to try out keeps running out of ammo. There's an emphasis on using Vigors to supplement your combat style, but I managed to get through most of the game without even bothering; it felt mostly like a formality.\n\n2. The length. There's challenge modes and collectibles aplenty, but any game in which I can plow through the entire thing in only eight hours seems kind of enemic. Granted, this was on Normal difficulty, but I've established to my satisfaction what a dying Confederate looks like and I see no reason to play through it again.\n\n3. The story. Holy crap, this story is PRETENTIOUS. It thinks it's so meaningful, so profound, with its messages, but they all boil down to \"racism is bad, war is bad, and people who fight wars are bad.\" For such an elaborate game to have such a simplistic view of the world is... well, for what the game was building up to, I was left extremely underwhelmed. The ending is particularly egregious here, an absolutely ridiculous and confused mashup of pseudointellectual nonsense and pretention that climaxes in a twist that makes absolutely no sense to me.\n\nAll in all, while Infinite did a lot of things right and had good enough gameplay to kill the time, I come away feeling more negative towards it than otherwise. If you come here for fun combat, tons of other games like Far Cry have this beat, and if you come here for the story, read a damn book.","timestamp_created":1588799017,"timestamp_updated":1588799017,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60229027271270752","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68690964","author":{"steamid":"76561199021493411","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1496,"last_played":1628957494},"language":"english","review":"A pice of ART!!!!!!\n","timestamp_created":1588792602,"timestamp_updated":1588792602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501510560512542725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68690933","author":{"steamid":"76561198077187769","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1588792532},"language":"russian","review":"Всё ещё шикарно!","timestamp_created":1588792568,"timestamp_updated":1588792568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578490197658538818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68688319","author":{"steamid":"76561198104407145","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27,"last_played":1633279699},"language":"english","review":"Если вы поборник логики и материализма и пришли сюда за сюжетом, спешу вас разочаровать.

game hurts so good. Would you kindly bring me tissues so I can wipe these two waterfalls attached to my face? The story of the whole series is great. I know there is a divide in the players when it is about the gameplays of the Bioshock games. I love them all from different perspectives. Infinite's story is where it shines. As someone who's had issues with their parents while growing up and still, I always get goosebumps thinking about parallels I could draw between Elisabeth and Booker, and myself and my parents. This game did help me realize that whatever they do, your parents are still humans who make mistakes and be ashamed of them. Humans who fear facing those mistakes. When I played the game back then, I still hadn't forgiven my parents' mistakes. I realized that forgiveness is not for the person receiving it, but rather the person granting it. The fact that Booker accepts death in the end for his daughter was what had opened my eyes. Except from extreme cases that include cults and paraphilias, your parents are there for you until they die.

Before I bought this game, I had always wanted to play this game for myself but due some of the negative things I had heard regarding this game, I did not buy it. However, when I saw this game go on sale with the rest of the other games, on a whim, I bought this game and gave it a try. In all honesty, this game was one of the best singleplayer experiences I have ever had the privilege to enjoy. It was so addicting and fun that I even dedicated my entire weekend to finishing this game, which is something that rarely do as games in recent years have not gotten me as hooked as this game has. From the tense and well written story to the loveable characters that you play as or meet within this game, this game nails everything perfectly. Besides the story and characters, the music, graphics, sounds, gameplay, and much, much more were all fitting, fun, and spectacular. While there were very (and i can not stress this enough) VERY few flaws/glitches that I encountered through my 2 playthroughs of this game, the pros that I have mentioned far outweigh any of the miniscule problems that I had with this game. And if the current price tag on this game puts you off, nearly every sale the entire Bioshock collection, including this game, goes on sale for about $10-15 (I forgot how much I got them for, sorry).\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 9/10. Thank you for reading this small, little rant and I hope you buy this game.

third installment in the BioShock series departs from the dark and gloomy deeps of the sea and instead transports the player to the vibrantly colorful flying city of Columbia.  You'll play as Booker DeWitt who meets the innocent Elizabeth and unravel the beautifully intricate story of BioShock Infinite.\n\nPros:\n\n\tStory: First and foremost the story is phenomenal.  It's deep and intricate but most importantly there are multiple hugely memorable moments and revelations.  I can't overstate how enthralling the story is and how attached you become to characters.\n\tColor: The color pallet is beautiful and vibrant.  There are points where you will stop and look at the world and think you're looking at a piece of art.  This game is a work of art.  Seeing environments change from peaceful to war torn has a dramatic effect.\n\tImmersion: The world feels alive and walking down the street one can see there is a story written not only on the signs and walls but in the people and a dark truth behind the beauty.  \n\tEmotional Attachment: Elizabeth may be the best part of the entire game.  There is so much to discover about her and seeing her interactions to the world around you builds a bond.  You will care about her more than you've cared about any character before.\n\tMemorable Moments: There are some really shocking revelations that come to pass in this game and you'll contemplate your actions and re-examine the entire game.\n\nCons:\n\n\tNot really a con but seeing what the rail system was and the potential it had really makes me wish they could have included it in the game.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\tVery few games can illicit an emotional attachment and response to events but BioShock Infinite does it masterfully.  This is one of those must play games and I highly recommend this and the DLC to everyone.  The DLC is a must as well. It brings the BioShock universe story full circle and becomes integral once you've played through it and has just as shocking revelations and moments as the base game.  \n\nScore: 10 / 10","timestamp_created":1588644977,"timestamp_updated":1588644977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68587892","author":{"steamid":"76561198061920393","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1588644719},"language":"english","review":"Its Bioshock one of the greatest games ever made","timestamp_created":1588644951,"timestamp_updated":1588644951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68586333","author":{"steamid":"76561198448478021","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1588649596},"language":"latam","review":"Buena historia, personajes interesantes.
