sahiden de oynanması gerek bir oyun.

DLC'ler ile birlikte muazzam bir hikayeye sahip olduğunu benim için bir kez daha kanıtlamış oldu. Oynayış açısından da oldukça zevk aldım. Herkese şiddetle öneririm. \n\nOyunun aynı zamanda kitabı da mevcuttur: BioShock Rapture Şehri diye. İlk iki oyunu bitirdikten sonra okumanızı öneririm. Ardından Bioshock Infinite ve Burial At Sea DLC'lerini oynayın. Kitap ile birlikte benim için gerçekten harika bir oyun deneyimi oldu.","timestamp_created":1577626927,"timestamp_updated":1577626927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547236382961273193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60834885","author":{"steamid":"76561198099508279","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":741,"last_played":1577626410},"language":"schinese","review":"我杀我自己？","timestamp_created":1577626852,"timestamp_updated":1577626852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60833591","author":{"steamid":"76561198799882741","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1014,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":999,"last_played":1588725057},"language":"english","review":"Highest Graphics in low end pc wow.","timestamp_created":1577625737,"timestamp_updated":1577625737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501947164535522461","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60831945","author":{"steamid":"76561198416148624","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":423,"last_played":1578583963},"language":"koreana","review":"게임을 벗어난 게임","timestamp_created":1577624236,"timestamp_updated":1577624236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60831339","author":{"steamid":"76561198141936783","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1134,"last_played":1577623457},"language":"schinese","review":"伊丽莎白，你甚至都还没真正的去过巴黎····","timestamp_created":1577623677,"timestamp_updated":1577623677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60829476","author":{"steamid":"76561198063705908","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":887,"last_played":1580900243},"language":"english","review":"A compelling and great story with an adorable companion to go along with you.\nDecent gameplay yet very satisfying and a gorgeous looking game.\n\nOverall, very enjoyable and fun to play.","timestamp_created":1577621978,"timestamp_updated":1577621978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550974547863006592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60827495","author":{"steamid":"76561197995219130","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":120,"last_played":1579879976},"language":"russian","review":"Игра балдёжная, ничего не скажешь автору очень много лет.","timestamp_created":1577619956,"timestamp_updated":1577619956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495898604393005371","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60827108","author":{"steamid":"76561198910342001","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1204,"last_played":1577369013},"language":"german","review":"Ich finde dieses Spiel unglaublich gut. Die Welt ist fantastisch aufgebaut und die Storyline finde ich ebenfalls sehr sehr gut. Die Ausrüstungen die man im Spiel findet haben wirklich gute Funktionen und auch die Tatsache, dass man zwischen sehr vielen Waffen wählen und switchen kann gefällt mir persönlich auch gut. Im Spielen kann man sich ebenfalls Booster für die Waffen holen und auch für die Kräfte die man im verlauf des Spiels findet. Mir hat das spiel wirklich Spaß gemacht und ich glaube ich werde es ein weiteres mal spielen um zu versuchen alles zu finden was ich beim ersten mal übersehen habe. Ich kann es jedem nur empfehlen :)","timestamp_created":1577619568,"timestamp_updated":1577619568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60825380","author":{"steamid":"76561198088840972","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3299,"last_played":1601821382},"language":"english","review":"Nice.","timestamp_created":1577617703,"timestamp_updated":1577617703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495898604393005371","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60824186","author":{"steamid":"76561198404360237","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":855,"last_played":1647876277},"language":"spanish","review":"Tras seis años de su salida y jugarlo por primera vez puedo decir que es una OBRA MAESTRA, tal vez para más de uno el final es un poco difícil de digerir, pero una vez lo entiendes y conectas todo puedes decir de que el juego cierra de forma magistral.
