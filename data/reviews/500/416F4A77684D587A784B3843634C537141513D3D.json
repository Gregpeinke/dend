The game originated out of Valve designers recognizing the fun of defeating melee-only enemies by way of  ranged weapons. To maintain a challenge, Valve added special enemies that work to seperate you from your friends.  Certainly a very gore-filled game, but also very rewarding play and a solid story. If you're one of those people who groans and/or screams at the movie characters \"Don't go in there, the zombies are in there!\" or \"Don't seperate, they're waiting for you to be alone!\" or \"Don't have a shower now, the zombies are coming!\" tis game was made for you. Now you can re-enact those moments, except YOU will be going into the room while your friends scream at you while being eaten by the zombie hordes. This game is worth it, even if it's jsut to show you how big a hypocrite you are. Enjoy, and turn your flashlights off.","timestamp_created":1309974540,"timestamp_updated":1385414354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4067055","author":{"steamid":"76561198031554294","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":158085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":103490,"last_played":1606794685},"language":"english","review":"AWSUM PAWSUM LOL","timestamp_created":1309974177,"timestamp_updated":1309974177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2726012","author":{"steamid":"76561198011689607","num_games_owned":343,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":793,"last_played":1341385200},"language":"french","review":"Mythique...","timestamp_created":1309958319,"timestamp_updated":1385405667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3727201","author":{"steamid":"76561198026648463","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":628,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"I used to hate zombies, but this game actually makes zombies fun!\n\nIt's a crazy and entertaining shooter.

Despite the game only having 6 campaigns and a handful of survival levels + the fact the player base is weak as of late I still find myself coming back and replaying the same campaigns for the 40th time now with the same people on Expert which is now my Normal difficulty. I use the same guns, play the same maps, shoot the same zombies, and yet I find myself playing L4D at least once a day. It's strange because I don't like L4D2 as much as I do L4D1, I'll play L4D2 with friends occasionally but that will just make me want to come back to L4D1 even more so. Something about L4D1 keeps luring me back and I find myself playing again and again without giving it a second thought. Whatever Turtle Rock did they did right, even after Valve took over and changed many aspects, TRS still managed to show through and show how amazing L4D1 was/is.\n\nRecently I've gotten into modding several aspects of the game including the infected and werid as it sounds that's what I sometimes think of when glancing at people, how they could look as an infected in L4D. It sounds obsessive and probably weird but it's just a random passing thought that crosses me and it makes me want to play even more. It's what made me realize that this game is one of my favorites of all time and why I will continue to play and mod it.\n\nDo yourself a favor, screw the people who say just play L4D2 since it has L4D1 stuff in it, screw the people who say L4D2 is superior and should be played over L4D1, screw the fact that L4D1 is an old game and has less players. Even if you don't think you'll ever play L4D1 since you have L4D2, buy it anyway, it's clear how much we lost when Valve took over L4D2 and made it without Turtle Rock Studios. If you have never played L4D1 or have only played it in L4D2 you are missing out on an entire experience with soul, something L4D2 can't offer.\n\nMaybe all of this is just a temporary thing, maybe I'll have a new favorite game in a day or week or even month but right now L4D is a major part of what I play and I don't think that will ever change.\n\n-------------------------\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis game is excellent, Its fun, good grapchics and escellent maps and characters.
