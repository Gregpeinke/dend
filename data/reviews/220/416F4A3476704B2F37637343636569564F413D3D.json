Cut scenes are in-game so you're never taken out of the action for long and every chapter of the game runs smoothly into the next. Many games will make you feel that you are only taking a small part in the action. They make you feel that you are spectator or a visitor who is just along for the ride. With Half-Life 2, Valve does their best to do away with this feeling. You become Gordon Freeman. And while the rest of those who resist the Combine look to Dr Freeman as their light in the darkness, you never feel like an over-powered demi-god. The odds that stand before you seem just as insurmountable to you and they would to anyone else. And yet, you press on fueled only by a small glimmer of hope and your sense of adventure.\n\nAdd in:\n+Physics Based Puzzles\n+Unique and Mysterious Story\n+Stunning Visuals Provided by the Source Engine\n\nAnd you've got the making of an unforgettable gaming experience.

Half-Life 2 spawned the demand for a sequel like nothing in any form of media has ever done before. An amazing game, with Physics and Graphics ahead of its time, and the occasional puzzle to think over. It really combines elements of an FPS with puzzles and story. A must have for any Gamer.","timestamp_created":1425898449,"timestamp_updated":1425898449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14805432","author":{"steamid":"76561198089879071","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":134,"last_played":1374204958},"language":"russian","review":"VOLVO!!GIVE HALF LIFE 3)))))))","timestamp_created":1425887715,"timestamp_updated":1425887715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14805047","author":{"steamid":"76561198095430313","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":4565,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4565,"last_played":1652825340},"language":"russian","review":"я бежал в меня стреляли","timestamp_created":1425884422,"timestamp_updated":1652976533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14802194","author":{"steamid":"76561198023143265","num_games_owned":575,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1425777049},"language":"english","review":"An awesome Sci-fi/Horror FPS that greatly builds upon the Half-Life mythos. The Gravity Gun and Physics are really put on display here, and afre very fun to use. The Level design is well done, but the sound design isn't unfortuneately. Don't get me wrong, this game has a really awesome soundtrack, but the sound effects leave something to be desired. Most of this comes from the overuse of stock sound effects, I understand when a small studio resorts to stock sound effects, but it is suprising coming from Valve. Second is the gun sounds, for the most part they are fine, but the regular pistol sounds a tad pathetic, as well do the stand-alone MG turrets. The reload sound for the Shotgun sounds like someone flicking a rubber band, which is bizzare.\n\nOverall an impressive game! This was my first time playing it, over 10 years after it was released, and it still holds up.","timestamp_created":1425860024,"timestamp_updated":1425860024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14801952","author":{"steamid":"76561198154805286","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2150,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":932,"last_played":1646847898},"language":"portuguese","review":"half life 2 e muito bom mesmo\n","timestamp_created":1425858451,"timestamp_updated":1425858451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14800857","author":{"steamid":"76561198118952738","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":728,"last_played":1404135130},"language":"russian","review":"За всю игру его били по ебалу шокером, стреляли в лицо, ели мутанты и при этом он не сказал ни одного слова. 10 Фрименов из 10","timestamp_created":1425852621,"timestamp_updated":1425852621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14800688","author":{"steamid":"76561198114067637","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1500315081},"language":"english","review":"\"What's a 3?\"\n\n-Cosmo; Fairly OddParents","timestamp_created":1425851782,"timestamp_updated":1425851782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14800255","author":{"steamid":"76561198112294917","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":506,"last_played":1426513098},"language":"english","review":"Fun old game, the storys fun worth the money tbh!!!","timestamp_created":1425849838,"timestamp_updated":1425849838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14799604","author":{"steamid":"76561198174981522","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":529,"last_played":1427824386},"language":"english","review":"Very fun game....But the Ai is very stupid ;)","timestamp_created":1425846931,"timestamp_updated":1425846931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14797156","author":{"steamid":"76561198135979047","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":554,"last_played":1553864143},"language":"russian","review":"5/5 выпусти 3 плз","timestamp_created":1425837337,"timestamp_updated":1425837337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14797094","author":{"steamid":"76561198006649064","num_games_owned":440,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":3141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2566,"last_played":1622770353},"language":"english","review":"...","timestamp_created":1425837054,"timestamp_updated":1425837054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14797043","author":{"steamid":"76561198087650317","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":620,"last_played":1602475043},"language":"english","review":"This was a GREAT sequel, almost better than the first.
