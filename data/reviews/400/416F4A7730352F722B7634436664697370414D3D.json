Man findet sich als eine Art Versuchskaninchen wieder und muss mit seiner \"Waffe\" Portale erschaffen. Sind die Level anfangs noch sehr einfach, steigt der Schwierigkeitsgrad nach und nach an, so dass es teilweise geradezu frustrierend sein kann - aber die Genugtuung, das Level dann geschafft zu haben, ist einfach riesig (ich bin gerade mal bei Testlevel 15 und finde das schon teilweise echt haarstr√§ubend). Dennoch ist das Spielprinzip innovativ, der Humor genial, die Sprachumsetzung toll und das ganze Deisgn der Levels liebevoll und geradezu s√º√ü gemacht.\n\nDas alles, besonders im Sale f√ºr knapp 4 Euro ist auf jeden Fall einen Blick wert. <3\n\n5 von 5 Sternen.

The main antagonist is hilarious and the story is unique. I recommend.\n\nLong review:\n\nI have poured my life and soul into this game to try and get more out of it. It's wonderful. From the beginning of the game to the last moment, you're solving puzzles that actually require you to use your brain and think from different angles how to work yourself out of a situation. Not only that, but the teaching to learn the mechanics through the puzzles is wonderfully executed and beautifully eased into the storyline.\nThe story itself slowly presents itself through the game and the environment around. You have to really look for the details of the story of Aperture and use that brain to piece them together, like a puzzle. But trust me when I say it's worth scouring every nook and cranny for the hidden bits of story and lore.\nThe character[s] are very unique with how they are presented and portrayed. [spoiler] The main antagonist, GLaDOS, is first shown as an ominous voice with no body coaching you through the puzzles. When she's finally revealed, it is shown she is a massive and complex piece of work, and she has many funny dialogue lines (my personal favorite being \"Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee [bzzt]\"). [/spoiler] The turrets are a main side character that don't aid the plot all to much in the first Portal game, but are very significant in the second. I still like to listen to them talk, though, and I try to piece a story together for them in my free time just to make them seem less mechanical and ready-to-kill.\nThe graphics are amazing for a game released in 2007 and even though it's 2022, it's better than other games that I have. Don't worry about your device overheating; despite the good graphics and portal mechanics, Valve has done an amazing job at keeping things simple enough so I could run this game first on a five year old laptop that struggles to run a painting program. Rest assured your device won't explode.\nThe music is nice. Nothing too notable about it. It fits the atmosphere and provides great background noise while you venture through the testing chambers. My favorite song, though, has to be Still Alive. [spoiler] It's the final song played in the game once you beat it. I find the sarcastic and snarky comments GLaDOS makes in it to be very funny, [/spoiler] and it even encouraged me to learn it on the piano (which I did!).\nI cannot for the life of me promote this game enough to you. It's worth the money ten times over, and has amazing replayability value if you want to go back through it ten, twelve, twenty times even. I know I've played through it a lot.\nAnd if you're checking out this game and considering purchasing Portal 2, DO IT! Portal 2 is an amazing continuation of Portal that doesn't require this game to be played to pick up the newer version (I do recommend playing this first before Portal 2, but it's entirely optional). \nAll in all, a fabulous game with a fabulous production team making this game a 9/10.\nThe only problems are that some of the puzzles are a bit too difficult and the portals can be tricky, but this all goes away with practice or getting help from some of the community guides.","timestamp_created":1644876114,"timestamp_updated":1644876114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110253477","author":{"steamid":"76561198391854772","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1644872977},"language":"brazilian","review":"Simplesmente incr√≠vel, valeu cada centavo!
