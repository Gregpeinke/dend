You have to solve a variety of puzzles using just your wits and your portals - this game may be based on the game engine of a first person shooter (Hlf-Life), but it definitely falls into the puzzle genre. \n\nThere is no soundtrack and the strictly minimalist setting has little in the way of eye candy. As for the storyline, your silent protagonist interacts with only one other character, an insane computer that also serves as the game's antagonist. The computer sometimes has witty remarks that keep the game from getting stale, but don't expect to be wowed by the plot, or the rather underwhelming ending. \n\nI enjoyed the first half of the game and felt the difficulty level was about right. However, after a certain event midway through the game the difficulty level ramps up significantly, and although there is no penalty for dying I will say my frustration level increased dramatically in the second half of the game. I was actually relieved when I unexpededly stumbled upon the final boss because it meant my tedious plodding through the second half of the game was finally at an end.\n\nIf you like puzzle games get this if it's $5 or less.","timestamp_created":1367893950,"timestamp_updated":1367893950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6635725","author":{"steamid":"76561198071073278","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":179,"last_played":1470238972},"language":"english","review":"The Apeture Sciences Board of Directors would like to remind you that your contributions to the scientific community made by buying and playing this game will far outweigh the possible risks, including but not limited to excrutiating pain, exsaperation, and possible death.","timestamp_created":1367871513,"timestamp_updated":1367871513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4220124","author":{"steamid":"76561198034094679","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":316,"last_played":1417970607},"language":"russian","review":"Экшен - головоломка с запоминающимся главным злодеем (т.е., извините, злодейкой), толковым юмором и довольно самобытной атмосферой.

A short and sweet campaign, various challenge maps that are actually challenging lol, and the ability to download custom made maps from the community.\n\n+Short\n+Cheap and probably less than $3 on sale\n+Entertaining short and sweet campaign that imo wasn’t that challenging aka I didn’t have to look up majority of the levels in order to progress and i’m dumb\n+You can quick save mid levels and quick load which is incredibly helpful\n+Funny dialogue\n+Boss fight\n+More than just a puzzle game\n+Several challenge maps that are actually difficult \n+This game has a lot of assets from Half-Life 2 which you can spawn with console commands which can be pretty funny as you can also play through the entire Half-Life 2 campaign as well if you do some additional steps\n+Cheats\n+Level select\n+Level editor and ability to download others maps. Note that this game is pretty old so you have to download the maps elsewhere\n\n-I didn’t get any cake\n-No full controller support not a big deal but, would’ve been nice\n-This game states that it has remote play, however, it does not. There are no co-op and or online multiplayer features to this game whatsoever therefore remote play obviously won’t work. Various Valve games for no reason have a remote play feature said to be in the game yet like I said this game has no local co-op features whatsoever.\n\nHonestly can’t even think of any cons for this game, it's just that perfect. It’s so simple but amazing in the same sense. Definitely worth trying if you haven’t already you’re missing out.
