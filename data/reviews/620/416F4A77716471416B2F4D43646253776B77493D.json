This game held my interest until i was about 80 percent through. The story just wasn't very good, and the humor got a little repetitive although it still made me chuckle here and there.  The characters and setting was just very shallow and not really explained that well it seems like the plot was concocted to have an excuse for you to solve puzzles. The half life games had the illusion of freedom even though the game is very linear. There is no illusion in portal 2 as you are very much on rails the entire time, the game is at its best when they take the wheels off and you escape the lab  in chapter 6 which was one of the highlights and breaks up the monotony which could be a bit tedious during long playthroughs. They do keep the game interesting by adding new gameplay challenges although the slow pacing started to wear me down towards the end. It wasn't really an addicting game for me and i got kind of tired after about a week of playing and cheated a little to look up some of the puzzles at the end. They weren't unsolvable but they are definitely above average difficulty in my opinion and will take you much longer to finish on your own. I'm dumb and impatient so this game wasn't my cup of tea however i can respect its excellence in craft and level design.  One of the best soundtrack in a game period. Overall 7/10 for the solo campaign. I did not try co-op but i feel you can up the rating to 8 as it looks pretty fun and quite unique.","timestamp_created":1594093768,"timestamp_updated":1594094562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72205078","author":{"steamid":"76561198159998069","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2473,"last_played":1593998622},"language":"english","review":"its portal its amazing thats it\n","timestamp_created":1594093734,"timestamp_updated":1594093734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72204157","author":{"steamid":"76561198978809023","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":236,"last_played":1619169355},"language":"koreana","review":"","timestamp_created":1594092403,"timestamp_updated":1594092403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72203635","author":{"steamid":"76561198203145567","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":64,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1659520035},"language":"english","review":"Very scrumptiously","timestamp_created":1594091624,"timestamp_updated":1594091624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72202837","author":{"steamid":"76561198821334284","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":812,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":314,"last_played":1659427395},"language":"english","review":"IT'S A GREAT GAME\n","timestamp_created":1594090465,"timestamp_updated":1594090465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72202508","author":{"steamid":"76561198984269035","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1596882286},"language":"english","review":"super fun if you can get both portal and portal 2","timestamp_created":1594089931,"timestamp_updated":1594089931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72202010","author":{"steamid":"76561198178277707","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1818,"last_played":1635609035},"language":"english","review":"noice","timestamp_created":1594089254,"timestamp_updated":1594089254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72201668","author":{"steamid":"76561198854538372","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":576,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":576,"last_played":1594082274},"language":"latam","review":"Alto juego para usar un toque el bocho y de paso tiene historia piola, si te lo compras con el portal bundle tas gucci","timestamp_created":1594088744,"timestamp_updated":1638154482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72201132","author":{"steamid":"76561199021887188","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":560,"last_played":1612669062},"language":"spanish","review":"El mejor juego para jugar con un amigo, en mi caso lo juego con mi novia y me encanta la química y el trabajo en equipo que logramos mientras jugamos <3","timestamp_created":1594087984,"timestamp_updated":1594087984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72200332","author":{"steamid":"76561198877407939","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":763,"last_played":1595444600},"language":"english","review":"The game very well made.
