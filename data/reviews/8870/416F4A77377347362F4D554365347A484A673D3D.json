The male twin hands you a box with a pistol, some ammunition, a cryptic message, and a picture of a young woman, before dropping you off at a lighthouse and rowing away. You decide to walk in the lighthouse, and climb your way to the lookout, where you see 3 bells. You ring them, opening up a door, revealing a seat in a small, condensed room. You take a seat, and are immediately thrown into the sky, higher and higher, until you're above the clouds, and find a city, just floating there.\n\nYou wander through a welcome center of sorts, and are forced into a Baptism before being allowed into the city. You wander for a short while, making your way into a carnival, and lucky you- you've just won the town lottery! Your prize? \n\nThrowing the first stone at the excecution of an interracial couple. But wait, your day gets better- Your right hand also has the markings of what the city's equivilent of the Antichrist. Oh, boy.\n\nThis is how BioShock Infinite starts, and the story only gets more interesting from there. The plot is quite a memorable one. Even though I finished the main story a month or so ago, I could probably tell you everything that happens. \n\nThe gameplay is not the strongest, I personally liked BioShock 1's combat best (The dual-weilding of Vigors / weapons bothers me from a realism standpoint) , but it works well enough to not be too repetitive. Some of the guns, like the machine gun, seem to lack a bit of punch, but the Vigors make up for that by looking just as devestating as they should look. \n\nThe setting is one of my favorites from any series, Columbia looks like people actually live there, and the political ideals of the citizens and government aren't over-the-top. Also, it's racist, and that's always fun. The world is quite deep, and everyone you pass seems to have something to say, having a conversation with their friends or family. \n\nThe characters are top-notch. Booker DeWitt has a voice, something new in BioShock, and rarely seen in FPS games nowadays, it seems. Booker's a great character, but as you've probably heard, Elizebeth is the real star of the game. She's one of the best NPCs in video games since Alyx Vance from Half-Life 2.\n\nOverall, BioShock Infinite is an absolutely fantastic game. But, I have to say, I think it's the weakest of the BioShock games. Make of that what you will.","timestamp_created":1400274633,"timestamp_updated":1404172733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548872172832489014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10140951","author":{"steamid":"76561198113012613","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1401841511},"language":"brazilian","review":"Foda Pra Karaleo !","timestamp_created":1400272688,"timestamp_updated":1400272688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10140538","author":{"steamid":"76561198108721173","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1402942365},"language":"russian","review":"nice!!!","timestamp_created":1400269744,"timestamp_updated":1400269744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10140107","author":{"steamid":"76561198040506736","num_games_owned":353,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":579,"last_played":1410464519},"language":"german","review":"10/10\n\nWould have a Mindfuck again.","timestamp_created":1400266994,"timestamp_updated":1400266994,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10139448","author":{"steamid":"76561198056891305","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":727,"last_played":1433066950},"language":"english","review":"WOW!","timestamp_created":1400262561,"timestamp_updated":1400262561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10139278","author":{"steamid":"76561197984117111","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1091,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":821,"last_played":1401703871},"language":"french","review":"super jeux d'aventure le scénario perfect je recommande","timestamp_created":1400261439,"timestamp_updated":1400261439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10138147","author":{"steamid":"76561198067838805","num_games_owned":334,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":504,"last_played":1400252199},"language":"english","review":"The best game i have ever played and it is the most emotional moment of my life too good to be a game it should be part of a movie absolute worth for life memory. ;

As plenty of others have said more than enough about it I will keep this review (relatively) brief.\n\nAs a history undergrad this game explores topics that I have an arguable understanding of and a genuine interest in. Throughout, the developers did an amazing job with the story, the setting, and the characterization. While clearly an alternative history narrative, the topics dealt with in [i]Bioshock Infinite[/i] were nonetheless historically [i]coherent[/i]. By this I mean that these topics were treated in a rigorous manner that did not depart from what we would expect, nor from what we have seen in (actual) history. In essence, Bioshock Infinite could be described as a fictional story but one which is based on true events.\n\nAnother aspect of the game that shown through was its attention to detail. In this regard, [i]Bioshock Infinite[/i] is second to none. As a comparative, [i]Deus Ex: Human Revolution[/i] is the only other game that may come close in this area. In a similar manner, of all the sequels I have played, [i]Bioshock Infinite[/i] is perhaps second only to [i]Portal 2[/i] in its apparent success of following a strong original game with an even stronger sequel. \n\nWhile this is the core of what I wanted to share about this game, below I will provide some tips for a more enjoyable experience (in response to some of the reviews that I have read here on Steam). Even further below that I will provide some arguably spoiler-level suggestions for a (perhaps) more successful experience in Colombia.\n\nUltimately, I strongly suggest that you consider purchasing and playing this game!\n\n[b][u]Tips for an Enjoyable Experience[/u][/b]\n\n[i]First[/i], follow the recommendations for choosing your difficulty at the start. If you play FPSs regularly, play at the hard difficulty. When in doubt, err on the harder side and dial it down if your needs be.\n\n[i]Second[/i], find a playstyle that you find enjoyable and rewarding. There is no point of playing the game by just spamming the skyhook system if you do not enjoy that. I sniped, ran the carbine, and the blaster. I used the [spoiler]crow and shield[/spoiler] vigors. And, despite being very consistent in my loadout, I enjoyed the combat and found it to be relatively challenging throughout. I especially found the finale challenging. By the end of the game I had died about fifteen to twenty times total, and I accrued two-thirds of those deaths in the finale itself ([spoiler]my chosen loadout was not very effective in this situation). Ammo could indeed be a problem for me considering the combination of my loadout and difficulty, and yes, this was even despite Liz's help.[/spoiler]\n\n[i]Third[/i], yes there are facets that I could nitpick, but in the end none of them stood out to me. All were drown out by the story, the setting, and the characters. All of these facets were never annoying enough to cause me to become frustrated with the game during. None of them now spring to mind in hindsight after having had the pleasure of the conclusion. In other words, I enjoyed the ride and the bumps did not detract enough to merit a concern.\n\n[i]Fourth[/i], despite having correctly guessed many of the aspects of the story and characters I still enjoyed it: beginning, middle, and end. The execution was well done; I configured the game to my taste, and took my time. The immersive elements of the game were well polished by default and I further improved it by disabling all the silly little helper prompts that I could. As such, I spent my time thoroughly exploring each area and taking in the game as it was. Each revelation or confirmation was a piece of the puzzle that I had hunted down and found. It was not just handed to me. \n\n[b][u]Possible Spoiler-Level Suggestions for Success[/u][/b]\n[spoiler][i]First[/i], fully upgrade either the shotgun, the machine gun, or the pistol. These weapons are ubiquitous throughout the game and can provide for useful backups when your preferred weapons are rundown.\n\n[i]Second[/i], purchase lockpicks! Anytime you see these buy them (and do so from the start). It is trivial to open areas that are locked if you have the picks but it is nearly impossible or can be time consuming if you must go backwards (if even possible) and retrieve them. The cost of lockpicks is insignificant in the greater context of the game.\n\n[i]Third[/i], concentrate your upgrades. Even if playing in a completionist manner, there does not seem to be enough money to upgrade all weapons and all vigors. I only managed to upgrade a few of the weapons completely and only a couple of the vigors before the game was over. While this improves replay value, unless you are playing an intentional generalist, consider specializing in one of the weapons I suggest above, plus a favorite, and then a couple vigors that you really enjoy and that seem effective.[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1400227195,"timestamp_updated":1400477194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503618061542510986","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10134844","author":{"steamid":"76561198046677894","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1613279640},"language":"english","review":"amazing","timestamp_created":1400219677,"timestamp_updated":1400219677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10134602","author":{"steamid":"76561197961969805","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":156,"playtime_forever":1026,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":836,"last_played":1448410643},"language":"english","review":"If you like beautiful graphics, unweaving a complicated storyline, and playing FPS games, this is probably worth getting.

Es hat sich gelohnt, fantastische Spielwelt, ruckelfreies Spiel, erstklassige Story und natürlich Elizabeth^^. Allein die ersten Minuten in Columbia waren fantastisch...ich wollte garnicht weiterspielen weil mir die Steampunk-artige Welt so gefallen hat. Im Weiteren Verlauf standen dann die Kämpfe an den Skylines an. Dachte erst das es schwer wird aber man hat den Dreh schnell raus. Schade dass man nur 2 Waffen gleichzeitig dabei haben kann, ein Unterschied zu den Vorgängern. Man braucht eine Weile um die passende Waffe zu finden. Die Kräfte sind wie üblich bei Bioshock innovativ und vor allem bestens in Szene gesetzt. Dein Begleiter unterstützt dich im Kampf mit Munition, Heilung und Salzen für die Kräfte, dennoch bleiben die Kämpfe vor allem in der 2. Hälfte des Spiels anspruchsvoll. Der Story zu folgen wurde  zeitweise schwierig mit den ganzen Zeitlinien und vor allem das Ende war für mich etwas verwirrend. Alles in allem aber ein klasse Spiel das sich nicht hinter seinen Vorgängern verstecken muss.^^","timestamp_created":1400192618,"timestamp_updated":1400192618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10122136","author":{"steamid":"76561198046572294","num_games_owned":421,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1500740157},"language":"english","review":"BEST ENDING EVER","timestamp_created":1400190024,"timestamp_updated":1400190024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10122043","author":{"steamid":"76561198076782437","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2347,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1515386874},"language":"english","review":"Definitely but this game.

Those two games presented tight mysteries that were all explained in-universe during the course of the game (e.g., The Many, Dr. Polito, the Big Daddies, the plasmids, Would You Kindly, etc.), whereas Bioshock Infinite expects players to take its magic powers and huge flying supercreatures (Songbird) for granted, with no attempt whatsoever to justify them in-universe, and only a feeble half-attempt at explaining the \"tears\" system.\n\nThe combat AI is a joke, with lame \"can't find him!\" mechanics that don't work well, and headshots are easily attained on oblivious enemies even in the final battles of the game. The only time things get even remotely hairy is when the game forces the gimmick of defending a destroyable objective upon you.\n\nWhoever decided to put a constant, grating, looping \"shk-shk\" noise on the vaunted PC options menu -- whose maximum FOV option is still less than PC FPS enthusiasts expect -- should be taken to a sound stage and have a subwoofer rammed up their nether regions. And there are bugs, too -- after a major boss fight, a cinematic sequence screwed up and the game couldn't proceed, leading me to replay that aggravating sequence. All over, audio crackles and pops from channel overload.\n\nYes, Elizabeth is very well voice-acted and she is a better companion than most games foist upon the player. The \"Heavy Hitter\" bosses were massively oversold in the pre-release hype, being mostly Guys With Big Guns And Tons Of HP, and little else to recommend them. Some of these characters only show up one or two times, which is disappointing on the one hand as they do tend to spice up combat, but relieving on the other hand as it's almost as boring to shoot them as it is to shoot everybody else, and some of their gimmicks are downright annoying. The first time you fight a Handyman, ask yourself: if my screen is shaking so much from him just walking around on the other side of the arena, how the hell are any of the buildings still standing intact? The answer is: because the guy who decided the \"cinematic screen shake\" effect had to go in didn't give two hoots about your ability to aim, enjoy the fight, or any pretense of fictional integrity. \n\nWith unsatisfying combat and upgrades that feel like they don't matter, characters that spout convoluted psychobabble to no purpose, and an unsatisfying story that doesn't answer anything -- the big reveal at the very end, for example, only begs the question of \"OK, yes, I recognized the foreshadowing of this, but WHY is this the case?\" -- overall, there's little to recommend the game besides the occasionally striking visuals of nostalgic early 20th century Americana.\n\nIt's a shame that the older games don't hold up too well visually, and have trouble running on modern PCs, because Ken Levine is riding the coattails of those far greater accomplishments.","timestamp_created":1400127945,"timestamp_updated":1400127945,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532899141311645508","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10115842","author":{"steamid":"76561198077648228","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1492312121},"language":"english","review":"Brilliant Game with a epical story.","timestamp_created":1400126569,"timestamp_updated":1400126569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10115321","author":{"steamid":"76561198120337946","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1587,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1482638409},"language":"english","review":"Of all the games I have played from console to pc, Bioshock infinite stands as my favorite game of all time.

Главное что постоянно есть оружие в руках, патроны валяются на кажом шагу, дропаются с мобов, а так же наш божественный НПС_суппорт может подкинуть парочку если не хватает. Элизабет это вообще отдельная тема.\n\n   Элизабет это универсальный помощник. Когда мало хп, она подкинет аптечку, когда нету маны, она даст нам фласку, когда кончаются патроны...Вуаля, и они у вас уже есть.  Сама Элизабет очень хороша. Мало того что персонаж внешне ну уж очень риятен, так ещё и не метается под ногами во время побоищ. Когда бегаешь по спокойным локациям интерестно наблюдать за нею. Она может рассматривать всякие предметы в витринах, или же стоять оперевшись о бочку рассматривая всё вокруг. Даже помогает иногда находить предметы, отмычки например.\n\nОчень порадовала сюжетная составляющая. Сюжет это наверное одно из самых сильных мест игры...Нет. Это самое сильное её место. Всё очень запутано, ну уж очень... Но это же круто. После прохождения самой игры я ещё где-то пол часа обдумывал произошедшее. Я до сих пор не уверен что осознал всё.
