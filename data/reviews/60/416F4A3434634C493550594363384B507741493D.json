Sounds simple and stupid, but Ricochet is a fun game if players are online. The first match of Ricochet I played was with two other people. There was Player and someone else. It was in the server, “Original Ricochet,” which is a server with no modded maps, just the vanilla maps like rc_deathmatch. Of course, the modded maps are good, but the original maps just feel a bit better. I stopped playing for a while because my ping was in the thousands but that stopped. I attempted to convince my friend to get it, but he just didn’t feel like wasting his money on a game from 2000. You may think I am dumb for playing this game for 2.4 hours (at the time of this review) but, why shouldn’t I waste my time on a game from 21 years ago?

It's ingrained into our lives. Many people, these days, are perfectly content with sitting on their computers all day playing single player games. I used to be a casual gamer and I used to do this. After joining the Ricochet gamer base, playing Ricochet became a new norm that was ingrained into my life. We need it for our wellbeing. It helps us escape society. There have even been studies that show how necessary tossing frisbees in a virtual environment is for our wellbeing. The fact that it was stripped away from us, especially by something that barely affects us specifically is very detrimental to our mental state. People are giving us so much crap for it, yet they don't know what it's like for us to be deprived of everything that's fun for us. Here is the truth, there are people out there myself included that don't think anyone is a gamer unless they are \"Ricochet gamers\". We would never in a thousand years waste our time playing a single player game as a Ricochet gamer. People that play single player games, are not really gamers to us Ricochet gamers... they are tourists. We Ricochet gamers spend hrs looking up configs, exploits and load outs, playing at low settings on 144+ hz monitors with 1000hz polling rate mice, we are extremely competitive. The definition of casual gaming to a Ricochet game is: playing single player games on ultra settings. a casual gamer plays for the escape, not the destruction of others. and to us, a casual gamer is not a gamer. Ricochet toxic players are not more toxic to casual players than other players, it might be that you are sensitive. if you can be trolled to the point you are not having a good time, you need to turn within. harden up. Some people are more sensitive than others, maybe stay single player.. keep in mind to some of us 2 hrs a day of Ricochet is not gaming, its warming
