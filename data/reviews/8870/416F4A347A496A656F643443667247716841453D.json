Gdy nie musimy się już trzymać żadnej logiki możemy sprawę zakończyć w dowolny sposób. W tym sensie zakończenie gry jest doprawdy bezsensowne i oznacza cokolwiek. Gra porusza także problem rewolucji ale uderza w najbardziej wyświechtany motyw - dumni buntownicy o wolność stają się tacy sami jak tyran, którego obalili *ziew*. \n\nTa cała filozofia została brutalnie wciśnięta w formę liniowego, prostego fps'a.

Es un shooter en primera persona, tiene una banda sonora más que buena, teniendo en cuenta que es un shooter y por lo general este aspecto no es muy pulido por los desarrolladores en este tipo de juegos, así mismo cuenta con unos muy buenos efectos de sonido y un espectacular doblaje al español, sumado a unos escenarios sencillamente espectaculares y un diseño de enemigos sobresaliente. En fin, es un Bioshock, tiene una historia de 10 con una jugabilidad muy divertida y frenética.\n\nRequisitos. Medios.

I Played through the main storyline on easy in just under 14 hours. Burial at Sea Ep 1 was done at about the 15.5-16 hour mark. I just finished Burial at Sea Ep 2 with a total of 22+ hours. I have only played Bioshock Infinite and none of the ther Bioshocks (yet.) I watched a playthrough of each game and their DLC on Youtube sometime in 2016. 4.9/5 Stars \n\n\nMain Storyline\nPlaythrough Style: Aggressive, Loot Bug\nPlay time: ~14 Hours\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nThe gameplay of Bioshock Infinite was fantastic! The controls are well placed and easy to use (SIDE NOTE: I utilized the additional buttons on my mouse for melee and aiming.) The storyline is very full 97% of the time, there are a few times it got (at least it felt) off course at times but the greatness of the rest of the story counteracted that. This was my first experience with a semi-recent story driven game, my previous being Portal 2. It was a very pleasing flow of events and movement, to just get to run around and hop from sky hook to sky hook blasting, shooting, and bashing enemies was the thrill and adventure I expected. The graphics are very well done and on par with if not better than most graphics from 2013. A very bright and open game compared to the previous Bioshocks. With my GTX 750Ti I can run the game on the highest graphic settings with no visible issues. The music and sounds will normally makr or break a game for me. The music is fantastic, honestly amazing. Gotta love 1912. Needless to say Bioshock Infinite has become my all time favorite video game.\n\n\nBurial at Sea: Episode 1\nPlaythrough Style: Semi-Aggressive (Leaning towards the aggressive side), Loot Bug\nPlay time: ~2 Hours\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nBack in Rapture, Pre-Sh*t Show too! Just amazing. Beautifully created and imagined, you get to spend some time in Rapture prior to the first game. Much like the main game, BaS:E1 just exceeds expectations in gameplay and graphics. Pretty much the same controls as the main game you can feel right at home while wandering around or fighting baddies. A big contrast would be the dark dinginess, once you get into Fontaine's, definitely a bit more spooky than previous. As this wasn't the longest playthrough there honestly isn't too much else to say about Burial at Sea: Episode 1.\n\n\nBurial at Sea: Episode 2\nPlaythrough Style: Non-Lethal (kill Count: 0), Loot Bug\nPlay time: ~6 Hours\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nWow... That's all I'll say about the ending of BaS:E1. I feel... I feel... different, more like.. a woman... WHAT?!?!? I'M ELIZABETH!!?!?!?! That's new!You are now playing as Elizabeth. But that isn't the only new thing. New mechanics have been introduced to the game. Like the 1998 Mode, similar to 1999 Mode but forces you to play a non-Lethal on top of the 1999 Mode difficulty. Stealth, Stealth is the new name of the game, at least my playthrough was. Enemies now have visible and a new sense of awareness from the main game. Sneaking around avoiding things that make noise such at broken glass and puddles of water (and other liquids) definitely adds to the feel of playing as someone like Elizabeth. You are given a new (to Bioshock Infinite) weapon to use, a crossbow, which fires non-lethal bolts like the tranquilizer bolt, the noise-maker bolt, and the Gas Bolt. You get to crawl around in airvents to escape enimies and even find secret rooms! The graphics still continue to shine as you run around the the underwater prison. The storyline for this is just filled to the brimand ready to be played over and over again. My biggest complaint (a small one at that) is that it feels like too much of just running in circles around the map going into each building a few times.\n\n\nOverview\n\nDo I recommend this game? Uhhhh... YEAH!\n\nIf you are seriously contemplating getting this game like I was for about a year, GET IT! It is worth every penny and I look forward to playing it for many more hours to come.\nThanks for reading my whole review!","timestamp_created":1504392988,"timestamp_updated":1632272939,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469501793384552002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34696155","author":{"steamid":"76561198068698590","num_games_owned":272,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1300,"last_played":1657747910},"language":"english","review":"For many years after first seeing and hearing about this game from others, I considered it one of the finest video games in history. But I had never actually got around to playing it myself until recently, and after playing through the main game and DLC, I can safely say that this game is by far the greatest game I have ever played.\n\nThis game is filled with sharp, fluid gameplay which is enhanced tenfold by Elizabeth. Graphically speaking, the game has stunning visuals with a beautiful setting far easier on the eyes than Rapture, although there is still a great deal of variety throughout the campaign.\n\nBy far the strongest aspect of Bioshock Infinite is its incredible story. The game features a wide variety of memorable characters like the Luteces, Daisy Fitzroy, Zachary Comstock, Booker DeWitt(the player character), and of course, Elizabeth. The story itself has incredible analysis of society and the world as it is, exploring themes of racism, religion, revolution, and more.\n\nEver since its intial release, I considered Skyrim my favorite game because of what it meant to me and how it inspired me to love video games as a form of storytelling and even as a form of art. But after the tremendous impact that Bioshock Infinite has had on me, I can no longer consider any other game to be my favorite. If you in any way believe that video games can be a strong artistic medium, then this game is an absolute must-play.","timestamp_created":1504388788,"timestamp_updated":1504388788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34694734","author":{"steamid":"76561198140453727","num_games_owned":363,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1743,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1528,"last_played":1505321712},"language":"russian","review":"Отличный сюжет, геймплей и....Элизабет.

I'm sorry to say I'm not amongst them. I really wanted to like Bioshock Infinite, but I just found it boring.\n\nI applaud the ambition of the story, and even in some parts the execution of the game, but I think in the end it falls between two stools. It's primarily a FPS but the FPS elements are repetitive. Even in hard mode there's no real challenge, especially since each time you die, you return to the scene as you left it, with health partially restored. So even the most useless player will eventually get through each battle - so no real challenge. The 'vigours' seem cool at first but most are just different versions of the same grenade/trap option. The other side of the game is the story, which seems to have all the grown up elements in place for an intriguing counterfactual history, but for whatever reason I just didn't find it sufficiently absorbing or interesting. \n\nMaybe the problem is that this is the first Bioshock game I've ever played, perhaps having the background of the preceding games makes Bioshock Infinite special. I love FPS games with a great single player story, having for example greatly enjoyed and replayed the Wolfenstein games recently.
