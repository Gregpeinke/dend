game is my favourite GoldSrc Half-Life game of all time.\nI picked this game up when I was as young as 7 years old and wanted to play more half-life games.\ni was taken aback because I was used to handling a crowbar and killing people with a glock but the game grew on me. \nThe introduction of new weapons and new enemies was an eye-opener because it added so much more to the game, seeing Freeman jumping into Xen was one of my most treasured moments throughout the game.\nEverything about this game is amazing, especially the introduction of Adrian Shephard (which in my opinion has the coolest playermodel and design out of all 3 Half-life protagonists).\nIt's a shame that these expansions to the half-life universe may or may not be canon and the fact that we might never see Shephard's story continue ever again. \nRegardless, I recommend this game to anyone looking to prolong their Half-Life experience and trying to make the most of it whilst staying in the original engine.\nThanks for reading this

molto interessante giocare \"Half life\" dal punto di vista dei \"nemici\".\nStranamente l'ho trovato più difficile di half life dal punto di vista dei nemici, ovvero, gli alieni sono più complessi rispetto a quelli combattuti da Gordon Freeman in Half life, però non posso dire lo stesso nei riguardi del boss finale, piuttosto semplice direi, però, trattandosi di un capitolo \"minore\" la scelta di un boss finale non troppo difficile direi che è abbastanza sensata.\nIl gioco è meno articolato di Half Life classico ma, come già detto precedentemente, ha senso trattandosi di un capitolo minore, però direi che è abbastanza bello, soprattutto per chi è curioso di sapere cosa si prova a stare \"dall'altra parte\" o \"da un punto di vista diverso\" durante l'incidente di Black Mesa.\nSpero un giorno che la Valve si ricorderà del nostro amicone Adrian Shephard perchè vorrei rivederlo anche in altri capitoli (se ci saranno).","timestamp_created":1606936276,"timestamp_updated":1606936276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81478633","author":{"steamid":"76561198334795835","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":354,"last_played":1606933349},"language":"latam","review":"La

Предстоит посетить как новые так и хорошо знакомые по первой Half-Life локации, а также увидеть Гордона Фримена. В дополнении присутствуют много новых врагов, в том числе новые виды зомби. Арсенал также пополнили, особенно инопланетный (например, ручной барнакл, шоковый таракан и спорометатель). Вместо привычной монтировки теперь у главного героя будет трубный ключ, а также ручной телепорт, который позволит на усмотрение игрока перемещаться из комплекса и посетить некоторые локации Xen и вернуться обратно.
