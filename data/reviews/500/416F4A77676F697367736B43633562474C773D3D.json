It may look a little dated now, but the source engine still feels good to play in, and the game is just hard enough to remain a bit of a challenge unless you are really paying attention. It's a very limited content game, just 5 or so hour-long campaigns for co-op play, but somehow I'm still playing the game occasionally with the same guys 6 years after release. \n\nUnlike Borderlands, the guns actually feel like they are doing damage, the panic can be real and you need a decent strategy to beat the campaign finales. Unlike Left 4 Dead 2, it is not entirely random and a good, careful player can sometimes make it through the game with barely a scratch, giving a real sense of achievement.","timestamp_created":1415626721,"timestamp_updated":1415626721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522383451461791992","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12872324","author":{"steamid":"76561198066434181","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":194,"last_played":1463526580},"language":"english","review":"Ever stressed out about work? school? life? just hop on this game and blow the living F*** out of zombies and while your at it get R**** by a witch.

Between you and it, there are sometimes wekk over 1k zombies of all types.  Ordinary infected, boomers, smokers, hunters, tanks, and my favorite, the witches.  Do NOT disturb the witch.  Have your son do it instead.  You fight your way from one safe house to the next, avoiding car alarms, killing hordes, and getting heald when a tank smacks you across the map.  You are joined by up to 3 NPCs that actually save your hide quite a bit.

— наша цель! Стреляйте им в голову,\nэто главное. А тела мы сжигаем. Тогда — верняк.\nк/ф «Рассвет мертвецов» (2004)\n\nСуть L4D банальна — неуязвимые к заразе герои должны пробежать до следующего убежища. Сделать это непросто — выжившим противостоят не гниющие развалины, а «турбозомби» из «28 дней спустя» и римейка «Рассвета мертвецов», безошибочно находящие цель, бегающие, перелезающие через препятствия или разносящие их в щепки.\n\nГадов лучше истреблять издалека. Гораздо тяжелее, когда они прут толпой или нападают в тесном помещении. Огонь по своим и вражеские пинки быстро выводят из строя, а лечиться здесь опасно — пациент вынужден стоять на месте, подставляя всех под удар. Кроме того, аптечки всегда в дефиците.\n\nLeft 4 Dead прощает новичков. Получив на орехи, игроки не умирают, а падают и, дожидаясь помощи, стреляют из пистолетов. После третьего нокаута персонаж отходит в мир иной… чтобы вскоре воскреснуть в какой-нибудь подсобке, откуда его вызволят соратники.\n\nС другой стороны, тут не терпят разгильдяев. На первый взгляд, воевать элементарно: нет ни классов, ни специальных способностей, ни бонусов за взаимовыручку. Достаточно прикрывать спутников, быть вместе, делиться лекарствами и не лезть на рожон. При этом малейшая ошибка может стать роковой — прикончив хотя бы одного бойца, враги запросто сомнут остальных. Отряд, где все схватывают с полуслова, действует намного эффективнее. Без голосовой связи не обойтись — глупо тратить драгоценные секунды на чат или контекстные меню.","timestamp_created":1415057086,"timestamp_updated":1415057086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527897000312805176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12769397","author":{"steamid":"76561198161584592","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1461151154},"language":"brazilian","review":"Old

No longer could you \"win\" the game by only caring about yourself. You need your teammates and your teammates need you.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n● Unique Cooperative Gameplay in every Gamemode! (Campaign, Versus, Survival)\n● The Lobby/Drop-in system works flawlessy allowing players to effortlessly finding a game.\n● Free DLC.\n● Make your own Maps!\n● Low PC Specs required.\n● Get to play as Special Infected! (Yeah.. those Zombies..!) in Versus mode.\n● Scoring System in Versus allows for both Teams to make an insane comeback!\n● Very Easy to setup your own Dedicated Server.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n● Players have to download Maps manually, they are unable to download from the Server they are joining.\n● No Workshop.\n● The Game is unpolished in regards to exploits and bugs, Valve has never responded to countless reports and complaints.\n● No Matchmaking, you're very likely to end up with very unbalanced teams when joining Versus games.\n● Ragequitting is not punished at all.\n\n[h1]The Community[/h1]\n\nThe Community for Left 4 Dead is very comparable to Left 4 Dead 2, in Public Games you can expect to be insulted and possibly even votekicked if you're underperforming in the eyes of your teammates.\nThere however used to be a Competitive Scene, this scene was much better in terms of actually being able to finish your games as well as making buddies. Unfortunately, it has died a long time ago.\n\n[h1]Current Status of the Game[/h1]\n\nAs of this post, Left 4 Dead has an 30-Day Average of [b]385[/b] Players Worldwide.\nYou are very unlikely to find Games going on, and if you do happen to find some, they're likely going to be unenjoyable.\n\nThe only way you're going to really enjoy this game, is if you find a couple of likeminded buddies and get Campaign + Survival going. Pushing your way through Expert mode will always remain fun. :)\nIf you're feeling lucky and you're not prone to ragequitting or shouting accusations (Trust me, nobody cheats in Left 4 Dead anymore) you can give Versus a go. 4 Players is already half of what you need!\n\n[h1]Final Words[/h1]\n\nLeft 4 Dead currently costs $20, just like Left 4 Dead 2. They however have a much different feel to the game and I'd still buy both versions.\nI recommend adding it to your wishlist until it gets on Sale though. ;)","timestamp_created":1413683671,"timestamp_updated":1413683671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":89,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.832706212997436523","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12547111","author":{"steamid":"76561198082899416","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":89039,"playtime_last_two_weeks":53,"playtime_at_review":24242,"last_played":1659636344},"language":"russian","review":"Лучший зомби-апокалипсис.
