It has amusing characters and jokes, good puzzles, and is fun to both play and look at. It is, at times, a little more challenging than Portal, but enjoyably so; people with and without experience should be able to enjoy it. It doesn't require long sittings of gameplay, so if you're a busy person or just can't commit yourself to being on the computer for hours at a time, Portal 2 works. At the same time, it's a game you [i]can[/i] play for hours at a time, if you so choose.\n\nI would especially recommend it to those not fond of direct combat games.","timestamp_created":1403545488,"timestamp_updated":1403545488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10719245","author":{"steamid":"76561198115106617","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":280,"last_played":1577134388},"language":"swedish","review":"köp det ;)","timestamp_created":1403545471,"timestamp_updated":1403545471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10719017","author":{"steamid":"76561198113892182","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":362,"last_played":1621370607},"language":"portuguese","review":"legal","timestamp_created":1403545217,"timestamp_updated":1403545217,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10718847","author":{"steamid":"76561198046097365","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":19,"playtime_at_review":1180,"last_played":1660651228},"language":"french","review":"Good Game","timestamp_created":1403544997,"timestamp_updated":1403544997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10718585","author":{"steamid":"76561197990139245","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":626,"last_played":1592720623},"language":"german","review":"Nach wie vor ungeschlagener Humor, im Vergleich zum ersten Teil sehr aufgemotzte Optik und mal wieder super Rätsel.

Rarely does a sequal take everything great about a predecessor and imporve upon it and just blow it out of he water.  It is refreshing to see this, considering how many shit sequals are out there.  \n\nNothing much has changed in terms of gameplay, except for the addition of the new blue, orange, and white goo.  This allows for more complex puzzles, making gameplay more fun.  Unlike Portal 1, the story is great (Portal 1 ddidn't really have much of a story) and the ending is great.  \n\nThe community created content adds a ton of life this game and the co-op is a blast.

Manche Level erfordern viel Geduld und Überblick, aber es ist den Aufwand jedes Mal wert, da die Story kurzweilig und außerordentlich amüsant ist. Ich habe den Multiplayer angetestet und muss sagen, dass er auch seinen Reiz hat, da die Level nur mit Teamarbeit gelöst werden können, was alles nochmal etwas kniffeliger macht. Das Spiel lebt allerdings hauptsächlich von der Story weshalb der Singleplayer den wichtigeren Teil des Spiels darstellt.
