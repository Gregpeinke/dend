I like the use of including a token black guy into the game so that the developers Id software dont come off as racist douchefucks. To top it all off, the game came out originally on the SEGA gemisish which is undoubtably the best tv ever made by Sandsung, the game was then later ported to PC by a small company known as Millie's Cookies who then established the best RTS franchise of all time, the \"IVE LOST ALL HOPE\" series, AKA FINAL FANATSEE.

This game set the stage for real time physics in games, others had attempted prior but this game really shinned with it.  The engine was ahead of its time, and is still very enjoyable today.  Here are the pros/cons.\n\nPros:\n- Endless fun with the source engine, I've put in well over 1,000 hours playing Half-life, Counter-strike, and Dod: Source.\n- Smooth gameplay, with an engaging story.\n- Customization is beyond anything i've seen in a game.  You can literally make an entire game if you want to.  \n- Replayability is high, no playthrough is the same.  Pretty good for a linear game.\n- Mods like Counter-strike bring endless hours of fun.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of a sequel is a major disappointment.  This has nothing to do with the gameplay or anything, but the shear lack of communication from Valve on a sequel to a flagship game is very disheartening.\n\n\nThats is really.  This game is pretty flawless, definetly play this if you are a video game fan.","timestamp_created":1446249725,"timestamp_updated":1446249725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18778556","author":{"steamid":"76561198030881902","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":977,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":913,"last_played":1495984905},"language":"english","review":"Easily the best PC game since the original StarCraft.

As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. \n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. \n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. \n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 -  A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","timestamp_created":1445987985,"timestamp_updated":1454102072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":379,"votes_funny":29,"weighted_vote_score":"0.93239825963973999","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18717052","author":{"steamid":"76561198127957616","num_games_owned":348,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3788,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2971,"last_played":1595878891},"language":"italian","review":"Niente da dire, tutto sottointeso.\nBe the Freeman, the one free man.","timestamp_created":1445978427,"timestamp_updated":1445978427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18716504","author":{"steamid":"76561197983500496","num_games_owned":547,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":1146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1071,"last_played":1449324465},"language":"romanian","review":"Half-Life 2 deși nu la fel de impresionant acum în 2015, reușește să ofere un gameplay bun și o poveste și mai bună.\n\n\nEste unul din acele jocuri pe care un utilizator de PC trebuie să le joace. Vă spun sincer, Half-Life 2 nu mai este acea bomboană, acel joc minunant pentru un gamer care nu l-a jucat inca. Pentru ca cel mai probabil, cateva din conceptele de joc au fost imprumutate si la cele mai moderne, iar intrand in Half Life 2 le veti recunoaste.\n\n\nInsa fără urmă de îndoială, multe din acele concepte care în alte jocuri sunt executate slab sau mai prost, în Half Life 2 ele functioneaza foarte bine.\n\n\nCe este interesant este că în Half-Life 2 toată povestea se desfășoară în joc, cu foarte puține momente randate in-game. Adică exact cum vezi jocul așa va fi și povestea. Acesta nu prezintă cadre randate în CGI sau alte lucruri care par scoase din joc, oferind o uniformitate foarte bună.\n\n\nEste un succesor demn pentru Half-Life 1 și deși nu vom avea parte de întâlniri masive cu fințele de pe planeta Xen, vom putea să observăm cum elita asuprește omenirea, iar un grup mic de revoluționari încearcă să răstoarne formațiunea Combine, o formațiune care conform deviziei servește omenirea.\n\n\nPovestea este cu siguranță foarte bună dar există și momente un pic mai plictisitoare, însă nu destul de plictisitoare pentru a te face să pui pauză și să ieși din joc.\n\nExistă și secvențe puzzle relativ ușoare dar și lupte mai dificile care te vor face să le resetezi de câteva ore.\n\n\nPersonajul care ne-a urmărit până acum G-MAN își va face și el prezența, iar cei mai agili îl vor putea vedea în diferitele niveluri din joc dar și în cadre destul de importante pe de-a cursul poveștii, însă în afară de niște comentarii in anumite momente, acesta nu va fi destul de relevant.\n\n\n\n[h1]Ca o concluzie[/h1]\nOricum Half-Life 2 (inclusiv Episode One și Episode Two) este un joc care trebuie jucat pentru oricine care vrea să se denumească PC Gamer. Povestea celor 4 (inclusiv Half-Life 1) se îmbină foarte bine, iar din nefericire finalul celui de-al doilea joc este presărat de referințe către compania Aperture (Portal) și despre posibilele întâlniri cu forța superioară ce guvernează formațiunea Combine.\n\n\nGameplayul funcționează bine și pot spune că nu am avut nici o problemă, atât tehnică(crashuri, glitch-uri, bug-uri) cât și logică (momente prost alese, alegeri care nu fac sens, probleme de plasare ale misiunii, obiectivelor)\n\n\n*Rectific - singura problema tehnica pe care am avut-o a fost in capitolul Anticitizen One, unde jocul a dat crash de zeci de ori cand am incarcat o salvare. Cel mai probabil in salvare era un bug care se declansa de fiecare data cand treceai pe langa un obiect. Problema s-a rezolvat cu incarcarea unei salvari mai vechi decat cea buguita*\n\n\nÎn final vom fi lăsați cu o senzație ce ne va face să jucăm din primul moment Half-Life 3, un joc care cel mai probabil, nu se va lansa niciodată.","timestamp_created":1445976159,"timestamp_updated":1446115166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18715446","author":{"steamid":"76561198257205262","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1465839007},"language":"italian","review":"scrivo
