It's damn good. It's very damn good. It's so damn good, you might as well spend your money on this immediately. Half-Life 2 does everything right that Half-Life does... and then goes even further, doing an even more fantastic job with its story. The graphics and level-design are both very aesthetically pleasing, and the actors all do their job very well (Though the best voice actor would definitely have to be Dr. Freeman's. Very excellent job). And the story, like it's predecessor, tells it completely through animations and no cutscenes to be found, giving the game a nice steady flow. The game also has a great atmosphere. It can feel hopeless, empowering, and frightening at appropriate times. And the world that is created outside of Black Mesa labs is well shown and characterized, to be a very believable place. \n\nHonestly, I only have two very small qualms with this game and that would be the loading screens and occaisional glitches. I never found an actual in-game glitch in graphics or animation, but rarely the sound would cut out of a random NPC's dialogue. And for a game that flows so well, the loading screen for the next section of a level can bring all that build-up to a halt. But these are only minor problems, that didn't take away all that much from how great the game is. Half-Life 2 is definitely one of the best video games I've ever played, and I can guarantee it'll be one of the best games you'll ever play as well. I cannot recommend this game enough.","timestamp_created":1437662630,"timestamp_updated":1441765893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515570938587188721","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17186637","author":{"steamid":"76561198202943354","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1561376613},"language":"english","review":"Definetly a great game.

Enter Half-Life 2, a prime example: considered almost unanimously to be one of the best and most influential games of all time, you don't play to the end to join the 'gaming elite' (well, I don't anyway; I don't know you), you play to the end because it's fun. Great fun. Inventive, thrilling, visually wonderful, technologically innovative, mind-bogglingly well-crafted, perfectly, slightly overrated, fun.\n   To this day, it's one of the most entertaining experiences you can have in the medium of ones and zeroes.

Думаю, в мире нет почти ни одного человека, который бы не слышал про эту игру. Она заманивает сюжетом и атмосферой, которые увлекают вас прямо до финальных титров: расказывать про процесс прохождения нету смысла - вы сами должны это пройти - от гонимого зверя в клетке до выживщего в заброшеном городе, от выжевщего в зомбиапокалипсисе до борца с системой. Каждый пройдя ее почувствует, что-то чего не ошушал в других шутерах да и играх вообще. Имперский лайк, рекомендую.","timestamp_created":1437426654,"timestamp_updated":1437426654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17146054","author":{"steamid":"76561198123432378","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":84,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1451755095},"language":"english","review":"It's Fun.","timestamp_created":1437423599,"timestamp_updated":1437423599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17145551","author":{"steamid":"76561198225519532","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1008,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":923,"last_played":1441177812},"language":"russian","review":"Супер!!","timestamp_created":1437421297,"timestamp_updated":1437421297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17144022","author":{"steamid":"76561198137630020","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4015,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1579,"last_played":1644427993},"language":"english","review":"This was the best game I've ever played.

Now this isn't a bad game at all. The physics are still great, the shotgun is one of my favorite guns and the gravity gun is fun as hell. Also, there is undeniably a sense of world that's \"alive\", but I didn't notice the charm of hl1 and I sure did get bored playing this a lot more often than I did in the previous game.\n\nAlso RIP half-life 3!","timestamp_created":1437415337,"timestamp_updated":1522526101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17143080","author":{"steamid":"76561198145773928","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":274,"last_played":1469015374},"language":"english","review":"now i never usually do serious reviews on games (beaucause i wanna be dank) but this game is on my top 10 games list. reasons? here:\n1. i'm too lazy to f*cking list them\ngg imma go play some more hl2 xdxdxd","timestamp_created":1437411349,"timestamp_updated":1437411349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17142832","author":{"steamid":"76561198045975980","num_games_owned":552,"num_reviews":99,"playtime_forever":508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1607373014},"language":"english","review":"Still waiting for the Episode 3.\n\nAfter nearly 9 years.
