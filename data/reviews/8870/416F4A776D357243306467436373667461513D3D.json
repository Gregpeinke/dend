I'd recommend playing the first game before this one, although it really isn't necessary. Infinite is it's own story, but set in the same world as the original.\n\nWhat really sets these Bioshock apart from other shooters is the atmosphere.  I think Infinite excels at this even more than the original because of the more realistic romanticized setting of 190X America. I remember getting lost is the first few 'no combat' stages like I was playing some sort of walking simulator.\n\nIt's the story that really makes this game. Combat, though enjoyable, takes a back seat to the plot. There's only a handful of open combat stages, which I felt to be the only negetive, only because it limits the experience with the large assortment of upgradable weapons and powers.\n\nI also enjoyed having a non-combat, support companion. The thing I hate most from AI team shooters (/cough Mass Effect) is that the AI spends most of its time blocking line of sight rather than engaging the enemy. Elizabeth, on the other hand, throws me ammo and stays the hell out of my way. I couldn't ask for more. I like how she takes cover and moves around too, even though she's can't be hurt.\n\nInfinite is also one of the few games that I can easily recommend the DLC. \"Clash in the Clouds\" is a great sandbox for trying out all the weapons without fear of ammo or progression (you can only hold two weapons at a time). I almost suggest playing it before the main game, but it would spoil the story. \"Burial at Sea\" is the final chapter of Bioshock centered around Elizabeth. It wraps up the franchise nicely, though I wouldn't bother unless you've played the original game.\n\nOverall I recommend Bioshock Infinite to just about anyone, especially story-rich shooter fans. If you enjoyed the original, you definitely owe it to yourself to pick this one up.","timestamp_created":1480217686,"timestamp_updated":1480217686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504517197608947754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27768016","author":{"steamid":"76561198067748828","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2294,"last_played":1551553437},"language":"brazilian","review":"Simplesmente o melhor singleplayer que você vai encontrar na steam está na franquia Bioshock e o melhor deles é o Infinite.
