The final chapter of this game (ignoring the ear damage) is genuinely the most fun i have had out of the goldscr trilogy.

The first is a buggy, obscure game introducing new features that are unpolished and don't fit, or a game that introduces absolutely nothing and is just a copy + paste of the original game with a few tweaks here and there. But this is no typical modded game, this is made by Valve, so you know it's gotta be good. Opposing force doesn't shy away from bringing in that gritty, military-esque atmosphere that was somewhat absent in the original half-life game, popping your straight into boot camp and establishing you are nothing more than a subordinate grunt, unlike the legendary Gordon Freeman in the first game. The way you interact with your fellow marines, guards, scientists, and other NPCs is also fresh. It implies that, simply you don't belong and that you are out of place, which aids in establishing this unique atmosphere which is carried out throughout the entirety of the playthrough. New enemies are interesting and challenging, adding another layer to that 'new' experience in half-life. Simply the addition of a wrench as opposed to a crowbar is also a nice touch as well. However, you, the player, simply being out of place in this environment doesn't take away from your own personal choices. You have been sent to quell the voice of these scientists, so do you? There are many little events and choices you can make to choose between sides. Do you do your job and help your brutish fellow soldiers, or do you side with humanity against these alien invaders. The choice is yours, and this freedom feels more expanded than it did in the regular half-life. 8.5 / 10, pretty epic.","timestamp_created":1632710769,"timestamp_updated":1632710769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100013489","author":{"steamid":"76561198860466268","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":17,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17,"last_played":1632030202},"language":"spanish","review":"fue el primer juego que jugue alla por el año 99, lo consegui en un cd de una revista una version demo.
