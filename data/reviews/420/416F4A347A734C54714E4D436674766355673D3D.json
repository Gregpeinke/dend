Игра на этот раз приподнесла немало интересного.\n\nЭпизод 2 - квинтесенция всех ранее нереализованных задумок игры (на данный момент), которая сумела при той же атмосфере и своей идее создать совершенно новый и свежий взгляд на окружающий мир. Вместо пустынных трущоб и закоулков теперь уже разрушенного города перед нами красуются бескрайние просторы горных лесов, пещерных сетей, заброшенных горнодобывающих рудников и кордонов. Герои пытаются убежать от преследователей: от всё тех же патрулей комбайнов и совершенно новых врагов. Эпизод во многом оправдал существование предыдущего, подытожив тем самым логический перенос места действия. Однако, игра всё ещё оставила достаточно много вопросов, на многие из которых так и не были даны ответы. Вероятнее всего (а это так и есть) всё шло к Эпизоду 3 (или HL3, как Вам угодно), и поэтому трагическая и в меру каноничная концовка данного аддона создаёт определённую пустоту, потому как события обрываются резко, не завершив историю в целом.\n\nТехническую сторону игры можно похвалить - разработчики потратили 2 года трудов не зря, усовершенствовав игровой движок и выжав из него намного больше полезностей и работоспособности, чем её предыдущая версия. Это видно не только в масштабности окружения и более высокой детализированности игрового мира. Саундтрек отыгран в том же духе, визуальная составляющая радует глаз, а красивые и проработанные локации преображаются в процессе боёв и перестрелок. Игра более динамична и насыщенна как технически, так и геймплейно. К тому же, достижения тоже не дадут Вам скучать.\n\nЭпизод 2 на данный момент можно отнести к самостоятельному целостному проекту, который играется так же комфортно, как и предшественник, даже не смотря на тот факт, что создан он был по принципу аддона. В неё интересно возвращаться и переживать напряжённые моменты (ибо их тут предостаточно), а развитие сюжета здесь как никогда сильно. Поэтому, игра однозначно стоит внимания как обычных игроков, не знакомых с серией Half-Life, так и для преданных поклонников. HL3. Надеемся, верим, ждём.","timestamp_created":1459569101,"timestamp_updated":1459571227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516619682312011719","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22188906","author":{"steamid":"76561197982628667","num_games_owned":549,"num_reviews":292,"playtime_forever":428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":391,"last_played":1393190578},"language":"english","review":"It's fun\n\nRather Half-Life over this.","timestamp_created":1459562783,"timestamp_updated":1459562783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493530452251434326","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22171299","author":{"steamid":"76561198173917473","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":289,"last_played":1586666545},"language":"english","review":"This game is absolutly rediculous.

Vehicular travel is back and you traverse very hilly environments with patches of trees here and there. Desolate houses welcome you to search them and the destructive portal always looms in the distance.\n-Level design is, as always, the strong suit of the game. It always feels like you are making progress and there aren't many dull moments. The graphics have aged a bit, but it's still a great looking game. Episode Two functions as well as its predecessors in and out of combat.\n-The story is also strong in this one. Voice acting is great, as usual, and there is always a feeling of urgency in the plot. Exposition sometimes undermines this flow, but it effectively develops this world that Half Life has made so interesting. It's a constantly changing setting and that makes for some interesting surprises as new elements are introduced.\n-There's nothing really awful about the title other than the cliffhanger ending. If the episodic releases had worked out like Valve said they would, it would have been fine. But it's been years. While I'm glad I got around to playing through the Half Life franchise, it's upsetting to know that there may not be a conclusion any time soon. I'm now part of the waiting line.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\n-If you like the other Half Life games, play this one. Don't come into it without any context, make sure you've played the previous titles otherwise you won't be able to appreciate what's going on. It's an excellent example of a well-told story and the style of level design that makes Half Life games so fun. I wouldn't let the cliffhanger dissuade you from trying out the games. While it's annoying to have to deal with such a long wait, it's worth playing the most recent installment in such a brilliant series.\n\nBuy it.","timestamp_created":1457942674,"timestamp_updated":1457942674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21818999","author":{"steamid":"76561198026361937","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":104,"playtime_forever":711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1612299105},"language":"english","review":"Well, I guess I'm waiting for Half-Life 3 now ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","timestamp_created":1457890509,"timestamp_updated":1457890509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21817710","author":{"steamid":"76561197983335740","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":173,"last_played":1354435200},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic game about a speechless man running across forrests with cool stuff and jeep.
