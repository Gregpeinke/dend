Действие игры происходит в 1912 году в вымышленном летающем городе Колумбия. Главного героя зовут Букер ДеВитт. Он частный детектив и прибыл в Колумбию, чтобы найти девушку по имени Элизабет. Позже, они вместе окажутся в центре войны между рабочими и городскими властями. У Элизабет есть сверхспособность: создавать \"разрывы\" между параллельными мирами и благодаря этому, они многое узнают про этот город, а также про свое прошлое.\nСаундтрек здесь прекрасный, чего только стоит музыка которая играет в меню! Большую часть игры нам придется расправляться со злодеями, в сопровождении очаровательной и очень красивой Элизабет. В игре прекрасная атмосфера. Локации разнообразны, декорации на протяжении всего прохождения будут постоянно изменяться, хочется просто бродить по городу, слушая диалоги прохожих и любоваться красотой, ведь перестрелки иногда надоедают. \nПодведем итоги: BioShock Infinite игра, с хорошим сюжетом, подбором персонажей, прекрасным саундтреком, отлично проработанными локациями. Рекомендую эту игру к прохождению, потому что каждый уважающий себя геймер обязан сыграть в BioShock Infinite!Думаю за 2013 год это лучшая игра,и если в 2020 или 21 году выйдет новая часть то она будет в много раз лучше...\n\nСпасибо как всегда за убитую минутку)","timestamp_created":1573139458,"timestamp_updated":1573139458,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":59,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.728133141994476318","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56694163","author":{"steamid":"76561198070697511","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":785,"last_played":1657585309},"language":"english","review":"A very good one, classic game","timestamp_created":1573135977,"timestamp_updated":1573135977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56691613","author":{"steamid":"76561198404655047","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":936,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":879,"last_played":1604785005},"language":"russian","review":"Ты хочешь начать всё заново... но прежде время обернется вспять, чем ты найдёшь прощение.

However I think I way prefer  BioShock Infinite, I think the characters were all really strong and had interesting dynamics and the story was subtle but always pressing on deep themes. The game was quite explicitly political in a far more overt way than Bioshock 1 & 2. \n\nBioshock Infinite touched on racism, religion, and indoctrination and is a pretty bold and unabashed critique of United States politics and culture. The more sci-fi paradoxy aspect of the game touched on ideas of identity causation and responsibility in quite a thought-provoking way as well. I am normally not a fan of multiple-worlds/time-travelling in media but in this I think they were not pretentious about it and it totally fits with the aesthetic of the game. \n\nThis was held together by a simple but decent gameplay experience with satisfying (to use and upgrade) weapons and powers that don't complicate the game too much to make you lose focus on what is happening with the characters. Also the game just looks beautiful and has incredible lighting. I found the climax to be super gripping and even a bit existentially terrifying. Great pacing of the story. \n\nI just wish they didn't put the auto-direction signal in, you can not press it but when you get a little lost it's always tempting. Without it the player is more inclined to focus on the environment instead of the arrow on the floor in front of them.\n\nHopefully I'll have the time to do at least another play through.","timestamp_created":1573082706,"timestamp_updated":1573122790,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56658718","author":{"steamid":"76561198446789642","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":685,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":685,"last_played":1573081474},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores jogos que  eu já joguei na minha vida, recomendo vcs não vão se arrepender","timestamp_created":1573081567,"timestamp_updated":1573081567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56656716","author":{"steamid":"76561198100915550","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4300,"last_played":1602193062},"language":"spanish","review":"11/10, Sublime en todo aspecto","timestamp_created":1573078662,"timestamp_updated":1573078662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"56656674","author":{"steamid":"76561198852945850","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1215,"last_played":1573066908},"language":"english","review":"First off I am huge fan of the first Bioshock game, but went into this one knowing it was different than that.

Sure, It's not as groundbreaking as Bioshock but the game really keeps you invested in the story and characters. It is however the easiest Bioshock game 2K ever published. It's not much of a challenge in the normal mode and ammo and salts which are the bread and butter of this combat system are available quite easily, so no longer running to shops and hacking them when you are low on money. Enemies are bullet-sponges and lack the ferocity of the splicers in previous games. However shooting feels solid as ever. It is also the most linear Bioshock ever.  Also the most stable game, no bugs or crashes whatsoever in my playtime, which I encountered often in Bioshock and Bioshock 2.\nOne thing about the story that really left me unsatisfied is the arc Booker goes through. I really got invested in the stoic Pinkerton's man who is horribly broken from inside. His fate in the end is quite painful and unexpectedly harsh. But I get the point, tragic protagonists stay with you longer.
