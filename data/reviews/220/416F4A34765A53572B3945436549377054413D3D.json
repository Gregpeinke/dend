Все на твердую пятерку.\nНедостатки:\nОбъективно говоря - НЕ ВИЖУ [spoiler] нет HALF-LIFE3 , она не выйдет, никогда:(\t[/spoiler] \n\"Проснитесь, и пойте, мистер Фримен, проснитесь и пойте...\" - такими словами начинается Half-life2, и с этой фразой игрок словно сам засыпает и оказывается во сне доктора Фримана, главного героя игры. \n\nУдивляет, захватывает и приносит удовольствие в игре абсолютно все, при этом не требуя мощных характеристик компьютера. \n\nРазработчики Valve потрудились на славу и миру предстала яркая компьютерная сага, вдохновляющая своей реалистичностью. В игре нет сюжетных вставок, весь геймплей игрок находиться \"в голове\" Гордона Фримана, посредством которого и спасает человечество. А спасать есть от кого - землян за 7 часов победил \"Альянс\" - воинственная группировка, прибывшая из другого измерения. Вот и приходится Гордону ФримануИгроку пробираться с боями до Цитадели, главного управления Альянса, уничтожая отряды Гражданской обороны и агрессивных животных, завезенных на Землю инопланетными захватчиками. \n\nГрафика в игре до сих пор может тягаться с новинками игрового мира. Реализма прибавляет и прекрасная физика - на стенах от удара остаются вмятины, мелкие предметы на полу отскакивают, когда в них попадает пуля, деревья и провода колышутся от ветра, поднятого пропеллером боевого вертолета Альянса... Тени, отражения, волны на воде, блики света - мелочи сливаются в прекрасную и правдивую картинку. \n\nВ игре присутствует звуковое сопровождение из смеси электронной музыки разных жанров. Композиторы Valve умело играют с настроением игрока: мощное техно накаляет обстановку в серьезных перестрелках, а красивое звучание синтезатора подчеркивает атмосферу упадка и отчаяния. \n\nКроме музыки из динамиков во время игры идет реалистичные звуки непосредственно игрового процесса, о которых стоит написать отдельно. Тут можно отметить умело спроектированный объем общего шума игры - то и дело можно услышать перестрелки в отдалении, шум летательных аппаратов альянса, крики зомби. Кстати, о зомби. Крики зараженных инопланетной гадостью людей пугают. Я никогда не был слабонервным, но стон зомби задел и меня, не говоря уже о криках и мычании других монстров. \n\nЕщё одна интересная особенность: преградой в прохождении игры может оказаться... обыкновенная глупость. Да, вы не ошиблись и я в своем уме. Именно глупость. Подкупает то, что перед Фриманом (Физик со степенью, как никак) игровой процесс постоянно ставит задачи, без решения которых дальше не пройти. Например Игрок оказывается в яме, посредине которой стоит бетонный цилиндр, на котором - доска. Получаются эдакие \"качели\". Что бы вылезти из ямы, игроку нужно использовать доску как мост, чего у него сделать не получается, т. к. под собственным весом Фриманаигрока \"качели\" уходят вниз. Выход из этой ситуации - накидать на противоположный конец \"качелей\" кирпичей, что бы они перевешивали игрока. Тогда и получится необходимый трамплин для того, что бы выбраться. И это - одна из самых легких задач. \n\nВ общем скажу, что для меня Half-life2 была и остается флагманов мире игр.","timestamp_created":1451735927,"timestamp_updated":1451735927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522848606109619141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20213307","author":{"steamid":"76561198103882207","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1901,"last_played":1580928081},"language":"english","review":"Downvote the game more , Make it less popular\nMake sure Valve never release a new half life\nGood work everybody","timestamp_created":1451734838,"timestamp_updated":1503918578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508649587631225586","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20213108","author":{"steamid":"76561198164466113","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1162,"last_played":1575636163},"language":"german","review":"Super gutes Spiel , Die Kampagne und Story sind einfach der Hammer , diese Version is zwar geschnitten aber es macht trozdem riesen grossen spaß , Applaus an die Hersteller :) !!!!","timestamp_created":1451734399,"timestamp_updated":1451734399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484827578067779541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20212758","author":{"steamid":"76561198268324292","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1952,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":867,"last_played":1610181356},"language":"czech","review":"Je to dobrá hra lepší sem nehrál :-)\n","timestamp_created":1451733595,"timestamp_updated":1451733595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20211679","author":{"steamid":"76561198126795260","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1134,"last_played":1451744419},"language":"italian","review":"Lo amo.

Lets find out:\n\nGameplay:\nInstead of with guns you solve physics equations to defeat enemies. To play through the game you should have at least a minor in physics. Just make sure you write your solutions down, because there is no save option: you have to play through the game in one sitting. After you beat the campaign you can participate in the multiplayer, which is a traditional fps with guns. The biggest flaw of the multiplayer is: It is too easy. I never died, even when I used no guns, i still was always the best on the server.\n\nStory:\nHalf Life actually shares its universe with the Legend of Zelda games, but due to license issues John Carmac had to withdraw all references to the LoZ games. In Half Life 2 you play as Morgan Freeman, an accountant who stumbles into a conspiracy of interdimensional aliens who want to take over the world. The Plot leads to many spectacular locations like a underground science lab, a mystic forest or a Baltic city. As a permanent sidekick you are followed by Alex Vance. the son of the hero of the first game. The story is engaging for most of the time, but it gets rather uncredible at the end. Especially the big final is very epic but implausible, unless you can accept sentinent cucumbers as weapons against UFOs.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\nThe Graphics are photorealistic. It is literally impossible to distinguish between game and reality. I often had to pause in my everyday life to determinate if i am playing HL2 or not. I therefor think that HL2 is responsible for many amok runs. This is a big problem and I think Epic Games should adress this in a patch.\n\nConclusion:\nHalf Life 2 is a terrible game. In its current state I cannot recommend it, but I will keep following it until it is out of early access. For now, I give it 8 out of 200 points: Five for the graphics and one each for storytelling and the chicken AI.","timestamp_created":1451729102,"timestamp_updated":1451729102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515172421932220459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20210375","author":{"steamid":"76561198165133617","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":111,"last_played":1521903733},"language":"english","review":"great graphics for a game this old","timestamp_created":1451727869,"timestamp_updated":1451727869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20210115","author":{"steamid":"76561198057572350","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":489,"last_played":1585190000},"language":"english","review":"One of the greatest shooters I have played.

The game received critical acclaim getting a 9.4/10 from GameSpot, and 5/5 from Metacritic, the shooter title was revolutionary to it's genre, and influenced countless other shooters like it.      The game spawned 3 whole expansions: Half-Life Opposing Force, which focused on a character named Adrian Sheppard, one of the enemy soldiers during the first game.   Half-Life Decay, which was unique in that it was a two player co-operative game exclusive to the PlayStation 2 port of the first game, the game focused on two characters during the events of the first game, Gina Cross and Colette Green, trying to escape the Black Mesa Facility.\nAnd Half-Life Blue Shift, which focused on a security guard named Barney Calhoun during the events of the first game, attempting to escape the Black Mesa Facility, this game also came bundled with an HD texture pack that was compatible with the first game.\n\nFinally, in 2004, a new Half-Life game was released, and was a sequel to the first game, rather than an alternate perspective of the events of the first game.    The game honestly looks better than most AAA games nowadays, which is an excellent feat for a game released in 2004.  The game had an incredible story, and a very long development cycle, the game is almost completely different from it's beta, and for good reason.  The beta of Half-Life 2 was leaked before it's release, the beta was extremely buggy, and recieved astoundingly negative reviews from critics.   This caused Valve to have to redevelop the entire game from scratch, and what we got was a masterpiece.   This game actually has a surprisingly underrated soundtrack, and I think that's because it doesn't actually interrupt the game, well, at all, the music blends perfectly with the gameplay, to make the two assets go hand in hand, essentially hyping the player's enjoyment of the moment even more.    The game doesn't force the fact that it's a shooter either, it feels more like an adventure most of the time, and they don't really force you to shoot anyone too often, and if you're ballsy enough, you can most likely rambo the situation, and run like a mad man.      Half-Life 2 can only be summed up in one word, sexy.   Half-Life 2 gets a 9.6/10","timestamp_created":1451682204,"timestamp_updated":1451682204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20192746","author":{"steamid":"76561198041137045","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":852,"last_played":1451579451},"language":"german","review":"Echt tolles Spiel!
