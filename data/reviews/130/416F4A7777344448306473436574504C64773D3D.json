I thought I was getting halfway through it when I was suddenly at the end right after finding the Doctor NPC who you need to find locked in a train car. However, for how short it is, it's still solid and didn't drag on for longer than it needed to. The devs had an idea in mind and only made it as long as needed, which I can respect. That DOES make it, however, the shortest of all three original Half-Life games, but does tht make it bad? No, I don't think so. It just comes as a surprise. I would say, if you liked the original Half-Life, then play this one out of respect for th franchise, if nothing else. It's still good on it's own, just feels like it was meant to be treated as a story expansion rather than it's own full length game.

The same Barney that you meet again in Half Life 2.\n\nThis episode is very bare bones compared to the original game and the first expansion. It has less weapons than both previous entries, and can be beaten in 2.5 hours if you're good. The story is not quite as interesting as before, but it has its moments. The game is still Half Life, though; all the things that make the original good, such as great gunplay, are still here.\n\nIf you're a casual fan of the series then you don't need to play this, but if you really enjoy the series then I would definitely recommend it.","timestamp_created":1494553590,"timestamp_updated":1494621082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544749081134796143","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31606470","author":{"steamid":"76561198081290128","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":168,"last_played":1469965277},"language":"english","review":"7/10","timestamp_created":1494170343,"timestamp_updated":1494170343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459882587194442749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31604874","author":{"steamid":"76561198142614800","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":482,"last_played":1641000611},"language":"brazilian","review":"Alguem sabe como conserta o bug do elevador??","timestamp_created":1494165702,"timestamp_updated":1494165702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31598546","author":{"steamid":"76561198338396143","num_games_owned":284,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1494143453},"language":"spanish","review":"Más corto que las otras expansiones pero igual de intenso que las otras","timestamp_created":1494143518,"timestamp_updated":1494143518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31594493","author":{"steamid":"76561197994506042","num_games_owned":526,"num_reviews":184,"playtime_forever":173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":173,"last_played":1492988735},"language":"english","review":"It's Half-Life, but more! This time you play as Barney in a short adventure in Black Mesa. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to escape Black Mesa!\n\nReally, there isn't too much that's different from the first game here. The graphics got an upgrade? I guess? Really there isn't too much to comment on. It's more of an expansion pack than anything. More of the same, really. And in Half Life's case, that's more than welcome in my book.\n\nSame shtick.

The game sounds good in theory, but the gameplay is repetative (puzzle, bombarded by cheap wave of enemies, repeat.) Also the game crashed a couple times, and there are some parts where you fall somewhere and need to use noclip to get out (like in between a train car and the wall). The weapons are the same ones as in Half Life, unlike in Opposing Force where you got a bunch of new ones, which makes it a little more boring. It might sound like these make the game bad, but i would really give it a 5/10. I'm only rating down because there's no \"meh\" option.
