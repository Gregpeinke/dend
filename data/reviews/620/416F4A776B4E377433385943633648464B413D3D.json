From Battlefield's multiplayer, to Assassins's Creed's TV like story lines, and Bioshocks's narratives, they have all made me slowly stand up from my computer seat and proceed to clap after playing them (Maybe not Battlefield, but rush mode gets my blood pumping). Portal 2 is one of them. The general concept of the game is so original and innovative compared to other triple-A FPS titles. Rather than gun down your enemy, why not portal them somewhere else and let gravity do the work. The game does not require you to run and gun, rather to let you think out  and how to approach each level. The narrative, characters, and voice acting too, are absolutely amazing. Wheatly in my opinion is one the best side-characters of any video game in history (Well actually, the companion cube might easily sit right next to him). He'll say a funny line from room to room and you'll never get bored of this moron. GLaDOS will always be GLaDOS, sarcastic, condescending, and cold even to the end. Overall the single player gets a 10/10.\n\nCo-op too does not fail to amaze. Two minds and two portal guns are always better than one, unless this friend of your likes to rip your robotic head off every single test chamber. Grab a friend and play a couple test chambers, you'll see why everyone loves this mode so much. It not only can test both your minds, but also communication skills and  maybe even patience. Unlike other co-op games where dropping a med-kit is as far as cooperation goes, you have to actually communicate and talk to your buddy. You need to think each puzzle through and discuss each other's plan of action. And so if you don't even feel like doing any of the test chambers, you can just play rock, paper, scissors, say 'hi' to the camera, rip each others head's off, and  more.
