It started as a unique single player first person shooter with a sci-fi setting. The world is very colorful, though gives me an odd feeling, with lots of different references I didn't get (my best assumption is that they are related to the first 2 games) and an almost cartoony atmosphere with so many details in it. It made my head spin, but at the same time i kept wanting to explore more of it and see if this seemingly 'oddly inconsistent' world would unfold into something cool. Having finished the game and looking at it now, all i have to say is this game is great. Why?\n Because of the gameplay? - It does contribute but not quite at its core in my opinion. Having played only a handful of  single player fps type of games, im not the one to judge. But i enoyed it.\n Because of the atmosphere? - Simply fascinating. Tons of things going on and off on the screen. Some contain loot and upgrades while others are just for sightseeing. Overall gave me a mixed feeling. Like a beautifully animated cartoon that essentially makes you question yourself about your general interpretation of politics and philosophy. \n Because of the story?(Without spoilers) - Yes. What a beautiful, yet confusing story this was. Left me staring at the screen numerous times, just trying to digest what has occured and wonder about what is next. And the feeling... It was not one-sided though, as if the game was aware of it and continually responded to these feelings by showing things from a different perspective. I didn't want the story to end so quick, but i couldn't keep myself from not wanting to see how it unfolds. Playing on normal difficulty didn't help in that regard either. Oh well. \nBioshock Infinite has been a great experience. I highly recommend playing it to anyone. Haven't played a bioshock game before? I hadn't either but now i know of such a masterpiece. Don't have the taste for FPS games? I relate to you, but this game is worth a try at the very least. Neither? Then play it period.

haber jugado el primer bioshock y el dos que me habia decepcionado  en comparacion al primero no esperaba nada de este titulo si bien se  veia interesante no creia que pudiera estar a la altura del primero  pero cuando lo jugue solo pude decir wow estaba ante una obra maestra uno de los mejores videojuegos que e tenido la oportunidad de jugar en  mi vida la historia es lo mejor que hizo en este juego contada de una gran manera  como pocas lo an logrado jugablemente es bastante interesante el cambio que surgio la saga pues aqui cambio en ciertas cosas para bien y en otras para mal  , en cuanto a la banda sonora es mucho mejor que la primera pues esta toma temas religiosos  y  otras  canciones que se escuchan de manera buena acorde a lo establecido para lo que el  juego busca que sientas la ambientacion es perfecta se esforzaron mucho en ello debo admitir dalre una calificacion a este titulo es muy dificil pues estoy ante unos de los mejores juegos que he  tenido la oportunidad en toda mi vida pero   tambien el primero me impacto mucho pero debo aclarar que  tome la decision de ponerle un 9.5 de 10 pues  me parecieron de los mejores juegos que e visto y un juego obligatorio para todo aquel que considere a los videojuegos  como el medio perfecto para contar una historia el unico probkema que le veo es que  jugablemente se parece muchos a otros shotters  genericos en cuanto a las armas pero dejando eso de un lado uno de los mejores titulos disponibles asi como  una de las sagas de videojuegos que mas e disfrutado en mi

of the last good games I feel 2k will ever make, next to Xcom 2. Mostly because 2k was bought out by Take-Two whos CEO said he plans to shovel micro transactions into every game they make going forward, and are only interested in mostly online multiplayer games because they can leech more off people that way. \nAnyways, as one of the last good games 2k has made thus far, this game was pretty good. Combat was fun, never felt to challenging. I only came across 1 glitch where the Vigor I got for killing a boss disappeared into the floor, but they have multiple points where you can get them again if you missed it. My only complaint is that they didn’t tell you some mechanics of the game, and I didn’t know certain things until much later in. While Gameplay and atmosphere was solid, I could not understand the story for the life of me. I understood some parts, but I felt sort of in the dark and that I was missing some key info. Especially at the end of the main game and the DLC where everything starts to kind of get confusing. Though that may have been a personal problem since I never played Bioshock 1 and 2. Gameplay is good so it doesn’t matter.","timestamp_created":1538637564,"timestamp_updated":1538637589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485697299242019653","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45095483","author":{"steamid":"76561198404955659","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":726,"last_played":1559842483},"language":"schinese","review":"nice!!!!","timestamp_created":1538633016,"timestamp_updated":1538633016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45095221","author":{"steamid":"76561198143391414","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1568,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1606765574},"language":"english","review":"Best Bioshock game so far, holds up even in 2020.","timestamp_created":1538631328,"timestamp_updated":1606882306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45094558","author":{"steamid":"76561198129963296","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":74,"last_played":1535582133},"language":"english","review":"I was surprised how much I did not like this game.\nOnly one plus: Cool cloud city.

Может быть дело в открытом небе. Может быть в том, что модели людей перестали быть чрезмерно стилизованными и страшными. Этот мир выглядит просто приятнее - хоть и он тоже недружелюбен к протагонисту.\n\nГеймплей здесь наконец-то стал идеальным. Мы получили наше привычное \"колесо оружия\" для выбора текущего оружия и спецспособностей.  Спецспособности очень похожи на плазмиды в первой части, только называются \"энергетики\". И, наконец-то, мы можем пользоваться ими и стрелять одновременно. Нужные вещи по-прежнему продаются в автоматах или лежат в различных укромных местах, особого дефицита денег не наблюдается. Впрочем, я играл на легком уровне, как и всегда.\n\nНо главное, главное - сюжет! После выхода игры прошло уже несколько лет, но люди до сих пор этот сюжет обсуждают. Когда я прошел игру в первый раз - я просто сидел, уставившись в экран с титрами и думал \"ЭВОН ОНО КАК!\". Судя по комментариям - у большинства игроков такая же реакция. Я не буду пытаться этот сюжет пересказать - нет смысла, да и спойлеры. Его нужно пройти и прочувствовать самостоятельно. Могу сказать только, что закручен он весьма лихо. Если в первом Биошоке мы получили пусть интересную, но довольно прямую и очевидную сюжетную линию, то в этой игре всё куда сложнее.\n\nИ да, эту игру действительно нужно пройти дважды. Потому что второй раз ты уже смотришь на неё совсем иначе, ведь ты знаешь, что будет в конце. Обращаешь внимание на некоторые детали и реплики, которые при первом прохождении не несли какого-то особенного смысла или просто были непонятны.\n\nИгра хороша всем - сюжетом, графикой, геймплеем. Но есть у неё один чудовищный минус - это система сохранений. Эта игра сохраняется сама в контрольных точках, соответственно, сохранение единственное (хотя технически можно ещё и выбрать просто начало главы). Я считаю, что контрольные точки - всегда признак лени разработчиков. Ведь чтобы сохраниться в любом месте - нужно останавливать игру, считывать позиции элементов на игровом поле, записывать их, потом восстанавливать. Это сложно и долго. А контрольная точка всегда одинакова, разве что инвентарь поменяется. И плевать, что игроку неудобно.\n\nТак вот, я ненавижу игры без сохранений. Но именно для этой готов сделать исключение - очень уж она удачной получилась.\n\nОднако разработчикам удалось ещё сильнее удивить меня, когда я добрался до DLC. Обычно дополнения к играм - это довольно скучные короткие уровни, сделанные для того, чтобы фанаты сеттинга могли провести ещё немного времени в своём любимом мире. Здесь над дополнениями работали, добавив в них ещё одну часть сюжета, причем так ловко его закольцевали, что мы получили финал всей серии \"Биошок\", с отсылками ко всем предыдущим частям. Это по-настоящему круто. Также стоит заметить, что в дополнениях нам наконец-то прикрутили к игре приличный стелс. И первая, и вторая часть были в чистом виде шутерами. возможность красться была там как пятое колесо у телеги. А в дополнении можно по-настоящему тихо пройти - с дротиками-транквилизаторами, оглушениями, переползанием по вентиляции.\n\nЭту игру пройти нужно обязательно. Я ставлю 9 из 10 исключительно из-за неудобной системы сохранений. Но сюжет и качество с лихвой это перекрывают. Проходите с дополнениями, они стоят того. \n\n--\nМои обзоры на [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/30807969/]странице куратора[/url] (на них можно подписаться)","timestamp_created":1538242515,"timestamp_updated":1538242515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483713805675506592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45005186","author":{"steamid":"76561198253485373","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":797,"last_played":1538240865},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game, from the gameplay, the character and many more.

       生化奇兵系列在真实的历史上背景塑造了一个架空的神秘世界。奇幻，神秘，富有天马星空的想象力，却又与真实的世界息息相关，代入感十足。生化奇兵系列无疑是游戏中的一代经典，而生化奇兵:无限就是经典中的经典！\n       在生化奇兵:无限的世界里，你可以领略如油画般美伦美幻的风景，聆听悦耳动听的旋律。置身于充满未知却又令人熟知的奇妙世界，惊讶于美丽世界背后的惊奇故事，感叹于光明表象背后的黑暗。当你迷失于无限的循环之时，蓦然回首，一切的一切，都始于最初的决定。\n        如果你认为它只是讲述了一个乌托邦的故事，让你欣赏风景的游戏的话那可就大错特错了。它恰恰是典型的反乌托邦题材，游戏前期的美好是为了衬托现实的黑暗，但是在这个黑暗腐坏的世界里，还会有一个爱你伊丽莎白不离不弃，在我们寻找真理的道理上提供一丝人性的光辉。\n         在游戏本身的游戏性上，生化奇兵无限也是十分出色。作为一款fps游戏，他的战斗系统也是独居特色:即包含传统fps元素之外，又增加了如魔法释放，空中导轨等更加丰富操作手法。广阔的自由度，半线性的叙事手法，加上画龙点睛的支线寻宝任务，为游戏的玩法策略上提供了更多的可能。玩家可以选择一路潜行做一个默默寻求真相的追梦人，也可以大开杀戒高调的改变世界！那么除此之外，游戏中还有数十张隐藏在各个角落中的录音卡带，它们可以帮你解开各个谜团，了解背后的故事，收集党和剧情党不容错过。\n        这个世界上有无数座灯塔，也有无数条道路通往不同的灯塔，也有无数个你和我。或许我们走过相同的路，到过相同的灯塔，但是却从不曾相遇，一切的一切只是无法改变的无限循环。我是谁?Booker Dewitt or
