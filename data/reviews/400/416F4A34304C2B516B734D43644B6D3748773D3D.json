The first-person point of view is definately a unique way to go about solving puzzles and really separates Portal from any other puzzle game. My only hang-up was that I thought it should've been a little longer, however it did wrap up nicely and still left me satisfied.

The main enemy was so great and appreciated by the community, she became an even more impressive antagonist in portal 2.\nEven though I have completed this game, I still find myself coming back to it now and then. You can solve the puzzles a little bit different every time. But it is more the atmosphere that keeps you coming back. Yes, it is quite sad and glommy, but it is so clever and interesting that it is fun to try again.\n\nPortal 2 is more of the same, but also great. But this first little game is well worth it, and a good idea to pick up if you have only tried portal 2. Even if you have not.\n\nIt works great on most PCs and you don't need a controller.

The portal gun is a fundamentally original game mechanic that will, in the course of half an hour's play, see you flying hundreds of feet and bending the laws of physics (not to mention your own mind). The minimal plot won't bore, letting you focus on the perplexing puzzles and, of course, the famous computer system GLaDOS, superbly voice-acted by Ellen McLain. Basically, imagine if Skynet from the Terminator films had a biting sense of humour. In a video game where you play the only human character you ever encounter, she's a strangely comforting companion.\n Of course, Valve, one of the greatest masters of atmosphere and setting in gaming, create a haunting and frightening game world. If you thought the Black Mesa science facility from Half-Life was scary, the Aperture Science Enrichment Centre is a real nightmare of a place, a soulles labyrinth of terrifying proportions. Look out for telling hints of the facility's degradation scattered throughout the early part of the game. Later, more worrying signs will give you glimpses into the truth of your situation. As you progress, even though you're a silent protagonist, you grow in power and confidence as GLaDOS begins to fear you more and you see exactly what's been going on behind the scenes at Aperture Science...\nOne thing you will feel, however, is that you wish it had lasted longer.
