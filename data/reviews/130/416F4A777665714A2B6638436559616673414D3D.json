Viele Half-Life Fans finden ja Opposing Force besser, bei mir war es aber anders herum. Gerade die kurze Spiellänge fand ich angenehm, denn trotz, dass ich im Jahr vielleicht nur maximal 50 Euro für eines meiner liebsten Hobbys - das Computerspielen ausgebe - wird die Liste meiner ungespielten Spiele immer länger und \"Länge\" ist für mich kaum noch ein Kriterium, vor allem wenn man Spiele fast umsonst bekommt. -So gibt es jede Woche bei Epic 1 oder 2 kostenlose Spiele, von denen zumindest ein Viertel bis ein Drittel für mich brauchbar ist und auch die ständigen Sonderangebote verleiten mich immer mal wieder zum kaufen. So habe ich alle Half-Life und Half-Live 2 Spiele mit allen Zusatzepisoden und DLCs für gerade mal einen oder zwei Euro bekommen. Und mittlerweile sind mir kurze knackiger Spiele von z.B. 3 bis 5 Stunden oft lieber als Spiele, die sich ewig lange hinziehen. Blue shift war genau richtig für Zwischendurch und auch, dass der Schwierigkeitsgrad niedriger ist als bei Opposing Force kam mir beim Genre Shooter entgegen - ich spiele eher rundenbasierte Taktikspiele auf den höchsten Schwierigkeitsgraden. - Insgesamt also eine klare Kaufempfehlung für Blue Shift.","timestamp_created":1650810726,"timestamp_updated":1650810726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114399496","author":{"steamid":"76561198289756983","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":229,"last_played":1650807185},"language":"spanish","review":"pretty good :)","timestamp_created":1650807270,"timestamp_updated":1650807270,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114397465","author":{"steamid":"76561199049849344","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1650803586},"language":"russian","review":"В сравнении с оригинальной  Half-Life игра, конечно, гораздо меньше: меньше карт, оружия, механик и сюжета, однако это неплохой продукт.

Here you play as Barney Calhoun, one of the security guards at the Black Mesa Facility, and you help the scientist survive the invasion of the Marines and the Black Ops, while Gordon is trying to fight against the alien threat as seen in the original game. You will play through all the behind the scenes of the security guard’s journey and all he does while Gordon is away. \n\nTechnically, this expansion is very similar to the original Half Life: You will find no new weapons, enemies or music. The gameplay itself is very similar too, of course without certain Gordon-specific mechanics and weapons. Graphically it does come with a high-resolution textures pack, and a very similar look and feel to the original game. \n\nSo, this is quite a different take on an expansion when compared to Opposing Force, which has not only much more content and play time, but also a completely different feeling and atmosphere that made that expansion had an identity of its own. Although not as rich and complete as that first expansion, this one is still very interesting and worth playing, especially taking in consideration its reduced duration.\n\nEven though this release is not completely canon, and you can certainly skip it and still understand the main storyline of the saga, I think that is quite an interesting and very fun short release that makes the player understand the importance of Barney for the next games. Going through the facility from his point of view does highlight a totally different perspective and makes you realize that Gordon was not the only one with an important role of saving Black Mesa. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who played and enjoyed the original Half Life.","timestamp_created":1650303588,"timestamp_updated":1650303588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114072907","author":{"steamid":"76561198258929086","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":44,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44,"last_played":1629212029},"language":"italian","review":"Half-Life: Blue Shift ti fa immergere nella Black Mesa Facility dal punto di vista di una guardia della base, spesso noioso e ripetitivo, questo gioco riesce lo stesso a regalare momenti di intrattenimento indimenticabili, dando una medaglia a questo gioco per essere ormai un cult.","timestamp_created":1650302845,"timestamp_updated":1650302845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"114066479","author":{"steamid":"76561199014062330","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":368,"last_played":1627054478},"language":"english","review":"Blue Shift more like blue shit am I right gamers hahahahahahhahahahhahhahahahahaahgahaagkahkfahkfhjgfshgkafgbfiabigy\n\n\n\nYeah it's just kinda okay, buy it on sale or in a bundle.

Unlike Opposing force, there is no new content offered to the gameplay and to a certain extent it feels inferior to the rest, nevertheless it is enjoyable.\n\nHalf-Life certainly was a turning point in the evolution of the gaming and the genre of the FPS, later extending its content based on various expansions, among these is Blue Shift, one of 2 official expansions (Next to Opposing Force) in which we relive the experiences that occurred in the original title under a different point of view, expanding the story and complexity of this acclaimed series.\n\n[list]\n\n[*]The expansion has a similar appearance to the basis title, because, despite being a single expansion, uses exactly the same graphics engine and aims to have a visual similarity to the base title, thanks to this, an identical substance is achieved and it maintained despite being a different campaign.\n\n[*]The atmosphere and ambience in various sections of the expansion are truly immersive and make you feel frantic or tense, depending on the occasion, something that is not evident in the other official expansion (Opposing Force) and despite being present in the title original, its use has been polished in the process.\n\n[*]Clearly it lacks the graphics currently defendants due to the age of this title, however, their appearance with time to pass the same as the original title has been preserved in a good way and not confusing or annoying.\n\n[*]This expansion gives us a new perspective of the events of the title, giving way to a new story taking the role of another character, the story of this expansion is very similar for properties to the rest of the saga, a mute character who must overcome certain challenges and solving puzzles in the process, the story is simple, but it works in this type of sequence, however, it is far behind compared to the original title and Opposing Force in details, referring specifically to those little dialogues and acts which if you paying attention, you could more easily understand history and learn relevant data, details of which are present in this expansion in a minimal, almost imperceptible.\n\n[*]It features the same style of play that all Half-Life, a combination of frantic action and puzzle solving, with another tense or frightening scene through. Despite replicate exactly the same in this sense, in these cases it can be really good.\n\n[*]However, despite having achieved, the degree of difficulty is extremely variable, something which was already partially present in Opposing Force, however, this season the difficulty can reach the point of being unfair or unplayable due to a mismanagement of resources along maps and a very irregular learning curve, something which can cause constant frustration on the part of the player (This is said after completing the campaign medium and hard difficulty)\nNavigation and exploration map was fair, he had several areas of real interest, but despite this, you may get stuck on maps in different parts, this is somewhat disappointing as it is customary for such securities, exploration and curiosity give response benefits to finding certain foreign objects, and irregularities of this kind is completely abolishes this effect.\n\n[*]Something that characterizes Half-Life, is that after each delivery or expansion, is offering consumers the opportunity to interact with new maps, weapons, enemies and others, and a serious mistake committed to the development of this title, is the lack of new mechanics, weapons and enemies, even reaching the point of giving us a smaller amount than the original title (something which could make sense taking into account the context of the story, but it would be a bit empty to explain argument the ratio error such proportions)\n\n[*]This expansion and considerably old, and this may cause incompatibility problems or errors constants in modern computers. Something which is present despite being readjusted. In Half-Life Opposing Force several errors were evident and failures which reduced immersion expansion, and in this case, mistakes (despite continuing within the playable and noticeable) become very annoying repeatedly with flow irregularities, errors in the maps, among other problems.\n\n[/list]\n\nHalf-Life Blue Shift As expansion belonging to the world of Half-Life is enjoyable and entertaining, offering you more about this saga, however, as an individual title, it does not have much to offer and to emphasize, committing several errors and simplifying feature makes the title of the original.","timestamp_created":1649872840,"timestamp_updated":1653063883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113786141","author":{"steamid":"76561198986978369","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":287,"last_played":1649848782},"language":"russian","review":"Та самая \"Халфа\" от лица охранника, да не какого-то, а помогающего Гордону в основной игре.

Он все также стреляет, как Гордон (правда, без танков, вертолетов и вот этого вот всего,  только рядовые монстры и спецы), да еще общается с коллегами и учеными - причем куда чаще, чем сам Гордон. Собственно, весь квест Барни в полном соответствии с должностью заключается именно в их спасении - а в основной игре они нужны в основном для открытия дверей и проговаривания инструкций. Неплохо. Очень даже.\nПроблема не в сюжете, а в технической стороне. Точнее, в безбожном количестве багов - дополнение как будто не успели отполировать. В итоге на респауне оружие стреляет само по себе, гранаты иногда почему-то взрываются прямо в руке, а ученый, которого следует сопровождать, телепортируется в начало уровня. Обидно как-то. Даже камера на старте сама не поворачивается. Эта проблема решается в настройках мыши, но почему нельзя было выставить их по умолчанию? Забыли, бывает. Да и разнообразие уровней поменьше - половину небольшого хронометража придется бродить по тем же коридорам, которые уже видели раньше.

Геймплей так и не поменялся, оружий стало меньше, (Хотя с помощью чита impulse 101 можно вернуть недостающие оружия из Half-Life), что-то совершенно нового тут вы не увидите, однако если хотите увидеть историю глазами Барни, то рекомендую.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1649249716,"timestamp_updated":1649249716,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113426531","author":{"steamid":"76561199061861151","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":604,"last_played":1658661474},"language":"ukrainian","review":"this","timestamp_created":1649248935,"timestamp_updated":1649248935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113410611","author":{"steamid":"76561198159886295","num_games_owned":622,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1553,"last_played":1649214282},"language":"english","review":"I played as the guy Mr. Freeman owes a beer to!","timestamp_created":1649214310,"timestamp_updated":1649214310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113396315","author":{"steamid":"76561199126672965","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":698,"last_played":1658171932},"language":"english","review":"play it","timestamp_created":1649189809,"timestamp_updated":1649189809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113365611","author":{"steamid":"76561199249345142","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1649136935},"language":"spanish","review":"me gusta","timestamp_created":1649136948,"timestamp_updated":1649136948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113365265","author":{"steamid":"76561198336414437","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1649136020},"language":"english","review":"This is a nice add-on for Half-life 1.
