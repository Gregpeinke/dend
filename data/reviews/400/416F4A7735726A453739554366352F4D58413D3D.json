You play as Chell, a female protagonist that completes testings for Aperture Science Laboratories. The game features a nineteen level campaign that allows you to solve puzzles. Solving each puzzle progresses you further into the story. This review will discuss the campaign, the levels, and gameplay.\n\nPortal features a solid campaign that provides a good introduction to the world of the Laboratories. The game begins with an in-game tutorial introducing you to the portal gun, the tests and Glados, the antagonist AI computer. Portal excels at storytelling through the slow burn approach to the story. Certain sequences in the story subtly reveal major plot points such as what is Glados planning to do to Chell once she has completed her tests. These subtle hints provide excitement for those who have noticed them as it foreshadows the final scenes in the game. Portal 1 is less about story and more about introducing you to the environment. I get the vibe that this game is more like a prologue to Portal 2 because comparing Portal 1 to Portal 2, P2 expands on the gameplay and environment and emphasises the story whereas P1 introduces you to the setting, the characters, the type of gameplay, and the story. In saying that, I do really like the introduction to the characters as Glados is a refreshing computer personality in which gives the impression that robots control humans, or Glados controls Chell.\n\nThe campaign as mentioned includes nineteen levels and these levels are basic. It promotes creativity as the levels progressively become more difficult. However, I feel the majority of the levels are simple and relatively easy compared to the final five levels. The final five levels are challenging and they require more thinking, meaning they encourage more exploration on how to complete it. The levels are of good length. About 10 out of the 19 levels took some time to complete and it lengthened the game and made it more enjoyable because the overall campaign was short at under three hours. Portal features an 'advanced levels' mode which takes the final six levels of the campaign, reworks them and makes them much more difficult to complete. I did not play this mode because I prefer not to replay the same levels with no end goal. Generally though, it does add some variety and lasting appeal to the game for players.\n\nPortal incorporates some vibrant and detailed gameplay, particularly in the portal gun. The portal gun allows you to create two portals that transport you from A to B. Comparatively, Portal 1 delivers on the shooting aspect of the portal gun because when shooting the portal gun there is a visible bullet that travels and it creates a graphics effect when it hits the target. This exceeds the portal gun shooting animations in Portal 2 which once you shoot the gun it automatically hits the target. Furthermore, the portal gun has fitting sound that complements it. I only encountered one issue in the entire game, which is relatively minor, and that is the somewhat less-responsive nature of the controls. For instance, picking up objects would regularly require two clicks on a regular basis and when some levels have timed sections it can become slightly annoying.\n\nPortal has very optimised performance. I played on max settings at something like 200FPS after turning off V-Sync. With V Sync enabled, I managed 50FPS and minimal stuttering.\n\n[h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1]\nPortal is a very solid game. It introduces you to the robot-run world and the world of testing. The story is fun in that it introduces you to the setting and characters through a slow burn story approach. The game has nineteen levels which I completed in under three hours. There is an advanced levels mode featuring the six final levels in the campaign that are more challenging. I get the notion that Portal is a prologue to Portal 2 as it is establishes all the aspects in the game, which is vastly expanded on in the sequel. In saying that, I enjoyed this first instalment into the Portal series. At USD$9.99 as a standalone product, I recommend it. However, I highly recommend the Portal bundle at USD$22.49 which includes Portal 1 and 2.\n\n[h1] [b] Rating [/b] [/h1]\nOverall: 7/10\n\n[h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1]\n- The slow-burn approach to the story.\n- The gameplay that refreshes the FPS genre.\n- The very detailed portal gun with excellent animations.\n- The emphasis of creativity in the levels.\n\n[h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1]\n- Length of campaign.\n- The simplicity in half of the levels. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Não há nada que já não tenha sido dito antes. Mas um dia vc compra um jogo pra se distrair e se depara com PORTAL. Não esperava tudo isso, realmente é assustador a quantidade informação e a amplitude do game. Tenho certeza que Orwell (do livro 1984), Huxley (Admirável Mundo Novo) teriam devorado este jogo. O enredo é enigmático e assustador, ao mesmo tempo minimalista, temos apenas dois personagem durante o jogo inteiro. Não vou me apegar a jogabilidade, gráfico e tudo mais, sou leigo nestes assuntos. Está análise apenas gostaria de minimamente evidenciar as sensações que o PORTAL pode despertar.
