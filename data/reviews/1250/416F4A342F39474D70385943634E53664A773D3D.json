But the gameplay gets repetitive, fast, and the biggest problem I encountered with this game was the odd behavior of the general community that plays this game. They seem to have no concept of what \"co-op\" even means (which I find odd considering they are playing a CO-OP GAME), they frequently watch you die while getting swarmed by zombies and there is an \"every player for themselves\" atmosphere in a game that is marketed as a co-op survival horror, which makes no logical sense.\n\nOf course, there's more. The community enjoys vote banning players for no apparent reason at all, I've spoken with other casual players of this game and they say the same thing happens to them. I guess being respectful and helping your teammates gets you vote banned in this game. I thought it was an isolated thing, but it happens in many many servers and other people have complained about it as well. If you want to enjoy a decent multiplayer co-op game where players are respectful and players help each other, then DO NOT play this game because it is the exact opposite.","timestamp_created":1401649101,"timestamp_updated":1401649101,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":30,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579815506935119629","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10314882","author":{"steamid":"76561198106599750","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2073,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1556824816},"language":"russian","review":"Нет слов,просто МЯСОООО!!!!!!!!!\n","timestamp_created":1401646625,"timestamp_updated":1401646625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10313896","author":{"steamid":"76561198102377513","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":451,"last_played":1431989988},"language":"english","review":"Fun game, easy controls :)","timestamp_created":1401641387,"timestamp_updated":1401641387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10313806","author":{"steamid":"76561197995466071","num_games_owned":400,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":15209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15209,"last_played":1402079926},"language":"english","review":"This game is basic in sense that you and some other players hold out in some level while hords of zombies and monsters atatck you.
