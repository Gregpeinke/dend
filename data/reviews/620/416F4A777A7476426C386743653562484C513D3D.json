I never played a game where i wanted to stay and just listen to the characters arguing about nonsese like in this game. Even when they aren´t talking about something important. The riddles are pretty cool, espacially because of the portal gun. They sometimes take a while to figure out, but they are never too hard. Often, you just facepalm yourself because you thougt 10 minutes about a way out and then suddenly realise how easy it is to get out of this place. Afer you completed the singlepayer (which is not longer than 6 hours) you can grab a friend and play co-op. This makes even more fun.
