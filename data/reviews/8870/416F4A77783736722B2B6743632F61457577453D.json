Но раз в год и палка стреляет, и EA выпускает хорошие и не заточенные под донат игры(хотя в последнее верится с трудом). \n И так Bioshok Infinite. В первую и вторую часть я не играл, так что  оценивать её буду как самостоятельный продукт. Благо игра мало связана с оригиналом.\n Для начала поговорим о плюсах игры:\n1.)Простая, но интересная механика. Это просто шутер. В классическом понимании жанра. Есть вы, есть ствол, есть толпа болванчиков. Тут стоит сделать поправочку. Ещё есть энергетики дающие персонажу особые способности(но их использовать по большей части не обязательно) и аэрокрюк, позволяющий ГГ быстро перемещаться по рельсам и нести хаос с небес. Так же игрока большую часть времени сопровождает прекрасная Элизабет(Тут я хотел написать её реальное имя, но это спойлер). Но это скорее относится к следующему пункту.\n2.)Персонажи.  Харизматичные и хорошо прописанные персонажи. Милая и обаятельная Элизабет, загадочные близнецы Лютесы, Отец Комсток, которому к концу игры хочется набить морду и игра даёт такую возможность и многие другие второстепенные персонажи. В этих персонажей  веришь и сопереживаешь им.\n3.)Сюжет. Он отлично поставлен и имеет сильную и неожиданную концовку. В середине игры я забеспокоился что сюжет скатится в уже надоевшую историю про свержение режима, но это ненадолго и будет неожиданный поворот. А для тех, кто любит покопаться в Лоре история Колумбии откроется с другой, невероятной стороны. \n4.)Атмосфера. Визуальная и музыкальная часть на высоте.Но тут уже всё зависит от вкусов человека.\nМинусы(куда-же без них)-\n1.)Сумбурная концовка.(Всё что бы я здесь ни сказал будет спойлером. Я предпочту промолчать).\n2.)Линейность. Большинство локаций представляют собой коридоры, а остальные арены. Я был бы рад если в игре было бы больше обходных путей и способов победить врагов. Я не говорю про нелинейность сюжета. Она не нужна в данном случае. Я имею ввиду вариативность отдельных задач на уровнях.\nИтог: Я рекомендую эту игру. Более 10 часов ярких эмоций и отличная концовка.","timestamp_created":1550416796,"timestamp_updated":1550416796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49054807","author":{"steamid":"76561198071104563","num_games_owned":606,"num_reviews":164,"playtime_forever":459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":459,"last_played":1550451250},"language":"english","review":"Played this game 5 hours straight.

I've always been more into multiplayer games (just look at my library) and the very few single player games I have are rarely played. However, this game seems like one i can replay over and over. First of all, the story of this game is one of the best stories I've played through. Only story that tops this on the top of my head is the story of the Last of Us. At the end, the game hits you with a shocking twist that legitimately had me shocked. The game play is something I haven't seen in shooters ever and it was quite refreshing to see different mechanics such as vigors, the sky line, etc. The graphics look amazing and it's surprising that this game came out 6 years ago, as the graphics of this game still hold up tremendously. And to top it all off, the characters in this game are quite interesting. At first I wasn't that interested in Booker and Elizabeth but as the game went on I grew an attachment to both characters, sort of like in the Last of Us.
