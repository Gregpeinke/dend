They change combat aswell. Combat in the clouds DLC has some nice unlockables, but only get it if you really like the combat of the base Bioshock Infinite game.\n\n[h1]Negatives:[/h1]\n- Combat can feel a bit limiting to what it could have been if they had gotten rid of things like two weapon limit at any time.\n- Does drag on a little in a small middle part of the game in my opinion.\n- 1999 mode isn't difficulty done right. Turns the combat into a cover based one unless you get really creative with vigors.\n- Very linear for most of the game. Could be seen as both a negative and a positive depending on your outlook and taste.","timestamp_created":1546016979,"timestamp_updated":1575061150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47900102","author":{"steamid":"76561198312030458","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2019,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1410,"last_played":1557340535},"language":"polish","review":"Kozak giera!","timestamp_created":1546015496,"timestamp_updated":1546015496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47899426","author":{"steamid":"76561198194242723","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1592,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":844,"last_played":1573607642},"language":"brazilian","review":"Uma da melhores experiências que já tive em termos de jogos.

The way the environments are used several times is great and works so well within the story. The story is the best thing about this game. The enemies are kinda dumb but there are a lot of them and the areas you're fighting in are often big so they do move a lot and come at you at a good pace if you're not paying attention. The final battle is a bit of an anticlimax, I had to do it a couple of times because I lost, but when I did win it was kinda sudden how everything was silent. That said, the story ending was really great.\n\nThe only thing I really did not like is how sometimes some exposition was done while you were fighting, I tended to concentrate on beating the enemies rather than listening so I missed a bunch. That said, there's a LOT of talk in this game, not all of it important. The voices, sounds and music is all really well done, but sometimes the rhetoric was a bit tiring. However, you can pick and choose what to play for a lot of the background story, so that's nice. The visuals are stunning and the world is really well built.

Саму игру я прошёл за 10ч, а длц которые шли к этой игре я прошёл за 5ч. Пройдя игру в 1ый раз вы можете понять ничего! На полное понятие сюжета мне пришлось потратить чуть меньше недели. Графика тут для хороша как и геймплей. В целом я могу сказать что серия игр BioShock-самая лучшая серия одиночных игр.","timestamp_created":1545657414,"timestamp_updated":1545657414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47772768","author":{"steamid":"76561198415253587","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1246,"last_played":1545899091},"language":"schinese","review":"这是我玩过最难受的一款游戏之一，游戏到中期就卡死崩溃，网上找了没有任何解决方案，50块当是做了慈善吧，垃圾","timestamp_created":1545644366,"timestamp_updated":1545644546,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.433070838451385498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47768548","author":{"steamid":"76561198372242652","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1546925645},"language":"spanish","review":"El mejor de la franquicia de bioshock , supera con creces al segundo y por poco al primero.","timestamp_created":1545628296,"timestamp_updated":1545628296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47768437","author":{"steamid":"76561198101090638","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1545680757},"language":"english","review":"Would get mindfucked again.","timestamp_created":1545627918,"timestamp_updated":1545627918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47767668","author":{"steamid":"76561198305308816","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1032,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1641183330},"language":"english","review":"Extremely intriguing storyline, beautiful level design and great game overall. Had lots of fun with the skyline fights tho the shooting gets a bit repetitive at times. The voice acting and dialogue is also amazing.\n\nIt's one of those games where you wish you could erase your memories and experience it again.\n\n9.5/10","timestamp_created":1545625269,"timestamp_updated":1641006679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47766973","author":{"steamid":"76561198071616807","num_games_owned":320,"num_reviews":115,"playtime_forever":1744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1744,"last_played":1545621787},"language":"english","review":"[b] Bioshock Infinite [/b] is a very different entry in the series but still keeps up in what makes Bioshock so great\n\n[b] Amazing Story [/b] With many Jawdropping and very cinematic cutseens and moments\n[b] Gameplay still just as good [/b] Not too much different but some fun changes in weapons and vigors\n[b] The Setting and Atmosphere is out of this world [/b] A very unique world that's fun to explore and dig deeper into\n[b] The DLC's [/b] Burial At Sea Episodes 1&2 are worth playing, mostly Ep2. CitC is alright and can squeeze out a couple hours. I personally mostly liked it\n\n[b] Overall [/b] This game is a must play for Bioshock fans and even anyone who just wants to play a fun, interesting FPS game. The Main Story took me about 15 hours and all the DLC took me about another 15 hours. It can be refreshing to play a game that has care put into it, the Story is Strong and Mindblowing. Only thing worth nitpicking is maybe the difficulty at times, sometimes can be too easy or very hard depending on your difficulty. But nothing is worth nitpicking, the games too good!
