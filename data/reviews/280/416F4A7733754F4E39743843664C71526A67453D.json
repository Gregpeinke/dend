Play the original version or Black Mesa, NOT this one. Half-Life: Source is an incredibly broken port. There's one map about halfway through the game where the visuals completely vomit, and it's impossible to tell where you're going. Enemy placements are different or missing. Some graphical effects look worse (somehow). Some entities or models are misplaced. The physics are different, resulting in the player being able to make longer and higher jumps allowing you to skip entire sections of certain maps. It's REALLY bad.\n\nIf you want to play the original Half-Life, just buy the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/]GoldSrc version[/url] or buy [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/]Black Mesa.[/url] The only situation I can ever think of someone actually buying this is so that they get the HL:S content for Garry's Mod.

I honestly never played the original half life so I don't know what the textures look like or what the difference between the two games are. My main focus is going to be rating this game without any previous knowledge of the Half Life games. This game is good, not the best, but good. Of course the game is a little outdated but that doesn't mean its not fun. The game is a first person shooter/puzzle game where you take on the point of view of Gorden Freeman. Story wise, this game is OK. There is not much story in this game other than short conversations with the NPC's throughout the game. Sound and music in this game are pretty good. There are a lot of silent moments where you wish something was playing in the background but its not too bad. The main part of this game comes from the puzzles and gameplay. Shooting people and aliens throughout the game with different weapons that you acquire, keeps the campaign refreshing and fun. There are some parts where you will get really confused such as the puzzles or when you are fighting a boss but its nothing too taxing. The best part of the game is the ending (I won't spoil). All in all, I can see how this game was very popular in 1998. I would say it BARLEY holds up today. So if you like older games and don't mind the old style shooters, I would say this game is totally worth the play.","timestamp_created":1512629364,"timestamp_updated":1512629364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38090405","author":{"steamid":"76561198311489178","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":756,"last_played":1517976471},"language":"english","review":"⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⣦⣤⣀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢡⣤⣿⣿\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠠⠜⢾⡟\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠹⠿⠃⠄\n⠀⠀⠈⠀⠉⠉⠑⠀⠀⠠⢈⣆\n⠀⠀⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢶⣷⠃⢵\n⠐⠰⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⢟⣽⣆⠀⢃\n⠰⣾⣶⣤⡼⢳⣦⣤⣴⣾⣿⣿⠞\n⠀⠈⠉⠉⠛⠛⠉⠉⠉⠙⠁\n⠀⠀⡐⠘⣿⣿⣯⠿⠛⣿⡄\n⠀⠀⠁⢀⣄⣄⣠⡥⠔⣻⡇\n⠀⠀⠀⠘⣛⣿⣟⣖⢭⣿⡇\n⠀⠀⢀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣿⣽⡇\n⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣿⡇⣿⣿⣿⣇\n⠀⠀⠀⢹⣿⣿⡀⠸⣿⣿⡏\n⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⠇⠀⣿⣿⣿\n⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿⠀⠀⢸⣿⡿\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⠀⠀⢀⣿⡇\n⠀⣠⣴⣿⡿⠟⠀⠀⢸⣿⣷\n⠀⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⠁\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈","timestamp_created":1512513402,"timestamp_updated":1512513402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505359768867492676","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38081014","author":{"steamid":"76561198192316997","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":417,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":415,"last_played":1590170182},"language":"turkish","review":"hl source > hl","timestamp_created":1512485253,"timestamp_updated":1563143894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38050202","author":{"steamid":"76561198366731587","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":161,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":147,"last_played":1560050487},"language":"spanish","review":"Hola, antes que nada te agradezco mucho por leer mi humilde opinion sobre este juego.\n\n\n\n\nRecordemos que este analisis solo es mi opinion y no se tiene que tomar tan a pecho.\n\nPues... ¿en donde empiezo? a mi parecer, Valve arruino un poco ese \"sabor\" del Half Life clasico, y no solo fue por el hecho de que le implementaron el motor grafico de Source a el Half Life clasico que todos conocemos solo que... le pudieron haber hecho mas que una adaptacion.\n\nPrueba A: El motor Source no cuadra muy bien con el juego, los NpcS tienen radgolls y eso me encanto creo que le dio un toque realista al juego, pero como cualquier cosa, tiene sus pros y contras, los graficos del agua no cuadran muy bien en varios escenarios, ((( SPOILER )))un buen ejemplo seria cuando tienes que pasar por una Gargantuar y activar unos rieles, en tu camino a encender el poder central para asi poder mover el carro y asi atravesar por los rieles, el una sala de mantenimiento veras que el cuarto ese lleno de bichos raros parecidos a los gusanos, recuerdo muy bien que en el Half Life original esa agua parecia tener una aparencia \"cochina\", por lo que en su adaptacion Source no lo esta.((( FIN DEL SPOILER)))\n\nPrueba B: Valve pudo haber hecho mas que solo implementar el motor Source en el primer Half Life, bien pudieron hacer un remake como lo hizo Black Mesa, y valla que Black Mesa fue muy bien recibido y seguimos esperando noticias de el, y es que esto resulto un poco mal para los seguidores de la saga, al comprar el Valve Complete Pack te daran todos los juegos hechos por Valve a la fecha, OJO dije Valve, Black Mesa no fue desarrollada por Valve y a todos aquellos que nos compramos el paquete nos hubiera gustado mas tener el juego Black Mesa en vez de tener a esta adaptacion.\n\nPrueba C (final): Quiero terminar esto con un...

I decided to do the training course first, but instead of a full body hologram greeting me and helping me, I saw a disembodied head floating around, talking to me. I was ok about this glitch, because I encoutered some in my first play of the original Half-Life. After the jump-crouch-jump part, I was greeted by a lot of frame smear. I turned to the left, and it was gone. I managed to get that image out of my head and moved on. The rest of the course was normal, except that floating head. During these later parts, I found the only redeeming qualities of this game:  Lighting and water. I finished the training course and went on to the actual game. For some strange reason, I had EVERY chapter in the game unlocked! Has this game been spying on my progress in the original game? I started the first chapter, Black Mesa Inbound. I turned back, only to find more smear. I was done. I can't beleive Gearbox (Gearbox made the port, and Valve released it) would be so lazy. They did good on Opposing Force and Blue Shift but why wouldn't they try on this one (I know I'm playing this game after the Valve patch, which might've caused some problems)?! Don't get this game on its own, and instead get it on the Valve Complete Pack, so you don't feel that you just wasted $10 on a glitchy mess.\n\n1/10 Good lighting and water, but intense smear.","timestamp_created":1511915453,"timestamp_updated":1511915453,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614526450634002686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37914813","author":{"steamid":"76561198273971182","num_games_owned":1347,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":141,"last_played":1515665231},"language":"english","review":"Too many bugs, too many fun.","timestamp_created":1511912696,"timestamp_updated":1511912696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37889383","author":{"steamid":"76561198153636207","num_games_owned":419,"num_reviews":91,"playtime_forever":57,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30,"last_played":1582063422},"language":"turkish","review":"al işte hl seviyosan çok konuşmaya gerek yok","timestamp_created":1511881747,"timestamp_updated":1511881747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37882739","author":{"steamid":"76561198140691913","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":677,"last_played":1596237652},"language":"english","review":"All right, Gordon, your suit should keep you comfortable through all this.
