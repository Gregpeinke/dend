Half-Life games are always well paced, and this one is no exception. You'll travel through canals, highways, deserted towns, and cities, and it feels like one long journey. Whereas the Half-Life 1 games all felt contained in one area, in Half-Life 2, it feels like you're going on an adventure... but a dark adventure, with zombies, and adorable widdle headcrabs. The physics puzzles seem kind of forced... probably because Valve wanted to show off physics in the Source engine. I definitely recommend this game, and if you can get Synergy going (free Steam download btw) you can play co-op with friends and try your hardest to break the game. It can seem a bit dry if you're used to more action-packed shooters. It prefers a slower, quiet atmosphere most of the time, but that's not a bad thing. It's just different.

This game takes you through the journey of one Dr. Gordon Freeman as he fights his way through the combine to take out Dr. Breen's Fortress in city 17. This game is a pioneer in physics and level design and has almost infinite replay value as you will not play it the same way through every time. The iconic crowbar and zero point energy gun will have fans grinning when you throw objects that are just a little too big at groups of combine. With a well thought out  story and solid gameplay, this game will keep you busy for hours. Be sure to check out the other two games, halflife episode 1 and 2 to continue the story.

It hasn't disappointed since.\n\nJust when you think you were alone as nothing more than a scientist, everyone still recognizes you and considers you the hero. You have the plot laid down once you saw how miserable the people of the city walk around.\n\nThe new Source Engine's physics and graphics in the game show great fun and at times make you want to enjoy the scenery, if not for the Combine to keep your head back into the action. Valve didn't over-indulge on the eye candy, as Alyx Vance becomes more helpful than hot. The engine certainly motivated my friends to want their hands on the engine's tools to see what they can create, mods or movies.\n\nThe heroes in each chapter are handy to have around for the time being, and you know when you have to progress through the game further alone. Yet even though at times you are not with a companion, there is a special thing here and there that gets you places (dune buggy and airboat for example) and make you understand that there's more to the game franchise than merely running and gunning. This can be a negative if you're not into puzzle-solving.\n\nIt even has its own creep factor at times. No intentional jump scares, but as usual, headcrabs and zombies lurk around in hordes. The addendum being there are various types now, and they add to the challenge and scariness in their own way. The game has it's dark and grimdark areas, and with thoughtful ways to progress and combat through them.","timestamp_created":1401946995,"timestamp_updated":1401946995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530516445636749268","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10350492","author":{"steamid":"76561198052972037","num_games_owned":519,"num_reviews":95,"playtime_forever":2969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2933,"last_played":1561777863},"language":"english","review":"Not Half-Life 3 0.1/10","timestamp_created":1401927970,"timestamp_updated":1454616083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10349814","author":{"steamid":"76561198089668576","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":81,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":69,"last_played":1404080686},"language":"english","review":"its an easy and simple game, but with so much detail and lore.

Poraz kolejny wcielamy się w Gordona Freeman'a ,który znów musi uratować świat.Tym razem zmierzymy się z Kombinatem i innymi stworzeniami które za wszelką cenę chcą nas zabić.Ogólnie gra się bardzo dobrze jest przyjemna, poziom trudności jest zadawalający, fabuła napewno na plus. Podsumowując:\n+Dobra grafika\n+Świetna optymalizacja(silnik source)\n+Fabuła\n-Mała swoboda\n-Dość mały arsenał\n-Brak możliwości latania(samoloty,helikoptery)\nOgólna ocena gry 9/10. Bardzo dobry tytuł w który warto zagrać!\n\n*2020","timestamp_created":1401827208,"timestamp_updated":1606428234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10336100","author":{"steamid":"76561198004603553","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":945,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":945,"last_played":1375215923},"language":"swedish","review":"Classic","timestamp_created":1401816556,"timestamp_updated":1401816556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10334930","author":{"steamid":"76561198131204431","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":30,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30,"last_played":1401540362},"language":"turkish","review":"ehh iste","timestamp_created":1401809347,"timestamp_updated":1401809347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10334457","author":{"steamid":"76561198069448629","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1039,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":825,"last_played":1437827594},"language":"dutch","review":"badass and awesome game","timestamp_created":1401806232,"timestamp_updated":1401806232,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnLOKscYCeY+2Jw=="}
