So here we are waking up weaponless in a sinking train car, waiting for Alyx to get the door open. Theres plenty of action, the pace ramps up nicely as the game goes on. You get to see and meet more of the Resistance and their camps during the story. The outdoors are beautiful looking forests and mountains. There are new enemies and lots of action. If you played HL2 and enjoyed it, these episodes are successful at extending the excitement. You'll really be missing out on a great gaming experience if you pass these games by. So here were are in 2018 and it’s the end of line with no Half Life 3 in sight. Its been an amazing evolution of first person shooters. But what happened Valve? Half Life 2 had such an amazing start – but ending???

chicos, pues ya he re-jugado a la saga half-life, voy a dejar la critica aqui, vamos a por ello:\n\neste juego y en particular toda la saga, es uno de los juegos legendarios que sirvieron de boceto para el resto de juegos tambien legendarios que vendrian despues, que serian, doom, quake, unreal, heretic, return to castle: wolfestein, pero todos estos juegos no tienen argumento excepto este que tiene un argumento que es fantastico e increible y tambien toda la saga completa, con lo que me quedaria del juego, el apartado grafico que es sensacional en la epoca que se creo y idoneo para maquinas bajas, tambien como he dicho antes el argumento que ademas de apasionante y genial (casi como una pelicula tipo mision imposible o cualquiera de accion, en half-life 1 recordaba mas a la legendaria peli de resident evil) te despierta una curiosidad de que pasara despues, o sea, te invita a seguir jugando, tambien me quedaria con los vortigaunt que le da un toque comico, ya que pone a gordon freeman hasta la estratosfera (casi como un dios), tambien con un momento en el cual te pone la patatilla a 100 por hora, que es el momento en el cual los zancudos atacan la base de white forest, que requiere que el jugador este concentrado y pendiente de acabar con los zancudos y sus guardias, tambien me quedo con la nueva arma que aparece casi al final del juego que es el dispositivo magnusson que es bonita y impresionante ya que te permite ahorrar cohetes mientras acabas con cada zancudo. tambien me quedo con otro punto reseñable que es la conduccion del coche (en el half-life 2 era una moto acuatica) que recuerda mucho a juegos como call of duty o halo que esta bastante bien y hasta da envidia al jugador y pensara \"joe, lo que daria yo por tener el BMW que esta manejando gordon freeman\", ademas yo pienso que si este juego fuese llevado al cine seria exito en taquilla, ya que atraeria a los gamers tanto actuales como veteranos (en el cual me incluyo como veterano)\n\nahora bien, el punto malo y no se si estoy haciendo un zasca a valve (ya que esta es una empresa que la tengo mucho respeto y cariño, ya que este juego fue parte de mi infancia) es el final inconcluso que te deja un mal sabor de boca ya que valve no ha sabido la forma y el tiempo en realizar una continuacion de una de las mejores sagas de todas y que esta saga jamas deberia de terminar ya que gordon freeman es nuestro idolo sobre todo en los informaticos mas veteranos ademas de que se ha dedicado a otras cosas (alguna justificada como potenciar otro de los mejores juegos del mundo, como es el Counter Strike) en vez de que continue esta saga, pienso que tendria que ser valve el que le diera continuacion a la saga (ya que el juego es suyo) y no los aficionados, ya que seria una falta de responsabilidad completa por parte de la empresa que creo este legendario juego que vengan gente que no trabaja para la empresa a hacerlo, espero que la continuacion del juego (el mod de proyecto borealis) si al final los aficionados lo crean, este a la altura y sepa dar continuidad a la saga y si valve algun dia crea el juego que lo mismo, que pueda dar continuidad a la saga, que el juego de un argumento igual o mejor que el episodio 2 y que lo mismo que paso con black mesa source que fue admitido en steam, que no restrinja el mod de proyect borealis, ya que este juego, he visto capturas y esta bastante bien.\n\nen general, ¿Recomendaria este juego?, mi respuesta es un si con mayusculas e incluso y ya como gran fan de la saga desde mi infancia (recuerdo que cuando jugue al 1, ya por el 2000, tenia un celeron a 433 mhz con 128 MB de ram y una nvidia riva tnt2 modelo 64 a 32 MB y una de las cosas a las cuales recuerdas con especial cariño y nostalgia fue el sistema, que fue el millenium y tambien el half-life 1 ya que lo disfrute muchisimo por aquellas epocas) recomiendo que os compreis todo el paquete de valve ya que encontrareis bonitas piezas de entretenimiento durante horas como por ejemplo los juegos de portal que aquel que le guste los juegos de logica, deberia de ir a por este juego y sobre todo el rediseño de half-life 1 que es black mesa source que es una sensacional obra de ingenieria ya que han rehecho el half-life source desde cero de una manera magistral tanto que ya parece otro juego, ese tambien apuntadlo en la lista de la compra de steam.\n\ny si le tengo que poner una nota general, voy a parafrasear a Angel Llacer en tu cara me suena si me dais permiso, jeje, alla va:\n\n\"te pongo un 11\"\n\nUn

life 2 episode 2 was a really satisfying end to half life 2 (besides that last scene where [spoiler] Eli whitney dies [/spoiler] ). But it still has its flaws. In my opinion, our mutual friends was the worst chapter of any half life game EVER! Trying to navigate a forest and gather these sticky grenades to then shoot down striders is tedious. Everytime I got a grenade, there was a 70 % chance the stupid stalkers would shoot at it with me holding it (and at that point I had virtually no way to fight back) and a 20 % chance of the grenades missing my target anyways, and a 9 % chance of the grenade actually hitting the striders but then bouncing off, and a .9 % chance of the grenade hitting the strider but then the strider turns around and I cannot shoot the grenade, and a .1 % chance of me actually killing the striders. I was thinking about cheating to beat that chapter, but I had to prove to myself that I was better than that. And beating the chapter made me insane, as I was in hysterics once I realized there were no more striders. I liked the ending, and for a half life game, it was pretty good. I still don't know why we had to have stupid episodes, and not having it all lumped into half life 2, or get a half life 3. This is why i'm hyped for project Borealis. It feels good to finally beat every half life game. But this, and episode 1, were a bit short and dull. At least the gman cutscene and ending were good payoffs to the suffering.","timestamp_created":1528380329,"timestamp_updated":1528380329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42552143","author":{"steamid":"76561197999159520","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1505213468},"language":"english","review":"very positive","timestamp_created":1528368610,"timestamp_updated":1528368610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42536176","author":{"steamid":"76561198370911563","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":99,"last_played":1529682398},"language":"polish","review":"podobał mi sie przedostatni level HL2ET taki td z magnusonami ale polecam \n","timestamp_created":1528304393,"timestamp_updated":1528304393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42532196","author":{"steamid":"76561197982064127","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":316,"last_played":1444139788},"language":"english","review":"The game's so good, the only thing I would actually preorder is Half Life 3.","timestamp_created":1528293565,"timestamp_updated":1528293565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42527026","author":{"steamid":"76561198373177788","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":459,"last_played":1656344303},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun burda bitermi lan bari ep 3 çıkarın merak ettirmeyin ....","timestamp_created":1528276828,"timestamp_updated":1528276828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465648829936981201","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42524274","author":{"steamid":"76561198170658003","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":334,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1528264666},"language":"english","review":"Yeah just got into the half life series and just finished playing this entry of the franchise....

There's just so much to say. Half-Life 2 is, simply put, the best single-player shooter ever released for the PC. It does so many things right in so many ways that it might be possible to write a thesis on the topic of Half-Life 2 compared to other single player shooters. What Valve has created is simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. And once the initial shock of it all wears off and it becomes possible to peel back the polished layers of sight and sound, there is an excellent shooter here. Half-Life 2 doesn't do anything particularly new; it doesn't really innovate in many ways. But what it does is set a new height for all other designers of first-person shooters to reach. It still isn't exactly perfect, but it's about as close as I've seen in my tenure here.\n\nBefore I really get into the review, you should know the background of how this game was reviewed. Valve did not want to send out copies of their game (for fairly obvious reasons) before it was released to the public. In order to play the game, I, and several of my colleagues throughout the industry, took a trip up to Seattle to visit Valve in order to have some private time with the title. I was given a little room to myself where I could close the door, turn off the lights, click my little red slippers, and pretend that I was sitting at home. It worked for the most part, largely because I was so engrossed with the game that when I came out of my trance I often had to take a moment to get my bearings. Obviously, Valve was happy to bring me into a controlled environment for ideal playing conditions.","timestamp_created":1527614065,"timestamp_updated":1527614065,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42358559","author":{"steamid":"76561198128765095","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1654550989},"language":"brazilian","review":"o id desse jogo na steam é 420 muitoi bom","timestamp_created":1527591141,"timestamp_updated":1527591141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542483627796173096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42345664","author":{"steamid":"76561198173359885","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":45,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1527534963},"language":"russian","review":"wtf)","timestamp_created":1527534614,"timestamp_updated":1542900073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492187470197677612","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42337555","author":{"steamid":"76561198286529793","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":1206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":409,"last_played":1605881094},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2: Episode 2 is a pretty good game.

You get to go inside of an antlion home underground, seeing new members of the species not yet seen. They improved the suit by making the flashlight a separate meter so you can actually do things with your flashlight on without draining your suit energy so fast.

Игра проходится на два-три часа дольше чем первый эпизод.\n• Геймплей. Да, здесь появилось что-то новое. Например: у фонарика появился свой заряд и он не будет тратить энергию костюма.\n• Графика. По сравнению с другими частями Half-Life, графика тут хорошо улучшена. Здесь есть и неплохой HDR, и новые блики, и, наконец, нормальные тени. Графика тут изменилась в лучшую сторону и это не может не радовать.\n• Достижения. Без комментариев.[/i]\n\n[b]Минусы:[/b]\n[i]• Малая продолжительность сюжета. То же самое, что и с первым эпизодом. Только этот эпизод затянут на два-три часа дольше.\n• Отсутствие продолжения. Прошло 11 лет. Третьего эпизода даже не видно. Что очень печально.[/i]\n\nИгра очень неплоха, вот только отсутствие продолжения портит всю картину. 8/10.","timestamp_created":1527434439,"timestamp_updated":1527434439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604312419891357422","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42307116","author":{"steamid":"76561198103834964","num_games_owned":1138,"num_reviews":669,"playtime_forever":15,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1527419581},"language":"russian","review":"Однотипные карты что в сингле, что в мультиплеере(лес, камни в лужах, подскальные проходы).\n[b]Большой плюс[/b] в этом [u]эпизоде[/u], что [i]действия игры начинают стремительно развиваться с самого его начала и раскрывается тема зомби[/i].
