Guided by the omipresent voice of GLaDOS, the player must navigate 19 different test chambers outfitted with different challenges. New gameplay mechanics are introduced gently, allowing time for the player to become acclimated to the different way of thinking in this first-person game. The pace is slow, leading to greater feelings of accomplishment when the player completes a test.\n\nUsing the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, players can create portals on flat surfaces and travel between them. Stepping through the orange portal will cause the player to emerge from the blue portal and vice versa. The puzzles centred around this mechanic display a great level of creativity and enginuity, making each test challenging but not impossibly difficult.\n\nAs the players progress through the Enrichment Centre, they interact with the computerised voice of GLaDOS who is arguably the reason most people will remember Portal. The dialogue is sharply written and, at times, laugh out loud funny. The delivery of Ellen McLain is faultless and is the icing on an already delicious cake.\n\nPortal is short, but is just long enough to leave the players wanting more without making them feel unsatisfied. While multiple playthroughs will be trivially easy due to the player's familiarity with the puzzles, it is still an entertaining experience down to GLaDOS.","timestamp_created":1408560755,"timestamp_updated":1408560755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11796323","author":{"steamid":"76561198091558032","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":443,"last_played":1408796545},"language":"spanish","review":"OBRA MAESTRA.\n\nJuego de puzzles en primera persona, diferente a lo visto hasta ahora.

You know when you play Game Dev tycoon and, even though you never expected it, it turns out all the sliders are in exactly the right place and you get a nigh-perfect score for a really low budget game? That's portal. \n\nThis game is challenging, but not because of skill. You develop the skills required within the first few levels, so there's no problems with repeating a level over and over again, desperately trying to point accurately enough and click fast enough to win. The challenge in this game is not in the doing but in the thinking; the difficulty lies in figuring out what you need to do, and you get an immense satisfaction when you finally figure it out. \n\nAnd who could forget the humor? The great thing about the humor of this game is that it's witty rather than silly, and the game's not contantly jumping up and down yelling \"hey, look at me! I'm FUNNY!\" The humor is used sparingly, and is therefore much funnier. \n\nPLEASE, play this game. I know it looks pretty average on paper, but I must now join all its other players in telling you that you just have to TRUST US. \n\nIf for nothing else, play this game so that you can finally know why everyone's getting so worked up over cake, and so you can finally understand what the words of Still Alive mean! \n\nMy one tip: When you're stuck, get a different perspective. Place a portal near the roof and look through it, or fling yourself into the air--quite often all you need to do is see things from a different angle!","timestamp_created":1407926438,"timestamp_updated":1407926438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11675367","author":{"steamid":"76561198047596946","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":425,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":425,"last_played":1407851195},"language":"koreana","review":"2는 아직안샀지만 진짜 포탈1해보니깐ㅋㅋ 스토리좋음","timestamp_created":1407851995,"timestamp_updated":1407851995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11670289","author":{"steamid":"76561198127368324","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":93,"last_played":1409377375},"language":"brazilian","review":"Simplesmente espetacular! =D","timestamp_created":1407814804,"timestamp_updated":1407814804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11670145","author":{"steamid":"76561198039897950","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":176,"last_played":1407819758},"language":"english","review":"Honestly one of the few games you need to play before you die.
