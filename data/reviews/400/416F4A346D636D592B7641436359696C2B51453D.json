When I recently bought it for myself and played through it again, i remembered all of the stages, but now I could actually immerse myself in the atmosphere of the abandoned Aperture test chambers and realise how truly unsettling it was. It's something I had never noticed as a kid because I was too focused on the comedy and amazing puzzles, which are also great, but seriously, this game is creepy. I know I can't really call this a review, more of a realisation, but I highly recommend Portal.\n\nOverall, I give Portal a 9/10. It does exactly what it wants and more.
