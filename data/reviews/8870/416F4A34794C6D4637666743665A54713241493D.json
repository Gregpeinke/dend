Ao menos, é o que aparenta em sua superfície. Em sua profundidade, como em qualquer outro lugar, existem problemas graves que são preferíveis que sejam varridos para debaixo do tapete. A figura de Comstock, messiância, autoritária e carismática revela um traço bastante curioso a respeito de líderes. A utopia construída em sua mente se tornou um pesadelo na prática, onde sua mão de ferro manipula uma população inteira, tanto física quanto psicologicamente. Nesse cenário, Booker DeWitt, um veterano, chega em Columbia muito confuso com a veneração ao seu líder, a aparência inicialmente inofensiva do local e seus habitantes \"felizes\". Ainda assim, ele tem a missão de resgatar Elizabeth, que passou toda sua vida enclausurada em Columbia. Ao longo de seu percurso, Booker descobre que nem tudo que aparenta ser na cidade, nas pessoas e até na própria realidade é o que diz ser. O regime de Comstock pode ser visto como uma distopia aos moldes de George Orwell, onde até a existência é algo que foi tirado das percepções do indivíduo. A dissidência ideológica em Columbia é vista em primeira mão por Booker, desencadeando uma guerra civil, onde a ideia de que heróis são apenas personagens, e não pessoas reais, é revelada com sutileza e mistério, sendo um alvo até do protagonista, questionando suas ações e divergências com o vilão Comstock.\n\nBioshock Infinite, assim como os jogos anteriores da série, toca em um ponto sensível a respeito de como o homem estuda a política e seus desdobramentos. Uma invenção humana, onde pode-se criar um \"paraíso\", assim como um verdadeiro inferno. O último jogo trata isso de uma forma única, introduzindo conceitos quase que sobrenaturais, misteriosos e que se ligam perfeitamente a esse panorama \"cinzento\" da política. Afinal, o homem não é dotado apenas do que é palpável, mas também de ideias. Conceitos nem sempre respeitam aquilo que o indivíduo sente ou experimenta. E isso é algo que Booker, Elizabeth e outros personagens entendem ao passar do tempo e que fazem o jogo ser um verdadeiro marco narrativo na arte dos videogames.","timestamp_created":1618751106,"timestamp_updated":1618751106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90521495","author":{"steamid":"76561198176306881","num_games_owned":492,"num_reviews":111,"playtime_forever":3363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2306,"last_played":1629451514},"language":"turkish","review":"Good

admit a little bit confusing in the end, but when you start to find the audio diaries about some characters it all become more cleaver.\nthe only thing that disappointed me a little bit was the fact that there is only 1 ending and the things you choose during the story don't change anything during the gameplay, and no final boss, saddly.\nfor the dlc's i loved the first part of burial at sea, i always wanted to see rapture before the ruin, and it was beautifull, the difficulty is pretty nice here, you don't have too much ammo, and salts, you need to study most of  the fights, and the story was quite enjoyable,\nthe 2nd part of burial at sea was quite a disappointment, the sory was too much confusing, and no sense for me, the gameplay was a little bit booring, stealth yeah, but many times the enemies saw me behind a wall, and i dunno, if they have special eyes or something else,and when they see you 90% of the time you have to run cuz they kill you in 2 shots, was pretty bad for

First released on the PS3--I remembered being enthralled by the trailer. I even got the collector's ed. Also the first Bioshock game I actually finished. Now, 8 years later, here I am, re-buying the game and replaying it, but this time on keyboard and mouse combo (and with all the DLCs that was not all available at the time). It doesn't disappoint. \n\nI love the Bioshock series, they really put effort in creating a world. And when I say creating a world, I mean everything from small details, foreshadowing, character development, witty messages hidden here and there, voice cast, atmosphere, design, etc. Playing it for the second time in 8 years and knowing what I already know from finishing the game, brings everything into perspective. A lot of small details and breaking forth wall one would have missed if played the first time.\n\nThe rare times an FPS game that has a great focus on the story and characters.\n\nNote: the one small flaw that might be quite annoying is the audio bug--you will get seriously choppy audio for some unknown reasons. Annoying popping static from your headset--I checked, my headset is fine. I'm sure there's a way around it.","timestamp_created":1618626857,"timestamp_updated":1618626857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90434051","author":{"steamid":"76561198025379908","num_games_owned":410,"num_reviews":191,"playtime_forever":1208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":627,"last_played":1618864998},"language":"brazilian","review":"Excelente jogo FPS muito bom o ambiente desse jogo é perfeito,sons história perfeitos voce fica ligado no jogo nem vê o tempo passar.Recomendadíssimo!!!","timestamp_created":1618620552,"timestamp_updated":1618620552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90433711","author":{"steamid":"76561198978465842","num_games_owned":418,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":875,"last_played":1653055692},"language":"schinese","review":"如果2014年出的话，就是年度游戏了吧","timestamp_created":1618619933,"timestamp_updated":1618619933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90433643","author":{"steamid":"76561198854587744","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":232,"last_played":1627114883},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情很好，可玩性也很高。","timestamp_created":1618619814,"timestamp_updated":1618619814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90433133","author":{"steamid":"76561198297628284","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":171,"playtime_forever":1118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1106,"last_played":1654283502},"language":"english","review":"Least best one imo a nice 8.7/10","timestamp_created":1618618969,"timestamp_updated":1620891002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90431704","author":{"steamid":"76561198125315406","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":861,"last_played":1618950449},"language":"english","review":"Superb","timestamp_created":1618616535,"timestamp_updated":1618764268,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90431167","author":{"steamid":"76561198138700861","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":1110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":811,"last_played":1621359499},"language":"turkish","review":"Beynin yansın mı istiyorsun?
