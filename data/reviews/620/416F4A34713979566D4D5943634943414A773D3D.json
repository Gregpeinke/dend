Daher lohnt es ich auch immer den Dialogen zuzuhören. \nIst man mit der Story durch, die für einen dummen Spieler etwa 11 Stunden dauert, so kann man noch einige interessante Community-Testkammern spielen und mit einem guten Freund ;)\nKlare Kaufempfehlung für diesen Preis!","timestamp_created":1401211807,"timestamp_updated":1401211807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10253516","author":{"steamid":"76561198090816573","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":575,"last_played":1582289420},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую!

La storia in sé risulta abbastanza prevedibile nei suoi twists principali, ma non smette mai di essere interessante, grazie innanzitutto a dei dialoghi scritti benissimo, costantemente esilaranti ed imprevedibili, e in secondo luogo a dei doppiatori in grado di reggerli e trasmetterli alla perfezione. L'umorismo nero è lo stesso del primo episodio, anzi GLaDOS ha delle battute passivo-aggressive che sanno essere veramente PESANTI e SUBDOLE nei confronti della protagonista; ovvero Chell, che è lo stesso personaggio muto e impersonale del primo. Poi abbiamo Wheatley, quell'adorabile pasticcione estremamente britannico la cui parlata è un dolce massaggio alle mie orecchie. I dialoghi sono scritti egregiamente, in modo da rendere i personaggi il vero motore di una trama piacevole e coinvolgente pur nella sua semplicità... ma che non riesce a evitare di sembrare forzata e \"finta\".\n\nRiguardo al gameplay, direi che è \"more of the same\". Gli enigmi fisici ci sono, divertenti, difficili al punto giusto, arricchiti da alcune nuove meccaniche e nuovi \"gadget\" da manipolare che si presentano uno dietro l'altro e pian piano si accumulano formando una curva di difficoltà piacevolmente omogenea senza mai arrivare ad essere frustrante. Ci sono state un paio di volte che ho perso dei quarti d'ora dietro ad un singolo enigma, ma ognuno di questi si è risolto in uno schiaffo sulla fronte seguito da un \"Ma certo! Come ho fatto a non notarlo subito?\". Quindi tutto bene, no? Il problema è che le sezioni coi puzzle sono abbastanza brevi, e intervallate da altrettante LUNGHISSIME sezioni di storia in cui il giocatore viene railroadato su un percorso lineare mentre un qualche personaggio dice qualcosa. Sezioni che sanno tantissimo di ostentazione del budget, con ambienti enormi, showcasing del motore fisico, visuali spettacolari eccetera, in cui il gameplay si limita a trovare gli unici due pezzi di muro su cui lanciare un portale per andare oltre. Sezioni la cui utilità posso condividere, ma che rallentano pesantemente il ritmo e risultano inutilmente lunghe per una storia che non ha poi così tanto da dire; anzi, a volte dice anche troppo, perché si può dibattere su quanto fosse necessario esplorare così tanto il background della Aperture Science e del personaggio di GLaDOS.\n\nLa campagna co-op online è molto più simile a Portal 1, avendo uno humour sì nero ma molto meno pesante e aggressivo, avendo una GLaDOS meno effettiamente minacciosa e più divertente, non avendo quelle lunghissime sezioni di turismo, e non avendo una trama che sia più di una cornice; al tempo stesso, però, avere a disposizione non solo quattro portali e due personaggi, ma anche tutto quell'insieme di gagdet e strumenti introdotti in questo gioco permette degli enigmi più complessi, più intricati, mai troppo frustranti, e maledettamente soddisfacenti da risolvere. La collaborazione fra i due giocatori è fondamentale, sia a livello di azioni (coordinare i movimenti, affidarsi all'altro...) che di ragionamento (soppesare le varie idee di entrambi, vedere l'altro tentare strade a cui non avresti pensato...); meraviglioso il fatto che non ci sia nessun elemento che spinga volontariamente o meno ad una rivalità fra i due: non c'è punteggio, non ci sono oggetti che può ottenere solo uno dei due, non c'è livellamento, dall'inizio alla fine si lavora come una squadra. Il gioco poi fornisce molti strumenti per interagire col partner anche senza un set cuffie-microfono (per quanto la cosa risulterebbe a mio avviso molto difficile): si può vedere la visuale dell'altro, indicare un punto dove attirare l'attenzione o invitarlo a mettere un portale, dare un conto alla rovescia, e si possono fare otto gesti diversi.\n\nIn definitiva, però, è un gioco grandioso, con dei puzzle intriganti e una sceneggiatura di altissima qualità. Rievoca perfettamente il tono del predecessore, spesso lo eguaglia anche se talvolta con visibile sforzo, ma solo raramente riesce ad andare oltre.\n","timestamp_created":1401138383,"timestamp_updated":1401138383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10244666","author":{"steamid":"76561198109252515","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59,"last_played":1564845507},"language":"hungarian","review":"Kiváló szórakozást nyújt!

Yeni oyununun eğer çıkacaksa çıkmasını bekliyorum ve oyunu almanızı tavsiye ediyorum.","timestamp_created":1401003162,"timestamp_updated":1401003162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10226541","author":{"steamid":"76561198092993295","num_games_owned":351,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":438,"last_played":1442669219},"language":"russian","review":"Игра великолепна 10/10","timestamp_created":1400996917,"timestamp_updated":1400996917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10226040","author":{"steamid":"76561198095225350","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":1879,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1727,"last_played":1536167617},"language":"english","review":"This game saved my life.\n\nI am 43.\n\nMy ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realise that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1400992500,"timestamp_updated":1625373115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10225605","author":{"steamid":"76561198102217017","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1676,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1234,"last_played":1595475038},"language":"english","review":"I already owned this game version for the xbox 360 and I thought it was going to be the same thing on pc, but it has got some serious improvements over the 360 version, including the ability to create your own test chambers. This game has an awesome story with amazing chraracters, soundtrack, puzzles, environment, etc. and the dialogue is sometimes just hilarious. It's simply one of the best games ever made.
