game first began to really suck me in right about when a certain gentleman and lady showed up at a bar and I thought \"Oh, gee, I like these two a lot, I hope they show up as recurring comedic side characters\". And. Well. Going into this world unspoiled feels like a grand mystery, and you are given bits and pieces of the answers throughout. The moment I found a certain someone dead, and [spoiler]go through a tear for the first time[/spoiler], was indescribable. (It also solidified my love for the aforementioned pair.)\n\nI know the story and gameplay can be polarizing, some people disliked the combat mechanics, some thought the sudden dive into quantum mechanics and philosophy was jumping the shark. As someone who eats those tropes up and loves every moment of bizarre interdimensional oddness, I thought this game was fantastic. The combat felt rewarding (honestly, if you can, play on the hardest difficulty, it presents a very decent challenge), the setting was fascinating, and the twists and the turns of the plot were a delight.\n\nI admit I'm not especially satisfied with the way the [spoiler]Vox Populi[/spoiler] were handled - the idea of [spoiler]Fitzroy being \"just as bad\" as Comstock[/spoiler] and other moral questions felt glossed over and not especially well-explored, but Burial at Sea Part 2 did address this in more detail, which was much appreciated. The entire uprising (again, until Burial at Sea) seemed more like a setpiece than the organic exploration of the way in which Columbia would fall that it was supposed to be. The ending, though... that was good fun.","timestamp_created":1636767017,"timestamp_updated":1636959759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102675758","author":{"steamid":"76561198092010235","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8861,"last_played":1637549100},"language":"english","review":"Outstanding graphics, good story line, and right balance of action.","timestamp_created":1636758317,"timestamp_updated":1636758317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102671772","author":{"steamid":"76561198030457677","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":5416,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5387,"last_played":1656017474},"language":"french","review":"Troisième épisode de la saga BioShock, parfois injustement critiqué, celui-ci ne prend plus place dans la ville sous-marine de Rapture mais dans la ville aérienne de Columbia, version alternative de la précédente.\nUn jeu qui restera parmi mes favoris au même titre que le premier, et dans une moindre mesure le second.\nBioShock Infinite a pour lui des qualités qui lui sont propres et pour commencer sa narration que je trouve particulièrement efficace.\nEnsuite ses personnages. Il y a bien évidemment celui incarné par le joueur, celui d'Elisabeth qui l'accompagnera durant une partie du jeu mais aussi tous ceux qui graviteront autour d'eux, chacun ayant une vraie personnalité et une place dans l'histoire.\nMême si BioShock Infinite reste un jeu de tir à la troisième personne où l'action prime, les dialogues et les interactions entre le joueur et Elisabeth s'avèrent particulièrement appréciables, apportent une chaleur bienvenue.\nGraphiquement le jeu est magnifique et encore aujourd'hui difficile de lui reprocher quoi que ce soit, si ce n'est la modélisation des mains ou des pieds de certains personnages.\nL'architecture des lieux est riche et détaillée, même s'il est regrettable que certains ne soient pas accessibles, mais le travail fourni reste conséquent, d'une cohérence et d'une qualité comme le studio nous y a habitués.\nComme pour Rapture l'univers de Columbia a été pensé et réfléchi. Si dans BioShock le joueur découvrait une ville en ruines, ici ce n'est pas le cas et elle fourmille de vie.\nLes combats sont nerveux et rythmés, mais si un gros reproche doit être fait, c'est celui de ne pouvoir porter qu'un nombre d'armes limité à la fois, ce qui est particulièrement frustrant.\nLes DLC qui accompagnent le jeu permettent de vivre des aventures alternatives dans un Rapture alors au sommet de sa gloire, brillant de milles feux : les amateurs apprécieront. A noter, le second DLC tranche en proposant une approche basée sur l'infiltration, ce qui pourra déplaire. A titre personnel je ne l'ai pas terminé.\nPour terminer je dirais que si la fin du jeu ne manque pas d'audace, je reste malgré tout à demi convaincu de sa pertinence, même si elle est justifiée par la mythologie qui nous est dévoilée tout au long de l'aventure.\nQuoi qu'il en soit BioShock Infinite reste un incontournable à n'en pas douter, même si certains pourront lui préférer le premier.","timestamp_created":1636752203,"timestamp_updated":1636752203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102669117","author":{"steamid":"76561199081420734","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":37,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1636748485},"language":"schinese","review":"

I don’t think I can name any other game that is so uniquely beautiful and has so much detail. Granted I did not expect the whole franchise to take such a different approach, but it was needed. Instead of being submerged again you are in the sky. So, with that comes new gameplay innovations and how you approach combat. At its core most of BioShock Infinite retains its vibe and stays true to what made the first two games fun. But now the story is way more cinematic, the protagonist speaks, and you have a companion that constantly assists you in combat either by giving ammo or health etc. I found combat to be the best out of the three games, however it was also the most restrictive. The shield is a great addition and allows you to survive longer encounters. Elizabeth is also very helpful by either showing you where some items are or giving you valuable resources mid fight, she is also the definition of a vita chamber which I found understandable and a nice twist on death. On the other hand, there were some gameplay choices I found either restrictive or odd. For example, there is no manual saving or quick saving it is completely gone. I found that horrible because you must watch out for checkpoints and are basically locked in playing till you get to one of them if you want to quit the game. The lack of a mini map or an overall map in the menu was also frustrating, but the areas were clearly mapped out and you can’t really get lost with the navigation button. Still a simple map could’ve been useful. Lastly, I think having only two weapons is bullshit. Nose Booger Detective Shia Doit man should be able to carry more than a fucking rifle and a pistol. I found this weapon limitation not only bad, but the overall combat felt like a non-stop scavenging hunt for other weapons or ammo. I don’t want to switch out useful weapons for shitty pistols just because I ran out of bullets. I want to have 5 different assault rifles ready to go instead of running around trying to find a shotgun or a whacky hand cannon. But this is not that bad, because again Elizabeth usually provides you additional ammunition and there are always vending stores around where you can buy more. Speaking more about combat I found new variations of plasmids fun and I liked that they still seemed similar. Combining different powers was fun and most of those powers had worth to them if that makes sense. None of them were useless or underperformed in combat. Overall, I can see why many say BioShock Infinite is the best in the trilogy, I mean the voice actor cast is great and the story gets chaotic quick. I won’t lie understanding what was happening in the end was difficult, but not completely incomprehensible. Now all I must do is figure out the timeline and where we are with this mess of multiverses. \nP.S Elizabeth is so well animated for a 2013 game character its not even funny.","timestamp_created":1636542590,"timestamp_updated":1636542590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102522454","author":{"steamid":"76561198988200503","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":5269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":653,"last_played":1639901472},"language":"english","review":"if you like doom you will  like this","timestamp_created":1636523138,"timestamp_updated":1636523138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102521756","author":{"steamid":"76561198299598734","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":855,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1642398174},"language":"english","review":"very nice","timestamp_created":1636521725,"timestamp_updated":1636521725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102520334","author":{"steamid":"76561199185626993","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":575,"last_played":1638562426},"language":"spanish","review":"god","timestamp_created":1636518967,"timestamp_updated":1636518967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102519714","author":{"steamid":"76561198850356666","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1851,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":276,"last_played":1641150468},"language":"latam","review":"BioShock infinite es un buen juego, uno de mis favoritos de la saga, aunque fácilmente le podrían haber puesto otro nombre, y sería más o igual de famoso, la historia y el concepto del juego, no se asemeja a un BioShock, y hubiera quedado mejor como una saga más.
