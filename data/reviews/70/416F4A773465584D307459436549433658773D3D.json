The first problem some might have is that it may seem a bit dated, this wasn't a problem for me, but I know a few people who might not like that. The second thing is there are a few glitches, and I will give an example of one that happened to me. There is a spot where you come up against HECU Snipers and must elimnate them before moving on, otherwise they will just kill you everytime. Now to kill these snipers you must use grenades and throw them up into their nests. Now the glitch for me was that no grenades spawned for me, either that or this wasn't a glitch, and the grenades are you just very easy to miss, in which case that makes this even worse. The only way i could move on was to use console commands to cheat and give myself grenades.

It also contains mostly no spoilers except the final paragraph.\n\nHalf-Life 1 was a science-fiction FPS shooter first released in 1998 that revolutionized narriative in FPSs and Games in general. It was the story about a scientist named Gordon Freeman (our silent protagonist) escaping the Black Mesa after a dimension-colliding event known as the Ressonance Cascade brings forth several hostile creatures from Xen. \n\nWhat do I think of it? Well for starters here's the pros and cons\n\nPros: Great use of combining narriative with gameplay and immersion, story is great, gameplay is awesome, weapon and skill progression is well-implemented, boss fights are fun (with the exception of Gargantuas and the tesla coil), level design is well-made and memorable, good shooting mechanics and controls, shift-jump is awesome, upgrading to a new weapon feels rewarding and gives a sense of progression, the chapter names sound awesome (maybe that's just me).\n\nCons: Platforming is outdated and the controls for it are incredibly slippery, some levels can seem unfair, a few minor glitches (like a glarring one in Aprehension wherein Gordon can be stuck in a black room after the cutscene when the soldiers drag him through the hallway), HD Models is the default and turning it off still has a few things of the original game that are missing/modified, hit-box issues with headcrabs for melee, tons of frustration.\n\nDespite the amount of cons, the pros manage to outweigh them (at least in my opinion), Half-Life 1 was a revolutionary step for first-person shooters and narriative and honestly, I wish there were more games like Half-Life, especially in it's setting, plot, level-design and progression in general (not in it's platforming though).\n\nAnother con I forgot to mention (I left this last since it's incredibly opinionated), when I finished the game, I felt a sense of nostalgia, a sense of acomplishment, a sense of everything coming to fruition. Sure I was enjoyed the journey, but I wanted to see Gordon back home, and seeing him be locked by The G-Man himself made me go play Half-Life 2 to see what would happen. This would normally be a pro but then when I finished that game I ended up playing through the rest of the episodes to see what would happen, then I finally got to that goddamn cliff-hanger. And now everyday, I await for a Half-Life 3, so we can finally see Gordon reach the goal he wanted to reach ever since the first game, to finally go back home and for everything to go back to normal. \n\nIn all honestly, I recommend it, but if those cons or anything I mention is something that you wouldn't enjoy, then it's up to you whether to pick up the game or not.\n\n\n\nEdit: Now Nominated for Steam Awards 2017","timestamp_created":1473111842,"timestamp_updated":1511526107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25361208","author":{"steamid":"76561198287128292","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":514,"last_played":1637812106},"language":"koreana","review":"전설 of 전설.","timestamp_created":1473068706,"timestamp_updated":1473068706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25358905","author":{"steamid":"76561198095618170","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":121,"last_played":1556878475},"language":"italian","review":"WOW!\nJust, wow!","timestamp_created":1473052671,"timestamp_updated":1473052671,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.424694687128067017","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25355200","author":{"steamid":"76561198101629901","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1509149148},"language":"english","review":"those bee fuckers are annoying","timestamp_created":1473029294,"timestamp_updated":1473029294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49590599536895752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25353656","author":{"steamid":"76561198173093949","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1915,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1579,"last_played":1584454592},"language":"english","review":"Theres a reason why this game is viewed not only as a classic, but as one of the best games in history.

This is where all of valve started. Hell, You wouldn't even be reading this review if it wasn't for this game, as Steam probably wouldn't even exist. Innovative as hell for it's time, as being one of the first games to have an expansive story, this game gives you the controller and never takes it away. The storytelling is pretty good for it's time, and the gameplay is still solid too this day. There is an expansivly fun arsenal, and many enemies are very unique and rememberable, such as the headcrabs. The presentation and graphics are also really good for the time, probably being some of the best there was when it came out. The game also has a very lonely feeling, as you have to escape Black Mesa all on your own, with no cutscenes, very little people, ammo, and health supplies, and hardly any music, which only slowly fades in when something big is about to happen. The whole game makes you always feel careful, as the whole place is full of dangerous aliens and it's slowly falling apart. Half-Life is an amazing game that uses a system that Valve has built upon for years, only improving it more and more ever since.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1473012040,"timestamp_updated":1473012059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25350585","author":{"steamid":"76561198113437147","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":1274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":679,"last_played":1589909676},"language":"english","review":"A real classic, and although it was made in 1998, still a really great game.

I haven't even played the original game and I should be ashamed of that!\n\nI picked up the game for 3$, fired it up and instantly fell in love with it. When starting I kinda wanted to freerun the game as the mechanics felt so good. Of course they weren't realistic as the new games, but sometimes I just wish more games would be done this way( without the wobbly left right movement). AS I tried to rush the game I soon realized this game requiered some skill. So I had to be a little more strategic. I loved the storyand the monsters in the game. Sometimes I found it too easy to advance into the next chapter as some enemies were stupid like hell, most of the time I strugeled to advance(Ok, I admit. I looked up a yt tutorial).\nThe thing that bothered me the most was the audio quality. Now I'm no programmer, but I think they could have done better even in 1999.\nWeapon handling was also a blast and found some wepons to be quite unique. To recap all of this in a sentence I would have to say: If you enjoy a game with a fine story, good weapons, bad AI and good graphics (for it's time), this is the game for you.\nI somewhat enjoyed the game in the same way I enjoyed the oringinal doom. This is the game that set a new industry standard and would be a shame if you didn't have it in your library.
