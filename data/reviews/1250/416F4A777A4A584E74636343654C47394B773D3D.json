Agora em COOP da para passar um bom tempo com os amigos, tentando passar em dificuldades mais altas, baixando mapas do Workshop. Da pra dar umas risadas, as vezes você buga em paredes invisíveis, e o jogo as vezes tem um bug do multiplayer que os monstros ficam invisíveis, e fica injogável!\n Mas é um ótimo jogo COOP. Recomendo para jogar com amigos.","timestamp_created":1406580594,"timestamp_updated":1408647018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11452889","author":{"steamid":"76561198007917428","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4488,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4180,"last_played":1616890619},"language":"swedish","review":"amazing","timestamp_created":1406570756,"timestamp_updated":1406570756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11451721","author":{"steamid":"76561198070582180","num_games_owned":194,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1092,"last_played":1600814736},"language":"english","review":"I bought a potato and got an Achievement \n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1406565568,"timestamp_updated":1406565568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501649737358093262","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11451625","author":{"steamid":"76561198137200903","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1163,"last_played":1509631187},"language":"turkish","review":"Bu Oyun Bir Efsanedir Bu Oun İlk BAsta Bir Mod Olarak Karsı ıza Çıkmıstır Aynı Cry Of FEar VE Benzer OYunlar Gibi OYun Tamolarak Co-Op Horor Arkadaşlarınızla Ve ya Baska İnsanlarla Oynanır İster seniz Solo Olarak Tek Oynayabilirsiniz Am Su An Killing floor 2 Yayılandı Bu oyunu Alıcanıza Gidin Killin Floor 2 Yi Ön Siperiç Verin","timestamp_created":1406565107,"timestamp_updated":1406565107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11450248","author":{"steamid":"76561198104881724","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":74,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1432450218},"language":"english","review":"Great game for team play but sucks in single player mode (way too hard for me lol) But team/server play is great fun!","timestamp_created":1406558323,"timestamp_updated":1406558323,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11449518","author":{"steamid":"76561198077700251","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":6649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1517,"last_played":1561588241},"language":"polish","review":"Nie zależnie od tego, czy dołączasz do serwera i grasz z obcymi, czy masz u boku samych znajomych, KF gwarantuje super rozgrywkę.\n\n+ grafika\n+ muzyka\n+ SI Zedów\n+ teamplay\n+ możliwość rozegrania każdej mapy na wiele sposobów\n+ różnorodność talentów i broni\n+ kilka poziomów trudności\n","timestamp_created":1406554409,"timestamp_updated":1406554409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11449168","author":{"steamid":"76561198064697072","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3507,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2800,"last_played":1414416681},"language":"english","review":"F*CK YEAH","timestamp_created":1406552531,"timestamp_updated":1406552531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11448241","author":{"steamid":"76561198141345517","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":853,"last_played":1499042853},"language":"english","review":"This is a good game, you kill people who look like they are tired.

Games can last at least 40minutes long on normal diffuculties alone, trying to do anything above normal is like having a having a fucking deathwish though.\n\nYou see, thats where the flaws of the game come into play, it's TOO HARD, diffuculty in games isn't a bad thing, infact it's rare in today's games, but Killing Floor takes it to a new level, you'll start off on beginner diffuculty, this is easy, really easy. Of course it's easy, it's beginner, so you step it up to Normal, you're going to die and die and die unless you have a very compotent team and a high level, doing diffuculties like 'Hell on earth' and 'suicide' will require hours upon hours of constant grinding on lower diffuculties, thats not so fun.\n\nThat brings me to the leveling, it's fucked beyond comprehension, there are six, yes, a mere six whole levels for each class, this doesn't seem like a lot right? Oh no...they've stretched it out so you need to grind for fucking days to level up and it gets tedious really fast, I'm begging Killing Floor 2 to fix this god awful leveling mechanic.\n\nMy final complaint, the end game wave. \nWhile the previous waves consist of a seemingly endless wave of mutant variants attacking you from you all angles, the final boss is always the same.\nThe Patriarch, you fight him alone to start with but he'll summon peions as the fight goes on, once or twice this fight will be fun, but the same enemy, every single time, for every single mission?\nPersonally I'd like to see some variety in later titles with different end bosses for different missions, fighting the patriarch constantly gets old.\n\nAll my complaints aside, this is a great game, one of the best FPS survival shooters I've played, like Left4Dead with more variety and less 'A to B' and like Nazi Zombies but again with more variation and just a thousand times better, the horror is actually present too unlike most Surival shooters.\nKilling Floor goes on sale quite a lot so I reccommend you give it a whirl.","timestamp_created":1406409403,"timestamp_updated":1406409403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11423916","author":{"steamid":"76561198079956116","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":870,"last_played":1406970743},"language":"russian","review":"СУКА НЕТУ КНОПКИ ОТЛЮЧИТСЯ БЛЯТЬ\nУЕБАНЫ\nСДЕЛАЙТЕ НОРМАЛЬНЫЙ ИНТЕРФЕЙС СУКИ","timestamp_created":1406405576,"timestamp_updated":1406405576,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11423206","author":{"steamid":"76561198010286196","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":24134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20505,"last_played":1656006481},"language":"english","review":"This is a totally fun and cheap CO-OP game that's \"arcade\" and everyone can easily play and understand :)\nI saw some people complaining about the DLCs.
