Todos tememos, todos sabemos que acontecerá. Alguns acreditam que já começou com a volta dos mortos de certo sujeito uns dois mil anos atrás. Mas o que nós realmente fazemos contra isso? A maioria dos mortais vive em negação, dizendo a si mesmos que isso é bobagem, coisa de filmes B, e assim vão tocando suas vidinhas patéticas. Mas nós não. Os gamers fazem o que todos deveriam fazer, nós nos preparamos. Treinamos sempre que possível, estudamos nossos adversários, possivelmente nossos nêmeses, para assim ter alguma vantagem quando o inevitável acontecer. Left 4 Dead é sem dúvida um dos melhores simuladores do futuro, mas vamos tentar fugir um pouco da realidade e tratá-lo como muitos, um jogo.\n\nUm grupo improvável\n\nUm Boina Verde veterano de guerra, um motociclista coberto de tatuagens, uma universitária amante de filmes de terror e um analista de sistema junior. Bill, Francis, Zoey e Louis, andando juntos em busca de um objetivo comum: sobreviver. Infelizmente não é explicado como este grupo se formou mas aqueles que se aventuram por L4D aprendem a respeitá-los e admirá-los, criando mais ou menos simpatia por um ou outro mas ainda assim é inegável o carisma de cada um deles.\n\nDireção definida\n\nAo início de cada \"capítulo\" uma nova esperança é dada, uma nova fagulha acende novamente a chama que impulsiona o grupo contra os infectados. E para isso você precisa de coisas simples como armas, munição, kits de primeiros socorros e algum tipo de granada. E o jogo lhe dá cada um destes elementos e solta um silencioso, mas ainda assim muito sonoro, \"Se vira!\" O que você pode fazer quanto a isso? Correr para sua salvação e rezar para que sua mira seja tão boa quanto você gostaria que fosse.\n\nAdversários inteligentes\n\nComo é de se esperar os zumbis não são gênios, ao menos não são mais, e eles funcionam de maneira simples, se algum deles te ver irá te atacar pois o vírus que os infecta, derivado da raiva canina, os torna criaturas violentas com qualquer outro grupo. Além dos zumbis comuns nos são apresentadas algumas mutações mais agressivas e até um pouco poéticas. Witch, mortal mas evitável pois só quer ser deixada em paz e chorar, Boomer, fácil de abater mas é necessário manter distância pois sua bile atrai zumbis como um alarme de carro, Hunter, muito agressivo, ágil e capaz de grandes saltos, é como um zumbi comum entupido de cocaína, Smoker, muito perigoso à distância e próximo pois sua língua incapacita facilmente o alvo e ao morrer solta uma fumaça que atrapalha a visão e causa tosse, atraindo zumbis comuns, e Tank, rápido, incrivelmente forte e resistente, mantenha distância e atire com a maior violência possível.\n\nE pra completar este grupo nós temos aquele que pode ser seu melhor amigo ou pior inimigo, o Director. Uma engine de inteligência artificial que irá se adaptar ao seu jogo. Se os jogadores estiverem com muita dificuldade, tomando muito dano, sendo incapacitado ou ficando sem munição com frequência, ele tornará seu jogo um pouco mais fácil, disponibilizando mais armas, munições, granadas, itens de recuperação e também diminuindo a quantidade e frequência dos inimigos. Mas se os jogadores estiverem jogando bem, redobrem sua atenção pois o Director vai aumentar seu desafio. Apesar de não ser perfeito, em alguns momentos até previsível, ele faz bem seu trabalho e mantém o fator replay alto. Uma das grandes qualidades de L4D.\n\nUm conjunto brilhante\n\nCada ponto de L4D é bem feito e bem implementado. Carisma, imersão e dificuldade adaptável são características isoladamente ótimas e no caso de Left 4 Dead onde você harmoniza este conjunto e acrescenta um ambiente de treinamento para nosso inexorável futuro o resultado só poderia ser um grande jogo. Uma peça obrigatória de qualquer biblioteca de um gamer que tenha respeito próprio.","timestamp_created":1292696215,"timestamp_updated":1385428385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1168893","author":{"steamid":"76561197988344849","num_games_owned":1233,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":3299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3299,"last_played":1343804400},"language":"english","review":"The greatest survival horror co-op video game available.
