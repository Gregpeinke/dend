It is truly one of the best games on pc and if you havent played it you should. It keeps you occupied whislt giggling along the way and keeping you focused on solving puzzles. Co-op proves very handy too as it can be played with friends and family which will also keep you focused, again keeping you entertained and giggling along the way.

Portal 2 is everything Portal 1 was times three: 3 times the number of rooms, 3 times the number of gadgets, and 3 times more fun wrapped into a storyline of 9 well-thought out chapters.\n\nThe game begins like Portal 1, but in a distant future where Aperture has become derelict and in disrepair. Chell is revived by the core named Wheatley, wonderfully voiced by Stephen Merchant. She is brought through a series of chambers that begins similar to Portal 1, but soon diverges into new challenges with new devices. She is then brought through a history of crude alpha, beta, and gamma test chambers that originate from Aperture's beginnings in the 1950's through the 1980's, introducing us to three new devices: boucing, accelerating, and portaling paint. She is then led through a series of newly created chambers that make use of the new paints, as well a new launcher, light walls, and levitators.\n\nWhereas you could spend a day solving Portal 1, you could become absorbed for a week solving Portal 2.

It took everything great about the previous game and added onto it. Great controls, story, gameplay, and audio all made even better than before. Overall game-time has been lengthened greatly, especially with the addition of multiplayer which is an absolute blast with strong replayability. The multiplayer itself has built-in mic capabilities and lots of communication tools, giving players of any skill a fair shot at succeeding.\n\n[b]CONS: [/b]Later levels of [spoiler]old Aperture[/spoiler] may be off-putting in appearances to some. The addition of various gels come fast and are a little overwhelming, but you eventually adjust. Due to the nature of the late levels being used to tell lore, there's not as many easter eggs in the main game! This is a bit disappointing, due to what we know about [spoiler]Half-Life 3.[/spoiler] It's also a fair amount easier than Portal 1.\n\n[b]WORTH: [/b]This game goes on sale with some frequency, so it'd be wise to wait for one of the many times in the year the game goes down to 80% off. The big thing is buying the two pack-- the multiplayer expands upon the story of Portal 2, has achievements, works wonderfully and is a delightful experience for two players. You won't regret springing for the second copy!\n\n[b][u]OVERALL: [/u][/b]There is no reason to not have played this and the original Portal, as it's an iconic series that goes on steep sales often. Portal 2 an excellent continuation of the story and a testament to Valve's strength as a developer.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td][h1]SCORE: [b]10/10                                                                     [/b][/h1][/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]Full Review Coming Soon[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]","timestamp_created":1420866914,"timestamp_updated":1476335937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13919039","author":{"steamid":"76561198121260487","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":795,"last_played":1422601775},"language":"schinese","review":"13小时通一周目√，这款大作我也是久闻大名，果然名不虚传","timestamp_created":1420864258,"timestamp_updated":1420864258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13918824","author":{"steamid":"76561198058251947","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":388,"last_played":1514762426},"language":"english","review":"The story is amazing and fun to play.
