You can eye-roll at every audio-log until you just stop listening to them since all are either god-spewing. overbearing drivel or some unbelievably racist monstrosity. Behind it stands a semi-interesting multiverse plot and some retro-sci-fi aesthetics which are cool but still struggle to redeem the early game slog.\n\nMost of the things your player character says is some asshole, impatient and uninformative non-sequitor that hinders immersion and he takes his sweet ass time to become anything resembling human. The games really strong point is the main ending and \"Burial at Sea\" DLC which circles back around and provide a BS1 prequel of sorts with a very emotional twist.\n\nGameplay-wise you have more weapons to choose from but they are, compared to BS1/2, extremely bland and don't offer unique/interesting functionality same as with their upgrades. Combined with the fact that you can only carry 2 weapons at a time it feels very uninspired and drab. The passive upgrades (aka Tonics, aka Gear) are limited to 5 and are either overly situational/useless or usable but banal. The powers (aka Plasmids, aka Vigors) are fine but as a whole combat/character building feels severely lacking. \n\nChanging from manual saves to checkpointed only is also a step back since you literally are forced to play huge segments again if you close the game when you want to and not when the game wants you to leaving player agency in the dust.\n\nOkay Elizabeth is absolutely great but then I don't think she alone saves the game, or does she?","timestamp_created":1631856439,"timestamp_updated":1631990162,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.463157922029495239","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99483558","author":{"steamid":"76561198323857467","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":884,"last_played":1634533426},"language":"schinese","review":"    大    为    震    撼","timestamp_created":1631855435,"timestamp_updated":1631855435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99481973","author":{"steamid":"76561199201407886","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":232,"last_played":1632032242},"language":"schinese","review":"good    i like  it","timestamp_created":1631852230,"timestamp_updated":1631852230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99481443","author":{"steamid":"76561198060937114","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1371,"last_played":1631838991},"language":"spanish","review":"Lo vuelvo a jugar luego de 8 años (esta vez completamente legal, guiño guiño) y ha envejecido bastante bien a pesar de ser \"un pasillo\", la historia te cautiva al punto que le puedes perdonar lo lineal que es.

Не смешите… Меня спасло, то что я вспомнил про поливалку в начале кладбища. И то пока я за ней бежал, схватил аптечку и через секунду Элиза предложила мне еще одну… =_=\nС плазмидами подкачали... Помните огненный плазмид первый частей? Как прекрасно он выглядел и использовался… Просто «чудо» - щелчок и соперник уже горит (=^.^=)… Тут это просто грена (мина)… ._. Вороны и мустанг по сути один и тот же тоник, но второй выгоднее… Действительно были интересны таран и щиток. Первый представляет собой блинк с рукопашной атакой. Второй - магнит, стягивающий летящие в вас патроны; после, вы возвращаете их в виде грены. Также, если прокачать, стянутые патроны можно собрать.\nСюжет интересен, музыка хороша, рукопашное оружие оригинально, вот только плазмиды на «четверочку»… Поэтому 9 птиц из 10 клеток.","timestamp_created":1631816767,"timestamp_updated":1631816767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581667244434356689","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99459651","author":{"steamid":"76561199093046488","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1634847033},"language":"russian","review":"во что я поиграл :_\n","timestamp_created":1631815781,"timestamp_updated":1631815781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99456963","author":{"steamid":"76561198277085801","num_games_owned":313,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":1281,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1632150022},"language":"german","review":"Empfehlenswert","timestamp_created":1631812273,"timestamp_updated":1631812273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99455936","author":{"steamid":"76561199123179245","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1034,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1632666040},"language":"english","review":"BUY THIS SHIT RIGHT NOW IF YOU DONT OWN IT","timestamp_created":1631811149,"timestamp_updated":1632323988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99455904","author":{"steamid":"76561198072932690","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":486,"last_played":1631803332},"language":"brazilian","review":"This game is fantastic!
