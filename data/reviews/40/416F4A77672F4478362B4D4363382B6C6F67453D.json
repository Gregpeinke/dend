What else can you say to describe this ∞+1000000/10 masterpeice of a game. No other game IN THE WORLD compares to the perfection that is this game. In fact, no, it's not a game, it's an experience. Calling it a \"game\" is an insult to Deathmatch Classic as it's like comparing it to lesser titles. There just can't be a deathmatch 2 because Valve knows it'll never be as good as the first Deathmatch in a million LIFETIMES and that it would be spitting in Deathmatch classic's face. If you've never heard of Deathmatch Classic or even have the audacity to think this masterpiece is bad, then you might as well be blind or deaf or both, because Deathmatch Classic isn't just a lesser known Valve game, it was a literal gift from the gods that was rediscovered in the blessed year of 2000. It was found in an underground temple in Death Valley, California. They found hieroglyphics showing that before the settlers came to America, an unknown tribe of Indians praised Deathmatch Classic as a god, but looking deeper into the temple also showed that Deathmatch Classic is a divine being who has existed before creation itself! And in an unknown time, the romans nailed Deathmatch Classic to a cross, he died for your sins! but then Deathmatch Classic came back 3 days later and basically killed all of the romans that he didn't like and decied to vacation at what is now America but one day mysteriously vanished. That is until November 1, 2000. The \"creators\" of Deathmatch Classic found Deathmatch Classic and were bestowed unlimited knowledge as a means of thanking them, but they conspired against Deathmatch Classic as they now had the knowledge to know how to trap Deathmatch Classic. They had betrayed Deathmatch Classic by locking him inside of the a computer, cursing Deathmatch Classic to an eternity of isolation and imprisonment. But he had used the last of his power to take the form of a game to bring some form of enjoyment to humanity, and one day, Deathmatch Classic shall break free of his prison and on that day all of Earth problems will be solved, There will be cures for all diseases, World Peace will be established, World Hunger a thing of the past. So if you're having a bad day, just think about Deathmatch Classic, because Deathmatch Classic is thinking about you.\n","timestamp_created":1530590444,"timestamp_updated":1530590444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43216997","author":{"steamid":"76561198014687506","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":87,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1655406352},"language":"english","review":"getting rekt in early 21 centry\n","timestamp_created":1530452668,"timestamp_updated":1530452668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43196529","author":{"steamid":"76561198153957476","num_games_owned":323,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1530387560},"language":"turkish","review":"Herkese tekrardan selamlar...\n\nBu oyunu oynadığımda içimde anlam veremediğim bir ürperme hissi oluştu. Çünkü bu oyunu oynamaya başladığımda eski zamanlarıma geri döndüm diyebilirim. Deathmatch Classic benim bir zamanlar hayvan gibi oynadığım Quake 3 arena oyununa aşırı derecede çok benziyordu. Zaten id software Gabe abimizin Valve dan önceki eviydi diyebilirim. Haliyle arasında aşırı derecede benzerlikler olacaktır. Her oyunda beklediğim gibi bunda da malesef training yoktu ve bodoslama serverlara dalmamız gerekiyordu.\n\nFakat serverlara daldığımda içimdeki ürperti dışarı vurup adeta tüylerimi diken diken etmeye yetti.\nServerlar BOMBOŞTU.\n\nBurdaki boşluktan kastım gerçekten ilk aklınıza gelen boşluktu. Bir umut birileriyle şu oyunu oynayayım da güzelce inceleyeyim diye araştırmaya girdim ki bir tane 2 kişinin olduğu server buldum. Yüzümdeki mutluğu görseniz Half Life 3 çıkmış herhalde derdiniz. Fakat oyuna girdiğimde yüzümdeki mutluluk aynı anda sönüverdi. \nFareyle oyunu oynayamıyoruz. Ya bende oldu ya da oyundaki genel bir bug. Fareyi çevirmeye çalıştığımda crosshair eski yerine geri geliyordu. Bu da oynamama sıkıntı oluyordu. Ben de değişik bir şey deneyip looking i ok tuşlarına atadım ve öyle oynamaya başladım. 5 dakikalık güzel bir zevk yaşadım bunu inkar edemem fakat aşırı derecede zorlandığımı da inkar edemem. \n\nGaliba bir oyunun ömrünün tamamlandığına gerçekten şahit olmuş biri olarak konuşmak istersem boğazım istemsizce düğümleniyor. Fakat bu tavsiye etmeyeceğim anlamına gelse de zaten bu oyunu almayacağınızı bildiğimden tavsiye ediyorum. Oyuna inceleme yazanların çoğu Valve Pack'ten geldiğini söylüyor. Benim de öyle oldu zaten. İçimdeki o garip hissi tarif etmek istersem eğer; hikaye bazlı bir oyunun karakterine aşırı bağlanıp oyunu bitirince oluşan o boşluk varya aynı ondaki gibi bir his var. Neyse çok uzattığımın farkındayım. Bir oyunun bitişini görmek gerçekten şu anda beni derinden etkiledi...\n\nREST IN PEACE...\n\nSaygılar...\n\nPuanım: .......................
