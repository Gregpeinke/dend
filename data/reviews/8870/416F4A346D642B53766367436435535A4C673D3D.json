This game is perfect example of how the industry undeservedly over-hypes its games and how game reviewers are nothing but paid industry shills over-inflating rating scores by an absurd margin.  This game is mediocre at best, maybe garnering a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10.  While the story setting and concepts are somewhat novel to the gaming industry, the gameplay is trite, the game's setting/environment is largely uninteractable with the character, and the lack of any player freedom or agency is unforgiveable.  Why this game is even a first-person shooter (and a lack-luster, yet superfluously ultra-violent one at that) escapes me.  Playing this game forced me to re-evaluate Bioshock 1 and 2 as being a much more worthy and enjoyable gaming experience: requiring much more thoughtful combat strategy, possessing a completely immersive and evocative setting (with denizens that actually react to your presence), and wonderful over-arching story themes that aren't abandoned half-way through the game or (worse) mis-represented to teach precisely the wrong moral.

The gameplay is fine for the most part, though there is the section where it forces you to fight the same boss three times with infinitely spawning goons swarming you and very little ammo. I've no idea what was going through the development team's heads when they okayed that sequence. It's absolutely abysmal and drops the player into a braindead state, the last thing a Bioshock game of all things would want to do.\n\nThe story comes off as smart the first time around, but it's easy to poke at until it pops and farts away like a balloon. I just couldn't help but think of how the first game performed all its world building so admirably through the setting, characters, and gameplay while Infinite attempts to capture the same magic but does it only half as well. None of the ideals of Columbia are redeemable in the slightest especially in comparison to those of Rapture, so it makes it really difficult to view any of the characters as anything other than gigantic pricks. Where Andrew Ryan was a hounding the player and being an unlikeable fellow in the original game, at least he had some reasonable ideals that one could actually consider as not being horrible if they weren't taken to such extremes. Comstock on the other hand built a city based on nationalism and white supremacy. How on earth am I supposed to take a guy like that seriously?\n\nThe only likeable character of the bunch is Elizabeth, but it feels like they could have done so much more by her. The developers attempted to make her appear useful by having her throw ammo and medkits at the player, but this just breaks up the gameplay with implausible moments of player invulnerability and isn't something I was incapable of doing myself by just taking a look around. It also happened at moments of extreme convenience for the player, and dropped the difficulty down on a game that already wasn't that hard. She's also completely invulnerable to everything on the field and invisible to boot. Last time I played a game that put this much emphasis on an escort mission, it was called Resident Evil 4 and turned out to be a masterpiece. Your A.I. companion in that game could get hurt, but she did an incredible job of ducking under the player's fire if they aimed anywhere near her, and she was integrated into some of the puzzles and obstacles in simple and clever ways. It never felt like a chore taking her around because the game gave just the right amount of leeway to make mistakes, but was still punishing should the player take their time in preventing her capture or neglect her health. Back to Elizabeth, it feels like a slap in the face to a character like that if you're going to take so much time integrating her into the plot and making her the only likeable character if you can just remove her from the gameplay experience and feel hardly any difference at all. \n\nBioshock Infinite is seemingly good the first time, and if you really must play this game, you should probably keep it that way and lock your thoughts on it and throw away the key.

The platform or playing area/space is a LESS crowded scenario than before! In Bioshock 1 & 2, I constantly felt subdued by the environment; here there is air-to-breathe!\n\n2. I felt like there were more pick-ups in Bioshock 1 & 2. (somewhere the sense that the DLC I bought made the difference in pick-ups was a scary thought...what would I have done without them?).\n\n3. Ok, the central game, most is played in the BLUE-SKIES. Compared with the DEEP-BLUE-SEAS like in Bioshock 1 & 2 (no problem with that-the dlc has more DEPTH DIVING so to speak).\n\n4.Alright. The mad-magazine humor-me horror does continue but not to the extent it did in Bioshock 1 & 2. Bioshock 1 & 2 MADE FULL USE OF THE SCREAM QUALITY in that way of thinking! Where-in the previous installments this was an unreasonable rambling that could be ignored; with enough attention NOW there is an attempt here to LOGICATE the craziness here (MAKE IT SENSIBLE-more so than before)! The villains intellect here is higher than the ZOMBIE level it was before.\n\n5.Then the issue of saving little girls from the error of their ways (NOTE : a very moral issue) IS NOT EVEN HERE! Sure you're WITH Elizabeth and she's your partner, but it's NOT THE MAJOR ISSUE IT WAS TO BE SAVING HER! She is your partner (think co-op)! The mislead little girls aren't sprawling like they were! \n\n6.The idea of tears is an interesting one where I have seen it repeated in the game CONTRAST (CONTRAST feels like a genuine spin-off of THIS GAME, saying that in a good light, reminiscent).\n\n\nThe following you may want to note!\n\nA)-As a package I am pleased in purchasing Infinite! The DLC offers another 2 full on single player campaigns! Ace!\n\nB)-The cassettes with comment are interspersed throughout the game in the tradition of Bioshock.\n\nC)-If you're wanting a \"Bioshock\" game then this IS YOUR THING, get it! It does stray a little from the formula of the 1st two games but it's Bioshock all the way!\n\nGame on.","timestamp_created":1410968231,"timestamp_updated":1410968231,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.582847118377685547","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12129630","author":{"steamid":"76561198091049004","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":708,"last_played":1539880339},"language":"german","review":"Was soll ich sagen?

With weak guns and healthy enemies the majority of combat time is spent reloading behind cover, or reloading while running away. There are certain interesting mechanics included that allow the player to create cover, health packs, sentries, etc. but they are often too weak or useless to be bothered with. The first enemies met are the majority of enemies fought throughout the game so after 20 minutes the game's combat can be almost fully explored.\n\nThis couldve been a great movie, but is not engaging enough to be worthwhile as a game.\n\n","timestamp_created":1410836877,"timestamp_updated":1410836877,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534844279289245605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12114400","author":{"steamid":"76561198095216675","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":894,"last_played":1471568569},"language":"english","review":"This game is Assy Approved with Assy seal of Awesome.\nYou must download it.\nBrought to you by the Assy Approval Assembly: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AssyAssembly#.\n","timestamp_created":1410833212,"timestamp_updated":1410833212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480769246816635132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12114339","author":{"steamid":"76561198059528485","num_games_owned":639,"num_reviews":74,"playtime_forever":220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1411442093},"language":"english","review":"Great graphics.\nNice moves.\nGreat gameplay.\nInteresting story.\nI haven't played the first nor the second one yet cuz a friend told me it wasn't necessary.

A combination of excellent gameplay and mindbending plot make it well worth the playthrough. Purchasing a DLC bundle is highly recommended. \n\n****\n\nBioshock Infinite is a single-player story-driven FPS developed by Irrational Games, the same studio that developed the original Bioshock. Bioshock Infinite is a spiritual successor to the aforementioned game, it's set in its own universe but has strong ties with the first two games. \n\nI’ve played this game approximately three times over the years, coming back to it once in a while when I feel the need for an exciting FPS game that I could finish relatively quickly. In some ways, Bioshock Infinite is exactly that. The game is about 12 hours long, plus a few more hours if you try to complete the small side quests.\n\nHowever, Bioshock Infinite is so much more than a fun FPS. Its one of the best FPS’s ever made. Much of its appeal stems from its insane plot. Bioshock Infinite starts off relatively simple; “bring us the girl and wipe away the debt”. To that end, you are blasted off to the utopian flying city of Columbia. From there, the plot goes of the rails in the best possible way. The story is constantly surprising you, going in wild directions that you never expected. You soon find out that underneath that thin utopian veneer that Columbia holds up, lies a dark, ugly society built on oppression and racism. And the simple task that you were given is revealed to be far more complicated than initially thought.  \n\nAs is tradition for Bioshock games, the story touches on deeper (and surprisingly timely) themes of racism, redemption, American exceptionalism, theocracy and religious oppression, capitalism, and class warfare. How well the writing handles such themes is up for debate, but I loved that the plot was able to address these ideas in its story. It all culminates in a heartbreaking finale that seemingly comes out of nowhere, but playing through it again, you see the subtle foreshadowing the whole time. \n\nThe characters are a large part of Bioshock’s success. Elizabeth, especially, stands out. Her Disney princess inspired character design is attractive and she’s brought to life through animations, voice acting, and writing. Its both endearing and sad to see this naïve girl we meet slowly change into a hardened woman, not through her change in costumes, but her portrayal. Elizabeth is one of the best characters in video games. \n\nBooker DeWitt, played brilliantly by Troy Baker, initially starts off as yet another badass player character to self-insert in. He is soon revealed to be a far more complicated person and takes on a larger role in the story that what it is initially implied.\n\nBioshock Infinite’s story is paced far differently from the Bioshock 1 and 2. Those games saw you as a nameless protagonist wandering through the dead and decaying ruins of a once thriving decadent city, slowly uncovering its secrets and how it fell. Bioshock Infinite sees you arrive to the decadent city at the height of its opulence, only to be the herald of its destruction. It’s a different kind of story that might throw off people who preferred the more melancholic tone and slower pacing of the former games.\n\nAccordingly, gameplay in Bioshock Infinite is far more action focused. Combat in Bioshock Infinite is brutal, action-packed, and incredibly satisfying. There are numerous weapons in the game, encompassing the standard pistol, machine gun, sniper rifle, and shotgun, but also includes other weapons such as my beloved hand cannon and the volley gun. All the weapons look great and feel satisfying to shoot. \n\nMost fights also have skylines which you can jump onto and ride them like a roller coaster, letting you shot at enemies as you go up and reposition. Jumping on and off a skyline never gets old. \n\nVigors function much like the plasmids in Bioshock. You can unlock up to eight vigors and use them to augment the gunplay; such as throwing balls of fire, unleashing crows, or charging forward with an explosive blast. I have to admit I prefer the vigors over the plasmids; they are much more impactful in terms of gameplay, beyond the strictly supportive role that plasmids had. They also function very differently from one other, giving you freedom in how you engage enemies. I loved using the Charge vigor to zip around and then blast someone in the face with a shotgun. \n\nThe game boasts some RPG elements. You can purchase weapon upgrades as you go through the game, allowing you to strengthen certain weapons or vigors that you like to use. You can also find clothing items, which you can equip to give you passive buffs that incredibly impactful. All this gives you a certain amount of freedom you don't find often from these kinds of games.\n\nWith all these strengths, it’s disappointing that we are limited to only carrying two weapons at a time. Its one of my biggest criticisms of the gameplay. I feel that it would have been far stronger and more engaging had we been able to cycle between four weapons instead of two. The iron sights are also toggle only, as opposed to the standard “hold to go to iron sights”. Iron sights are arguably less important in a Bioshock game (I stopped using them entirely) but I would have preferred that option be there, especially for people who like using the carbine or sniper rifle. \n\nVisually, Bioshock Infinite has aged well. The city of Columbia is still dazzling when you first arrive and the characters still look pretty great. Not only is the music great and fitting for the setting, but its also used to great effect to highlight the overarching parallel universes theme. There's also this haunting sting whenever you melee execute an enemy that is both chilling and awesome. \n\nIn summation, Bioshock Infinite is a game that is absolutely worth your time. Its a game with fantastic gameplay and deep, creative story, and touches on themes that'll have you pondering about it for a long time. Its a relatively short game, so its perfect for those with busy schedules who don't want to commit to a 40+ hour playthrough.","timestamp_created":1410807425,"timestamp_updated":1595517760,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12111023","author":{"steamid":"76561197971995680","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1413,"last_played":1462126232},"language":"english","review":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\nAmazing.","timestamp_created":1410806490,"timestamp_updated":1410806490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12110955","author":{"steamid":"76561198042633943","num_games_owned":1349,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":826,"last_played":1427470447},"language":"german","review":"ICH BIN ENTTÄUSCHT.\n\nGanz ehrlich, ich bin ein riesiger Bioshock-Fan.

The game does not really pick up until you meet Elizabeth (Booker being sort of a surrogate main character up till that point). The story and atmosphere are extremely compelling and the game does not ignore some of the sensitive political and social issues that existed during that era, though it only makes short notice of it and could have served an interesting subplot. It's nothing like its horror-ridden undersea predecessors and markets to a different audience but enjoyable all the same, perhaps even more meaningful, depending on what sort of experience you pull away from it.\n\nOnly downside is possibly combat. While it's doable, it's not always enjoyable & quite a few gunfights feel as if they've been copy-pasted from other sections of the game making them feel repetitive and pointless.\n\nBut it's okay because of the story and because of Elizabeth. Everything else pales in comparison to what this game has to offer in terms of depth of narrative and Elizabeth's characterization. Very few games truly capture the heart and I think that this can be considered among them.","timestamp_created":1410801588,"timestamp_updated":1451951980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553805768489837646","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12110151","author":{"steamid":"76561198060284429","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":77,"last_played":1505420368},"language":"english","review":"Love it.
