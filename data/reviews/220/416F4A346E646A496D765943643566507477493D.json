games story is focused on Gordan Freeman again who’s the protagonist from Half-Life. Some odd years after the events of the first game he’s dropped in a city at some point in the future where aliens have taken over the earth. The aliens who take over earth are known as the Combine and they aren't the same aliens from the first Half-Life that attacked Black Mesa. Apparently the Black Mesa incident is what got the Combine’s attention and they came to earth and defeated all the world's militaries in a war that lasted seven hours. After it was over the Combine put a suppression field in place that made it impossible for humans to breed and have kids. It’s used as a way to control the human population and scare people from rebelling out of fear of mass extinction. As well as putting a puppet world government in place to do their bidding. This government began turning some of the humans into half human half cyborg soldiers to oppress and terrorize ordinary citizens. These are the enemies you’ll be fighting a lot of the time. Just so you're not confused, the soldiers with guns in this game are NOT aliens. They’re humans that have been turned into cyborgs and given Combine alien technology and weapons to do the bidding of the puppet government. You only actually see the actual Combine aliens a few times.\n\nThe story has you helping the members of the resistance who are trying to fight against the Combine’s puppet government. With most of the main characters being people who were part of the Black Mesa staff during Black Mesa incident. The leader of the Combine’s puppet government is a man named Dr.Breen who sees himself as “the representative of humanity.” He’s also the main antagonist and was the director in charge of Black Mesa during the first game. Valve mostly wrote the characters by taking the generic copy and pasted stock character models from the first game and giving them their own names, personalities, and back stories. You even see the alien enemies from the first game make a return as members of the resistance. Because apparently the Combine went to war with them too a long time ago and now that they’re both on earth they’re still fighting each other. There are some new characters however and most if not all of them are likable additions. Most of the story will have sections where you’ll be standing around watching other characters talk in replacement of cutscenes. These moments are well animated and voice acted. All of the characters are believably written and have their own personalities and motives.\n\nHalf-Life 2’s gameplay was fun as well, it took that pacing that Half-Life 1 did and turned it up a few notches. Making sure the gameplay is constantly changing each chapter by introducing more weapons and new environments. As well as unique gameplay scenarios and making sure that you don't fight the same enemy over and over again. It all works to keep everything feeling fresh from start to finish. The only time it ever felt like it was dragging for me was during a part where you're driving an airboat through a canal, which felt like it went on longer than it should have. The vehicles in this game BTW control like ass, way too much understeer and the traction feels weird. The terrible platforming sections from the first game are mostly gone and have been replaced by some light environment puzzles that are usually solved through using the physics engine.\n\nOne of the weapons you’ll be given will be the gravity gun which allows you to pick up anything that isn’t nailed down and fire it at enemies. Explosive barrels, regular barrels, saw blades, wooden crates, wooden pallets, chairs, rocks, paint cans all can be picked up and launched at enemies to attack them with varying degrees of success. Some of these items can be used to climb up to somewhere by stacking them in some areas. You can also use the gravity gun to grab and pull supplies such as ammo and grenades from hard to reach places.\n\nOther than tat there are other weapons most of which are carried over from the first game. Such as the crowbar, pistol, 357 magnum revolver, shotgun, exc… There are only three new additions, the first one is the gravity gun and the second is that the MP5 has been replaced with an MP7 which functions more or less the same. The third one is the overwatch rifle which has an alternative fire mode that shoots a ball of energy that disintegrates enemies when it hits them. The remote explosives that you could throw down and detonate with a press of a button from the first game are gone which is fine because they weren't all that useful. The alien weapons from the first game are gone as well and that’s because you're fighting against a completely different faction of aliens this time. The grenades also don't feel very good to throw this time. Since the fact that they’re a physics item makes it so they bounce and slide around when thrown.\n\nThe shooting is still not all that good and suffers from the same problem that the first game has. The shooting is hitscan based, which means that it has more to do with line of sight then it does with ballistics. An example of this can be seen in a chapter where you need to open a door so your airboat can get through. They’ll be an enemy on a mounted machine gun firing at you and you can grab a paint can off of a shelf and hold it out in front of you. If you hold it out so it’s blocking your view of the guy on the machine gun he can’t hit you. He’ll still fire at you, he just can’t hit you because you can't see him. Other than that one incident the Combine military are mostly very component in combat. They’ll rush you, flank you, fall back, and lob grenades at you as appropriate. But their challenge has more to do with the fact that they’ll usually come at you in numbers then it does the AI. There’s also a few new enemies other than the combine as well as the return of some of the enemies from the first game.\n\nThis all combined with good sound design, an awesome soundtrack, subtle environmental storytelling, and world building. It all amounts to a game with a world and narrative that kept me invested for the entirety of it’s run time. After I finished the main game I went and played Half-Life 2: Episode One and Half-Life 2: Episode Two both of which continued the story of the main game. The ending of Episode Two is known as one of the biggest cliffhangers in all of video game history and is one of the reasons I wasn’t sure if I wanted to play this.\n\nI won't spoil anything but Half-Life was released in 2007, that’s over a decade ago as of writing this. They were planning on releasing another expansion called Half-Life 2: Episode Three but they never got around to it and never will. Half-Life’s publisher and developer Valve owns the Steam website and Steam is basically a money printer for them. Why develop games and sell them in stores to keep the lights on when you can just run the store yourself?\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode Three & Half-Life 3 are never coming out and that means that this is a story driven game that doesn't have a satisfying conclusion, which means it loses points in my book. A games story should ideally make players want more but it should never leave them feeling unsatisfied. This games story left me both feeling like I wanted more and unsatisfied because of the cliffhanger ending. Shame on Valve for leaving the fans with massive blue balls for all these years and doing nothing to alleviate it.\n\nThe game was good, it has some good pacing in the gameplay and an interesting story with good world building. It’s just a disappointing shame the conclusion to the whole thing is super unsatisfying. GG anyway I guess. Now to get into some of the mods for these games.\n\n\nExtended version of this review here -
