Huge lumbering giants that left you alone if you left them alone. Things you avoid until you have the ammo and health to hunt. that sound you could hear from rooms away, will it be behind this corner?. Fights that would end with the player having no health packs like 7 health and only 3 guns that still had ammo. This game still has guns and abilities but they are all sad and I just find myself running out of ammo and salts.\nOoh no you died here have some ammo and free health and spawn right next 2 where you were? I did like how it sounded like Elizabeth said FUCKER FUCKER!!! Every time she revived you\nNo saves, auto saving bullshit. And I always miss the tiny logo sooo i have no idea when saves drop. Just quit and pick back up where I left off. FUCKCKCKCKCK I LOST AN HOUR OF GAME PLAY!!!\nI love getting attacked by people who were friendly for no reason with no warning \nWhy is the protagonist soo damn demanding to Elizabeth, would it be soo hard for him to be a gentleman? throw in a would you kindly toss me a health pack Elizabeth.\nwould you kindly toss me a gun\ntoss me some salts, would you kindly.\nIt's not hard\nThe lock picking system is dumb as hell and the rest of the story is often behind a locked door. Do i open this safe with money? And have no way to continue the game unless i load my last save or do i continue with the story never knowing whats in the box.\nOoo you paid extra for dlc, heres 5 free keys!!! Ooh look a safe that costs and get this, 5 keys!!!\nGot caught in a loop of dying before my character could get back up, 7 deaths in before I gave up and loaded last checkpoint\nNavigation arrow got stuck leading me in a loop, had to google my way out only to find it was taking me WAY OFF COURSE.\nCan only hold 2 guns at a time\nCan't hold potions for salt or health\nWhat a dumb ass story!

Incluso los personajes que hay en columbia no se sienten vacíos y le dan más vida al juego, desde los que son más protagónicos hasta los que solo interactúas una vez. Como siempre el estilo y diseño de la ciudad llama mucho la atención más aparte que la trama se ve enriquecida con teorías científicas y física cuántica. \n\n\nGráficamente es bastante bonito, la variedad y cada detalle de los escenarios, los gestos de Elizabeth en específico están muy bien hecho. La jugabilidad es algo sorprendente ya que Elizabeth funciona como alguien que te ayuda y no tienes que estar preocupándote por protegerla, las batallas son frenéticas y por eso cuidar a alguien más seria molesto; hay una buena cantidad de armas y poderes que obtienes además de que implementaron los carriles que hace el combate más especial y el que le puedas pedir a Elizabeth maquinas, armas, torretas o botequines de otras dimensiones y todo esto lo hace un shooter único y divertido, cada enfrentamiento está justificado y ligado al argumento. \n\n  \nEl final es uno de los mejores que eh visto en un videojuego, todos los datos y piezas al final se unen y que todo tiene un sentido lógico que te va hacer sentir barias emociones y te dejara pensando por un tiempo en especial la escena post créditos si no prestaste atención, en total si te la pasas explorando son más de 16 horas de juego, ese es otro punto bueno ya que talvez sea un juego lineal pero te da la oportunidad de explorar y como recompensa te dará distintos objetos y algunas piezas extra de la historia. Aun si te parece poco tiempo los DLC´s son igual que buenos por si no te es suficiente, cuenta más trama a la historia principal, pero de otra perspectiva. \n\n\nTalvez no sea un juego para todos, más que un shooter es un juego para empaparte de una historia un poco compleja en la que tienes que prestar atención a cada detalle, la acción es algo secundario y aunque no seas fan de bioshock definitivamente debes jugar este ya que para mí es una obra maestra y una experiencia única que no te debes perder.","timestamp_created":1578437681,"timestamp_updated":1578437681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584687113761901855","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61493802","author":{"steamid":"76561198397090556","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":426,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":426,"last_played":1578434835},"language":"english","review":"GG","timestamp_created":1578434873,"timestamp_updated":1578434873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61493123","author":{"steamid":"76561198148796989","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":320,"last_played":1510942553},"language":"russian","review":"НИХУЯ НЕ ПОНЯЛ НО ОЧЕНЬ ИНТЕРЕСНО","timestamp_created":1578433794,"timestamp_updated":1578433794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61492424","author":{"steamid":"76561198073934304","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":771,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":635,"last_played":1609352334},"language":"brazilian","review":"Uma das melhores tramas que já vi!\nJogo sensacional","timestamp_created":1578432729,"timestamp_updated":1578432729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61492141","author":{"steamid":"76561198199091794","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2171,"last_played":1578354508},"language":"english","review":"rtyuiol;","timestamp_created":1578432264,"timestamp_updated":1578432264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514563083648681641","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61491697","author":{"steamid":"76561198078926150","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":1421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1245,"last_played":1580491525},"language":"english","review":"9/10","timestamp_created":1578431591,"timestamp_updated":1580072161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61489256","author":{"steamid":"76561198316905616","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":655,"last_played":1578570847},"language":"english","review":"2/10","timestamp_created":1578428004,"timestamp_updated":1578428004,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.486427843570709229","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61488224","author":{"steamid":"76561198394560037","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":694,"last_played":1578423209},"language":"turkish","review":"It's not just a game.
