I really do, but I want to try and give this game as a fair a try as I can.\nPros\n- The story is great, despite a terrible first act the game still has a strong act 2 and 3 in regards to the story. The Vox Populi are executed well and they work as a good lesson for Elizabeth in regards to learning morality and moral greys.\n- The games overall look is quite nice, Columbia is beautiful and the overall graphical fidelity is strong.\n- The plasmids are fun to use (ill get to this later)\nCons \n- The fucking combat is terrible, for starters the weapons compared to the originals are weak. They have no alternate firing modes that would give you a reason to use all different weapons. Just choose 2 weapons you like and that's all you end up using.\n- Plasmids are poorly executed, there's no reason to use them at all whatsoever due to how easy the combat in the game already is, speaking of.\n- The difficulty is piss easy, this game is a joke. \n- Slate, fuck him and his stupid character, if I hear him say tin man one more fucking time.\nConclusion\nThe main thing that I hate the most about this game is that it's a BioShock game, this is not BioShock. BioShock prided itself on it's strong challenging gameplay, interesting world design that you wish you knew more about, characters that were interesting and made you really think about what was going on in Rapture.\nBut Infinite is none of what BioShock was, this game fails as a game first and foremost and send off to BioShock secondly. \nTl;Dr\nFuck this game","timestamp_created":1574678747,"timestamp_updated":1574678747,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458199828863143921","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57813998","author":{"steamid":"76561198135295955","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1575688716},"language":"koreana","review":"vest","timestamp_created":1574671600,"timestamp_updated":1574671600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57813489","author":{"steamid":"76561198041623381","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2480,"last_played":1580106834},"language":"english","review":"Fukin love this game!","timestamp_created":1574670380,"timestamp_updated":1574670380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57811969","author":{"steamid":"76561198103490255","num_games_owned":260,"num_reviews":155,"playtime_forever":3694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3556,"last_played":1586469009},"language":"spanish","review":"Perfecta conclusión para excelente trilogía y los DLC valen la pena (excepto el de las armas)","timestamp_created":1574666747,"timestamp_updated":1574666747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57811032","author":{"steamid":"76561198284667309","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2163,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2163,"last_played":1574609199},"language":"schinese","review":"那两个科学家神棍才应该在还是婴儿时闷死在婴儿床上，这样就没人能打开裂境了，也就不会出现这场悲剧了，还我布克和伊丽莎白。","timestamp_created":1574664438,"timestamp_updated":1574664438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57806540","author":{"steamid":"76561198997688568","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":367,"last_played":1615301917},"language":"english","review":"My goodness","timestamp_created":1574654048,"timestamp_updated":1574654048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57806154","author":{"steamid":"76561198064735057","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":595,"last_played":1659074648},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1574653234,"timestamp_updated":1574653234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57804382","author":{"steamid":"76561198147379775","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1320,"last_played":1615862933},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo perfeito, sem mais.

Awesome artstyle that seems to have aged pretty well\n- Crisp and fluid shooter mechanics that are a joy to play\n- One of the best written game stories in recent years (this alone makes it worth a play)\n- The game never got boring and was the perfect length for me\n\nCONS:\n- IMO Difficulty didn't seem to be consistent all the way through (played on HARD)\n\nVERDICT:\nThe first game was a tough act to follow but Bioshock Infinite managed to be superior in almost every aspect. Polished across the board, nothing seemed clunky and out of place. Having one of my favourite gaming plot twists, Infinite is nothing but exceptional. Do not miss this game.","timestamp_created":1574517680,"timestamp_updated":1574517680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57696697","author":{"steamid":"76561198160665102","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":666,"last_played":1574515435},"language":"schinese","review":"生女当如伊丽莎白","timestamp_created":1574513238,"timestamp_updated":1574513238,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57694645","author":{"steamid":"76561198218296464","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":827,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1577037249},"language":"brazilian","review":"Excelente!","timestamp_created":1574511090,"timestamp_updated":1574511090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57688899","author":{"steamid":"76561198084299102","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1643,"last_played":1574533080},"language":"english","review":"epic","timestamp_created":1574504440,"timestamp_updated":1574504440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57686746","author":{"steamid":"76561198302860601","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":561,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":561,"last_played":1574501196},"language":"koreana","review":"쌋다","timestamp_created":1574501694,"timestamp_updated":1574501694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"57685618","author":{"steamid":"76561198995972268","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":658,"last_played":1625147396},"language":"schinese","review":"没什么好说的，就两个字“好玩”！","timestamp_created":1574500246,"timestamp_updated":1574500246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn+Thy+4CcueG3AE="}
