When looking at the servers, it is constantly updating and moving. This is an annoyance, because when you try to join the one you want it will update and move, causing you to click the wrong server. You then have to wait for the level to load while you try and quit and join the one you want hoping it isn't full. Another problem is the admins. They boot people for starting off with the wrong class constantly. I seen people get booted just because the accidently chose firebug.It happened to me because i was a demo last game and started off demo in my new game. I got booted. I have also joined a game where it shows im a level 0, which i clearly wasn't. This resulted in yet another kick.The crashes happen occasionally. And it pisses me off because of all the time i spent going through the levels, only to be fucked in the end. \nSome of the positives are the gore, the teamwork, and fun you have in each round.

Even though the objective is always the same (survival). The addition of the killing floor Objective Mode just added to the charm of the game, giving us tasks and objectives to complete as per the modes description.

All the fun of FPS, without the competitive nature of the game, just pure Co-Op, team orientated survival.

At the end of each wave a shop opens and you get to purchase weapons, stock on ammo grenades kevlar for the next round.\nIt's not like left 4 dead where you follow a trail to get from point A to B, but in Killing Floor the whole map is opened to explore.\n\nPros: hilarious English voice accents, many weapons which feel balanced and realistic with recoil, a nice class/perk leveling up system, great many various maps, slow motion kills(although some people dont like it), and an overall satisfaction to recking all the specimens down and blowing them limbs off\n\nCons: \ndated graphics, \nunlike left 4 dead where u have to get to the chopper, there is no real objective other than survive the final wave,\nno character differentiation what so ever, all are clones with same voice acting which sucks cuz you get to pick a character and class to play as,\nsome achievements are damn near impossible to get since the game can get really hard at suicidal and hell on earth difficulties.\n\nI highly recommend this game.
