There is non-stop action driven by an interesting story and mysterious characters. The game still holds up really well, and despite knowing it is a 2004 game, it has a real sense of reality about it and an odd way of getting into your head. \n\nThe controls are very precise, the only downside being sometimes you can infuriatingly get stuck on things, or the gravity gun requires a few clicks to throw the object you want. But overall it feels very fluid. On the first playthrough, it can seem like each level is really long, which sometimes makes it a bit tedious (e.g. some people say the airboat level is too long), but this makes for a satisfying amount of each level before moving on - i.e. once you're done with the airboat, that's it. \n\nThe game isn't scary so much as it has many jump scare moments and a very melancholic atmosphere about it. I mention this because there are probably many like me who don't usually like anything too horror driven. I hadn't played this game in the past because of that, and certainly this game is the absolute limit. But I am glad I have finally given it a go and experienced this classic game.
