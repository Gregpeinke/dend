In the ending of Half-Life 1 Gordan is teleported and then arrives 20 years in the future on a train at the start of Half-Life 2 and the fact that nobody gives a shit seems strange. Gordon doesn't say anything and it seems like he should have had a voice in this game as it would have made it easier to get into him as I found the character of Gordan to be out of place but not in the way he should be. Story wise it's weird considering Gordon would have no idea what is going on and he just starts helping his old colleagues like he knows what's been going on and was always there. I also found the somewhat very minor romantic push between him and Alyx by her father was kinda weird considering she would have been a child during black mesa and he would be 47 years old if he wasn't teleported through time from the G-Man. Overall the story is interesting especially in the final chapters and the ending is amazing but I just feel like Gordon is the wrong guy and I understand that Gordan is a crucial part of the story due to him being view as a hero but I don't think he should have been the main character. \n\nPersonally I think Adrian Shepard from Half-Life Opposing Force would have been a better fit as he was forced into a similar deal that Gordan got at the end of HL1 and the semi-romance with Alyx would have been more natural as he was only 22 at the time he was put into stasis but it would also break the story at the same time because it's not Gordan so IDK.\n\nYA KNOW?!","timestamp_created":1480927755,"timestamp_updated":1480927755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28198996","author":{"steamid":"76561198081482996","num_games_owned":386,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":2210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2180,"last_played":1451796064},"language":"schinese","review":"G胖求数3，求数3，求数3.\n重要的事情说3遍。","timestamp_created":1480920118,"timestamp_updated":1480920118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28197375","author":{"steamid":"76561198052980517","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1120,"last_played":1480906712},"language":"english","review":"This games storyline and creative world that it's set in is fascinating.Even though it's not a horror game, which i appreciate, it has some jump scares in here to make it fun.
