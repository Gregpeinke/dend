I never played it as a kid, I was very much aware of the legendary status this game has built up since then. There was no question that I HAD to play this game, since I wanted to find out what makes this game so great, but it was obviously hard to give it an honest try with all these initial expectations.\nIt's an old game, but it doesn't nearly feel as old as it actually is. The engine and graphics were undoubtedly very advanced for their time, but that doesn't really impress me anymore in today's day and age. The atmosphere was kind of uncanny, like the original Half Life game, mostly because of the lack of a soundtrack. Half Life 2 improved on its predecessor in this regard but still left a lot of silent voids throughout the game. Still, in the end I started to understand that this is a crucial part of the Half Life experience, rather than a flaw in the game design, yet it's not exactly what makes the game awesome either.\nInstead, I think people have started worshipping Half Life 2 because of the gameplay. The game as a whole might lack a lot of things we have come to expect from video games nowadays, but it is just a tremendous amount of fun to play. It's a good shooter, with a good physics engine, good enemies, and a good story, with the gravity gun being the spice that gives the game a bite.\nAs a final verdict, I can't say that it's amazing, but it's good!","timestamp_created":1533647763,"timestamp_updated":1533647904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43979765","author":{"steamid":"76561198104081044","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":126,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":126,"last_played":1519281055},"language":"schinese","review":"也许我是个被时代抛弃的人  玩了几个小时这经典大作。。我真的没有玩进去。。。","timestamp_created":1533635784,"timestamp_updated":1533635784,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476003140211105347","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43978206","author":{"steamid":"76561198250091314","num_games_owned":620,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":1479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1350,"last_played":1574674654},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2 continues the formula that has won its fellow Valve titles such critical acclaim by following a silent protagonist through a seemingly-seamless gameworld as they, and our first-person-perspective selves, venture through a world of spectacular setpiece action sequences that push the boundaries of the Source Engine as we follow along with a plot that remains remarkable subtle considering how frequently it deals with cosmic aberrations, grotesque body horror, and the technocratic enslavement of the human race.\n\nThe silent protagonist presented for our gaming pleasure this time is Dr. Gordon Freeman, a bespectacled MIT graduate stomping mutely around from within an armoured hazard suit that puts him on a comparable levelling, combat-wise, with the equally-faceless, gasmask-suited thug soldiers patrolling the dystopian streets. Your makeshift herosuit moves simply and controls easily – if you’re familiar with pretty much any other Valve game, or indeed, almost any FPS from the past twenty years, you find the basic WASD system to be no challenge at all to master. If, by chance, you’ve never played a PC game before and have come to Half-Life to see what all the fuss is about, then rest assured – Valve will still masterfully introduce all the necessary concepts to you in an opening sequence so well-crafted and refined you might never even notice you had been tutorialised at all. \n\nOnce you’ve become familiar with the keyboard layout and mouse controls, you will be prepared to step out into the first wide-open outdoor environments of the game, and it is at this point you will most likely want to take a gander at your audio-visual options. As usual, Valve have included a large suite of variable settings, and you might consider turning down some of the lighting, water effect, and render-distance, HL2 is by no means heavy on the hardware by modern standards, but you might just save yourself a framerate drop or two in certain areas, and in a game focused on bringing top-shelf gameplay rather than fixating on having the shiniest graphics anyway, you won’t be missing much, if anything. \nYour sudden plunge into this oppressive world leaves you with little time to take in the scenery before unavoidable plot-shenanigans require you to  flee your starting locale, the amount of weaponry you pick up on your way out and the whole armies’ worth of cannon-fodder baddies in hot pursuit almost threaten to turn your underdog nerd protagonist into the hero of a bullethell shooter. However, this too does not last, and you soon find yourself part of a run-and-gun hovercraft chase that in practice is a lot less exciting than it sounds – this sets the approach followed by much of the game, rapid shifts of gameplay from one somewhat gimmicky sequence to the next, including a survival-horror segment out of absolutely nowhere and a stop-start-stop-start-stop-start dune buggy roadtrip that, emblematic of much of the game, drags on for just long enough to become tiresome, and then some.\n\nBy the end of the game, you’ll be carrying a whole arsenal about your person, and while many of the weapons are fun and beautifully cathartic – the punchy one-shot-kill revolver, scoped crossbow that fires white-hot rods, guided missile launcher and ability to summon giant killer ants were all favourites – but the game makes the best guns so situational they’re useless, or makes the ammunition for them so scarce you need to resort to using any one of the several generic and rather samey machine-pistols dropped en masse by the crapshoot AI goons instead. \n\nFor a game that spends around fourteen hours utilising large, open, levels, it was so surprising to see so much of the last half-hour or so of gameplay be literally on-rails, before slamming into one of the most abrupt (but by no means, conclusive) and confusing endings in all of fiction. If you’re so inclined, you’ll be able to sweet through the game a second time to pick up all of the few remaining Achievements and perhaps a more solid understanding of the story – naturally Valve gave their golden goose full integration with the Trading Card system, even though, in my entirely subjective opinion, the Cards, Badges, and Emoticons are nothing to write home about.        \n\nHalf-Life 2 is not a bad game, it delivers another large part of a competent (if complicated) story, and is clearly very technically impressive in both design and execution as it holds up Valve’s usual high standard, doesn’t weight very heavily on the hardware (at least not until you start exploring a world of prequels, episodic sequels and spin-off titles). \n\nI recommend playing this game for yourself – and it’s a bargain if you find it bundled alongside a handful of other Valve titles during a sale - but if you’ve come here looking for “gaming’s best story”, or the “best characters”, you may end up being let down.

They say Half Life (1998) was the game of the year, but check this out. Revolutionary graphics with thanks from Valve's Source engine. A mere better game in terms of story. That was the problem with the first one, it felt limited. Half Life 2 masters the problem of moving our protagonist, Gordon Freeman along. The second instalment takes a large turn on how different and how gritter this gamje is from the last one, This is what made Mad Max: The Road Warrior a house hold name. This game feels fresh and different, something you would see in grand sequels, like i named above.\n\nHowever, If i wanted to introduce the game to a friend, they would'nt like it as the game is outdated for this era we live in. I would probably call them gay and tell them to fuck off.\n\n\n\"One of the finest game's of the century\".\n\nEddie","timestamp_created":1533527340,"timestamp_updated":1608807204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43957539","author":{"steamid":"76561198303354365","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":456,"last_played":1534060277},"language":"koreana","review":"뭔 놈의 집으로는 가지 않아..........였던가\n\n거기 좀비만 나와서 무서워 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ","timestamp_created":1533521537,"timestamp_updated":1533521537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43956818","author":{"steamid":"76561198393726081","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":4162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":1513,"last_played":1660104476},"language":"english","review":"This game changed FPS shooters forever and changed the industry by storm.

I didn't really understand the first bit all that much but I really liked how creepy and mysterious the G-man is throughout the entire game. The weapons in the game like the gravity gun and the upgraded version you get at a certain point are my favorite weapons in almost any game. I think that the placement of health, ammo and other resources are well placed and aren't unfair placed, or that you get them too frequently. one of the best levels in my opinion is the Ravenholm level, i liked the creepy atmosphere there was with the dark tone and the different kinds of zombies in the level, such as the headcrabs and the regular zombies which when killed if you don't kill the headcrab on top of it's head it will attack you like normal headcrabs. And the other enemies like the giant zombies that are really tough to kill but not that agile, the fast zombies that run at you full speed climbing on the side of the buildings when you encounter father Gregory that throws his shotgun towards you so you can kill then quicker than with your other weapons. the puzzles i liked as well though they weren't too hard they could be rather simple but i liked that you weren't stuck on the same puzzle for ages. also the creative ways to use the gravity gun to throw explosives at the enemy or saw blades or just anything incl. Corpses of the combine. the other levels are amazing as well like the hover boat level where you spot the G-man doing suspicious stuff as always. The characters in the game Alex, Barney and Eli who rescues you and helps you teleport though it goes a bit south. And the ending i really liked though i ain't gonna spoil it of course but i think its nothing less than a masterpiece an easy 10/10 in my opinion","timestamp_created":1533513199,"timestamp_updated":1554072922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43955933","author":{"steamid":"76561198826190395","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":172,"last_played":1543354744},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра\nТоко она мне не нравится\n","timestamp_created":1533511993,"timestamp_updated":1533511993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43955194","author":{"steamid":"76561198839885091","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1576729216},"language":"german","review":"einfach das gelbe vom eii\n","timestamp_created":1533507982,"timestamp_updated":1533507982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43954571","author":{"steamid":"76561198073623718","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1765,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1735,"last_played":1532836176},"language":"spanish","review":"Perfecto en todos los aspectos,  una joyita antigua y juego de culto, la historia y ambientación sigue siendo tan atrapante como cuando salió allá por 2004.

Rozgrywka jest różnorodna, bo przyjdzie nam pływać poduszkowcem, podróżować autem czy stanąć na czele rebelii. W grze jest parę łatwych, lecz przyjemnych łamigłowek. Jednak w porównaniu do pierwszej części typów przeciwników jest mniej, a dostępne bronie są mniej różnorodne (Chociaż po części HL2 nadrabia to gravity gunem, który jest genialny!). Brakowało mi też etapów w stylu Blast Pit. Pomimo, że MOIM ZDANIEM oryginalny Half-Life jest nieco lepszy, to Half-Life 2 nadal jest ZDECYDOWANIE wart zagrania.
