The game that changed everything. Before this the [i]Half-Life[/i] series was just a man with a ponytail and some Gearbox expansion characters hiding in vents and assaulting things with a crowbar, and a rather disappointing short film with that guy from [i]Flyfishing[/i]. But this game didn't just change the way people viewed the series; it changed the way we look at video games.\nLet me tell you a story. Back in 1993, the video game [i]Doom[/i] was released. The people at Valve, being innovators in video games, wanted to make a video game that \"scared you as much as [i]Doom[/i] did\", and this originally manifested itself as Valve's [i]other[/i] famous unreleased game (and apparently Gabe's pet project, if some sources are to be believed), [i]Prospero[/i]. Whilst the game itself never made it to Alpha stage, you can see fragments of it in most Valve releases - particularly in [i]Half-Life[/i].\nThe original pitch for [i]Half-Life[/i] included a feature about the new game engine, that apparently featured improved physics and graphics. But wait, they're talking about GoldSrc? The game engine that's definitely not based on the [i]Quake[/i] engine, which itself is definitely NOT the id tech engine series? Surely GoldSrc is the last engine you would think of when talking about game physics?\nBut whereas [i]Half-Life[/i] was more action and exposition-based, it's successor was more aimed at creating realistic and fully-fleshed out characters, scenarios and locations for the player to explore at their leisure - whilst obviously keeping within the parameters of that world and it's restrictions. And this is where half of [i]Half-Life 2[/i]'s success lies. The characters are brought to life very convincingly with a combination of excellent animation and superb voice actors on top par. If Barney was the gamer's fan favourite of the 90's, Alyx Vance is undoubtedly the favourite of the the last decade - and beyond. I'm not a [i]BioShock: Infinite[/i] fan so I don't rate Elisabeth, but I get why people like her. It's for the same reason they like any video game companion: because they're sharing in the adventure and loving it. I'll bet there were plenty of teenage boys out there who considered Alyx a legit girlfriend. Well, we can all dream.\nI'm not going to gush about the Beta content, because everybody knows about that. As much as I do think there are some excellent unexplored ideas in there, that's not the focus of this.\nSo how does the game fare today? You would think that after over 10 years at the top, surely it feels a little bit dated? Well, actually, no. It doesn't feel the least bit dated, it feels just as fresh as if it still had the pre-wrapped packaging on. Admittedly, it doesn't share the polish of some newer games, but is that inevitable for a game that's just celebrated it's twelfth anniversary? Maybe, maybe not. I think that the only thing that dates the game is the light effects. I'm not knocking it, but these days you expect some JJ Abrams-esque lensflare everywhere.\nBut that aside, the game is undoubtedly fully deserving of its title.\nAnd also? HL3 is not a lie.","timestamp_created":1458217132,"timestamp_updated":1589906962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584905624389648438","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21882264","author":{"steamid":"76561198163793576","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1333,"last_played":1457859599},"language":"thai","review":"ยอดเยี่ยมเลยทีเดียว เพลงประกอบก็เพราะมากครับ","timestamp_created":1458198341,"timestamp_updated":1458198341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21879967","author":{"steamid":"76561198180246891","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":682,"last_played":1575899273},"language":"english","review":"Words cannot explain of how i love the whole Half-Life series.\n\n11/10 Best video game ever made","timestamp_created":1458182189,"timestamp_updated":1458182189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21875640","author":{"steamid":"76561198203648893","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1008,"last_played":1642882840},"language":"polish","review":"Przeszedłem te gre 26 razy ale nadal myśle BEST GAME EVER mój uluniony rozdział to nigdy więcej nie chodzmy po ravenholn .

Acredito que muitos que acompanharam toda a Saga HL tem um posicionamento semelhante.\nO Game vem revolucionando o gen FPS desde sua primeira aparição, sem contar toda sua trama enigmática e seus belos gráficos que sempre foram os melhores de sua época...\nA Valve conseguiu desenvolver um jogo que não consegue responder muitas perguntas, mas consegue acrescentar muitas outras. E isso seria muito bom se ao menos existisse um HL3 anunciado se é que me entendem, nem preciso explicar certo?\nO jogo conta com gráficos fantásticos que até hoje conseguem impressionar os navegantes de primera viagem. A jogabilidade é simplesmente fantástica. By the way Source é a Engine com a melhor física que você terá o prazer de experimentar.\nA campanha de HL2 é bem longa, tendo um total de quinze capítulos e ainda conta com uma quantidade boa de conquistas que podem ser completadas em uma única jogada.\nDesde 2007 estamos na espera de um anúncio sobre a sequência dessa obra de arte, mas nada aparece...\nMas agora eu tenho um desafio pra você. Compre essse jogo e tente não se apaixonar pela trama, personagens e tudo que existe nesse universo.

Half-Life 2 è un gioco mediocre, il gameplay è carino e vario ma molto, anzi troppo schematico. La trama è scialba e insoddisfacente su molti punti, ma ciò nonostante è apprezzata e sopravvalutata tantissimo. Non capisco come facciate a dire ancora che sia il miglior FPS di sempre, non capisco come possiate lodare certi aspetti del gioco che sono oggettivamente mediocri, a partire dall' ambientazione che su veramente troppi livelli lascia non poco a desiderare (es. la strada costiera) ritenendo elemento fondamentale per le sesazioni che prova il giocatore quella penuria di dettagli e movimento assente più volte. Che Halflife sia stato un capolavoro per l' epoca nonché ponte tra il vecchio tipo di FPS e quello nuovo non ci sono dubbi, ma oltre quello non è niente. È propriamente un cimelio storico, un vecchio gioiellino che rimarrà nella storia dei videogiochi, ma nient altro! Non è il migliore ne tanto meno un capolavoro adesso nel 2016. \nÈ come dire di preferire una Citroen DS ai giorni d' oggi e non un' attuale berlina superaccessoriata solo perché la DS ha modificato gli standard e portato cose che in futuro sono diventate la base. \n\nOra vi starete chiedendo perché io nonostante abbia per lo più parlato male del gioco lo consigli lo stesso, ma la risposta ve l' ho già data. HL2 può e deve essere apprezzato ad oggi, ma non per le sue meccaniche o per il suo contenuto, quanto per il suo valore storico!","timestamp_created":1457971720,"timestamp_updated":1457971859,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518186092376708984","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21833805","author":{"steamid":"76561198155281879","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":2042,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":681,"last_played":1628961520},"language":"russian","review":"ШЕДЕВАР!!11!!!1!","timestamp_created":1457960667,"timestamp_updated":1457960667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21833137","author":{"steamid":"76561198179795527","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2312,"last_played":1653053653},"language":"english","review":"My favorite game of all time, this was the first fps I've ever played.

Игра была выпущена 16 ноября 2004 года (21 ноября 2004 года в России и странах СНГ компанией SoftClub) и получила высочайшие оценки многих авторитетных изданий[5]. Помимо этого, игра собрала множество наград и более 45 титулов «Игра года 2004»[6]. В 2012 году Half-life 2 была награждена на Spike VGA 10 (Spike Video Game Awards) как лучшая игра десятилетия[7]. Разработка длилась шесть лет, на протяжении которых исходный код игры был даже похищен и выложен в Интернете[8]. Основными технологическими достижениями разработчиков можно считать движок Source[9], предоставивший игрокам потрясающую анимацию персонажей, продвинутый искусственный интеллект противников, реалистичную физику и шейдерный рендеринг. Невиданный ранее уровень взаимодействия игрока с внешним миром был достигнут благодаря использованию модифицированной версии физического движка Havok Physics. На сегодняшний день продано более 12 миллионов копий игры[10], не учитывая продажи через сервис Steam. В 2005 году игра была переиздана в коллекционном коробочном издании Half-Life — игра года. В России и странах СНГ сборник был выпущен компанией Бука. На разработку игры было затрачено около 40 миллионов долларов США игра шедевр","timestamp_created":1457463268,"timestamp_updated":1457463268,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21711745","author":{"steamid":"76561198114998059","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2225,"last_played":1648311473},"language":"russian","review":"Прекрасная игра !
