Nicht nur, dass du die Rätsel (oder wie Glados sagt: Die Tests) lösen musst von Level zu Level gehst, wagst du auch mall gewagte Ausbruch versuche aus den Testkammern und erfährst auch nebenbei etwas über die Geschichte des Labors.\n\nDer Multiplayer hat mir und meinen Coop Partner auch sehr gut gefallen.

am *in love*.\n\nAfter playing the first Portal I wasn't very certain whether the sequel would rise to the challenge. There was something about the simplicity of the game, the lovely GLaDOS sarcasm/blatant lies and the plot twists which seemed repeatable, but not improvable. I was a bit worried that Portal 2 would be a repeat of Portal, only bigger. I resigned myself to it and decided to play it anyway. \n\nLuckily, I was wrong, although at first I was still sure I was being cheated. After all, the first few test chambers are carbon copies of Portal test chambers (trust me on this one, I re-played Portal right before starting Portal 2). I was about to complain before I realized that I Wasn't Getting It, because it was obviously a stylistic choice, a sort of \"Previously, on Portal\" combined with \"Yup, this is going to be about history. Prepare for a ride.\"\n\nOh yeah, the game is about history - the history of Apperture, the history of GLaDOS, the history of the facility. And it's done just right - with the perfect amount of fun, sarcasm, disappointment and twists to keep me glued to the screen (and to keep *you* glued, I assume, but who knows). I mean, seriously, the puzzles are great, but the story? I am hooked here. Definitely played it for the sheer fun.\n\nThe only issues I have with it is that some of the puzzles were a bit... well, not sure if they were *hard puzzles* per se, but they were hard to figure out because of not being able to see details of the scenery properly. For example, I couldn't find spots to put the portal on (I shot *at* them, but the portal didn't catch and I thought that meant they were unusable surfaces and tried other solutions again... and again... and until I went through a walkthrough). \n\nOne or two of the puzzles were hard in and of themselves, enough to make me wander about for many long minutes (you know the feeling, right?) But that isn't quite so bad. Except for being frustrating. Very frustrating. \n\n9.5, only deducting 0.5 from its sheer perfection because from time to time I stared blankly at tricky walls that weren't meant to be tricky.","timestamp_created":1386410185,"timestamp_updated":1386410185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7950509","author":{"steamid":"76561198101385796","num_games_owned":422,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":655,"last_played":1606032498},"language":"english","review":"want something relaxing but still kills ur brain ? give this a try =D","timestamp_created":1386409086,"timestamp_updated":1386409086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7949855","author":{"steamid":"76561198068708604","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":7790,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3407,"last_played":1657034187},"language":"english","review":"fun game and you can make your own map and download other people map for free co-op is great and the campan taken me 8 hours to finshed.","timestamp_created":1386403908,"timestamp_updated":1386403908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7949164","author":{"steamid":"76561198045850314","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":281,"last_played":1508126162},"language":"english","review":"If you haven't played play it will do crazy things to your brain and its quite a bit of fun.","timestamp_created":1386398095,"timestamp_updated":1386398095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7949112","author":{"steamid":"76561198000277657","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":768,"last_played":1447988102},"language":"portuguese","review":"...","timestamp_created":1386397669,"timestamp_updated":1386397669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7948020","author":{"steamid":"76561198100518579","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":936,"last_played":1481168321},"language":"brazilian","review":"Achei legal, gosto de jogos logicos e divertidos, é esse o caso.
