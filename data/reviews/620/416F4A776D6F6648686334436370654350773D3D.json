İlk Portal oyunuyla tanışmama bir hayli geç oldu. Neden bilmiyorum ancak ilk çıktığı zamanlarda zamanın yeni çıkan oyunları arasında biraz kaynamıştı. Dolayısı ile tam olarak ilgi gösteremedim ancak en sonunda onunla tanışınca kalbimi bu kadar çabuk fethedeceğini hiç ummuyordum.\n\nOldum olası bilmece, bulmaca olaylarına ilgi duymuşumdur eskiden beri. Ne zaman zeka oyunları veya zeka sorularıyla ilgili bir kitap bulsam, filmle karşılaşsam onu sömürürdüm. Onları çözme konusunda çok çok iyi olduğumu söyleyemem ancak yine de boş değilimdir hani.\n\nİşte böyle bir anda Portal gibi bir oyunu oynamak benim için ne kadar tatmin edici olduğunu hayal edebilirsiniz. İlk açtığımda ne yapacağımı bilemediğim Aperture Science’ın o beyaz duvarları arasında koşuşturmak, GLaDOS’un huşu dolu sesiyle rahatlamak ve turretlerın “I don’t hate you” sözleri ile hala sevildiğimi bilme duygusunu yaşamak oyun boyunca kahkahalarla geçen bu zaman içerisinde ayrı bir motivasyon olmuştu benim için.\n\nŞimdi üzerinden dört yıl geçti ve bu mükemmel oyunun ikincisi raflara çıktı. Ne yalan söyleyeyim hayatımda ilk defa gözümü bile kırpmadan parayı basıp aldığım bir oyundur Portal 2. Hatta ilk defa ön sipariş ile aldığım oyun olduğunu da yine itiraf ediyorum. Neyse benden bu kadar bahsetmek yeter. Şimdi gelelim Chell, GLaDOS, Atlas, P-Body ve elbette ki yeni dostumuz Wheatley’e.\n\nIt’s allright, it’s allright don’t be panic! Ok, you may panic! \n\nValve’ın aslında pek çok oyuncuda büyük bir hayal kırıklığına uğrattığına hepimiz hem fikirizdir büyük olasılıkla. Nitekim Valve’ın Valve olmasını sağlayan, oyun dünyasına 40 milyon tonluk ağır bir top gibi düşen Half-Life’ın Episode 3’ünü yıllar geçmesine rağmen çıkartmaması pek çok kişiyi hayal kırklığına uğrattı. Ancak Valve bu işte bir yerden alırken bir yerden veriyor.\n\nİlk başta dilerseniz Portal 2’nin konusundan başlayalım. İlk oyunu bitirenlerin hatırlayacağı gibi Chell ile sevimli ve esprili yapay zekamız GLaDOS’u yok edip kendimizi Aperture Science’ın dışında baygın (her ne kadar etrafı görebilsek de Chell’in o sırada baygın olduğunu düşünüyorum) bir şekilde yatarken buluyorduk. Ardından göremediğimiz ancak robotik sesler çıkartan bir şey tarafından sürüklenirken oyunumuz sona eriyordu.","timestamp_created":1434817463,"timestamp_updated":1441322768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.64075082540512085","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16556575","author":{"steamid":"76561198181633758","num_games_owned":301,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":172,"last_played":1648996437},"language":"portuguese","review":"bue fixe","timestamp_created":1434816333,"timestamp_updated":1434816333,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16556494","author":{"steamid":"76561198171878845","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1798,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":985,"last_played":1546546779},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Гра, яка змусила мене відкласти книгу і сісти за комп'ютер :)","timestamp_created":1434816163,"timestamp_updated":1434816163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16554497","author":{"steamid":"76561198082085019","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":943,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":653,"last_played":1534188358},"language":"russian","review":"Очень веселая игра.
