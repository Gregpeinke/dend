But unlike its predecessor Half Life 2 shows its age in its gameplay. From the lens of a player in 2004 I could understand why this would be a larger than life gaming experience but the fact is were not in 2004 anymore and the features of this game no longer set it apart. I'd even go as far to say that this game is ridden with tedious enemy's with often times cheap placement as well as piss poor pacing that has far too much exposition that stops the action dead in its tracks, a design decision that the first game actively sent a president on not doing as to set it self apart from the other games of the time which inherently makes it kind of a bad sequel in terms of gameplay. All that being said this game does have its moments like the story which I do actually really enjoy but its flaws in gameplay very much outweigh those positive aspects making this just not a good experience for me.","timestamp_created":1639541945,"timestamp_updated":1639541945,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.375986576080322266","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105850811","author":{"steamid":"76561198450357137","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1644000521},"language":"brazilian","review":"gordon","timestamp_created":1639540071,"timestamp_updated":1639540071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105847946","author":{"steamid":"76561198850110996","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1655943364},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1639534913,"timestamp_updated":1639534913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105847873","author":{"steamid":"76561199024459540","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1467,"last_played":1639534737},"language":"spanish","review":"el

Другого не дано. [/h1]\nНа второй халфе выросло целое поколение геймеров и нельзя переоценить вклад этого шедевра и всей команды разработчиков Valve в образование современного геймдева.\n\nМоё знакомство с этой серией игр произошло в далёком 2008 году, когда я был ещё совсем ребёнком. На компьютере у знакомых нашей семьи был установлен HL2 EP2, который в то время был горячей новинкой. Признаюсь, некоторые вещи сильно меня впечатлили и напугали при первом прохождении в столь юном возрасте, и они продолжают делать это и по сей день.\n\nСпустя много лет я вернулся к серии и начал прохождение с самой первой части. В 2021 я наконец целиком и полностью прошёл всю серию и моей равдости нет предела. Великолепная графика по тем временам, лицевая анимация, прописанные диалоги, режиссура и постановка сцен. А сюжет и более того, заслуживает отдельного положительного обзора. Игра в меру сложная, в меру быстрая и заставляет игрока всё время находится в напряжении, воображая что же ждёт его за следующим поворотом. Будет это интересная головоломка или опасный противник? Можно узнать лишь пройдя дальше и так будет на протяжении всей игры.\n\n[b] Итог: [/b]\nЯ бы настоятельно рекомендовал всем неравнодушным геймерам хоть раз пройти вторую часть именитой серии в совокупности с её эпизодами. Этот сюжет навсегда врежется вам в память и вы никогда не забудете харизматичных персонажей и злодеев, и такие легендарные элементы геймплея и взаимодействия с окружением. А также рекомендую познакомиться с Half-Life: Alyx, если будет доступ к VR шлему.

It's good. Like it's really good, it's definitely still a product of it's time but gosh darn is it charming. It's funny that my only knowledge of this game came from Gmod which I played obsessively and source film maker YTPs and yet I only experienced the original thing now years after. It was incredibly surreal seeing everything I had once seen as a kid but in the context they were meant for. Anyway enough about nostalgia, I should talk about the actual game. \n\nThe writing is what immediately struck me, it has so much more personality and style than the original, the city feels like an actual place with people that have lives and have more to say than just “hey gordon”. Even the antagonist has an interesting and charming personality, this was the start of valve’s loveable identity as a game developing company. \nThe gameplay is pretty much the same as the original but with the added bonus of a gravity gun which adds so much to the sandbox and puzzle design. Puzzles are actually fun now. You can use the gravity gun to pull a mine out of the ground and throw it at an enemy or pick up a saw blade and throw it at a zombie. It’s such a genius addition.\nThe level design is the real highlight, its pacing and gameplay diversity makes it a blast to go through and never drags or feels monotonous. There's a lot more variety in the enemies as well so combat feels a lot like a puzzle on top of being fun. There were some moments where the way to progress was very obscure and took a bit longer than I had hoped to move forward.\nThe graphics still hold up pretty well, it’s not as impressive as the Black Mesa remake but it’s still aesthetically pleasing. It still has the occasional death glitch now and then but it’s a lot more manageable.\n\nThis is a great FPS that deserves it’s high praise and surviving player base.\n8/10 Where’s half life 3?","timestamp_created":1639454886,"timestamp_updated":1639454886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105798991","author":{"steamid":"76561198880370271","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1377,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1377,"last_played":1639442117},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2 is great.
