You may not know how to count to three, but we still love your games. Portal was the best puzzle game I played, (still did not play portal 2) and I was enjoying a lot, but there are downsides, the game was relatively short. I only played it for like 5 hours before beating it. Also the final boss, was pitifully easy. Compare it to the rest of the puzzles. Every boss is just a glorified puzzle with an added gimmick in basically every puzzle game known in existance. The puzzle was doing 3 different things with only one thing changed in between. The first time it is hard, but then you know what to do and how to do it if you keep getting farther each time. It becomes really easy and the only problem was with that time limit, let's just say, **** TIME LIMITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But in this game it made some kind of sense why the time limit was implemented, also without the time limit the boss would be extremely easy to beat. Like more laughably easy then it is now. Though this game is fun, screwing around with portals is awesome, the momentum mechanics are so much fun to screw around with trying to finish the level. Although the character roster was lacking. Do not get me wrong the story is awesome, but the amount of characters are 6. 2 if you do not count companion cube or those weird cores on the final boss of the game that for some reason can talk. I guess that adds to the atmosphere of lonliness though. Another thing is that this game is so good it made feel guil and sadness to a cube after incenerating it! A ******* CUBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So this game is really good just wish there was more of it. Oh hello there sequel.","timestamp_created":1482910060,"timestamp_updated":1482910060,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28742446","author":{"steamid":"76561198103964657","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":452,"last_played":1481043377},"language":"schinese","review":"神作，尤其是后半段，很有代入感，galdos塑造的很完美，一个矛盾的混合体。","timestamp_created":1482909733,"timestamp_updated":1482909733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28742060","author":{"steamid":"76561198315955325","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123,"last_played":1657916772},"language":"english","review":"An incredible game.

Therefore was my first game in the Portal series Portal 2, which I liked a lot. Last week there the Winter Sale began and I decided to buy $10 worth of games. Eventually I had $2 left and I saw that Portal was in sale too, and seeing Portal gave me memories of how fun Portal 2 was, so I decided to buy it. The game unfortunately doesn't last very long, I finished it in 2 hours, which would give me the possibility to refund it, but I'm not, because the creators deserve their money and I haven't tried the 'Bonus maps' yet. Storywise, the levels started off with a tutorial, some courses where you'd know what to do, and eventually the part where you try to escape and really have to put your skills to the test, I liked the puzzles a lot because you really need to think outside the box and you need to look at thing in different ways. The boss fight is a lot like a normal course but there's a different objective. After defeating the final boss, I saw a cutscene and the credits afterwards. I managed to watch all the credits because the songs in both games are amazing!\n\nPro's:\n- Great story\n- Good controls\n- Great music\n- It teaches you to think in possibilities, not limits\n- It teaches you to think outside the box\n- It teaches you to look at things in different ways\n- Boss fights are nice\n- Great fun overall\n\nCon's:\n- It doesn't last long (2 hrs in my case)\n\nOverall:\nThe experience is definately worth $10, but it won't last very long.

it)","timestamp_created":1482863845,"timestamp_updated":1482863845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28721371","author":{"steamid":"76561198344266410","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1514587980},"language":"spanish","review":"Simplemente

If you expect a shooter, then you probably have the wrong expecation what this game is about. It's not a shooter at all. It's a physics & puzzle game, which makes it unique. Despite its age (over 9 years) it's still  one of the best games in my opinion, due to its unique playstyle & interesting concepts. \n\nIf you are into solving problems & physic games (which were already implemented in the Half Life series), then just go for it! You won't regret it. Many people will probably consider this to be a 'must-played' game, along with other games as the already mentioned Half-Life series and other classic games.\n\nOn a sidenote: The game is rather short (Although that is relative). I've beaten it in a few hours, so you might want to get it while it's on sale. It usually is on discount for 75% which is a lot. Many people don't want to spend relatively much money for such an old game, but it's 100% worth it when it's on sale.","timestamp_created":1482765814,"timestamp_updated":1482765926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28674171","author":{"steamid":"76561198082741956","num_games_owned":886,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":257,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29,"last_played":1482821990},"language":"schinese","review":"我要当一辈子V吹！！！","timestamp_created":1482764160,"timestamp_updated":1482764160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549125969409942627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28674013","author":{"steamid":"76561198082203996","num_games_owned":319,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1482766293},"language":"brazilian","review":"Nice Game!","timestamp_created":1482763886,"timestamp_updated":1482763886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28672087","author":{"steamid":"76561198337240677","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":447,"last_played":1480426585},"language":"schinese","review":"很有趣的游戏，有点费脑子，晕3D的千万不要玩！！！！！！切记切记！！","timestamp_created":1482760481,"timestamp_updated":1482760481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28671835","author":{"steamid":"76561198352084182","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":37,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1499263539},"language":"schinese","review":"玩了一小下头痛死了","timestamp_created":1482759976,"timestamp_updated":1482759976,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.419217795133590698","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28671732","author":{"steamid":"76561198209543217","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1527380804},"language":"schinese","review":"Mac的portal和军团要塞2字体都有问题，不过游绝对没问题。","timestamp_created":1482759785,"timestamp_updated":1482759785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28670291","author":{"steamid":"76561198003843468","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1421185483},"language":"english","review":"The best experiment Valve has ever pulled off I believe.
