You would think that after creating such an amazing story, how could they follow it up? But with with the bumbling Wheatley, [spoiler] GLaDOS coming back, [/spoiler] and the backstory of how Aperture came to be, the singleplayer campaign can easily take up half of your total playtime for the game. [b] PTI - [/b] The Perpetual Testing Initiative is one of my favorite parts of the game. Because it is a level editor, you can create infinite test chambers with infinite possibilities, each as simple or as complex as you like. With Cave Johnson talking to you in every downloaded test, it seems like a whole new game. From turret traps to gel puzzles, there's something for everyone in the PTI. [b] Co-op -[/b] Personally, I have not played Co-op very much. I have played a few levels though, and from that I can determine that it was put together perfectly. From the ping tool to the emotes, the Co-op could be sold as an entire other game, or at least DLC. Whether you choose to be Atlas or P-Body, the fun will never end when you recruit a buddy.\n\n[u] Negative: [/u] [b] Puzzle Elements - [/b] Even with as many elements as there are, the level editor still seems small. Allowing players to create their own elements and publish the models to the workshop (Like in TF2) would be a lot more fun. Also the bugs. There have been bugs so exploitable, they even have names. \"Portal Bumping\" or \"Bunny Hopping\" for instance. Either the devs don't care, or haven't paid enough attention to the game. [b] PTI - [/b] The PTI is severely lacking. While you can get the basic puzzle layout, things like the Underground theme and the Overgrown one are not available unless using less simple external mods. Having a theme selector to change the look of puzzle elements and backgrounds and such (Much like in Super Mario Maker) Could drastically improve the quality. [b] Items - [/b] The items are given an entirely new look, but one that is nowhere near as familiar as the original things from the first game.\n\n[u] Conclusion: [/u] I would definitely tell you to get this game. You would definitely appreciate it more if you played the first game, but you don't even really have to. It was actually hard to come up with a list of negatives that looked as big as the positives.","timestamp_created":1534892382,"timestamp_updated":1534892382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44301351","author":{"steamid":"76561198284252916","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":772,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1594509988},"language":"brazilian","review":"TOP","timestamp_created":1534888911,"timestamp_updated":1534888911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44301253","author":{"steamid":"76561198139470335","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1107,"last_played":1436885662},"language":"spanish","review":"Me pareció igual que el Portal 1 (lo cual es bueno, porque también me gustó), pero mejorado.
