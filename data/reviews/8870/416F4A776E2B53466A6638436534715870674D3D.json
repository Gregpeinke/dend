The idea of playing out the story from the beginning and hiding it from the player is pulled off phenomenally. Additionally, the game is very rewarding if you listen to all the recordings. \n\nThe look of Columbia is done in such a way that it simply pleases the eye. The brilliantly stylized design and sounds create an incomparable experience. \n\nThe supporting characters are interesting and very memorable. Elizabeth herself is probably the most useful NPC I've ever seen. And the coin trick is just a *chef kiss*\n\nOf all the Bioshocks, even though the sheer use of weapons and Vigors has been trimmed it is the smoothest so far. It is a great pity that the system with the gun wheel from dlc was not included in the main game.\n\nI also really enjoyed the Burial at Sea DLC even though the end took me by surprise once I figured out what was going to happen. And it was a bittersweet feeling that happens really rarely to me. The non-standard gameplay really appealed to me. The stealth + those goals animations, hacking and crossbow really suited the noir style of Elizabeth alone in Rapture. \n\nIt was the most enjoyable of Bioshock for me and I would put it on par with the first \n","timestamp_created":1645410198,"timestamp_updated":1645410198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn+SFjf8Ce4qXpgM="}
