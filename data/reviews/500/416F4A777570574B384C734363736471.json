Each has their own little back story and their own personality, something that helps you connect. Like Francis, who hates stairs, helicopters, zombies, walking, and generally anything and everything.\n\nThere are multiple campaigns in the game, each with a different set of locales and atmospheres. Like the first campaign, No Mercy, which has you moving through a city to rendezvous on a hospital skyscraper rooftop. Each campaign is broken into chapters, which have you getting from the start area to a safehouse. At the last chapter, you face a thing called a finale, where you get a bunch of supplies, an area to hole out in, and a trigger to start it. When you activate the trigger, a massive horde of zombies rush at you. And the game features a \"Director,\" who controls how the chapter is going. For example, you might hole out in a parking lot in one area and defend against a wave of zombies using gas canisters in one playthrough, and maybe the next the canisters won't be there and the zombies will come from behind.\n\nOkay, so maybe Left 4 Dead doesn't have the deepest plot. But if you're not looking for anything particularly engaging and enthralling, and simply want to unload as many bullets as possible into fast moving targets who are hungry for you, Left 4 Dead is a great game, especially if you have some friends to help you survive through the bullet riddled repetition.\n\nIf you like FPS games, or zombie games, this is the game for you.","timestamp_created":1359893354,"timestamp_updated":1574003942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"871239","author":{"steamid":"76561197980647320","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":2111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2111,"last_played":1321430400},"language":"brazilian","review":"Excelente cooperativo online, muito bom !","timestamp_created":1359853958,"timestamp_updated":1359853958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6642422","author":{"steamid":"76561198071238441","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":6270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4961,"last_played":1510380478},"language":"english","review":"Much better than the second game.
