At the first time, it is a just normal exploration game, however, when you find the Elizabeth, the game had changed. you need to think about all choices and opportunities which may change the plot, attack enemies and so on.

Daisy Fitzroy did nothing wrong, but neither does Infinite aside from the poor handling of a compelling class war and its revolutionary. \n\nI finally had the chance to play this in 2021 after my parents refused to buy me a rated M game during my senior year of high school and to my surprise, this game very much holds up in this day and age. With ultra graphics cranked up, the world of Columbia is a marvel even among your ray-traced Night Cities and Saint Da-knees (I assume this is the plural of Saint Denis)—in many ways, it’s how I’d envision heaven to be like if heaven was a cultish apartheid state brain-damaged by incessant imagery of Americana. \n\nThe combat is a lot of fun, you shoot stuff with guns and also with abilities called vigors. There are zip-lines that you’ll often employ in fights to add verticality as you mow down waves of sharply dressed henchmen. However, it would be unfair to reduce Infinite to just an FPS shooter—the main appeal is obviously the story. While the Civil War veteran Booker DeWitt serves as the player’s eyes and ears, the game largely centers around the girl who he’s sent to retrieve. Who is this Elizabeth and why is she important? If nothing else, her contributions as a companion endear her more than any other follower in gaming history. While she doesn’t pitch in much in terms of shooting and slashing, Elizabeth provides numerous potions and ammo according to the player’s need in the midst of battle. After years of screaming at my computer when Lydia blocks my path during combat only for me to accidentally behead her with Wuuthrad, Elizabeth is a joy and delight as a follower. \n\nUltimately, Bioshock: Infinite packs a lot of heavy material in a ~10 hour playthrough that I can’t recommend highly enough. Now that I’ve left the small population of gamers who haven’t played it yet, I must implore my former brethren to make the jump.","timestamp_created":1615278831,"timestamp_updated":1615279147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88118420","author":{"steamid":"76561198140231247","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1130,"last_played":1626596088},"language":"english","review":"I

Columbia è bella, ma non ha nemmeno un decimo dell'atmosfera di Rapture, inoltre Columbia è solo \"grafica\", non succedono mai eventi particolari dovuti al fatto che la città è sospesa in cielo.\n- Lo shooting è bruttino, con un feedback delle armi quasi del tutto assente, inoltre il protagonista è piuttosto goffo e la modalità di mira praticamente inutile. Il tutto rende gli scontri a fuoco abbastanza tediosi e poco divertenti. La situazione era simile anche nei precedenti capitoli, ma l'impronta un po' horror, l'ambiente claustrofobico e la difficoltà più elevata, rendevano il tutto più interessante.\n- Difficoltà estremamente bassa, dovuta anche alla scarsa IA dei nemici, ma quello che rompe veramente il gioco è proprio la coprotagonista Elizabeth, sempre pronta a lanciarvi munizioni, energia e cure, ogni volta che ne avrete bisogno. Ah e non si può morire, ogni volta che subirete abbastanza danno, perderete semplicemente i sensi e la fida donzella vi rianimerà in pochi istanti, il livello di sfida è praticamente nullo.\n- Non ci sono puzzle ambientali o minigiochi come nei precedenti capitoli, anzi, in realtà ci sono, ma li risolverà sempre automaticamente Elizabeth. Quindi tutto il gameplay si basa solo sullo shooting, che come abbiamo visto è mediocre.\n- Al posto dei Plasmidi ci sono i Vigor, che sono praticamente la stessa cosa. Non essendoci interazioni ambientali si limitano ad arricchire un po' gli scontri, nulla di che.\n- La trama è interessante, si sviluppa integrando viaggi nel tempo e realtà parallele, ma sul finale si contorce un po' troppo su se stessa e perde di senso, culminando in un finale wtf. Non lo voglio mettere come vero difetto, ma comunque non mi è piaciuta.\nBioshock infinite e stato per me un viaggio nella noia e più di una volta ho pensato di dropparlo, ma non lo faccio quasi mai e quindi mi sono forzato a completato.

It easily has the best gunplay of the series, with most weapons feeling very unique and powerful. One aspect I think they stepped backwards in was the limited gun selection, as now you can only hold two at a time. The plasmid choice isn't anything revolutionary and is mostly reskins from the original but I enjoyed playing around with the octopus one. The way upgrading works is less enjoyable, as instead of being given the opportunity to max out all your guns through exploration you will have to focus your efforts on a select few. \n\nThe enemies in the game are generally more interesting, I liked the soldier's uniforms and the replacement for the Big Daddy was not at all disappointing visually, although from a gameplay perspective it wasn't quite as fun to fight. The songbird was a very interesting enemy that I felt didn't steal the spotlight for longer than it should've, and was removed from the narrative in a satisfying way. \n\nI think Bioshock Infinite had a much heavier focus on science fiction than the previous two, which may sound odd knowing that the first one was underwater, but much of the story and setting of the game relies on complex scientific concepts. While I'm not sure the story is better than that of Bioshock the original's, they did a great job of making the storyline feel like there was real weight attached. Near the beginning of the game, some of the decisions presented actually made me want to go back and see what the difference would've been, which is some high praise at least from me personally. \n\nI enjoyed the company of the twins and Elizabeth throughout the entire game without fail, and the shockingly racist and stunning colonial culture and world design of Infinite kept me engaged throughout the entire playthrough. In my eyes, it's equal to or better than the first, and obviously better than Bioshock 2.","timestamp_created":1615175876,"timestamp_updated":1615175984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565062642097473145","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88057457","author":{"steamid":"76561197972076795","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":869,"last_played":1615173799},"language":"english","review":"Main story is fun, Burial at see E1,2 DLC not worth it, less than 4 hours in playtime on normal.","timestamp_created":1615173889,"timestamp_updated":1615173889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88057278","author":{"steamid":"76561198151022435","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1478,"last_played":1614981192},"language":"english","review":"i am sad it ended.","timestamp_created":1615173562,"timestamp_updated":1615173562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88056612","author":{"steamid":"76561199125261967","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":666,"last_played":1615391775},"language":"brazilian","review":"Esse jogo é simplesmente genial, digno de um clássico","timestamp_created":1615172390,"timestamp_updated":1615172390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88055344","author":{"steamid":"76561198073032716","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":738,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":693,"last_played":1617504523},"language":"english","review":"Best fps","timestamp_created":1615170126,"timestamp_updated":1615170126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88054763","author":{"steamid":"76561199051010481","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1354,"last_played":1643757999},"language":"english","review":"Cool game great graphics and a amazing story","timestamp_created":1615169159,"timestamp_updated":1615169159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88054311","author":{"steamid":"76561198311190568","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":507,"last_played":1621252188},"language":"schinese","review":"我非常喜欢无限，主要是它终于让我打阳间生物了\n什么？墓园？\n【卸载游戏】\n。\n。\n。\n。\n。\n。\n----来自一个胆小玩家的悲哀\n游戏挺好的（虽然没法完全体验），看见了记得替我夸。。","timestamp_created":1615168377,"timestamp_updated":1615168377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88053684","author":{"steamid":"76561198136534244","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":823,"last_played":1617240456},"language":"spanish","review":"Ta weno\n","timestamp_created":1615167203,"timestamp_updated":1615167203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88053490","author":{"steamid":"76561198152827077","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":476,"last_played":1609099659},"language":"brazilian","review":"Esse jogo é muito bom vai tomar no cu que perfeição que lindo compra isso vc n vai se arrepender","timestamp_created":1615166866,"timestamp_updated":1615166866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88053445","author":{"steamid":"76561198308796865","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":514,"last_played":1615814118},"language":"english","review":"Nice Game!, the visual was beautiful and the music too!
