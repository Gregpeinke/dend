mocno ulepszona widac prace włożoną w ten tytuł.\nMisje sa ciekawe i nie da sie narzekac na nudy,czasami ale to rzadkość na trafimy na zagadke logiczna,zagadki są proste i nie trzeba zbytnio wysilac

Graphically, it was the best releases of the year, if not the best. For me, one of the best games ever created.\n\nI do not come to talk about Half Life exactly, since everything is said. I come to talk about what happened next.\n\nThe Steam gaming platform was initially only an application from which you could download and play Half Life 2, called Tracker. At the time, Valve had not thought anything special for her, since it had been created with that sole purpose: to allow users to play Half Life 2. Nothing else.\n\nSuch was the success of this game that the company decided to continue its history through episodic releases. The first of June of 2006 was released Episode 1, and later, the 10 of October of 2007, Episode 2. Initially would be a trilogy of episodes that would give preamble to the next great game.\n\nTime passed, and Episode 3 continued to be postponed and postponed, for reasons confused and still discussed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Steam platform was gaining ground, thanks to which Valve agreed to host games of other companies in it. More games began to be published, more new users arrived; every year even more quickly. Valve continued to develop games for a while, to finish projects in which they were still working, but from Episode 3, nothing was said.\n\nSteam was becoming more and more profitable for Valve. Thousands of developers were eager to sell their games on the platform, and with the rebates every winter and summer were more profitable than the launch of a game. This made Valve think that it was no longer necessary to make games. They preferred to continue adding cosmetic content to Team Fortress 2 and CS: GO, as it generated money more easily. As soon as they could, they took the simple route.\n\nNot long ago, during the last 2 years, several Valve employees began to leave the company. Concept artists, voice actors, stage modelers ... and above all, writers. Writers who previously worked on scripts such as Portal 2, Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 and, of course, Half Life 2. They left the company for an obvious reason: Valve no longer offered them any task they could apply their talents.\n\nIt seemed that Valve's plans were not to continue the sagas mentioned. Many fans speculated that perhaps the reason for this was that the dialogues and storyboards were already finished, and that only needed to be recorded in a video game. After 13 years without knowing our beloved series, there were still people who kept the hopes and looked forward to the return of Gordon Freeman.\n\nTwo days ago, on August 25, 2017, those hopes faded.\n\nHalf Life saga writer Marc Laidlaw, who had left the company 18 months earlier, revealed in his blog a letter containing what appeared to be a \"fanfiction\", camouflaged between modified and other names, but that was really everything the plot of what would be Episode 3 if it had ever come to be developed.\n\nMarc was motivated to do this by realizing that after so much time of dedication and love for his work, Valve was no longer interested in the least to give a proper conclusion to the story and simply left the game to oblivion, while the fans continued to wait incessantly for the next track that would lead them to think that HL3 was close.\n\nSick of Valve's refusal and saddened by the fans, Marc gave us all the conclusion we both hoped for, in the form of text. What would have been a phenomenal game ended up becoming a blog entry of about 30 lines.\n\nThat's right, gentlemen. Gabe Newell preferred the easy money offered by both Steam and CS: GO instead of worrying about his biggest and most recognized series, letting her die as pathetically as possible. And as if that were not enough, he revealed not long ago that he is developing a card game, which will surely be an excuse to sell microtransactions.\n\nYou make me sick, Gaben. You make me sick, Valve. Great developers sold like prostitutes to the money, forgetting completely of what one day made them big. I hope it's worth it for you to have left an opportunity to go down in history as big as this, for a meager game of cards, hats and boxes with painted weapons. I will not remove this negative feedback until Valve replaces the fans in some way, for these 13 years of useless waiting that they made us go through.","timestamp_created":1505180096,"timestamp_updated":1505180096,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495124787092208862","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34893249","author":{"steamid":"76561198330362213","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6938,"playtime_last_two_weeks":97,"playtime_at_review":3043,"last_played":1659655188},"language":"english","review":"10/10 \n\nnever forget","timestamp_created":1505179719,"timestamp_updated":1505179719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34890346","author":{"steamid":"76561198133309646","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":851,"last_played":1657991076},"language":"french","review":"LE JEUX A AVOIR","timestamp_created":1505164199,"timestamp_updated":1505164199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34889871","author":{"steamid":"76561198287279884","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":304,"last_played":1590279459},"language":"spanish","review":"Aburrido y quieres desquitarte de los combines? aqui tu juego","timestamp_created":1505162096,"timestamp_updated":1505162096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34889726","author":{"steamid":"76561198191400455","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1625418711},"language":"polish","review":"Classic <3* \n\n\n\n*(<\"3\" if you know what i mean) ;)","timestamp_created":1505161505,"timestamp_updated":1505161505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34888163","author":{"steamid":"76561198251246442","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":9474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6007,"last_played":1648665536},"language":"english","review":"ood ame","timestamp_created":1505155211,"timestamp_updated":1505155211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543778836727142334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34887205","author":{"steamid":"76561198081264372","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":849,"last_played":1476368726},"language":"english","review":"I cant wait until Artifact!","timestamp_created":1505151640,"timestamp_updated":1505151711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49714285135269165","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34886886","author":{"steamid":"76561198241056660","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":4158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2422,"last_played":1587568228},"language":"english","review":"Over...

will start with some key features and then an small story of how i ended up hooked to the half life series\nok graphic while not awesome by today standars are still great, i mean, 10 whole years, and still looks incredible\nwhile im not familiar with many FPS as i dont tend to play them very often, im pretyt pleased with the weapons, switching and all of that, though i admit, with more recents FPS games, some things could be better, i still think even today it stands up very well, another thing i find great, something that most FPS games lack is, puzzles, not only physical or platforming puzzles but even deciding which weapon to use, when to use it, or what weapon to use after that, and that makes one have to actually cycle throwgh all weapons, also health, yeah, one cant just COD this game,\nbut even wit a great implemente game mechanic, where this game shines is...its story , told via ingame dialogues, instead of cutscenes, it blends in perfectly, and its an amazing one, yeah it kinda ends on a cliffhanger but its well crafted and paced, ok maybe not all the time, but the story is great, also is just a bit linear, but with the atmosphere, the characters, the voice actors, the hidden clues, if one finds them, a great story overall, admitedly i miss some of the mot common enemies from the first game, but that just because i loved the designs, but thats another thing, half life 2, has designs, from the different enemy types to the characters, they have made a great impact in me, and well, as far as i know, the whole gaming industry, so a fun, well written, full of great design, atmosphere, characters, even the background every now and then a place amazes me just by looking at it, greatly implemented puzzles, not all ar intuitive,  but al alwasy rewarding, and great game mechanics, sadly an incomplete story, the fact that too little returns from the previous games, and even ignore that one's expansions excelent additions, makes it just  below perfect, anyway im still amazed how many times i have gone back to play this game, it has lots of cliches, from the silent protagonist, to the \"hold on to the enemies while i slowly open this door\" and so on but it does it in a way that works, they are there, thats for sure, but arent annoying or dumb, or just there for the sake of it,  but i had to point that out, also, yeah there is also the fact that there are still many tings in the story that are just references casually found here and there and ome arent exactly obvious, knowing more about the inmense world they have crafter for these saga would be great, and SADLY i dont think we will see another game for a long time \"hint hint\"\n\nhere a little story of how i got introduced to it\n\nall started with portal, i got that one when it was free for a short period of time, i dont remember the specific reason, anyway, it required me to download at least the demo of half life 2, anyway, loved portal, awesome game and all, but felt like the half life 2 demo was just sitting in there doing nothing, and i not being a fan of first person shooters i was reluctant to play it...well just to not waste it, i did, and was one of the bet decitions i have ever made, the demo goes almost inmediately to ravenholm, probably one of the most scary part of the game, but it was oozing with ATMOSPHERE, with....something, so i had to play the full version, understand what was going on, so i played the first game, i was amazed, even with its god awful graphics(something the second game doesnt suffer from) i had to know how everything ended up like ravenholm or everything else, tthen i played the second game and after it the first's xpansions, and i have repeated them, just because they are simply awesome","timestamp_created":1505120422,"timestamp_updated":1505120422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34875842","author":{"steamid":"76561198013365015","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":1468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1468,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"If

Sure the old Source engine feels odd compared to modern day standards but it plays sharp and smooth the whole way through. Once you can look past the dated models and textures in some areas, what you find is a bombastic sci-fi FPS puzzle solver. Memorable characters you will find yourself having strong positive or negative feelings for by the end. Stunning set-pieces and well constructed levels that will definitely test your platforming skills. An excellently paced and constructed story that will keep you trudging through to the very end. Well at least as far as Valve will let us trudge...\n\nYou'll shoot.\nYou'll run.\nYou'll beat things with a crowbar.\nYou'll even stack a box or two.\n\nNo library is complete without the Half-Life series and you won't regret adding it to yours.
