В конце раунда  был виден 1.80 метровый  человек, хотя нет не человек, левая рука у этого дядьки была - вертолетная пушка с тепловизором и самонаводящиеся ракетой, из преса сочилась кровь и выстреливало штото из него, разрывая в клочья любую плоть. Сильный и быстрый здоровый дядька с длинными волосами, в шортах. Кто же это? - Это был ПАТРИАРХ . Появляется в 20-300 метров от игроков и шагом идет к игрокам.Старается убить самонаводящиеся ракетой. При сильном ранений ,падает на одно колено и встает,делается невидимым и уходит с места боя что бы подлечится, потом снова рвется в бой. Атакует как в близи так и на расстоянии с неведимкой и без нее. Ну о чем это я..ах да вообщем появился в кустах и шагает такой к нам и говорит: \"Сейчас ты умрешь\" стреляя ракетой. Всадил в него 2 обоймы гранатомета м32 а ему хоть бы што...пока перезаряжал,он успел убить 2  одним ударом. Стрельнул снова и он сел на колено  но потом встал, сделался невидимым и убежал. Было принято решение занять оборону в ангаре, заменировав вход, мы стали ждать его. 2 на входе и 2 в конце. Я был в конце и слышал его, он показался у входа и взрывчатка сдетанировала, ранив врага, снайпер лихо выстрельнул с м99 точно ему в голову, раздался рык и голова превратилась в фарш.

This game is ok, on a scale 0-5 I have to give it a 3, it could have been a 5 but there are some huge limitations. First of all getting caught on the edge of a fence or a car bumper is just silly. Secondly the designers really need to spend some more time at the gun range because reload time is even more silly and the power of the weapons is way off, for example the .45 automatic can kill zombies with 2 shots, but the Tommy gun takes 5-7 shots...they are the exact same caliber (.45) and the Tommy gun actually produces more energy than the pistol. I do not like how all the weapons essentially are the same power, for example the combat shotgun is great, kills with one round and can fire as fast as you can pull the trigger, but it only has a ammo capacity of 6 rounds so you can only kill six zombies and the reload time is that of a jeriatric circus clown, the Tommy gun holds 50 rounds but because it takes 7+ rounds to kill a zombie you can only kill 5-6 zombies before the dreaded slow reload. So basically because of ammo capacity and silly reload times all the weapons have about the same effectiveness at killing the baddies. Go to the range folks, experience how with a little practice you can reload a lot faster and also learn the true effectiveness of different rounds like the .556, .45, 9mm, .30 cal, etc. I will say that the grenades and melee weapons are spot on and work nicely, just don't get to close  :) All in all a fun addictive game that I'm glad I only spent $5.00 on and not $30 or $40 when it was new. Maybe KF2 will address these obvious and glaringly annoying issues  :) \nP.S. With real world firearms you do not have to operate the charging handle or pistol slide every time you reload the weapon. You only have to do that if you run the weapon dry. This is another factor in the silly slow reload times.

Én 5 euróért szereztem be, leárazva, annyit viszont bőven megért! Rengeteg DLC-t lehet hozzá venni, szóval ha kicsit szeretnénk befektetni a játékba, nem fogjuk megbánni, és találunk a fogunkra valót. Ami kicsit csalódás, hogy már nem játszák olyan sokan. Azért így is sokszor találkozhatunk megtelt szerverekkel, de már nem olyan mint régen. Persze a játék kihalásától még 1-2 évig nem kell félni... Összességében ha egy Co-op zombi gyilkolászásra vágysz, és szeretnéd kiereszteni a gőzt, ez a megfelelő játék. Én nagyon várom a Killing Floor 2-t is, mert ha sikerült kiküszöbölni a Killing Floor 1 hibáit (és a videók alapján sikerült) akkor egy nagyon jó játéknak nézünk elébe. Nem fogsz csalódni ha megveszed a Killing Floort, de 19-20 eurót ne adj érte, annyit semmiféleképp sem ér meg, várd ki az akciót, vagy a nagy nyári leárazást, és azért a 3-5 euróért szinte ingyen lesz!

Also there are so many achievments and workshop items that will just add to the experience that Killing Floor provides for you. \n\nWhat makes this game even better, the co-op. Playing with your friends and with people online is a blast, but for practice there is a solo mode where you have access to everything in game. Also the Z.E.D. mode is a when time move slowly due to a headshot on a zombie and this makes the experience much more thrilling.\n\nLastly, this game is owned by so many people and that should say a lot about this game in the end.

Es zeichnet sich besonders für die echt coolen Gore Animationen aus d.h. es ist sehr brutal & blutig. Außerdem basiert das Spiel auf Runden-Überleben und Teamwork. Die Gegnerzahl wächst bei jeder überlebten Runde/Welle. Man kann auch anders Spielen indem man einen gemoddeten Server betretet, sind aber meines Erachtens immer voll.\n\nZum Abschluss gibts immer in der letzten Welle einen \"Bossfight\" indem der sogenannte (fette) Patriarch -puff zack- vor einem Spieler erscheint und den meistens instant zerfleischt, er verfügt über eine Minigun, einen zerfetzten Arm und so ein komisches Riesenteil das aus seinem Bauch rausragt und Spielern direkt ins Gesicht boxt. Nebenbei schreit er immer das er euch alle Umbringen wird und noch so'n paar Laute wie \"BADEGUBAI\" bevor er seine Minigun startet.. xD\n\nDie Waffenauswahl könnte etwas größer sein aber ist nicht weiter schlimm..
