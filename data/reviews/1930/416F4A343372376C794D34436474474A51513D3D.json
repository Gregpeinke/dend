I am saying this because with a ton of games available today and so many on sale offers, one may easily abandon a game and go for another.\nWhy I like this game? It is addictive. It keeps you playing for its advantages regardless its flaws. I have a lot of games, games I go back playing like skyrim, games I do not stop until I complete them like shadow of Mordor and games I never start playing yet. Too many games, too few time. Still, two worlds is a game that I start and did not abandon nor I will anytime soon. This game has something strangely addictive. For example I abandon dark souls about mid game while been an excellent game but I am now mid-game at two worlds and I hardy spent this little time to write this, right now I prefer to enter the game and continue.\nTo describe this game very briefly, it is like diablo on levelling and items, like oblivion on world environment feeling and like divinity 2 on movement and combat. It also has some unique gameplay elements on its own.\nWhat you need to know primarily is that tutorial is brief and very basic. This game needs your close attention to understand it. The first time I play I think there were major flaws and bad designs but with a second and third closer careful looks I understand that I was wrong. Once you understand how things work it is where you really get addicted. I am sure that most negative reviews comes from hasty gamers. I do not blame them, a modern game needs to have a proper tutorial, a complex game a large tutorial, this game most likely relies on the manual.\nLet’s get on details(the bad stuff at the end):\nThe character: You only play a male human character, no females and no races. That’s it. Also your starting character is fixed, fixed attributes and fixed starting skills. You cannot start with point pool and boost what you like. However the starting skills are the basic ones and at level 1 of 10. You can level up and increase any you like. All starting skills are all you need to do all essential things and secondary actions. For example you have lock pick 1 and you can lock pick and also increase it for a better chance. You do not have alchemy skill but you can still use alchemy. Finally, playing the game and visit villages and towns will allow you to meet trainers that will teach you the level 1 of all skills eventually, so there is no skill point cost at all for level 1 skill. If for example you want to advance alchemy or water magic you do not start with, all you need is to find the appropriate trainers to get the 1st skill point by paying some money. While levelling you get 5 attribute points and one or two skill points, usually one. You may also get one skill point before you level up but I have not yet figure out when, the game has many good secrets. You can also permanently increase attributes using alchemy even without skill 1, if you find the proper ingredients. In other words the game is rewarding for the good and smart player offering more than the standard gain experience and fixed level up procedure. Two level 10 characters for example may be different, one may be even 40% stronger from extra attributes and skills alone.\nThe gear and items: Items are much like diablo, leveled items and many auxiliary items, consumables and especially ingredients. The only disadvantage here if it is one is that there are too many items. Not just leveled, too many items. Perhaps the greatest variety on gear I have ever seen. Ready consumables are just what is needed. Ingredients are plenty and not only herbs but also parts from animals and various minerals. There are also gems as consumables to add different types of damage to weapons, traps to set, spell cards and spell boosters and few standard items like the teleport stone and quest items.\nOne unique gameplay element here is that you can enhance any gear item, weapon or armor with another piece of item of the same type. Items have a special attribute called ‘class’ which is usually one. If you have a short sword for example and find another one you can drag and drop it one another and you will now have a class 2 short sword which of course is a little better, doing more damage in that case. This is a very good thing and very useful, as it allows you to use trivial equipment to avoid buying everything from the store at every couple of levels or so, or live and die by drop chance alone. For example I used a Grom Shield that happened to be a very common item groms carry and drop so I end up finding about 30 or so, effectively had a class 30 simple grom shield with a parry number high enough to keep me up to level 10 or so. Then there were better shields to buy and enemies no longer often carry that shield, so it was time to change. Spell cards also stack. Add a second and third and so on card of the same spell and the spell becomes stronger, requiring more mana however. Finally gems can be placed on a weapon for extra damage and you can put as many as you like as long as they are of the same type, e.g. rubies that add fire damage.\nMoney and trading: Surprisingly money are always needed here, and the game offers a fair amount of money. The trading is active to this game. You always earn cash and you always have reasons to spent, and not on consumables exclusively. I’d rather say you may spent for making your hero more powerful. Enemies either drop inventory with a fair amount of gold and random items or a single standard automatic pickup, like the wolf drops a wolf heart which is an ingredient.  Anything may drop but specific items have better sources to be harvested and animals and beast always drop standard ingredient item instead of inventory. All except single pickups are level depended, chests, enemy inventories and shops. You are bored looking for ingredients that increase your stats permanently? No problem, pay some attention to mage shops and after a certain level you definitely come across to buy.\nEnemies: Good variety of enemies, large size enemies are really deadly and not level depended, leveled enemies are logical like bandits; they got stronger but not as much as you.\nClasses: The 3 archetypes work well, fighter, mage and archer/thief that is. Hybrids also work well. There is depth on each single archetype, fighting style and weapons for fighters, magic schools for mages and lots of choices to master for an archer/thief.\nThe story is interesting, the world is very good at least. The soundtrack is almost perfect.\n\nNow the bad stuff: \nThe back-jump. Honestly I hated that. In my opinion it ruins melee. I do not even assigned it to a button. The game is much better without. Again, my opinion.\nThe dialogues. Not sure what English dialect that is but it is strange until you get used to it. Also some times are almost childish, some other times are very mature. Your hero speaks quite well though.\nThe NPC characters. Quite average.\nThe spells. They are lots and great and come in form of cards that stack and extra spell booster cards (more damage, less mana etch). However you may have 3 spells with booster cards (that also stack), the others need some special way to be placed on your custom hot bar, first on the spell amulet and then on the hot bar. No big deal but somewhat annoying.\n\n","timestamp_created":1447177431,"timestamp_updated":1447177431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":108,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.796945333480834961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18946015","author":{"steamid":"76561198112606494","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":45,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30,"last_played":1446662039},"language":"english","review":"this game doesn't work and has zero support.

Bad.\n\nSo bad that the single player is entirely not worth it and beyond saving- there's no point to playing it, and as many has said before the voice acting is awful and characters not at all memorable.\n\nBut that has somehow not made this game a terrible purchase for me. You see, I bought three copies of it while on sale for shits and giggles once I saw the multiplayer tag, expecting a few hours of cheap laughter and something to bash on.\n\nI got exactly that and more. The combat is -just barely- engaging enough to drag you in, but broken enough to be completely conquered by several players together, at low levels. I've related all the dragging and running from monsters and the fact that melee combat is awful at lower levels to being rather realistic. It's like some strange dark comedy where you run from hordes of wolves, bears, undead, grom, and ghost bears to take to the towns people who of course mob upon it and destroy it in seconds. But while doing this, you'll of course start to grow and gain more and more experience, levelling up in a sort of Dark Souls manner. In fact, the combat of the game sort of reminds me of the souls games, like a simplified version without repostes or other mechanics- but a dodge and parry button can be used, and it can be used well enough that there's a skill cap to melee combat. And you can mold your character however you want past the beginning much like in Dark Souls as well- you want to be an ice mage wearing huge armor? Sure. Sneaky necromancer who stabs people with a spear? Absolutely. It might not hold your hand and it certainly won't be fair at times but that can be forgiven with the strangely mesmeric depth of character possibilities and gameplay on several open world maps, even if you can't change their appearance to begin with past a few sliders that make no sense. For the sake of difficulty, I'd recommend starting as a magic class and then change into whatever you like later on- equipment has no restrictions except for stats and many spells just need a few points into their respective fields of magic. And somehow the game keeps things refreshing even if you lose all progress on a map when you exit the multiplayer session (you can, of course, unlock many maps through progression of the multiplayer and pick up on those irregardless) by having the enemy spawns and loot be interchangeable. One time a encampment of orcs happened to have a sand dragon instead of its usual, far over levelled and idiotic to fight. But we killed it and took its mediocre loot with a sense of accomplishment. Dying means nothing in this game as spawn points are everywhere and they heal you- but it still has managed to be fun? \n\nThe setting is easily laughable and the characters forgettable but this is a game I can find myself recommending to play with multiplayer and a few friends. It's just enough of a clone to many well known games that you can find yourself having fun while breaking and bending it to your whim. As an example, animals are afraid of many fields of fire magic and you can also easily stun lock enemies with the water magic's AOE capabilities forever, even if when they take damage they unfreeze. Me and my friend has somehow made this challenging in unexpected ways and still had fun seeking adversity. Don't take yourself seriously while playing this game- imagine it like some poorly made table top game that your little sibling/relative made to impress you but somehow manages to entertain you at the same time despite its broken aspects. \n\nAll in all, the singleplayer is worthless but the multiplayer is a surprising gem with qualities of Dark Souls, Diablo stye looting, and Oblivion small open world maps with quests to deal with. I can't recommend the full price but you absolutely should pick it up on sale for five bucks a copy- it's like a cheesy movie you'll find yourself enamored with.\n\nAlso, it charmingly included alchemy into a multiplayer game and that seems rather cool to me. \n\nTLDR: Buy it on sale for five bucks or less to play with your friends who all have hamachi. You'll get some time of entertainment.","timestamp_created":1445718053,"timestamp_updated":1445718053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18657019","author":{"steamid":"76561197967824100","num_games_owned":374,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":590,"last_played":1636650469},"language":"french","review":"J'aime jouer à ce jeux.","timestamp_created":1445692096,"timestamp_updated":1445692096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18603847","author":{"steamid":"76561198198767835","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1444133875},"language":"russian","review":"=_=","timestamp_created":1445450740,"timestamp_updated":1445450740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18584954","author":{"steamid":"76561197993354991","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":122,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1405902460},"language":"english","review":"AWSOME","timestamp_created":1445355911,"timestamp_updated":1445355911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18561002","author":{"steamid":"76561198170415393","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":30,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30,"last_played":1445050969},"language":"english","review":"Why did I even play this game? \n\n1) I hated the wonky controls-Usually in these kinds of games using the keyboard and mouse as a control scheme, the spacebar is jump, but not this one, it is the actioin button. \n\n2) No direction-Seriously, no direction at all.

Being a conniseur of the truly awful and noble defender of that which is unjustly labeled so, I must say that this is indeed a good game.  It is not an Elder Scrolls game, nor does it try to be.  It is however a fun game.  the unique item upgrade system whereby stacking an item on top of an identical item makes a stronger item.  This made looting more fun and strategic, do you lose the weaker sword in favor of the better sword? or do you keep the weaker sword because you know it's more common and could be upgraded to be more powerful than the better sword?  Weapons have slashing, bashing, or pearsing damage.  And enemies have different resistances to each, and not mild resistances either, it's a case of 'look it's a skeleton, should I use (A) a sword and half a dozen health potions and kill it in about 15-30 hits, or, (B) a club no potions and kill it in 2-3 hits.\nIf anything, the game reminds me of an open world titan quest with 3rd person view and WASD movement.\nTons of side quests and one of the only games where being the brave hero type can screw over innocent people.\n\nThis game is often on special and it only cost me $1 something.\n\nBuy it, relax and have fun.","timestamp_created":1444031591,"timestamp_updated":1444031591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18336985","author":{"steamid":"76561198044001156","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":8333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6115,"last_played":1656465128},"language":"english","review":"Two Worlds is one of those games that is so bad that it ends up being a little good. Although it is impossible to take seriously, the game can actually be quite absorbing once you get into the swing of it. \n\n\nThe game has aged quite poorly, and even getting it to run properly can be a nightmare. One you get it to run properly, you may be faced with constant crashes, although I have not had these issues. That being said, the game actually runs somewhat well on the PC, which is a nice contrast to the 360 port, where the game runs under 30 FPS at almost all times. On both PC and 360, the game often lags hard when you kill someone or when you level up as you kill someone. This sometimes makes a very damaging blow quite satisifying, but most of the time it's just annoying.\n\n\nMoving on from the technical side of this game, we need to take a quick stop to look at the story and voice acting. The story is quite generic. Some evil dudes kidnap your sister and you need to get her back. The voice acting, on the other hand, is anything but generic. This game has the worst voice acting I have ever heard in a major title. Even the protagonist's voice acting is terrible, with laughably bad writing to boot. The voice acting and story go hand-in-hand to make a hilariously bad story experience that you can't help but laugh at when playing the game.\n\n\nBefore we take a look at gameplay, I want to touch on graphics. The graphics, specifically the face rendering, are simply bad for the time that this game was produced. By contrast, many of the environments look quite nice. It feels like the artists really put some effort into this part of the game. Graphics almost never make or break a game, but I wanted to touch on it.\n\n\nNow for the gameplay and replayability. The gameplay in the game is quite repetitive, but something about it is addictive. You often adopt the same strategies to kill many enemies, but actually figuring out what those strategies are can be quite fun. For example, I found that a mixture of critical strike, defensive combat, and traps allowed me to easily tackle any enemy. However, experimenting with other paths can be quite fun as well, which is where the game's replayability comes in. Although I found that the critical strike build was simply the best build, I did have fun experimenting with an amplification nuke mage for a bit. Sadly, the mana costs were too prohibitive, but experimentation like this is what helps keep the game fresh.\n\nAlthough some have complained about the game's difficulty curve rising too quickly, it is likely that those same people missed many of the essential side quests that allow you to level your character and tackle larger enemies.  For example, if you skip the first major city (Tharbakin), you will fall behind drastically in levels. Just like in other RPGs, if you tackle the main quest first, you will pay dearly. The general rule for gameplay difficulty in this game is as follows: the further south you go, the harder the game gets, and when you cross the river, the game gets significantly harder.\n\nThe gameplay is where the game redeems itself and comes into its own. Somehow, this gimmicky gameplay where you find the best way to abuse the game's skill and combat system is quite addicting, and you often find yourself playing for hours at a time to see just how badly you can abuse the game. Through my strategy of mixing critical chance, critical strike, and defensive combat, I was able to build a character that would crit on virtually every attack for 250% damage, quickly disposing of my foes. For any bigger characters, I would abuse the game's traps and bad enemy pathing and walk the enemies into the traps before I unleashed on them with critical strikes. Attempting to abuse the game in different ways allows for many hours of replayabilty.\n\nBefore wrapping up the review, I want to quickly address the Xbox 360 port of this game. When I first played this game, I played it on an Xbox 360, and that experience shaped my opinion of the game quite negatively. The game lags quite extensively, and the combat system is significantly worse because the controls are just horendous. Lastly, for some inexplicable reason, critical strikes are broken on console. You cannot crit people. This means that killing even modest enemies requires you to have many traps and bombs and patiently kill them. This drawback is very large and detracts heavily from the gameplay experience on console. I would recommend at least looking at the PC port if you played the 360 version and did not enjoy it.\n\n\nThis game, despite its big flaws, actually ends up being a mediocre but very addictive fantasy RPG. I would never even pretend that it could compete with games like Oblivion, but something about it is quite addictive and can leave you playing it for hours on end as you try to find the best way to cheese the game and abuse the combat systems. I would never dream of paying $60 for this game, but I would recommend it at $5 or below. It is worth it just for the hilariously bad story and voice acting at $5, and if you enjoy it, you will actually get quite a bit of value out of it as you can easily end up sinking 50+ hours into this game.","timestamp_created":1444020167,"timestamp_updated":1480103804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18333217","author":{"steamid":"76561198125687580","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1443852817},"language":"english","review":"bad game , the game crash everysingle time , plz fix","timestamp_created":1443994745,"timestamp_updated":1443994745,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18329281","author":{"steamid":"76561198058688587","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4,"last_played":1443974748},"language":"english","review":"I ignored the reviews since they were mostly about gameplay; I liked Risen a lot so I thought why not, sure it's not Skyrim, but I don't want another Skyrim.\n\nI really should have watched this video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogZS6z_EIzs","timestamp_created":1443978871,"timestamp_updated":1443978871,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18323946","author":{"steamid":"76561197961816754","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":68,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":68,"last_played":1443902767},"language":"russian","review":"((","timestamp_created":1443955933,"timestamp_updated":1443955933,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18302110","author":{"steamid":"76561198044988053","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1443851339},"language":"english","review":"So after a couple of Hours of trying to get this game to work I finally got past the Start-crash and got to the point where i needed to enter the CD-KEY (why i need that for a game i downloded from steam servers is beyond me) and could not input anything into the field and the cursor refused to work while the game was running.

Above all negative towers this [i]Reality Pump[/i] release, the story-line gets the worst part. Not-so-epic, and somehow basic, we take the role of a traveller searching for his sister who is mysteriously kidnaped. After being approached by a strange man who leads us to the main quest, we start our journey only to realise the side-quests are actually more interesting. Despise all the shortness, the main-quest encourages the player to explorer the kingdom, complete site-quests, gain reputation among the several available factions, choose a side among the war against the orcs, and discover new areas.\nMuch like Gothic series, this action RPG gives you the freedom to explore the world as you want, with an amazing combat system that puts you to the test by fighting bandits, goblins, wild animals, Cyclops, and many other creatures we are used to encounter in this genres. Getting yourself in the wrong side of the map might lead you to difficult enemies, but with great rewards worth the trouble.\nTwo Worlds offers a simple and interesting system where the player can create new items by cooking all sort of organic and magic objects. Mixing up till 5, the result may be different each time you tweak with the items, but you get to keep all the recipes for future use. New potions with a lot of different results are the most common, this will certainly make the game a lot easier, since harvesting items can be done pretty much everywhere. You can’t craft new weapons, but you can upgrade them, and that’s good enough. There’s plenty to choose from the vast variety of armour-sets, swords, staffs, and many more powerful objects to kill all those evil Golems!\nThe player also relies on magic, and for that the levelling up is great, choose among the 5 elements, and advance your combat skills and how well you manoeuvre your weapons.\nAlthough the gameplay is flawless and the graphics try to keep with it, the major problem falls upon the text-dialogue. NPC are just repetitive, in both appearance and dialogues, and that’s really a shame, because some actually tell you interesting things about the world of Two Worlds. It’s a big map, but very repetitive, even with snow, desert and deep forests, the game lacks on dungeons with only a handful of them to complete and loot. Small huts and villages with hidden secrets might be your salvation after a long walk throughout the world. \n\nWith great emphasis on side-quests, your journey won’t be a waste of time, and in time you may learn to enjoy it.\nOne of those games where you love it or hate it. Can’t go medium with this one, it’s made for RPG fans. Unless you are one, stay way.\nCould be batter, but could be a lot worst considering all things! 6/10.","timestamp_created":1438008800,"timestamp_updated":1438008866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569761455059051514","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17227379","author":{"steamid":"76561198067087610","num_games_owned":1279,"num_reviews":346,"playtime_forever":250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27,"last_played":1445876777},"language":"brazilian","review":"otimo recomendo","timestamp_created":1437861926,"timestamp_updated":1437861926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483404278755187988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17091416","author":{"steamid":"76561198151609590","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":91,"last_played":1649059583},"language":"english","review":"game does not work dont buy","timestamp_created":1437138189,"timestamp_updated":1437138189,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488054603338241577","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17059094","author":{"steamid":"76561198094982358","num_games_owned":403,"num_reviews":120,"playtime_forever":2055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1552927859},"language":"russian","review":"RPG старой школы..\nСвободный мир, ты - сам по себе.
