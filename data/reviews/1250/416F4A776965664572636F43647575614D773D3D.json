to max out so it rarely gets boring. then theres the difficulty modes which for the players who really like a challenge can really have a challenge. i could say alot more but these are the points that

Также подходит для тех, кто любит хорошую командную игру. в одиночку тут не выжить особенно на аду. 7 классов, до 6 игроков, от 4-7-10 волн, от легкого до ада, не важны заслуги в таблице, где показаны классы и статусы игроков, когда перед вами выходит ОН!!! создатель монстров, патриарх, Кевин Клемели, он уничтожит вас, если вы не сплатитесь с командой. советую всем!!! Лично мне нравился процесс прокачки класса. сейчас то я расскачал всех, и наслаждаюсь убийством в полной мере.\n\n10 мясников из 10\n\nPS ребята, у кого нет игры, берите с ДЛЦ сразу и скорее.

A játék 2009. május 14-én jelent meg PC-re. A program eredetileg egy Unreal Tournament 2004 mod volt, ebből nőtte ki magát teljes értékű, önálló játékká akár a Counter Strike vagy a Team Fortress 2 széria.A történet igazából annyi,hogy egy Horzine Biotech nevű, biotechnológiával foglalkozó cég különféle klónozási és genetikai kísérleteket végez, főként katonai célokra. Azonban valami hiba folytán a mutánsok elszabadulnak, és ellepik Londont és környékét.A játék lényege az,hogy egy álltalában 6 főböl álló csapatnak fell kell venni a harcot ezekkel a mutánsokkal szemben de a legfőbb feladat a túlélés.A játék a hullám rendszert azaz a hordamódot használja,ami anniyt jelent,hogy egy kör annyiból áll,hohy jön egy adott számú mutáns és megg kell őket ölni.Majd egy kis pihi,amiközben ell kell menni a boltba fegyvert,ammot meg ilyeneket venni és kezdődik a következő \"hullám\" amiben több mutánns és erősebbek jönnek.A játék végén van egy Boss a Patriarch aki szinte mindent tud:Teleportálni,láthatatlan lenni,lőni és még sok más finomságot.Ha már a szörnyeknél járunk akkor van nekünk 9db szörnyünk a bosson kívül.Sok pálya van+eventek mint pl.: karácsonyi\nDe ez a játék is elkövette azt a hibát,hogy annyi dlc-t adott ki,hogy egy alapjátékot kitenne.Nem vagyok oda a DLC-kért mert 1-2 karakterért nem fogom kifizetni a játék felét mert így is van egy jó pár karakter meg azok nélkül is lehet játszani.De ezt kijavítja az,hogy vannak ingyenes letölthető tartalmak is.","timestamp_created":1418995010,"timestamp_updated":1435834346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13448717","author":{"steamid":"76561198078508222","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1678,"last_played":1627669462},"language":"russian","review":"Для любителей пофаниться в зомби-шутерах - в самый раз. =)","timestamp_created":1418994754,"timestamp_updated":1418994754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13448670","author":{"steamid":"76561197992843954","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":17960,"last_played":1609185596},"language":"english","review":"Best zombie game!

With almost 640 hours on this, this is game I've playing the more along Garry's Mod and Counter Strike since I was a kid.\n\nI remember seeing it for the first time in one of those \"Top 10 zombie games you must to play\" 2012 YouTube video, and I was like \"DAAMN I HAVE TO PLAY IT\", but of course I was just a 12 yrs old kid in the middle of his school time xD I firstly downloaded it free from somewhere, probably through Mediafire; then after playing some hours I showed it to my school friends, and the fun just began.\n\nThey come to me the memories of that 2013 summer in where each week my parents took me to one of my friends' house, and we spent some hours playing Killing Floor, both of us connected in a LAN, alone fighting versus the hordes of ZEDS without even knowing that this was their name, just enjoying as two 12 yrs old kids could do.\n\nOne day of 2014 I asked my dad to buy the game for me on Steam, and I was already playing on my own in the multiplayer some time before finishing school, every day. Thanks to this game I learned English, and thanks to this game a little bit of my current personality and past were built.\n\nI met A LOT of people in this game. The first one was a really kind guy with whom I survived my first Infernal mode gameplay. We became good friends in so short amount of time through cooperation and friendship. After defeating the Patriarch, we celebrated it in the chat. I never saw him again, but I remember him till those days.\n\nSome time after, I met Nerea, a girl of my country (still in the 2014 year), and she was the first female friend with whom I played a videogame. I still have a screenshot with her in the winning screen, but unfortunately some time after, for some reason, she stopped talking to me and answering my messages, so at the end our relationship just faded away.\n\nThen through the years I made a lot more of friends: Yoshimitzu, Dann, Crimson, Kenzie, ByDeathX, BlackFiero, Lusia, SincereJing, Scorpion, Anna, Karma, Labots, Neria... and a lot more of people I cannot remember anymore, but with whom I shared a lot of experiences. I even still have some of these friends on my friendlist and still talking to them. One of those friends is called Viktoria, a girl I met on 2016 and with whom I keep a great and personal friendship that last to these days.\n\nI know this is more like a self-experience writing more than a review, but I needed this. There was a time in where this game was an everything to me, and everytime I see it on my library, I cannot avoid remembering all the momments and the people involved in my memories. Killing Floor is the game in where I probably was having more social interaction in my whole gamer history, and in where I made my best friends. <3\n\n\nFor someone curious, this is the screenshot I was talking about, in where I'm standing victorious with Nerea and other teammate:
