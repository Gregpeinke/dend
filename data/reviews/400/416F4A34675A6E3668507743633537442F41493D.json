influential and iconic game that really shaped a lot of the landscape when it came to puzzle games, oh, and the game itself also is pretty cool. As tends to be the norm, it seems that the most iconic and beloved games know how to keep things simple and elegant, and Portal is a prime example of this philosophy. Few games feel more tightly focused than this, with a single core mechanic being all it takes to craft an array of unique and engaging puzzle stages to make your way through. Not only is the game so wonderful from a gameplay perspective however, but its atmosphere and storytelling are also huge aspect, if not the biggest one, which make this such a good and loveable game. In fact, the only real area in which this game falls short is in its execution of certain ideas.\n\nThe main mechanic in this game is frankly genius, the portal gun is one of the coolest puzzle solving tools out there, further reinforced by its wonderful visual design that makes the colours of blue and orange put next to each other have people thinking of it. It has some absolutely perfect constraints and abilities that make for interactions that are neither too free and hard to design thoughtful puzzles around, but also have such a wide array of uses that you're always being surprised and given a few different challenge types you're exposed to. The way portals carry momentum is a particularly interesting thing for the way it can turn this puzzle game into one that requires moments of quick thinking, positioning and reflexes to make your plan come to fruition. My only issue with its applications in fact, come back to the fact that I find these faster momentum based puzzles really, really hit or miss, with some paving the way to truly memorable moments, but others being downright aggravating, especially with the camera being a bit frustrating to immediately orientate after being thrown through a portal at different angles. This made some of the later portions of the game kinda frustrating and tedious since they became more prevalent by the end.\n\nThe puzzle design itself is a bit mixed as well to me, as while the game introduces so many concepts to you in a thoughtful and effective way without ever feeling as if the game's talking down to you, it feels like that it only stops this teaching when there's barely any game left to play. In essence, Portal's brevity stops it from reaching its full potential and instead has the feeling that most of its content is a huge tutorial. Now the tutorial might be full of wonderful writing, with Glados being hilarious with her perfect balance of sarcasm and blatant lack of care for the player and many quotable moments making the perfect character to take you through this isolated, clinical nightmare. I feel like I'd also have thought a bit less of this game if not for the way the final act manages to be as good as it is, taking the concepts you've learned and applying it to more environmental problem solving that takes you through these harsh, industrial landscapes as you make your way through the inner workings of the test chambers you've been through.\n\nNot only does this lead to a lot of more interesting problem solving that feels a bit more naturally integrated into things, but the atmosphere is so unbelievably strong as you feel like you're deconstructing the place that's held you throughout the rest of the game, no longer feeling like you know the direction to take, instead going in different directions with no semblance of an end in sight. The comedic elements are also toned down at this point as well, with a much more menacing tone to everything uttered by her to the point where it doesn't feel truly safe, her threats of violence going from funny jokes to something with some great tension behind it. Really the game is close to being an amazing little package despite some issues with puzzles either being finicky thanks to the physics not aging the best or some puzzles having long periods of waiting around, and I think that if it had another hour or 2 to really experiment with its ideas and go just that bit further with them, I'd consider this game to be a flawed masterpiece, but as it stands, I simply find it a pretty good game that had a lot of influence and paved the way for its masterpiece of a sequel. I'd definitely recommend checking this out if you somehow haven't, because despite my complaints and the fact that not all elements of the gameplay have aged the most gracefully, it's a classic for a good reason.\n\n7/10","timestamp_created":1632401568,"timestamp_updated":1632401568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99833855","author":{"steamid":"76561198993454376","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":64,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1659383398},"language":"english","review":"RECOMMEND","timestamp_created":1632400835,"timestamp_updated":1632400835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99827516","author":{"steamid":"76561198989729174","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":471,"last_played":1644761937},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game.
