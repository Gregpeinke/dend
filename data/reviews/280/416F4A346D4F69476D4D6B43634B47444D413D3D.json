YES!!! Now, please, come ON people! Stop hating it because it is \"the same as the original\". I will tell you why it is BETTER than the original. 1. If you beat the game but forgot to save, this game allows you to go to ANY point in the game. 2. It is a nice love letter to those Half-Life 1 and exansion players. 3. Yes, it is the same game, BUT, Valve wants new players to go try the 1998 classic, with better lighting, physics, and just some better mechanics that Gold Source could not handle. BONUS FOR GMOD PLAYERS. 4. You can't use Gold Source models in the game without addons, so now you don't have to. So I give this game a 10 out of 10. So new players who haven't had a chance to try the original, hope you like it, and people hating the game because the reason stated before, hope you know see reason Valve made this game!","timestamp_created":1417220929,"timestamp_updated":1417221194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56589508056640625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13130466","author":{"steamid":"76561198032412523","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":792,"last_played":1332918000},"language":"english","review":"This is the quintessential FPS.

Right now I'm playing through it in the DK2 to get the complete package. The Source version does polish up the original quite a bit, there are many HD models, water effects, shadows, modelled environments instead of cube-maps etc. I paid for this separately, and I'm happy I did.\n\nAs for playing in VR, of course it's awesome, but. Before doing this I've played 30h+ of HL2 in the DK1, 15h+ of the episodes in DK2, as well as a ton of other VR experiences. This game, HL1, is not for the person without VR legs if you want to play it with supreme immersion. You run super fast, close to the ground, haha. At first it was a bit crazy, but now nine hours later I'm very used to it, and I plan on finishing the entire thing in the DK2.\n\nA classic I never experienced at the time, but I still remember seeing it when visiting a friend.

For me there is no fix.\n\nWhen the game needs the user to open up the console and cheat to get it working, then you know its wrong.\n\nThe game feels like it was halfassed.
