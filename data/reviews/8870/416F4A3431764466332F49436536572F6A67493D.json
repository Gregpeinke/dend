Because there are a lot of different tacks one could take there.\n\nOne could point to video games that surpass their pop culture antecedents.  [i]Psychonauts[/i] is, in a lot of ways, a better kid's cartoon than actual kid cartoons.  [i]Half-Life 2[/i] is a better action movie than actual action movies.\n\nOr, one could point to video games in which the actual experience of play was something fundamentally new and experientially exciting.  [i]Katamari Damacy[/i] is something that didn't exist in human experience before [i]Katamari Damacy[/i] the game.  And it would be just [i]weird[/i] to argue that [i]SUPERHOT[/i] isn't a challenging and thought-provoking installation piece— the kind of experience that would have absolutely provoked intrigued conversation had it surfaced as a MOMA exhibition rather than a piece of downloaded software.\n\nOne [i]could[/i] just appeal to Ebert's narrativist prejudice and point out games in which a story is told expansively in a way not possible before interactive media.  [i]Fallout: New Vegas[/i] is a huge story, with a spectrum of factions and environments and theme development based on player choice, but the [i]entirety[/i] of that story, all that was and is and could be in it— with the attendant experience of navigating your own way through the forking paths of outcomes— mean that the videogame format make it it possibly the most absorbing and immersive postapocalyptic fantasy experience ever.\n\nBut then I always end up thinking: [i]Bioshock Infinite[/i].  Because it's just so obvious.  The story has such a literary quality.  The writing is impeccable.  The SF elements are thought-provoking and conceptually-challenging.  The visual development of Columbia as an immersive space to experience is both gorgeous and compelling.  The rich and contradictory characters.  The skillful approach to the difficult subject matter of America's dark history.  The complicated reflections on intent and outcome, on prosperity and justice, on decency and degeneracy.  It's hard to imagine anyone playing this game and doubting the potential of video games.\n\nR.I.P. Roger.  I know it's an FPS-type game, so, [i]yes[/i], some of your experience will be spent unloading grenade after grenade into bullet sponges.  And I know you would never have [i]seriously[/i] given video games a chance; you would have listened to any argument, [url=https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/video-games-can-never-be-art]dismissed it on spurious, intellectually groundless points[/url], and considered your position secure.

A little bit about the story of this game; it takes place in a floating city named Columbia where crazy things happened and continue to happen and you, Booker Dewitt, are sent to retrieve a \"package\", cause you owe money through gambling and you need to pay back what you owe. The game looks like and feels like a normal First person shooter, where you move around shooting people, but no... I don't want to spoil too much but you have to play through at least halfway before you start getting a headache because your mind will literally be BLOWN to bits! And since the possibilities lore-wise are endless, so are they gameplay-wise. You can use Vigors that you drink then they provide you with convenient powers that you can use in battle. Set your foes on fire before blowing them to bits with your shotgun? Check! Lift your foes in the air, slap them back down on the floor, then lift them again and headshoot each and every one of them while they cry in pain? Check! Invoke watery hands that wrap around your foes and root them in place before you slash them to death with your signature Skyline Blade? Check! The combinations are endless. The story will take you where you do not want to go, a land filled with emotions and by the end of the game, you will cry... and feel utterly confused and helpless. The voice-acting is one of the best I've seen in a videogame and the characters are so well written, you cannot but help admire them, no matter how brutally evil they are... and like all other Bioshock games, this game will make you question your reality and beliefs in ways you did not think possible.\n\nI'm through with the main game, but I've still got so much left to do.

Overall, Infinite is excellent. I'm not a big fan of the time travel-reality hopping-whatever of the story, but I really enjoyed the gameplay and the level design--even though this is often what's criticized when people reminisce about this game. The worldbuilding is solid, the characters are good, and the writing is mostly on point.\n\nBut I really hate the ending. A lot. It's trying to be thought provoking, but it's bridled by the unfortunate reality that what's postulated as happening at the end is impossible, makes no sense, is stupid, and is so outside of what could realistically happen that it's not worth thinking about. Yeah, I know, people think it's deep or whatever, but I don't understand why. Ken Levine says:\n\n\"Wow! Isn't that mindblowing? Just think about what that twist means!\"\n\nAnd ChalkStorm says, \"Why should I bother thinking about something that's categorically impossible in real life and makes no actual sense when you do try to think about it?\"\n\n\"But think about it!\"\n\nAnyway, suffice it to say that the conclusion of this game could effectively be Ken Levine saying, \"Imagine the world if 2+2=5!\" Saying as much is meaningless. If it could be true, it wouldn't be true. It's not worth contemplating. \n\nBut I'm in the minority, I guess most people like wasting their time decyphering nonsense.

One point from Songbird, he's a good boy\n\nRight from the setting, somehow it feels like there were more things going on in the dying, fucked up city of Rapture, compared to the big, well populated city of Columbia. Most of the game feels like a completely linear, narrow hallway with the exception of like two segments where you're made to explore around a little bit. Not to mention the entire explanation to this place being more technologically advanced than Rapture like 40 years before Rapture was built feels like a massive, lazy asspull\n\nThe two gun limit is so much not fun it amazes me. Not only that but there's also no more than one ammo type with any guns. I carried the Sniper Rifle throughout the entire game when I found it, upgraded that to maximum and never cared too much to upgrade other guns unless I did it for fun. Why would I feel like upgrading guns when I could only get the use of them sometimes. In addition I rarely felt like upgrading guns even mattered. Some upgrades to some guns are really good, but some upgrades just barely do anything. The upgrades don't even change how your guns look which is somewhat boring. Most of the guns feel just way worse than most others too, I never saw a point to using some guns, like the regular pistol as soon as you found anything else. This game also managed to have a really unsatisfying and weak feeling shotgun that even has an upgrade to lower its accuracy. Cool I guess? In the first two games the upgrades are rare but really useful, and you really have to think about which ones to get, and they even change how your gun looked. That was neat\n\nThe two weapon limit also ties in to many of the enemies being really not fun to fight against. The Handymen just charge at your face and keep hitting you while tanking a ton of bullets. So many times I just spent all my bullets at them and let them kill me so I could revive and have some new bullets again to try to kill them with those. If I ran out I let them kill me again so I could spend the regain bullets again, spend them on other enemies first and use their guns instead\nThe Firemen just keep lobbing firebombs at you, leading the throws with pinpoint accuracy so you just get drained of your health mid fight until you kill them, which takes quite some amount of bullets and time too\nThe crows just teleport in your back or face, get in a free hit before you can shoot at them. They're really just pretty boring with nothing much going on for them\nThe regular enemies die fast and drop ammo and health, but compared to the Splicers that seek you out and keep shouting shit at you, these guys just hide until they shoot at you, giving away their positions and then you shoot them\nThe rocket enemies are also boring because they're armored, so you're forced to expose yourself to the rockets for longer while they sponge up bullets\nThe snipers shoot at you immediately when they get a line of sight if they're in position, you get no opportunity to shoot first, which got annoying very very fast\nIn the first two Bioshock games it was really fun to fight against most enemies, even the tankiest enemies, Big Daddies, were fun since you could prepare for the fight against them, hack security so they would help, set up traps, use ammo types that were strong against them. You can't do any of that in this game, you can only use a plasmid to possess a turret at best, sometimes you can use Elizabeth's admittedly nice Tear ability to find some small assistance, but you can NOT set up any traps or use any ammo types that are strong against them, since none of those things exist. The enemies in this game just attack you on sight and you just have to keep trying to kill them until you win\n\nThe plasmids, or \"vigors\" as this game calls the completely different things, are also dumbed down so much it just annoys me. You just get all of them automatically for free so you never have to think about which ones to get or use. Especially since most of them are completely useless in this one too. I ended up only using Possession and Crows in the end because all the other ones didn't do jack fuck. Upgrading them is most of the time just some number changes, as opposed to how the first two games gave them new functionalities. I could only think of a couple of upgrades for them in this game that felt interesting or really useful\nThe passive plasmids you could equip in the first two games are replaced by \"gear\" which is special loot you sometimes find from the few secrets this game has, and from Handymen. As far as I understood you get a randomly picked item that gives you some improvements, most of which felt useless, like being able to move faster on the railways. Which doesn't really do anything in practice. There were a few nice ones, like the one that improves your critical hit damage or the one that makes all guns reload faster.\n\nI also wished so much you could carry health packs and whatever this game's equivalent of eve needles would be. This is another removed mechanic that you made you think about your purchases in the first two games, and made exploration feel more useful but can't have any of that in this travesty\n\nThe only good things I can think of in this game are like Elizabeth and her tear ability that lets you alter the arenas with changes like helpful turrets, cover, new guns, one time use health packs, things like that. \nThe railway things you can travel on were pretty fun, even though using them mid-fight was also often a bad idea since the enemies still hit you pretty easily. But when you could use them effectively they were pretty fun and gave the game some nice mobility, that felt refreshing since most of the game is just sitting behind a cover. Running out of the cover often just meant you take unnecessary damage for low payoff. \nI also really liked the Songbird, he was a cool character, which I interpreted was sort of a Big Daddy equivalent? He was a good lad, I want like a plushie of him or something\n\nOverall Biosock Infinite did absolutely nothing better than the first two games did, either removed or dumbed down every single mechanic and took out all the fun. This shit just made me miserable. I would actually heavily recommend AGAINST playing this game at all. Just skip it. It's not worth the time. 2/10","timestamp_created":1592350998,"timestamp_updated":1592350998,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":36,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.625532805919647217","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70908507","author":{"steamid":"76561198876451323","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":529,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1592414785},"language":"spanish","review":"buena jugabilidad, buena historia, buenos personajes. totalmente recomendable","timestamp_created":1592350705,"timestamp_updated":1592350705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41vDf3/ICe6W/jgI="}
