You want it to look as good as it did in its halcyon days but you want to \"modern\" it up just a tad. You paint the house as you see fit and after the job is said and done you look back on your work. The job is noticably half assed and paint is running onto the ground and carpets inside. Paint bubbles are everywhere and some walls have a thicker coat than others. For some reason a support beam to the house was broken in the process and the structure is noticably listing. And as i final \"touch\" there are some abscure foreign paintings nailed to the wall that nobody on earth would buy on a whim.\n\nIf anything the analogy is about as good as the game itself.\n\nSombody asked for a repaint of the original half life and the people who did it busted the game beyond repair.\n\nPROS:\n-Its half-life in all its semi-untouched glory\n\nCONS: \n-All the little quirks the original half-life kept intact.\n-Various graphical bugs.\n-Various NPC bugs.\n-Dialogue bugs.\n-Animation bugs.\n-Bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs.\n\nAll of the bugs this game has had may have been fixed but i honestly expect to find more.\n\nYou'd think that a repaint of a game from 89 wouldn't have so many downsides to it.

The complete lack of ANY communication for TEN YEARS is completly disgusting, It is disrepectful to the fans who supported valve for years. Its sad that valve doesnt even have the courtesy to tell their fans that half life is dead. It is clear that we will never get a satisfying ending to an amazing story. I personally am not interested in anything valve has released since Episode 2, and if the single player story driven masterpieces of recent years are anything to go by, its that valve only cares about its games as service titles, and not their narative driven campaigns. I am deeply upset that we will never get to explore the atmospheric and exciting universe of half life again. Valve prides themselves on their independance and flat workplace structure, but its clear there is a lack of focus. Valve, like too many companies in the video games industry, seem to be too blinded on following the money, they have left behind those that got them there in the first place...","timestamp_created":1504582732,"timestamp_updated":1504582732,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.388506799936294556","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34748640","author":{"steamid":"76561198037347067","num_games_owned":387,"num_reviews":205,"playtime_forever":2225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2210,"last_played":1574437474},"language":"english","review":"MY REVISED HALF-LIFE VIDEO REVIEW:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwmpJjAXDEA\n\n[b]Intro[/b]\nI don't like using the words 'overrated' and 'underrated', but I'm going to be hypocritical here and call this game, by FAR, the MOST OVERRATED game I've EVER played. I cannot fathom how or why this game gets so much praise. ALL of the praise I hear this game get I can give to another far superior game that came out\nin the same year or even earlier. It's a glitch riddled, overly linear, somewhat dull FPS that overshadowed far more interesting and enjoyable titles of the year. \n\n[b]The Great:[/b]\n++Fighting the human enemies (HCE marines) is a lot of fun\n++AI is incredibly smart, not just for its time, but for now too\n++Lots of enemy variety\n++Soundtrack is fantastic\n++Brilliant mod support\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+Headshots are satisfying\n+Weapons are diverse\n+There are nice optional HD models\n+Game supports ultra high resolutions by default\n+Sound design is very good even if the actual quality is low\n+Often impressive set pieces, the one place where this game actually did innovate, except fans of the game praise it for the very things they despise about CoD?\n\n[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]\n+-Story? What story? Oh, you mean how there's occassional dialogue given by NPC's (that is, if it doesn't cut short for no reason) every once in a while? Come on, there's hardly a story other than an experiment went wrong, aliens invaded, then marines were sent to kill everyone involved with the project. Now, escape! Riveting stuff..\n-+Gordon Freeman is mute and has very backstory. Not sure how a boring scientist can take on hundreds of highly trained marines either, as well as massive aliens.\n+-Multiplayer is average\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n-Short game\n-Movement SUCKS. It feels like I'm roller skating and jump crouching as well as the air control movement feels off\n-A good few weapons are straight up useless\n-Some enemy types, especially towards the end, are REALLY not fun to fight\n-Game is often praised for its atmosphere, but to me it's like a cheesy B-movie. All atmosphere is lost when dialogue is always cut short and when I see a scientist jump through a window, running away from zombies only to greet me and say \"Greetings!\" over enthusiastically.\n-Field of view is awfully small and there's no slider\n-The 5 minute long tram ride is a slow, dull showcase of uninteresting environments and has zero interactivity, and neither does the 10 minute intro after\n-Hitboxes suck\n-Has really bad screen tearing, no matter the frame rate\n-Audio quality is poor\n-Horrible animations\n-No reason to play this again with no other game modes, a dead multiplayer community and no bots and a short campaign\n\n[b]The Horrible:[/b]\n--Level design is shoddy and often not a lot of fun to explore. It also makes no sense. Who puts meat grinders in a scientific research facility?\n--The Hard difficulty isn't fun since it just turns enemies into bullet sponges. Two direct shotgun blasts and a grenade should kill a bullsquid, as should two direct shotgun blasts to a marine's torso...\n--Game looks laughably bad, even in comparison to other poorer looking titles of the year\n--Game goes from too easy to too hard in the last few chapters. One of the worst difficulty spikes I've ever felt.\n--Gunplay is unsatisfying (besides headshots) and weapons feel dull. It's not awful, just very much below average.\n--Buggy beyond belief. I cannot think of a single other game that I can manage to glitch out irrepairably within the first 10 seconds of gameplay... 'gameplay' being a word used loosely as you sit in a square 'room' with nothing to do. And this is after 2 decades of constant patches...\n\nSound: 6/10\nGraphics: 3/10\nGameplay: 4/10\nContent/Replayability: 2/10\nOverall: 4/10 (Based on my overall enjoyment of the game)\nAverage: 4/10 (The four main categories added together, divided and rounded up)\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n1998 is my favourite year for gaming. Half-Life is not a reason why. In-fact, it's almost a point against it. What a shame that other innovative titles had their trophies stolen by a far lesser game.

I wouldn't give this a 10 because it's just Half Life only slightly improved (graphicly) but the game is indeed still good so it gets a

The lighting is realistic, and the textures in general are rendered at a slightly higher definition and are more colorful and dynamic. More notably, some of the textures or props have been replaced with those from [i]Half-Life 2[/i] due to their similarities in appearance and function. The water, for example, is exactly what one would see in the sequel, and the overall environment is improved.\n[b]+[/b] Nice about this port is the fact that there is now level selection, and messing with the Developer Console as a result of porting the game is easier to use. It provides some sense of interface and user-friendliness of that of [i]Half-Life 2[/i].\n[b]+[/b] One notice to the artificial intelligence is that they are generally more aggressive in fighting than those in the original, which in itself is not necessarily an improvement. However, in the original, enemies were more likely to stay in their posts and less likely to respond to incoming grenades or attacks; that is the improvement.\n[b]=[/b] It managed to retain every aspect that made the original good with its strong faithfulness, though it is more or less the same experience.\n[b]-[/b] Just by the looks of the port, it is quite clear that Valve was either concerned about their budget or just outright lazy. Either way, with most of the assets and files being unaltered, there are a few changes other than the replaced engine that make choosing this over the original game worthwhile. Even the multiplayer aspect (sold separately) is mostly unchanged, with the same old Deathmatch as its only game mode, but at least, we get what is advertised, since the multiplayer aspect is branded [i]Half-Life: Deathmatch[/i].\n[b]-[/b] Notorious for several glitches, notably the one that is bound to generate seizures in photoepileptics, located in the first part of chapter 10: Residue Processing. If one were to play the original and then this remake, he can easily find some glitches not present in the original, but even those who never played the original can still spot some of the glitches.\n\n[b]CONCLUSION:[/b]\nAs a GoldSrc-to-Source port or update to one of the greatest FPS games ever, [i]Half-Life: Source[/i] succeeds in invigorating the environment with somewhat richer graphics and realism, but as a remake or commercialized product to bring on a refreshed experience, it fails to truly convince players of the original (and even newcomers to the franchise) to purchase this one.

It follows the misadventures of a guy with glasses as he shoots aliens with guns, in HD! Sort of.\n\nSo in an attempt to hype up the source engine, which Half-Life 2 was developed on as well, Valve went on ahead and ported Half-Life, a GoldSrc game, to the Source engine, obviously. Sort of. See the thing is, it's not a perfect port, and it's imperfect for a ton of dumb, easy to fix reasons. It baffled me, walking through the halls of \"HD\" Black Mesa, seeing scientists hover above their chairs, guns dropped by enemies wedged into the walls next to them, and various times where the gameplay didn't trigger causing me to have to reload. These problems are generally specfic to the moments they happen in, and would take 14 seconds to fix, literally. Those scientists doing their xen yoga tricks (see what i did there?) above their chairs are props, not npc's, what's stopping Valve from just realigning them so they actually SIT on the chairs? \n\nThe slightly higher definition textures and lighting effects are nice, I like that metal shine for sure, but if you're anything like me then the graphics of vanillla Half-Life hold a lot of charm, and if you're not like me than the graphics of HL: Source don't upgrade enough to impress you. If you want to get into classic Half-Life but think it hasn't aged very well, (who can blame you?) than I recommend Black Mesa instead, it's a much more solid remake of Half-Life and eons more care went into that than went into this. It's really baffling that, for all the playtesting Valve holds dear, it feels like they never actually tested this product to see if it holds up.\n\nThere are worse ways to spend your money, and this tends to go pretty low in price during sales, but I'd honestly pass on this.","timestamp_created":1502489393,"timestamp_updated":1502489393,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606978654861450195","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34154962","author":{"steamid":"76561198286695818","num_games_owned":451,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":806,"last_played":1520705154},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyunda zaman zaman çok fazla çıkmaza gelinsede nasıl yapılcağını anladığınızda gülüp geçiyorsunuz.
