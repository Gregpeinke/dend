І спочатку це сприймається навіть позитивно, враховуючи скільки нам треба бігати по комплексу, ще перед початком сумновідомого експерименту, проте це тільки до першого платформінгу.

Так, можна, і навіть багато. Але це все хороше було взяте із оригінальної \"Half-Life\" без змін, тож і відноситься саме до оригіналу. Скажу чесно, не очікував я такої халтури від \"Valve\".

you want to play Half Life, either stick to the original, or play Black Mesa. The current version of Half Life: Source has several glaring bugs. If you haven't played Half Life before, you might not notice them, but they are very detriminal to the experience.\n\n- The crowbar always plays the sound for hitting concrete when you hit other objects or surfaces. Using the crowbar is a central aspect of the gameplay, especially in the earlier chapters, and this bug takes away an important cue as when it makes sense to bash onto something or not.\n- The pre-calculated global illumination and the improved materials cause the interiors of ventilation shafts to be bright, which are supposed to be pitch black (forcing you to use the flash light).\n- The flash light doesn't have a limited battery as it has in the original, which also diminishes the \"horror\" aspect of the game.\n- Physics don't work exactly like in the original. Puzzles that ask you to push boxes around are harder to solve here because boxes appear to have almost no weight or friction.\n- Some scripted sequences involving NPCs (e.g. a scientist peeking out of the trash container he is hiding in when you come close to it for the first time) appear to be missing, which harms the atmosphere.\n\nIf my memory serves, not all of these issues existed in the release version of Half Life: Source.","timestamp_created":1590613740,"timestamp_updated":1590613740,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539333760738372803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69908393","author":{"steamid":"76561198934233865","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1635009407},"language":"brazilian","review":"melor jogo\n","timestamp_created":1590612088,"timestamp_updated":1590612088,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69890713","author":{"steamid":"76561198090727494","num_games_owned":438,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":618,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":518,"last_played":1624985464},"language":"schinese","review":"classic!","timestamp_created":1590587000,"timestamp_updated":1590587000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543015062808990479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69872371","author":{"steamid":"76561198038331598","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1609198790},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1590554097,"timestamp_updated":1590554097,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492424249649047852","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41q6aqvICc6/FigI="}
