Шутер стал более динамичный и увлекательный , игра стала более жесткой и кровавой , но при этом все не скатилось до уровня какой-нибудь \"кровавой бани\". Оружие стало более органичным и более чувствительным в отличие от предыдущих частей . Помимо этого никуда не делись плазмиды (а точнее \"энергетики\") , которые привносят свою львиную долю геймплейных элементов в игру . Так же есть аэрокрюк., который добавляет жестокость игре , именно с него вы и будете получать кучу оторванных голов на экране. В остальных случаях оружие стандарт любого шутера (пистолеты , пулеметы , винтовки , ружья итп итд). \nВ игре в отличие от прошлых частей просто красочный мир , цвета яркие и насыщенные теплом и эмоционально согревающими ваше воображение. Эпоха , место действие выполняют просто 100 % атмосферного погружения в игру. Красочная , яркая (но не всегда) и красивая игра.\nОтдельного слова заслеживает Элизабет которая выполняет просто кучу полезных функции и действий для героя , благодаря ей игра приобретает другие краски в некоторых местах . И да сюжет , про него говорить не особо и надо , сами поймет , а самое главное это концовка.\nИгра просто великолепна и залуживает времени которое можно на нее потратить и вы не пожалеете . К сожалению обзор написан только сейчас , а игра была пройдена еще в день релиза , но до сих пор игра просто Великолепна.   10 / 10 аэрохуков им в горло.","timestamp_created":1369136598,"timestamp_updated":1511446930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"728862","author":{"steamid":"76561197976746890","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":1467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1498898979},"language":"english","review":"Probably one of the best games I've ever played storywise. The combat does start to die down a bit and it'll feel like filler material towards the end of the game. However, the story is what really drives Bioshock Infinite. At first everything seems straight forward, but when the story unfolds it starts to boggle your mind. By the end, it brought a tear to my eye because it allows the player to build so much emotional connection with the character(s) that you'll feel a thud in your heart or have goosebumps all over whenever certain events in the story takes place.\n\nHonestly, you have to finish this game. The story right up to the ending is so well thought-out that you couldn't have seen it coming and I'd probably brand this as a game that set yet another milestone. I can't vouche for its combat, honestly, because it's definitely a \"repeat\" of Bioshock 1 if you will; but the skylines add a fantastic twist to the fights because it's not just restricted to your use. Each \"arena\" where you fight a bunch of people before a boss or similar shows up, has its own unique twists and it'll only get more and more chaotic, if not unnerving towards the finale.\n\nThe game itself is relatively short compared to most other games (clocking in at about 9 hours on hard difficulty) but in the end, it's probably one of the best 7 hours of my life (minus 2 from the combat...). If this was condensed into a movie, I'd say hello Oscar and slot it into my \"watch once a year\" shelf right next to Forrest Gump. (: \n\nThen again... Probably not.

Потрясающая игра, возможно лучшая в этом году (на мой взгляд). История как всегда (для серии BioShock) интригующая и по сравнению с предыдущими частями, эффект \"удара мешком с кирпичами по голове\" в последних 10-15 минутах игры  просто невероятный. После концовки вся игра ощущается иначе... И появляется жгучее желание \"развидеть\" концовку :(, чтобы пройти ещё раз. Главное не наглотаться \"спойлеров\"! Слегка разочаровывает лишь линейность сюжета и отсутствие альтернатив в конце... Разумеется, после прохождения возникла масса вопросов, вырисовываются различные параллели между прошлыми частями. Словом разработчики сделали своё дело! Рекомендую пройти хотя бы первую часть серии, чтобы усилить эффект \"удара по голове\" тем мешком :).\n\nИ эта первая игра, где NPC, сопровождающий тебя почти всё время, ощущается как живой человек! Самый \"живой\" игровой персонаж из когда-либо виденных мною. Едва ли не вся игра держится на \"няшке\" Элизабет. К слову, те же Аликс Вэнс, Эйлин Гэлвин или, скажем, Кортана (из серии Halo) - нервно курят в сторонке.\n\nВсе остальные составляющие (графика, звук, музыка и боевая система) игры на высоком уровне. Дополняют общую картину.\n\nРазочаровали враги, а точнее туповатый ИИ. Местные аналоги \"Больших Папочек\" появляются всего несколько раз за игру и не вызывают каких-либо проблем даже на самом высоком уровне сложности (доступном при первом прохождении). Играть рекомендую сразу на высокой сложности. Игра очень и очень простая. Хотя есть режим \"1999\" для ценителей настоящих испытаний. Пока не проходил в нём :).\n\nЕсли будет новый BioShock (или дополнения к BioShock Infinite) – обязательно куплю. Ждём \"город поз землёй\" или \"город в космосе\"/\"город на Луне\"?","timestamp_created":1368902442,"timestamp_updated":1392473762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542875409126281738","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2035594","author":{"steamid":"76561198001269511","num_games_owned":420,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":3758,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1307,"last_played":1625326816},"language":"russian","review":"Одна из моих самых любимых игр этого года =) \n\nИграл в первую часть, но так и не прошел её до конца, мне просто надоела.

The gameplay definitely has its moments, but the story and mechanics are in dire need of revision. Worth playing for sure, but it's not the lightning-in-a-bottle that was the first game. Bioshock's strongest triumphs were overcoming the usual AAA-game mistake of serious disconnect between gameplay and story, strong customization of playstyle and resource management, and presented its city and governing philosphies in a way that felt real, mature, and logically conclusive.  In contrast, to say nothing of the extremely dumbed-down mechanics, muddled weapons, and interchanable plasmids, Columbia is clearly one big scripted facade, full of caricatures, all railroaded on a suspiciously linear path.  Long story short, I came away from the first Bioshock feeling like Rapture was a real place full of real monsters, and instilled with a strong politcal statement of what the logical conclusion of objectivism would really look like.  Infinite was about... nothing really.
