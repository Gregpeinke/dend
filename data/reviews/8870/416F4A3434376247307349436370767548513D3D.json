For example, I shoot at the marines in Halo due to them not being so helpful, (and it's fun to watch them dodge grenades). I do get anything good out of shooting Elizabeth, because you can't. She can save your life in many situations. \n\nI also like the vigors,(despite most of them being a little underpowered) that you can use in this game. The game isn't the game where you can run into battle with a shotgun without losing a lot of health. You need to take cover and attempt to shoot people, (unless you are playing on easy mode).","timestamp_created":1385783275,"timestamp_updated":1387070466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7836640","author":{"steamid":"76561197972270962","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1755,"last_played":1419356339},"language":"english","review":"SO GOOD.","timestamp_created":1385783245,"timestamp_updated":1385783245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476232558488845825","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7836580","author":{"steamid":"76561198012602234","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1258,"last_played":1572596485},"language":"english","review":"Amazing.","timestamp_created":1385782973,"timestamp_updated":1385782973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7836579","author":{"steamid":"76561198027459045","num_games_owned":295,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":619,"last_played":1410002103},"language":"koreana","review":"너무 잼잇어...;;대작임 ;꼭 해보시길 적극 추천함 ; 장난아님 ;","timestamp_created":1385782971,"timestamp_updated":1385782971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523178815841674805","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7836491","author":{"steamid":"76561197996356478","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":480,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":480,"last_played":1381113767},"language":"english","review":"It's about 5 hours of a really engaging story and world.

It is enough to keep you entertained and can be quite challenging at times though at no point did I feel like the enemies were insurmountable. What really drives Infinite and the other Bioshock games though is the story and ambience. Columbia is a city birthed from the notion of American exceptionalism taken to the extreme and you can see it and feel it in every corner of the game world. The plot and story, particularly your relationship with Elizabeth, is incredibly well done and the ending will smack you in the face and leave you speechless.

It invites you to a beautiful city above the clouds and fills it with enough life and sounds to make you want to take the time to linger and drink it all in. Very stunning. I found myself taking the time to appreciate all the fine points the designers put into make this game as immersive as possible. It feels believable. \nThe story also unfolds brilliantly: its starts as both simple and idealistic - everything is as honest as it seems - but quickly hints at a darker undertones until the beauty and the beast are violently revealed. The story tears into you with the wolf dressed in sheep's clothing and demands that you confront it. Is everything still so beautiful now that you've seen what exactly lies beneath? There is also hope - a hope you are asked to hold on to even as the game does its best to wrestle it away from you.\nGameplay-wise, however, I didn't find Bioshock Infinite in any way special. It flowed nicely, had excellent pacing, and included some details that made the game memorable, but all told was a very simple First Person experience. Weapons are basic, powers are basic, gameplay is stream-lined enough not to get in the way of the player experience. Not necessarily a bad thing in this instance. \n\nAll in all, truly enjoyable game deserving of high marks.","timestamp_created":1385754640,"timestamp_updated":1385754640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7829674","author":{"steamid":"76561197968691651","num_games_owned":3097,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1261,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":941,"last_played":1627146887},"language":"english","review":"loved this game some people have said that the story is convoluted but i loved it from begining to end. still playing through the dlc at the moment as i don't wanna rush it but well worth the money.","timestamp_created":1385754579,"timestamp_updated":1385754579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7829420","author":{"steamid":"76561197970628459","num_games_owned":322,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1618,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1388,"last_played":1539290856},"language":"english","review":"incredibly overrated in almost every way.  the only nice thing about it is the concept of a floating city however its execution is lacking.  the so called legendary eliabeth is nothing more then a poor mechanic reminding the player they suck at rescource mangement and might as well have a house in the middle of uncanney valley.\n\ni only got it as it came with xcom, but to be honest not even that dispell the bitter aftertaste\n\nverdict: dont bother.","timestamp_created":1385753834,"timestamp_updated":1385753834,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536069750785827637","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7829353","author":{"steamid":"76561198090880147","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":919,"last_played":1559005021},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock was always a magical experience for me, something a lot of games lack now a days, and this game by no means disappoints.","timestamp_created":1385753644,"timestamp_updated":1385753644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7829330","author":{"steamid":"76561198046628736","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":878,"last_played":1571436098},"language":"english","review":"This is an amazing experience to behold, I spent 9 hours in my first playthrough and immediately started my second, good replayability, great story, and some decent dlc if you get bored with the amazing storyline","timestamp_created":1385753555,"timestamp_updated":1385753555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7829199","author":{"steamid":"76561198045234913","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":14030,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12287,"last_played":1399773350},"language":"spanish","review":"Eh...

O sistema de combate é simples, bastante dinâmico e divertido, o que pode ocasionar em uma certa repetitividade de ação que, mesmo sendo monótona em determinadas partes, tudo é ofuscado por uma fantástica história que cativa e impulsiona o jogador a todo o momento.

What really sets this game back is the distinct lack and obvious work around the devs did when making this game. In the demo Elizabeth's tits were at least twice the size but in this game they're like half. They used to be fucking watermelons and now they are merely saggy lemons, anybody would think she's just a typical lemon whore, why would any sane person change that? THIS GAME DOESN'T EVEN HAVE BOOB PHYSICS! After touching myself furiously to the first few demos this game released it was clear that the full release game was not intended to be an extended means of masturbation, which as you can imagine sadened many a poor boy. After crying to my daddy on the telephone, \"how long now?\" I was stricken with the realization that perhaps I could still one rub one out to Elizabeth, even with the lack of breasts that she had once obtained. So I poured myself a glass of fruit loops and let my hand fall into my pants. Elizabeth did not get me going for a second, but there was a shiny knight waiting for me, his name is Booker and I'll tell you what, that man has a lovely jaw line.

It was a shock to be away from rapture but it has worked really really well. The graphics i take my hat off to are amazing and cannot be criticised.\n\nAlthough all that said there were points in the game where i wanted to pretend they didnt happen but im afraid they did. For instance at the start at the lighthouse the puzzle to the door, i believe that was arbotary and really could have done without. Yes it maybe there due to the security as Columbia is not just some place everyone is allowed, but i would have prefered a little harder puzzle or dialogue at that scene.\n\nOverall great game 8/10 recomend purchasing, im actually away to buy burail at sea, cant wait :D!!!!","timestamp_created":1385750673,"timestamp_updated":1385750673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7828144","author":{"steamid":"76561197964542340","num_games_owned":936,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1479774578},"language":"english","review":"This is, hands down, the best game I have played in years.
