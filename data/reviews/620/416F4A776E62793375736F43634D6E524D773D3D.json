The story is really well done, it has it's highs, it's lows, it's funny parts and its sad parts. It's really well written, and it's one of my favourite stories in a game, of all time. Also it's pretty lengthy, I spent about 23 hours doing the story alone. \n\nOntop of the amazing single player campaign, there is also a co-op campaign in which you and your friend (or a random stranger if you can't find a friend) can spend hours completing. It's not as long as the single player campaign, but it's good for about 5-6 hours...maybe. \n\nThen there are loads of amazing fan made maps. They are some amazing ones that are single player and some that are co-op, and these add hundreds and hundreds of hours ontop of this amazing game. \n\nTo put it simply, if you don't own this game - you're missing out.\n\nOh...and I almost forgot to mention the content creator.

Especially since I heard they increased the length of the game considerately. I loved the length of the first one and finished the game in one 2-3 hour session. Fortunately, all my worries were unfounded.\n\nThe game starts pretty much like you expect it. You do some puzzles, race towards GlaDOS, and even have a funny side kick (great voice acting by Stephen Merchant). After the first couple of chapters however, the game and story completely pull the rug from under you. Like the first Portal, the story and characters are a highlight in this game.\n\nThe best part of this game is it's pacing. It never bores, never makes you do the same kind of puzzles for too long, and throws some new mechanics at you every hour.\n\nConcluding, an amazing follow-up to an already amazing game!

Brilliant and better game than it's predecessor.","timestamp_created":1419305161,"timestamp_updated":1419305161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13537380","author":{"steamid":"76561198119775675","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":432,"last_played":1628841367},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de los mejores juegos a mi punto de vista y destacando a GLaDOS como un villano excelente :D","timestamp_created":1419304230,"timestamp_updated":1419304230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13537285","author":{"steamid":"76561198104189168","num_games_owned":366,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":2355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1260,"last_played":1629314817},"language":"spanish","review":"Mejor juego de puzzles en la existencia?\nProbablemente sí.","timestamp_created":1419303759,"timestamp_updated":1625084711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13537146","author":{"steamid":"76561198051376832","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":997,"last_played":1446708234},"language":"schinese","review":"一款让你脑洞大开的游戏，关卡的优良设计，还有创意工坊的大量地图量都为这游戏延续生命里，相信我，当你开始玩这游戏时你就会被深深吸引了。ＩＧＮ的９.５分给的合理！！","timestamp_created":1419303086,"timestamp_updated":1419303086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13537077","author":{"steamid":"76561197972335980","num_games_owned":481,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1152,"last_played":1641766663},"language":"english","review":"The best game ever made?\n\nmaybe\n\nit's that good","timestamp_created":1419302807,"timestamp_updated":1419302807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13537062","author":{"steamid":"76561198080070614","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":10045,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8920,"last_played":1636925387},"language":"english","review":"Couldn't solve Wheatley's test chamber 11/10","timestamp_created":1419302746,"timestamp_updated":1419302746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13536961","author":{"steamid":"76561198120798379","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":415,"last_played":1624186386},"language":"english","review":"im a horrible person.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1419302213,"timestamp_updated":1419302213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511111080646514893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13536851","author":{"steamid":"76561198031796569","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2437,"last_played":1642992565},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorites.

Not in a bad way like Hitman: Absolution (which i reviewed in a bit too much of detail). This could be one of the best sequels for a game, I've played, though it really didn't start as a serious project and since bloomed into something that's pretty damn great. \n\nIf you're not familiar, this was really just a lone physics game that valve aquired and then turned into Portal. So where to go from a shot game about puzzles with physics? Start with: new puzzles (obviously), also make a well made story with atmosphere and humor the game was originally known for, include a mysterious deeper lore for previous fans, add new ways to solve puzzles, have friends co-op on a seperate part of the game with even more puzzles, then finaly as Cave Johnson would probably add \"Market the crap out of it\".\n    \n So i am here to say they did it all, and they did it right. It's hard for me to say anything bad, not even sure there is anything inherently bad about this game. Maybe how mainsteam the game has become? Not really. Lack of puzzels after game? No they fixed that. Maybe the lack of answers from the lore? Hopefully in time it will all be answered. But overall in gameplay, visuals, and story, this one is a keeper.","timestamp_created":1419301459,"timestamp_updated":1419301988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13536625","author":{"steamid":"76561198032350252","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1423960270},"language":"brazilian","review":"ben 10","timestamp_created":1419300825,"timestamp_updated":1419300825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13536502","author":{"steamid":"76561198058046600","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1570043213},"language":"spanish","review":"Un gran juego que demuestra que no siempre es necesario contar con mucho armamento y accesorios para que este desarrolle una buena historia y emocion con el estilo humoristico que caracteriza a este juego, mas aun si se juega en multijugador o en camaras de la comunidad; tiene su gran sentido del humor hacia la humanidad, y un gran villano muy al estilo de que pasaria si una IA decidiera que los humanos son innecesarios o en este caso solo sujetos de prueba acumulables y desechables, y sin dejar de lado a la heroina que nunca se rinde(ni habla). en fin un gran juego que vale cada centavo que se paga por el","timestamp_created":1419300306,"timestamp_updated":1419300306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13536400","author":{"steamid":"76561198014833480","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1545010030},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely love this game, unlimited replay value and a great sense of humour throughout.\n\n11/10","timestamp_created":1419299906,"timestamp_updated":1419299906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnby3usoCcMnRMw=="}
