However, for 2004, these graphics were astounding. A 5/10 is average graphics. \n\nSound Design: \nI can astutely tell what is going on around me in each level. It is very clear, with each enemy having a distinct sound, each gun having a distinct sound. It makes it very clear to know which enemy is coming so you can handle it. Sound design doesn't get a perfect score as it's a little weird here and there. \n\nSoundtrack:\nThe soundtrack has some bangers but the game mostly relies on the sounds of the world to amplify the experience. \n\nPlot/Dialogue:\nI feel that the plot here is better than the original and is super intriguing.  The characters have logical intentions, with a logical progression as it goes on. The facial animations are also better than some of the games that have come out as of late, and this game didn't use motion capture. The dialogue is top tier and will get a good chuckle from ya. The ending here is a great cliffhanger and I understand now why everyone wants Half-Life 3\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is definitely one of the selling points of this game. The gunplay is very diverse, with a wide selection of enemies. It really gets you thinking of how to approach the situation. The level design is also extremely well-done, with the game not holding your hand and relying on environmental clues to get you through the mission. It makes the player feel smart, which is great. The gameplay here also expands on the base game, adding some new mechanics and new level design, whish is excellent. \n\nSetting:\nThe color and scenery of the forest was awesome to experience. It really got me immersed in the setting which I enjoyed.\n\nFinal Notes:\nEpisode Two serves as a great end to Half-Life 2 and excellently sets up Half-Life 3. I hope to God they release a Half-Life 3.","timestamp_created":1614315711,"timestamp_updated":1614315711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87452123","author":{"steamid":"76561198374329010","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":346,"last_played":1648056828},"language":"english","review":"The Combine Hunter is my waifu","timestamp_created":1614307823,"timestamp_updated":1614307823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87445943","author":{"steamid":"76561198271951438","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":276,"last_played":1653161308},"language":"english","review":"Hey, do you guys remember Half Life 2: Episode 2?

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 :hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1614181232,"timestamp_updated":1614181232,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87356171","author":{"steamid":"76561198855959438","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1195,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":484,"last_played":1634604040},"language":"english","review":"hl3","timestamp_created":1614178777,"timestamp_updated":1614178777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87347040","author":{"steamid":"76561198069848836","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1608132760},"language":"english","review":"The second Expansion pack continues from Episode 1, but you don’t need to play the first episode.
