[/u][/b]\n\nPortal is the story of a young woman (named Chell, presumably) who wakes up in a science facility (Aperture Science Enrichment Centre, to be precise) after being asleep for some time (read: few years). She is chosen as a test subject for testing a 'Portal Gun' developed by the aforementioned science facility and is assisted by a robot known as GLaDOS. This game puts you in Chell's shoes as you get past different test chambers with the use of the Portal Gun.\n\n[b][u] Pros [/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Really satisfying graphics - I mean there isn't much variation in environment but whatever is displayed is in pretty good quality.\n[*] Heartpounding soundtrack - you can listen to it over and over again (it comes as a separate free download with the game too)\n[*] Groundbreaking gameplay - really, I have never played anything like this before.\n[*] Mesmerizing voice acting - There isn't any voice acting in the game apart from GLaDOS' character but the actress (Ellen McLain) really outdoes herself.\n[/list]\n\n[u][b] Cons [/b][/u]\n[list]\n[*] Really short - I finished the main story campaign in a bit over 2 hours but including the extra challenges and achievements, it takes up around 7 hours.\n[*] Kind of overpriced - for what it offers, the price tag of $9.99 is pretty steep but in the Orange Box bundle it is worth it. Separately, it should be sold for $4.99 I guess.\n[/list]\n\n[u][b] Verdict [/b][/u]\n\nThis is a fantastic game. Must play for all gamers, whether you like action, puzzle, RPG, etc. It has become a cult classic and has an equally, if not, more successful sequel aptly named Portal 2. This game isn't for the weak-hearted as the challenge maps are pretty darn challenging (see what I did there?) and a few puzzles took me up to 20 minutes to figure out (maybe I'm just dumb). The pros far outweigh the cons and it is the best game I have played in a long time.
