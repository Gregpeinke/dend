Half-Life 2 is probably my favorite in the series so far (possibly surpassed by episode two, but I tend to consider HL2 and it's episodes as one big game anyway). They just got everything right with this one. This has much more in game story than the first, much better voice acting, and character animations (especially their faces) that I would dare to say are still unmatched in any other game engines! The gameplay itself is also much improved over the first, as no longer are you getting stuck on nothing and enemies you just killed, and just the guns themselves feel better. And unlike the original, I don't remember ever having to revert to an earlier save because I had so little health and there was no way to get past without more. And despite this game being made in 2004, it is still quite beautiful. I know the graphics were improved in 2010 to bring them up to the quality of EP2 (which as I recall is still graphically superior to HL2, even if not by as much), but I still find it's graphics impressive.\n\nAnyway, this is a great game.

For starters you have the basic weapons, pistols, machine guns, a shotgun, grenades, rocket launcher (RPG?) and so on. Some weapons have dual uses like the machine gun has a grenade launcher. The weapons feel very good to use. The pistol has never been so much fun to shoot wow! I'm shocked. The machine guns have real kick to them. The shotgun seems very effective. The rocket launcher is laser guided, which is fun to take down helicopters with. Launch it and guide it to the helicopter, because if you shoot it straight, the rocket will get shot down.\n\nThe combat is rich and fulfilling with certain segments of driving such as a boat or car segment where you still get out and go into buildings to combat things. There are also puzzles and challenges to breakup the action just like there were with the original game. It keeps you thinking, sometimes over thinking. There are puzzles such as using a crane to move your car, using a washing machine to weigh down a platform and taking out a force field by rolling a car (trying not to spoil). There are less puzzles in this game than the last, most of the puzzles seem to involve combat like using the gravity gun as a weapon.\n\nLevel design is well thought out. Areas are very realistic and cluttered with things you'd really find in any given area. There are trees, junk, wrecked cars, beds, dilapidated walls, broken floors and so on. It really helps the immersion that these areas feel real instead of a typical video game level. This is a very linear game that does have little points of exploration, but you are cleverly guided through things that catch your eye. Like lights in a room are turned on or a character standing under a light and the game will condition you to subtle cues that they mean \"go here\" or characters will flat out say \"run Gordon! Go now I'll hold them off.\"\n\nThe game has several new or altered enemies. Even the old enemies are more difficult and altered. There are new head crabs, the standard and the venomous kind. For humans that have a head crab on them, they are this game's zombies, smart, difficult, dangerous zombies. You can shoot them in the head, slice them in half, sometimes the head crab will hop off, they scream a horrifying muffled wail, but worst of all... if you don't get moving they will rise again in a matter of minutes. There are several terrifying enemies that with the dark and new lighting really disturbs you and sends a dread through you that other games fail to duplicate. The game really manages to terrify you through other ways, such as traveling beneath a giant bridge actually gives you a sense of height that is strangely intense because you fear falling when clearly this is a video game. Maybe that says something about the game's immersion.\n\nOf course there are your run of the mill soldiers, and special ops enemies... but they are intelligent. Several enemies in the game are very intelligent and don't have patterns, but thought processes. Such as if they are injured, they will fall back and get a better position, if they have you pinned down, they will throw in grenades, rush in with guns blazing or bait you into firing at them. They will never line up to be shot; they will fan out so they can all shoot you.\n\nIn all the game is a lot of fun, but a lot of it isn't, especially if you're a little clueless as to what the story is, because the game won't help you with that right away at least. What might be an intense boat segment of the game might be a long annoyance for some people. Sometimes you can over think puzzles that aren't even really puzzles, but you miss a small lock to shoot off something and end up using the newly acquired gravity gun to pile junk to get over things. What could be a fun car segment with stops in between could be seen as an annoyance to have to stop, because the military has ambushed you or set up a force field.","timestamp_created":1373425059,"timestamp_updated":1373425059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":62,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.744496405124664307","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98877","author":{"steamid":"76561197961772298","num_games_owned":593,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":827,"last_played":1636236869},"language":"english","review":"The game has time.","timestamp_created":1373424942,"timestamp_updated":1373424942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"752623","author":{"steamid":"76561197977398713","num_games_owned":537,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":525,"last_played":1626451803},"language":"english","review":"The best single player FPS ever.

This game was soooo ahead of the times. Interactive/destructable environments and enemy AI that used cover was all very advanced stuff for a game from 2004. Even the models and textures seem very good to this day. Not to mention the voice acting and lip sync still seem flawless and I personally haven't seen any game that can come close to matching it. Not even top dollar productions like the Mass Effect series get the lip sync, facial expressions, and body movements as natural and seemless as HL2. The only thing that ruins this game for me are the weapons. I don't really like any of them, except for the one that can shoot any interactive object, and they all run out of ammo way too fast. Also, if memory serves me right, there was no assault rifle. There was an smg, but no true assault rifle. In any FPS the assault rifle is the bread's butter, the unicorn's horn, the alcoholic's cheap whiskey, and yet it's no where to be found in HL2.

It’s a sin to not own this game in your Steam library. This game is a pretty amazing sequel being greater in damn near every aspect. Half-Life 2 simply put is awesome you have to play it at least once otherwise you’re a bitch. \n\n+Cheap and usually damn near free on sale\n+Various kinds of enemies new and old\n+Tons of weapons to use yet again a lot of returning ones and a couple new ones\n+Campaign takes you all throughout City 17 a city in the future enslaved by an evil alien race. City streets, sewers, mines, zombie infested city, highways, a giant citadel, etc. \n+All kinds of better physics and animations on the new Source engine\n+Can pick up props and throw them around a lot easier now. Also zombies can throw props at you now which is cool\n+Quick save button\n+Gravity gun as whole is a really cool weapon especially near the end\n+The bug bait weapon where you can control the antlions also was really cool\n+Somewhat controller support now\n+Steam Cloud\n+Can get rebels to follow you who do a much better job at fighting than the security guards in the first game. Also their AI pathing is nice as they follow you pretty fast and move out of your way when blocking doors. Other NPCs that you have to follow will run back to get you if you get lost.\n+Ravenholm as a whole is pretty dope almost if wish there was a whole game… dedicated to it…\n+Story is vastly different from the original and is more story focused with more dialogue and conversation with key characters besides just you running around a government facility killing aliens and talking to the occasional scientist on what to do.\n+Lootable crates now have their own skin besides just the generic crate making it easier than bashing every single crate you see and barley getting everything as now you can get tons of health and ammo\n+God tier soundtrack\n+VR support? \n+Boat & a car you get to drive around with a mounted machine gun… pretty awesome\n+Gordon actually throws his explosives now instead of setting them on the floor in front of him and even have the options to throw or drop\n+Indicators next to your crosshair telling how much ammo and health you have left\n\n-The only thing I really disliked about Half Life 2 was the map layout and just overall map art design. Looking back at the original Half-Life every chapter was another unique location of the facility that was just sort of colorful and bright and vibrant and just was awesome to explore. Half-Life 2 takes you into a dirty disgusting city going through the sewers, slums, mines, etc. just the overall locations and looks of the area is just so gross and in such a grey tone I just loved Black Mesa as a map much more. Also trying to figure out where to go next can be a struggle a lot of times.\n-The valve in the chapter Route Kanal is hidden so damn well I cry everytime I enter that room!!!\n-Any portion of the game especially in Nova Prospect where you have to stay at a said location and just kill waves of combine imo was just so boring and the combat as well just got boring at many points\n-Remote Play? Dude why does every Half-Life have remote play when this game doesn’t even have any multiplayer aspect to it whatsoever?\n-Wished there was a bit of an explanation between the events that happened between Half Life 1 & 2 as a lot happens and you just have to take it in would have been kinda better imo if there was a bit of a recap before the game started\n-Buy this and get Half-Life 2: Lost Coast which is a cut level they decided to let players play anyways bundled as a completely separate game it’s super short, eventful, and overall pointless. \n\nI really loved the original Half-Life and felt it’s a very unique shooter and is pretty awesome for the time it came out with how little details and content that it has. This Half-Life is better in the sense of graphics and overall gameplay details like better animations and what not. I found Half-Life 2 boring and as it was entertaining enough to finish a couple of times I always thought this game was just really boring. The gameplay just wasn’t as fun as the original and the story is cool but, just didn’t grasp as much as many other games. Still a dope ass game though worth getting considering how it’ll probably be $2 on any sale lol.","timestamp_created":1372982588,"timestamp_updated":1623819706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5077479","author":{"steamid":"76561198044815697","num_games_owned":1186,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1376564436},"language":"english","review":"S'good.

Ainda deixando no chinelo jogos de hoje em dia.\nHalf-Life 2 em minha opinião tem uma história muito boa, cativante e muito misteriosa, mas fique em mente que jogar o primeiro Half-Life, ou pelo menos saber sua história pode ser essencial para entender bem esse jogo. Com personagens únicos, e muito bem desenvolvidos, sua história é contada de uma forma bem \"tímida\", te forçando a observar bem o jogo e ir juntando os \"pedaços\" para você ter uma ideia do que esta acontecendo. Pois o jogo não vai simplesmente jogar a história na sua cara com milhares de cutscenes e textos, você tem que ser paciente e observar bem o jogo, assim tambem te fazendo a observar a sua verdadeira beleza.
