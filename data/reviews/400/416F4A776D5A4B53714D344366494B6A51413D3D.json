This game's story is very witty yet dark. Its puzzles and gameplay mechanics are unique and it requires a different thought compared to most puzzle games.\n\nHowever, this game is not nearly as fleshed out as its sequel, Portal 2. Its gameplay is extremely short (I finished the game in 3 hours) compared to Portal's more convential 20 hour average for a first time playthrough. It's puzzles are also much simpler and its level designs much more conventional than that of its sequel. However, regardless of its relation to its sequel, this game is truly innovative and immersive for a puzzle game, its story is well-constructed and unique, and it paved the way for many games like it. And although I thought this game was a cinch compared to its sequel, it's still a puzzle game that can still get anyone \"puzzled\" to find a solution.\n\nI suppose my critique on it's difficulty was due to the fact that I played and completed Portal 2 first, and it was that game where I experienced the difficulty of overcoming the unconventional thoughts and mechanics required in order to progress,","timestamp_created":1436499922,"timestamp_updated":1436499922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51327437162399292","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16968791","author":{"steamid":"76561198129126865","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":4544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2821,"last_played":1653359496},"language":"english","review":"Although being quite short and very easy after knowing the solution, Portal is still quite fun.

Polega na przechodzeniu z komnaty do komnaty, pełnych pułapek, kiedy jesteśmy wyposażeni w broń otwierającą 2 portale. Jeśli wejdziemy przez jeden - wyjdziemy przez drugi. Naszym zadaniem jest tak umieszczać portale i na tyle szybko by uniknąć pułapek i przejść cało do końca. \n\nNiestety gra jest bardzo króciutka, nie ma multipleyera, więc główkujemy sami, a jeśli nikogo z tych optymistycznych opinii gra nie zirytowała ani razu to powiem, że jesteście chyba święci. \n\nNie wystarczy bowiem wygłówkować jak umieścić portale by przedostać się przez szereg pułapek, trzeba jeszcze dobrze celować i mieć świetny refleks. Każde otwarcie nowego portalu zamyka stary, więc jak wykonejemy to w locie i nie wcelujemy gdzie trzeba, musimy zaczynać od początku. I od początku, i od początku. Zdarzają się też miejsca, gdzie próby wycelowania w cokolwiek, kiedy jesteśmy w locie, zmieniają trajektorię tego lotu, co już gdzieniegdzie, szczególnie w zaawansowanych komnatach doprowadzało mnie do szewskiej pasji. \n\nGra ta nie toleruje po prostu błędu. A i jeśli mamy pecha, że punkt zapisu jest akurat dużo dalej to po paru próbach szybkiego obrcania kursorem jesteśmy poirytowani i znudzeni. Bo ile można wykonywać szereg tych samych czynności tylko dlatego, że nie udało nam się gdzieś tam na końcu wcelować? Jeśli poprzez to gra chciała wydłużyć swoją psotać to... nie tędy droga. Roczarowaniem też dla mnie okazały się dodatkowe mapy. Bp jeśli jesteście głodni nowych wyzwań możecie jedynie zrobić znane już Wam komnaty na poziomie zaawansowanym, albo przejść jakąś w wyznaczonym czasie, czy nie przekraczając liczby otwieranych portali. Także poza kampanią główną (bardzo krótką!) gra niewiele już oferuje. \n\nJednakże gra doczekała się wielu fanów, portale cieszą się taką popularnością, że ludzie potrafią dodawać efekty broni portalowej do swoich filmików, by samemu rozwinąć pokazany tu pomysł. Nie znać tej gry to po prostu wstyd. Skłamałabym też, gdybym stwierdziła, że kampania główna jest słaba - jest bowiem świetna, dobrze się bawiłam tylko... krótko, stąd to rozczarowanie. Co do wyzwań i komnat zaawansowanych... - nie spełnia to moich oczekiwań, ani trochę.\n\nPodsumowując:\n\n+ gra opiera się na świetnym pomyśle przechodzenia przez portale, które musimy sami odpowiednio umieścić\n+ wykorzystanie zasad fizyki\n+ humor\n\n- gra jest bardzo krótka\n- dodatkowe mapy to powtórzenie tego co było\n- bywa irytująca, nie toleruje błędów gracza, szczególnie gdy czynności trzeba wykonać szybko","timestamp_created":1436133322,"timestamp_updated":1436133322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.632991194725036621","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16900653","author":{"steamid":"76561198159336116","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":604,"last_played":1461080450},"language":"english","review":"does it have controller compatibility?","timestamp_created":1436131519,"timestamp_updated":1436131519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16898647","author":{"steamid":"76561198131534066","num_games_owned":368,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":294,"last_played":1593491355},"language":"english","review":"Only had trouble with 2 of the puzzles but still super fun!","timestamp_created":1436122937,"timestamp_updated":1436122937,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16898085","author":{"steamid":"76561198212944104","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1509937750},"language":"english","review":"this game is one of the best puzzle games ever. you cant even count stuff like candy mania. this game is awesome\nand you really should get it right now. #infinite loop #cake is a lie #
