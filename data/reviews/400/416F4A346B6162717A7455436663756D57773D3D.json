The game was released in a bundle package known as The Orange Box for PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on October 9, 2007, along side with  Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, and Team Fortress 2. The game consists of a series of puzzles which must be solved by telporting the character using the Portal Gun. Graphics looks slightly better than HL2 games, the light and reflection are way more detailed, as for the gameplay, it's completly different than the other 4 games in TOB. In this game you have just one weapon, which is not really a weapon, more of a tool and it can't shoot bullets or anything like that, just portals. The Portal Gun is very helpful and you can do alot of fun things such as long jumping, the iconic wall-floor infinite free-falling and throwing diffrent objects through portals. The level designs are so creative and fun that everything is well balanced. You feel the missions and tests challenging and yet, not frustrating. You know that it's hard and you have to think how to get in some place, but you know it's not impossible and there's some trick behind it. Honestly, when I shoot 2 portals to walls to see as who am I playing as, I was very surprised. I expected some tough guy, but no, it was a nice woman. She looked really tired, but I know she will look way better in Portal 2 XD. Overall, it's a unique game, if you want a different type of first-person game, that is not a shooter, a surgery simulator or a horror-survival game, then this is for you!\n\nPERSONAL RATE: 9.5/10","timestamp_created":1467316353,"timestamp_updated":1467316353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544817924499511719","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23963638","author":{"steamid":"76561198119781328","num_games_owned":369,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158,"last_played":1432424961},"language":"english","review":"One of the greatest puzzle games out there.

[/h1]\n\nA mi criterio Portal es una pequeña muestra, casi un modelo de cómo sería un videojuego perfecto. Da cátedra, por así decirlo, de cómo debe ser un videojuego. [b] La sencillez de sus premisas y la complejidad de sus conclusiones la transforman en uno de esos videojuegos que difícilmente pueden verse superados. [/b]\n\nCorta, intensa, extraña y muy satisfactoria aventura en primera persona. Portal logra con muy poco, lo que cientos de juegos con muchísimas cosas no pueden ni siquiera aparentar: un videojuego integrado. La ambientación es terriblemente bien lograda, el guion milimétricamente cuidado (a pesar incluso de la dificultad de que solo hay un personaje que hable en todo el videojuego), la narrativa visual correctamente desarrollada, la jugabilidad es de lo mejor y de lo más original que se ha hecho en toda la industria de los videojuegos, la musicalización coherente al estilo empleado, los gráficos más que aceptables, el desarrollo de personajes es sencillamente brillante, el diseño de niveles creativo, ingenioso y definido, la historia es misteriosa, repleta de intriga, y fiel a costumbre de Valve esconde más de lo que muestra.\n\nTodos estos aspectos junto a otros más, perfectamente integrados, pensados como un conjunto, de forma coherente. Eso transforma a este juego en un todo, donde no se puede separar las mecánicas de jugabilidad de la iluminación, o del guion o de lo que fuere. Todos los aspectos individuales se potencian unos con otros, y ninguno se destaca más que otro, o por lo menos no en demasía.\n\n\n¿El precio? No vale ni la pena aclararlo. Comprar este juego no es un gasto, es una inversión.\n","timestamp_created":1467240912,"timestamp_updated":1467240912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653179168701171875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23938648","author":{"steamid":"76561198095070463","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":95,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":95,"last_played":1467236596},"language":"english","review":"i really wish i could play this game but i get extremely dizzy, almost threw up just now","timestamp_created":1467239618,"timestamp_updated":1467239618,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.316547185182571411","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23938462","author":{"steamid":"76561198118214414","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":79,"playtime_forever":1868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1867,"last_played":1492849603},"language":"english","review":"Doesn't need a review.
