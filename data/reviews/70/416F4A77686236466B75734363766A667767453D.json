The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo, or how long stable atoms survive, radioactive decay. The term is also used more generally to characterize any type of exponential or non-exponential decay. For example, the medical sciences refer to the biological half-life of drugs and other chemicals in the human body. The converse of half-life is doubling time.\n\nThe original term, half-life period, dating to Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the principle in 1907, was shortened to half-life in the early 1950s. Rutherford applied the principle of a radioactive element's half-life to studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of radium to lead-206.\n\nHalf-life is constant over the lifetime of an exponentially decaying quantity, and it is a characteristic unit for the exponential decay equation.\n","timestamp_created":1560884196,"timestamp_updated":1593112684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51287629","author":{"steamid":"76561198396337789","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":22072,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2273,"last_played":1579763748},"language":"turkish","review":"18 lira verdiğime pişman değilim çok güzel oyun hele crossfire map'i ile efsane bambaşka oluyor...","timestamp_created":1560857309,"timestamp_updated":1560857309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51284042","author":{"steamid":"76561198065579986","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":405,"last_played":1586744043},"language":"english","review":"too scary for me. by far. i got scared. too scary","timestamp_created":1560835485,"timestamp_updated":1560835485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51283980","author":{"steamid":"76561198381837597","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":2192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1293,"last_played":1630180216},"language":"english","review":"i love this game\n\nlike i REALLY love this game\n\ni REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY  love this game","timestamp_created":1560835005,"timestamp_updated":1560835005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529073357582092285","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51283965","author":{"steamid":"76561198340883683","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60,"last_played":1594169022},"language":"spanish","review":"un juego que el tio Gaben creo para nosotros hace ya mucho, y la verdad que es una joya al menos de su epoca","timestamp_created":1560834894,"timestamp_updated":1560834894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51283718","author":{"steamid":"76561198092130938","num_games_owned":563,"num_reviews":99,"playtime_forever":1695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":100,"playtime_at_review":1645,"last_played":1660126908},"language":"english","review":"Aged like fine wine.

Vi starete chiedendo.\nPartiamo dal fatto che Half Life è un gioco fantastico e una volta finito ti viene voglia di rigiocarlo.. Bhe, a me viene voglia di farlo, ma penso che non lo farò, o non ora.\nIl gioco è molto difficile, ma bello, il problema è quando ci sono dei bug completamente casuali che ti rovinano l'esperienza di gioco e ogni volta che stai giocando passi da un momento all'altro ad ammettere quanto sia bello Half Life ad ammettere quanto sia buggato e ingiocabile per colpa dei Bug.\n1)Molto spesso non so perchè morivo senza un motivo valido, toccavo qualcosa che in teoria non doveva farmi danno e morivo\n2)Il gioco crashava e ogni volta dovevo ripartire da un punto difficile che avevo già superato\n3)Una volta ho avviato il gioco e invece di farmelo partire in 1920 x 1080 me lo ha messo in una risoluzione che a malapena potevo leggere qualcosa del menù principale, (come se non bastasse la schermata iniziale del gioco era pure capovolta)\n4)Molte volte gli scienziati che dovevano aprirmi le porte o darmi accesso a qualsiasi cosa si buggavano inspiegabilmente e rimanevano fermi immobili e dovevo ricominciare dall'ultimo punto\n5) Verso gli ultimi 20 minuti prima di finire il gioco (in cui si va verso Xen e bisogna sconfiggere quella specie di aracnide gigante con una specie di massa tumorale sotto la pancia) il gioco ha deciso di sua volontà di resettarmi i comandi, non potevo nemmeno ripristinarli automaticamente perchè il gioco non me lo faceva fare, cosi ho speso un tempo abbastanza considerevole per reimpostare manualmente tutto \n6) Questa forse è stata una delle cose che mi ha fatto più incazzare, verso la fine del gioco (ancora prima di affrontare il boss che sembra un bambino con la progeria) mi è scomparso il mirino, esatto, il mirino che ho tenuto attivato per tutto il gioco mi è scomparso a caso.

The controls are tight and responsive, and the weapons have a proper amount of kick to them (at least the human weapons).  The alien weapons all feel wonderfully bizarre.  The soundtrack is a mix of haunting and powerful, chosen to certain scenes to showcase the feel behind an otherwise silent protagonist.  The action can feel a tad schizophrenic from time to time, depending on the enemies, though it mostly feels satisfying.  The real shine goes to the story, however.  The game tells an interwoven tale with no cutscenes or dialogue from Dr. Freeman, putting the player through their paces to reach the conclusion.\n\nCONS: The action suddenly jumps from one moment to another, sometime with little indication that things are about to change.  The real problem is first person platforming.  It feels very awkward, and makes the game difficult for poor reasons.  And surprisingly, there is a fair amount of it.\n\nFINAL: Half-Life is still a pinnacle of gaming, not just for it's time.  It still holds up the ideals of classic FPS action mingled with a cryptic story that not only allows the player to give Gordon Freeman some characterization through their own interpretation, but also leave small hints of a bigger plot beyond what you're seeing through the Physicist's eyes.

The story is pretty straight forward. You play the average scientist man Gordon Freeman in his escape from a science facility where everything's gone to Hell. It's kind of an afterthought and serves to lay out the action. It's basically an action movie plot, and it works pretty well. The characters are memorable enough and the overall plot is good enough to keep you focused on the end goal. There's also lots of little touches I love that add to the experience, such as the slow beginning that gets you acquainted with the world you're in, and level details that give a little character to everything. The combat feels nice and gives a decent variety of approaches to various combat situations. There's plenty of weapon variety, with every weapon feeling fun to use. Gunfights are tense and ammo is just scarce enough to make you strategize when and where you use it, but plentiful enough to where you get to use all of the different weapons regularly. Most of the levels are great and provide a decent mix of experiences with their own unique difficulties to overcome. None of the levels are particularly bad, but some of them have gameplay ideas that fall flat and are more annoying than fun. The graphics are obviously very outdated by today's standards, but the style and design still hold up. The character and enemy designs are fantastic and the alien designs in particular are very memorable are some of my favourite aliens in any media. The limitations on the graphics and sound design create an atmosphere that makes the game eerie. Overall I'd say it's aged much better than other games released around the same time frame. The AI, however, has aged pretty poorly from my experience. Enemies are ripe for cheap exploits, and allies are excruciatingly stupid at times. The AI is definitely the weakest part of the game for me, but I'm not too upset by it considering the age of the game. The gameplay still feels tight enough to overcome the AI's shortcomings.\n\nHere's an overall breakdown of the game for me.\n\nPros:\n-Fun gun play open to different approaches\n-Weapon variety\n-Memorable story\n-Great level structure with different ideas that spice up gameplay\n-Top notch alien designs\n-Eerie atmosphere\n\nCons:\n-AI can be frustrating to deal with at times\n-Some levels feel weak\n\nWhat more can I say, it's Half-Life. It's the classic game it is for a reason. A revolutionary game in the world of first person shooters that helped make Valve what they are today. It still holds up to this day with ideas that still feel modern mixed with a retro style that comes out very nice. If you haven't played it yet, and you like first person shooters, go ahead and get it. Wait for a sale if you want to, but it's definitely worth a play.","timestamp_created":1559996816,"timestamp_updated":1559996816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51109746","author":{"steamid":"76561198236338040","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":397,"last_played":1640637969},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego es una maravilla sin duda para ser de 1998 al dia de hoy se mantiene con bastante buena calidad, la musica es excelente y queda muy bien con la ambientación de los escenarios y la historia a qui en este titulo no tiene tanta importancia como su secuela.Y por eso es considerado el dios de los FPS.\nPuntaje Final a Half Life: 9.5/10","timestamp_created":1559963193,"timestamp_updated":1559963299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51103717","author":{"steamid":"76561198277383020","num_games_owned":753,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":40,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40,"last_played":1536800495},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1559933245,"timestamp_updated":1559933245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51103082","author":{"steamid":"76561198047366198","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":127,"playtime_forever":1552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":871,"last_played":1603563374},"language":"english","review":"Yeah, it's pretty good...","timestamp_created":1559930728,"timestamp_updated":1579384267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51098820","author":{"steamid":"76561198185335071","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1586001759},"language":"french","review":"Saga culte et jeu révolutionnant les FPS une tuerie.
