It only takes about 3 hours to complete which is disappointing considering how Opposing Force was around 8 hours long. It also isn't as unique or original as Opposing Force was.\n\nHowever despite its flaws the experience is still a fun one. Seeing how Barney Calhoun escaped Black Mesa is interesting if you have played Half-Life 2. Gordon Freeman can be spotted throughout the game which ties it quite nicely with the original. There are some really great puzzle sections as well which really require you to think. The gameplay is very good just like in the other Half-Life games.\n\nOverall, a great game let down mainly by its short length. Worth playing if you are a fan of the franchise.","timestamp_created":1454015630,"timestamp_updated":1454015630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20798475","author":{"steamid":"76561198077269608","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":601,"last_played":1456512027},"language":"english","review":"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I don't know if I do like it or not but ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh but ehhhhhhhhhhhh whatever this story goes it's just Barney, Barney Barney Barna!!!!

It still maintains what made the other two games work, in terms of it's story and it's engagement.\n\nYou play as one of the \"red shirts\" (or as in this case, blue shirts), aka, a Security Guard, Barney Calhoun. He's one of the lowly security guards in the Black Mesa compound who, surprisingly, proves more badass than most of his own coworkers. Again, for the same reason I enjoyed playing as Gordon Freeman in HL and as Adrian Shepherd in HL:OF, Barney is a character that can get very immersive, owing to his silence. And you never lose control of him in the game, keeping you firmly in his POV.\n\nMost of what I have to say about this game has already been said in my other reviews of HL and HL:OF, so I won't go into too much detail. I liked the continuous level design, giving the feel of exploration, and enough of a story that will keep you invested in the game. I also liked how this game used armor instead of a powered suit, making it easier to maintain by just findining more armor, preventing you from slowing down too much.\n\nBut therein lies the problem. Whereas \"Opposing Force\" had plenty of new stuff, this game feels lacking. You only get a few of the weapons from the first game, and this game is much shorter compared to the first game. I feel this game fell short of it's predecessor by not trying anything new to expand upon the story and setting. I am glad though that there isn't as much platforming as the original, like in HL:OF, which did the same. But the one thing that saved it for me was how they made you feel more involved in the plot, near the climax of the game. But overall, I feel this game could have been so much more.\n\nWhile this expansion didn't have what \"Opposing Force\" has to offer, it still manages to work fine on it's own, and it's not terrible. It's enough to keep you invested, but it's kind of a letdown after a good game and a good expansion pack. But if I had to play it again, I'd play it again, soundly.","timestamp_created":1453122630,"timestamp_updated":1477847766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20595037","author":{"steamid":"76561198125049644","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1452105827},"language":"english","review":"Short, but if you enjoyed the main Half Life game and want a bit more from a different point of view, give it a shot.","timestamp_created":1453071666,"timestamp_updated":1453071666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20588626","author":{"steamid":"76561198020373845","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1458387693},"language":"german","review":"Half-Life: Blue Shift fügt sich wunderbar in die Spielereihe ein und belichtet die Story aus einer weiteren Perspektive.

this was underwhelming. I'll vote the game down. Why? Because if one buys the Anthology, he won't care about this at all. But if someone checks the individual games, maybe gets a little look into the game, and I hope that can understand this. To be really short: game is too short, quite shallow, less guns, less varied environments - nowhere as good as HL or Opposing Forces.\n\nHL Blue Shift currently stands at 90% positive reviews, while HL and Opposing Forces if I remember well has 96% and 95%  positives, and I have to agree with the trend - the game was fine, but not even as good as HL (This is my third, final review of the anthology - in my book Opposing Forces > Half-Life > Blue Shift, simply based amount the fun I had while playing)\nThe game features a really awesome physics based puzzle (barrels in coolant), had a fun part shooting gas cannisters' top to make them shoot at a door, and a barrel-detonator puzzle  which is really questionable in my opinion. \nOtherwise this game feels like a well-written, longer trailer for Half-Life. Alien contact's majority are headcrabs, there are maybe two Alien Grunts and Masters - the enemy variety could have been better from the gameplay aspect - the lack of stronger enemies really felt like the protagonist is away from the bigger happenings, making him feel like an underdog.\nThe gametime is about 3-4 hours, and the highs of it are the various little physics puzzles,  but other than that this game is everything but memorable.  We have less weapons than in the base game - Glock, Colt, machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher, granade and satchel charge. (Plus Snarks, based on wiki) It's about the half of the arsenal we had in the base game or in Opposing Forces - this, with the short campaign makes this game nowhere as fun as the other titles were.","timestamp_created":1452015813,"timestamp_updated":1453716878,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514324009418487549","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20323796","author":{"steamid":"76561198002495038","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":363,"last_played":1451997343},"language":"english","review":"Well I have mixed feelings about this expansion but generally left satisfied.

It's well desighned, interesting, have a good length for this game;\n+ Lighting. What I noticed after original is that there's much better dark places.

The first half of the game the quality of the mapping is about the same as Opposing Force’s, but in the second half it does get a lot better. There is also a considerably better flow and story compared to Opposing Force, here there actually is one compared to the no existent one in Opposing Force.\n\nThere are no reused sections, although some did seem to take a lot of inspiration from Half-Life’s. However there is a heavy use of sections where you need to go a long way around just to open a door, this is done multiple times. Also not all the weapons are used, this is a good thing is some ways since everything in this game was not out of place, but there are still some non-energy\\Xen weapons that are not used.\n\nThe main problem with the game is that is it too short, it really does feel like they made half the game, then ran out of time. This would explain the lake of weapons and also the lack of difficulty increase, there is no end boss and the end point does feel like a mid-point.\n\nBut this game is really good, if you had to choose between this and Opposing Force, choose this.
