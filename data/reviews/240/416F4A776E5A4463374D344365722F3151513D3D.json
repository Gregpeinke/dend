The third one. It came out in 2004 and was running on Source engine, mostly to improve graphics. It also comes with bots and not much else.\n\nMultiplayer community is as good as you expect it to be in CS games. Very lively. And very de_dust2. But that's to be expected. You can still find some lower-populated servers that play other maps.\nAnd yea, it's mostly full of good players. But at least not crazy pros like you have in CS1.6, so it's more playable.\n\nWell, as for bots, there is not much that I can say. They do fine. You can still tell away a team of bots from a team of real players, the way that they stick together in one or two groups. But didn't play with them enough to say anything else.\n\nAs for core gameplay itself, it stayed true to same old formula. It's still a game which has strategical part where you use grenades to cover assault. Where you need to know when to camp as team and when to move out to clear a room as team. Focusing and giving diversion. It's also still a game where you can die from single bullet before you can react. It's still a game where accuaricy and reaction are more worth than thinking. Still a game with sniper-rifle that kills with one shot no matter where you shoot and still a game where headshot bonus is way too much. Still a game where few super-players will be killing everything else. And yea, still rewards more money to buy weapons to the team that just won. And the best tactic there is to blind players with flashbang, which is no fun for those who got under this effect.\n\nYea, still has that core gameplay with mix of bad and good. Mostly bad.\n\nSo, let's get down to differences between original CS and Source. I can divide it into three things: Improved grenades, cover matters more and actually random spread of fire.\n\nGrenades were improved. They are easier to throw, feeling like they have lower gravity. For me it felt that they are being thrown exactly where I want when it comes to far distance. Well, almost. Still feels better.\nEach grenade also got better. Flashbang works almost same, but also makes player deaf and disables map, making player even more unaware of situation. Explosive grenade not only damages but makes player deaf for a while too. It also feels stronger. Well, or at least easier to throw at target because of lower gravity, as said. And smoke grenades become actually useful, as the smoke is fully solid now, it can actually cover up. You also can't see names of players through smoke like you could in CS1.6.\n\nCover matters more. Well. Or shooting through wall (wallbanging, they say) isn't as good as it used to be. While you can still shoot through some thin walls or doors, you can't shoot right through thick level geometry. So you will not get annoyed by some random bullets giving you minimal damage and slowing you down a lot because somebody is spamming through level. Oh yea, slow down isn't as huge as it was, another plus for me, can actually get back to corner despite getting shot a lot.\n\nAnd the random bullet spread of weapons is actually random. Which is big for some people because in original there were only few set patterns to spread, making it semi-random. And thus the fanatics who spent 1000 hours on a game could wreck anybody by just spraying bullets and somehow headshotting everything with no care. Now you can't just do this. And so many pros whined about how much they can't just wreck things and how developers hate what truly matters - them. Because screw letting newbies a fair chance. Because they don't want competention, they just want to feel like elites.\n\nOh yea, and you don't have to buy primary or secondary ammo anymore at the start of round. Few less clicks on something you would get anyway.\n\nAs for graphics, I really like them. Source engine gives here a very clean nice looking image. It's not ovely detailed as Global Offensive, just something with taste. While being smooth. Hard to say, but I like the way it looks a lot. Also it uses physics a bit, mostly to have nice ragdolls for corpses and some trash items that are placed around in some levels. You know, barrels. Though it annoyes some when they find barrels under their feets, but it's still seems like a nice little fun. Otherwise, physics don't really impact gameplay. Outside of maybe that one spot in office map where you can block doorway for hostages with a good placed grenade with props.\n\nSadly, absolutely no music.\n\nWell, I still wouldn't call it a good game. Still a mess of tactics and twitch shooting, which is punishing to majority of people outside of few pro ones. All while trying to keep you addictive with that \"almost killed him, if only one more second\". Even with small improvements that Source version got.","timestamp_created":1438511332,"timestamp_updated":1453849988,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496478855609893799","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17345849","author":{"steamid":"76561198007818846","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":53735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43590,"last_played":1653834485},"language":"czech","review":"Srdcovka, old school :)","timestamp_created":1438500289,"timestamp_updated":1438500289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514568448066711426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17345437","author":{"steamid":"76561198236944730","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":19992,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4077,"last_played":1467043288},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую эту игру","timestamp_created":1438497554,"timestamp_updated":1438497554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17341477","author":{"steamid":"76561198179291282","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40,"last_played":1536788175},"language":"finnish","review":"THIS GAME GIVED MORE THAN MY WIFE AND MY KIDS THANKS CSS","timestamp_created":1438472339,"timestamp_updated":1438472339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17341262","author":{"steamid":"76561198005054084","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9019,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8976,"last_played":1446148761},"language":"french","review":"super jeux indemodable je recommande","timestamp_created":1438471282,"timestamp_updated":1438471282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17336721","author":{"steamid":"76561198125407444","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":49728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19085,"last_played":1578331321},"language":"russian","review":"Нармальный узбагоинчик ;)","timestamp_created":1438451145,"timestamp_updated":1438451145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17334817","author":{"steamid":"76561198079039588","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":312,"last_played":1571236519},"language":"swedish","review":"sooooo good","timestamp_created":1438443080,"timestamp_updated":1438443080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539356350898742676","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17334228","author":{"steamid":"76561198125744811","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":112496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":44754,"last_played":1604252247},"language":"russian","review":"Лучше нет","timestamp_created":1438440457,"timestamp_updated":1438440457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500594496726989746","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17333997","author":{"steamid":"76561198054427087","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":38754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37051,"last_played":1592658486},"language":"russian","review":"Before Valve was an important task: to transfer all your favorite Counter-Strike more tech engine, namely the Source Engine (This engine has turned out so successful that is used to this day in games like Dota 2, L4D2, Titanfall etc. ), without touching the original game mechanics (thank you, Wikipedia). Developers with this task fully managed.\nPros:\n+ The game mechanics remain the same.\n+ Using a technological engine allowed us to use sharper textures, with an average size of 512 × 512 pixels (128 × 128 in the original), as well as more elaborate three-dimensional models. It is also possible to make extensive use of the possibility of the engine associated with the mirror images - from weapons fitted with a telescopic sight, you can see the surrounding environment (but not the model of other players) players on the lens rear sight when it is not in an approximate state.
