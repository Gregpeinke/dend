By Valve?! Thank the heavens, I can't wait to experience an eye-opening first-person-shooter that delves into the horrors of war and chills me to my core! I can't wait to experience an epic campaign that shows the atrocities of 1940s Europe in ways that other games have failed to! \nKnowing Valve, the graphics and game-play will be great for their time! I can't wait to... wait... what's this?\nOh. It's another Goldsource mod. Yay. So, it's Half-Life/Team Fortress/Counter-Strike except now it's World War II. How brilliant. No campaign, just derelict lobbies full of mindless bots that serve to only be shot at and ask you \"why are you playing this game in the present day?\" Credit where it's due, the developers at least had the good sense to keep the game simple. It's just - join game, pick gun, run around and get killed. Because yes, this is one of those games where every other player is a hardcore veteran that annihilates you from the other side of the map. I must admit I like how all the maps are based off real historical battles, but this is stuff we've seen in other games before, remember. \nYou play as Americans, Germans or the British. For some reason there's barely any games going where you can play as the Brits, but maybe I just missed them somehow. \nThe gun-play is as generic as ever, but what else do you expect at this point? There's a decent selection, but, like Counter-Strike, the game gives you a melee weapon that's more for show than actually being useful. \nAnd the grenades somehow manage to be slower and heavier than even Half-Life's grenades felt. Well done, guys. \nI think all in all, even if this game was still enjoyable and thriving today, Day Of Defeat Source is always there, and that's obviously a better decision... because let's be honest, the only Goldsource games worth playing for their replayability are Half-Life and its expansions. As for Day Of Defeat - just stand down, soldier.","timestamp_created":1619807360,"timestamp_updated":1619807360,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459649145603179932","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91181091","author":{"steamid":"76561198982347977","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":971,"last_played":1659966723},"language":"russian","review":"1","timestamp_created":1619804034,"timestamp_updated":1619804034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91062722","author":{"steamid":"76561198870174255","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1775,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1660,"last_played":1640213669},"language":"czech","review":"Its pretty good","timestamp_created":1619627456,"timestamp_updated":1619627456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91029409","author":{"steamid":"76561198077181885","num_games_owned":355,"num_reviews":108,"playtime_forever":807,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1639939163},"language":"english","review":"Quiet game, it's certainly seen busier times.

I love both of these games to death, but the similarities are few and far between. Obviously source has better graphics, but the maps and communities are nearly polar opposites.\n\nDay of Defeat is much harder than its Source counterpart. Mainly because of the source engine itself. DoD has a very weird sense of physics. So weird in fact, it's hard to explain. Your weapons are widely inaccurate when you're moving in nearly any form (which is expected) but the time it takes to stop moving is hard to get used to. Jumping feels right, sprinting feels good, but they're both limited by a short energy bar. I have no problem with this whatsoever- it makes sense to me that they'd put a lot of realism into that.\n\nThe gunplay is, for lack of a better word, nice. The guns aren't pretty by any stretch, but this is an old game, stop complaining about it. They aren't hard to handle like Counter Strike, but they feel real. Killing an enemy takes a lot of effort, but gunfights are ended quickly because of how damn powerful your weapons are. In a military shooter like this one, that feeling is essential. I don't wanna feel like I'm walking around weilding nothing more powerful than a squirt gun with hot sauce in it.\n\nThe popularity of this game has sparadically decreased since its release, but thats expected. Whereas most people have moved on to Source, there's still very much a community that thrives here. Most of them for the nostalgia, but a good part of them have joined because they're looking for something new. Veterans here are very common (not war veterans, guys.) and you could tell that this was a piece of their childhood. I'm being serious. Some of these guys joined steam way back when it was made. Are they good at the game? Oh my god. I'm lucky that I walked out of spawn sometimes.\n\nWhat's my personal verdict?\nI feel like this is a relic. Something everybody should experience at some point in time. That's not that ridiculous- especially considering this game is so cheap off-sale anyway. It's hard to get the hang of, but damn do you ever feel good afterwards. Sadly, though, at the end of the day I do prefer the Source version. I hold both of these close to my heart as milestones of my slow transition into PC gaming.\n","timestamp_created":1614086292,"timestamp_updated":1614086292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87058079","author":{"steamid":"76561199022267409","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2836,"last_played":1658863943},"language":"spanish","review":"buenisimo hace años que juego","timestamp_created":1613778014,"timestamp_updated":1613778014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86997647","author":{"steamid":"76561198280023511","num_games_owned":249,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":981,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":981,"last_played":1601825655},"language":"english","review":"its amazing played it alot during christmas","timestamp_created":1613705573,"timestamp_updated":1613705573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517077267169952393","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86947386","author":{"steamid":"76561198238206988","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":535,"last_played":1613649721},"language":"schinese","review":"动不动闪退","timestamp_created":1613647403,"timestamp_updated":1613647403,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86911782","author":{"steamid":"76561198060131710","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":58334,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58207,"last_played":1616036281},"language":"english","review":"yikes","timestamp_created":1613600514,"timestamp_updated":1613600514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482315093278884888","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86906974","author":{"steamid":"76561198281215729","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":104,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":104,"last_played":1613594469},"language":"russian","review":"Отец «Day of Defeat: Source» выглядит отлично и по сей день!
