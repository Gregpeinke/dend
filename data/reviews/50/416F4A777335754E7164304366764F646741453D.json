I'm coming back to all of these games almost 20 years later as an adult.\n\nOpposing Force is the faster, more destructive alternate to Half-Life IMO. Lots of new weapons that are much more damaging, but you also have some enemies towards the end of this game that require it. I'll just say... REALLY GLAD I PLAYED THIS ONE ON EASY.\n\nOverall, it's a much shorter trip through the facility but it never wears out its welcome. There is a \"bad ending\" mixed into the game somewhere, so keep an eye out for that one, it's actually really cool. Would have definitely been as much of a challenge as the first had I not chickened out to start.\n\nI had a hell of a good time with Half-Life, but ultimately became too frustrating. Easy was still challenging enough for a casual gamer, but allowed me to speed through this game a bit because I mean, come on. This game is great and I'm glad to be here, but I have newer things to play.\n\nHighly recommended for those travelling down memory lane & looking for old PC game challenges!","timestamp_created":1503932258,"timestamp_updated":1503932258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34553626","author":{"steamid":"76561198209024453","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":79,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":79,"last_played":1503928879},"language":"russian","review":"Отличное дополнение!)","timestamp_created":1503929029,"timestamp_updated":1503929029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34551458","author":{"steamid":"76561198260904589","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":366,"last_played":1648443393},"language":"english","review":"The definition of a good DLC.","timestamp_created":1503922869,"timestamp_updated":1503922869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34550353","author":{"steamid":"76561198128732946","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":365,"last_played":1648894143},"language":"polish","review":"Moja ulubiona część Half-Life.

So when I picked up the original in a nostalgia rush, I decided to fill in that particular omission.  So I came to this with nostalgia for the original game and all its flaws, but not this iteration.  And I enjoyed it; I think it's inferior to the original, but as an expansion that's expected.\n\nThe gameplay is the main strength here.  The new weapons show variety and creativity.  The two melee weapons are arguably better than Gordon's iconic crowbar; at the least, they give more depth to close combat.  The alien weapons are where things get really creative, and also creepily cute.  The Shock Roach is more satisfying than the Hive Hand ever was; you lose the ability to shoot round corners, but the damage feels better and you gain the ability to accidentally suicide in water.  The Spore Launcher offers interesting reloading strategies and bouncing projectiles that reward skill, plus amusing idle animations.  The Displacer Cannon rewards experimentation. Lastly, the Barnacle \"grappling hook\" enhances the overall experience by adding a third dimension of mobility.  \n\nThe new enemies are nice to see, though I don't think they add anything tactically.  To me, they fill roles similar to the Xen aliens in HL1.  There are some good set-pieces, such as the conflict in the sewers.  The presence of squad mates is fun, though it is limited by the dated AI.\n\nThe story is a bit of a trickier proposition.  While the creators clearly put a lot of effort into the plot and how it is told, it doesn't feel quite as polished as the original.  A bigger problem, perhaps, is that nothing here is directly mentioned in later games.  Skipping this doesn't affect your enjoyment of the larger Half-Life narrative, hence my recommendation above.","timestamp_created":1500984865,"timestamp_updated":1500984865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33781256","author":{"steamid":"76561198340047884","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2802,"last_played":1654900286},"language":"czech","review":"Very good game.

But as anyone who has played the original knows, anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and things go to hell pretty quickly. The main draw of this is a new capaign, new areas, new weapons, and some new mechanics like a grappling hook and squad commands. The game succeeds in new areas and new weapons, with a much needed sniper rifle and hevay machine gun, as well as a few alien weapons rounding out Shepard's arsenal. I'm not sure how successful it is with the new mechanics though. The grappling hook, made from a detached Barnacle, works very well, but rope climbing and swinging feels wonky at best. Squad AI is extremely basic and they frequently get in the way more than they help, but they're useful if for no other reason than drawing enemy fire while you blast away at the myriad creatures you'll be facing, including some now aliens and Black Ops soldiers who have been sent in to clean this messy situation up. Not perfect, but pretty solid, even if the ending boss fight feels basic and the ending itself underwhelming.","timestamp_created":1500479942,"timestamp_updated":1500479942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33652555","author":{"steamid":"76561198376665904","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":515,"last_played":1497280984},"language":"russian","review":"История про военного по имени Шепард и военных которые убивали всех.
