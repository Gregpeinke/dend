Hakkında da hiçbir şey bilmiyordum. Açıkçası oyun beni gerçekten kendine hayran bıraktı. Oynanış olarak aşırı özgün değil fakat doyurucu ve gayet zevkli. Grafik kalitesi ve genel sanat tarzı da oldukça hoşuma gitti, kendine özgün bir tarzı var. Oyunun en beğendiğim yanı ise hikayesi. Hem kafa açarak hem de merak ettirerek devam eden oldukça güzel ve bir o kadar da enteresan bir hikayesi var. Oynadığım ana karakterden ziyade benim çok daha ilgimi çeken çok tatlı ve tam kararında tasarlanmış bir yan karakter var ve oyunu benim için çok daha zevkli kıldı.

You play in a floating city that worships the American founding fathers as if they are Gods. Your main enemy will be some of the people who believe and enforce this \"religion.\" \n\nThe gameplay is about what you'd expect if you've played the previous Bioshocks. I think combat has slightly improved in Infinite because the guns and plasmids are more varied and more customizable. Also there are a new wide range of enemies so it is good to have new challenges rather than falling back on the same old enemies we've already beaten. \n\nThe story is actually very good in my opinion. I won't spoil anything, but for the first 80% of the game, I thought the story was good but not great. But the twists at the end really got me good. \n\nVERY MINOR SPOILER PARAGRAPH: \n\nIn Bioshock Infinite, you have a companion named Elizabeth for most of the game. Simply having a companion is a great vessel to carry the story, that the previous Bioshock games didn't really have. Also the AI is very good, and it never feels like a burden. But now since your companion will always talk with you, and has her own very important backstory, the story is much easier to follow and to relate to. \n\nAll in all, I know I'm 5 years late, but Bioshock Infinite is probably the best of the series. Good fun gameplay. Good soundtrack and art direction. Good story. All around good game that pretty much anyone can enjoy. 8.75/10","timestamp_created":1536860638,"timestamp_updated":1536860638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44715527","author":{"steamid":"76561197992690392","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":994,"last_played":1535837845},"language":"english","review":"It wa good but not great !

Сюжет был и в преведущих частях, правда во второй, он как-то через пень колоду ( задним числом в сюжет первой части, впихнули полоумную бабу,  котороя из своей дочери решила зделать божество, без свободы воли) но не суть.                                                                  \n       В  <Bio Shock infinite>, за основу взята класическая сказочность, принцесса запертая в башне, королём-тираном, над башней кружит страшный дракон ( но всё не совсем так, точней всё совсем не так ).                                                                                                         \n       Помните в <Half-Life 2>, Гордену Фримену в напарники, добавили милую девушку Аликс Венс, и игровой прцес стал живей, в Инфинити эта идея ещё более развита.                     И вот любуюсь я лицевыми анимациями Элизабет, и вспоминаю Сару Райдер.                 Я пытался сюжет Андрамеды серьёзно воспринемать, но тут Сара выдовала анимацию трёхлетнего ребёнка, и я со стула сползал.  Ещё тогда 2013-ом, можно было по-людски делать, ну не будем о грусном.                                                                                                  \n       И так,  весь сюжет подоётся через восприятие мира Элизабет, она смотрит на мир широко распахнутыми глазами, но риальный мир не то что пишу в книгах, и Элизабет постипенно меняется.                                                                                                                 \n       Отдельно надо сказать про локализацию, я прошол оригинальную версию, потом с лббительской локализацией.

It completely stands up as a great sequel to the best game ever made (bioshock). The characters are great, every one of them are memorable from the main character booker dewitt to the side characters such as jeremiah fink or daisy fitzroy.\n\nSome people might be worried that the game will feel like one big escort mission with elizabeth following you everywhere, this is not the case, first of all: she cannot get damaged, she gives you ammo and health in fights and aside from all that like the others her charcter is one of if not the most interesting character.\n\nAmong all the games many great elements is the crowning jewell (for me at least) is the story. The story is easily the best video game story ever created completely surpassing such games as: heavy rain, mass effect, the last of us, silent hill 2, persona 4 and even the  games predecessor bioshock it self. The ending will leave you truely stunned.\n\nMy one gripe with this game is the combat. Now this topic is very divisive, some people love it some not so much. Personally i think the combat while still very good isn't nearly as good as the origional. You can only pick up two different weapons at a time restricting the amout of variety in guns you have, you have a select few that you keep and the others you try once and never again. The vigors (plasmids) while they sound exiting i personally just ended up using shock jocky all the time because there was something about the others where the just wern't fun to use. My last point on the combat is a short one but in my opinion the most important, it just isn't satisfying.\n\nBut never the less this game is still amazing and well worth your time 9.5/10","timestamp_created":1536613838,"timestamp_updated":1536695558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44672612","author":{"steamid":"76561198125967412","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1536617348},"language":"english","review":"Great game and even better ending to a beloved series.","timestamp_created":1536606548,"timestamp_updated":1536606548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44671868","author":{"steamid":"76561197970661271","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2045,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2045,"last_played":1536600199},"language":"english","review":"Let me start out by saying this game is phenomenal and this is my first review on Steam because This game deserves it.\n\nMy brother kept hounding me for years to play this game but didn't really like how this was in the sky and not underwater (I know, stupid of me).

The Gameplay is engaging, but not complex. Just keep attacking people and hope they die. Call of Duty fans would call it a standard FPS experience which I agree with. Learning to chain attacks requires a little patience but with time, it is rewarding to learn every Vigor's special attacks. Traps aren't much useful though, since you too are forced too keep moving around. Graphics are hmmm.... let's just say they're okay. I didn't find the visuals all that appealing because of the cartoon-ish faces, but it has its moments. Visuals I give - 6/10 whereas gameplay - 9/10\n\nComing to the story, without any spoilers, you play as Booker Dewitt who's supposed to rescue a young girl to wipe your debts away with a strange man who had visited your office a few days ago. However, the city of Columbia has many other surprises in store for you. Story is pretty straightforward with a few minor choices here and there which ultimately make little to no changes in the main storyline. They're just for visual purposes. One more thing, the main storyline connects a little with the battle at the wounded knee of the American history. So, brush up on your history lads. \nNot too impressive but not that bad either.

The other games allowed you to keep a full arsenal, allowing you to take advantage of different weapon capabilities on the fly. This is probably the key factor keeping the game from being as awesome as it could have been.\n- Weapon and vigor upgrades are ridiulously expensive and don't seem to make a substantial difference in combat. \n- Ammo and vigor salts run out rapidly because of bullet sponge enemies thrown at you in large environments that offer practically no cover.  Sure, the previous entries had bullet sponge enemies too, but there were plenty of things within the environment to use against your enemies. Not so much with Infinite. \n\nIf you can get this one on sale, I'd say get it. Not so much for the full price.

This game is without a doubt, one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played. Aesthetically, it works wonderfully for me. While not every level is filled with amazing detail or visual storytelling like in other games such as Fallout or even Bioshock 1, spending time in the world of Columbia is a treat. The colors, saturation, and world building it engages in are really well done. The game is clearly a relic of early 1900s America and it clearly still struggles with class divide and racial segregation. In fact, this country prides itself on white power and capitalism to the point where it plays a central role in the story. NPC dialogue, propaganda posters, and other elements throughout the world all help flesh out the world and are fun to stop and engage with. \n\tOne of the main subplots of the game plays into this class divide with a proletariat uprising. This violent uprising uproots the white elite of Columbia and through the combined effort of minority groups and the exploited worker class. This conflict places you on the side of the proletariat, mostly out of necessity, as you attempt to find a ride off of Columbia. Initially, the game takes a very anti capitalist approach, using 1900’s imagery of overworked and underpaid workers being exploited by self indulgent and larger than life bosses. Upon the proletariat victory, the game takes a much different approach, showing the communist leader, Daisy Fitzroy becoming the same violent and power hungry leader she sought to destroy. It definitely aims to show these two “extremes” as equal which is ultimately disappointing as one is white nationalist religious zealots and the other is working class uprising. Although many deem a violent uprising necessary for systemic economic change, it’s unfortunate how Daisy Fitzroy are merely pushed to the side, becoming enemies that are no greater than their oppressors.\n\tAbout halfway through the game, the revolution aspect of the game is completely abandoned, without any real meaningful conclusion. Elizabeth, of all people, kills Daisy Fitzroy, which essentially sends the revolution into a frenzy since it no longer has its face. Although it was kill or be killed with Daisy at that point, I thought Elizabeth would have resonated with their struggle a little more. The second half of the game deviates into a rather interesting many worlds theory type of story. It is here where the true nature of our main characters are revealed. Having played the game twice and watching videos on the subject, I am able to piece everything together a little bit better, but it is certainly the type of ending that will have you looking up explanations. It is a very high concept and some may view it as “pretentious”, but I for one have come to enjoy the ending. It does a fantastic job at concluding the story regarding Booker Dewitt, Comstock, and Elizabeth. Beyond the communist revolution and aesthetic of Columbia, it seems like this was the story they were truly trying to tell.\n\tOne of my favorite aspects of the game was the relationship between Booker and Elizabeth. They start out as complete strangers and over the course of the game, they slowly learn how to trust each other. There are plenty of times throughout the game where Booker’s selfishness or Elizabeth’s headstrong attitude conflict with each other, but it always leads to growth in their relationship. By the end of the game, they truly do have a father-daughter relationship, where Booker would do anything to save Elizabeth. I don’t think their relationship is as natural as Atreus and Kratos in God of War, but I did find that Elizabeth and Booker had more chemistry.. Their interactions throughout the game are perfectly acted and add a lot to the atmosphere of the game. Having a character by your side, who is naive to the outside world, slowly discovering her purpose in life is a treat to watch unfold. The end of the game has an off putting tonal shift in which Elizabeth becomes this all knowing, and almost godlike that goes on to explain the ending of the game to Booker. Within the context of the ending I suppose it makes sense, but it is still weird nonetheless.. Comstock plays a compelling villain to Booker and Elizabeth. I love how clearly vulnerable they make him despite how worshiped he is in Colombia. He is clearly scarred by his past involvement in wounded knee and attempts to cover up his sins with religion, which is quite the opposite of how Booker handled that situation. \nThe pacing of this game is incredible. The plot is constantly moving forward, with the only exception being the Lady Comstock fight, which slows the pacing down to a halt. This section isn’t that long, but on harder difficulties, it can definitely be frustrating . Besides this slight mishap in pacing, these is little to no backtracking or filler in the game. Naturally, that leads to a shorter game of about 12-15 hours, but it is 12-15 hours of riveting story that is never dull. Upon a second playthrough, on the 1999 mode (hardest difficulty), I found the shooting and fighting set pieces to be exciting. The rail system allows for a great amount of verticality to the game. You can approach fights in countless different ways, using height to your advantage. The vigors were also useful and I found myself relying on them more on the harder difficulty. At some points, I found the hitboxes of certain benches, staircases, etc to be unforgiving. Booker would often be stopped in his tracks and I’d be forced to move around the smallest obstacle. I also found that trying to jump on and off of the rails quickly would often be unresponsive or glitchy, making it difficult to exit and enter the railing. Despite these problems I found the game to be exciting and rewarding, especially on harder difficulties \nDespite some jarring 180 degree  story changes, spotty social messaging, and infuriating boss fights, there is something magical about playing Bioshock Infinite. The beautiful coloring of the world coupled with the mystery and mythos of Columbia, create one of my fondest gaming memories. The ending is really well done and each main character gets closure to their story (especially Elizabeth in the DLC). There’s a reason why people still make videos on this game almost 10 years after it came out. 9/10\n","timestamp_created":1536386428,"timestamp_updated":1660293643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"44624892","author":{"steamid":"76561198423395642","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1521,"last_played":1563614912},"language":"english","review":"This game is the Best game I have ever played.
