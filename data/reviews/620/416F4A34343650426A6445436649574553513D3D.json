What else must I say?  Don't worry I'm not finished.\n\nIt all starts off with a massive apocalypse at Aperture Laboratories and you are right in the middle of it.  A core called Wheatley helps you survive but GLaDOS captures you and forces you to do many test chambers before you, well, you can find that out for yourself when you buy the game.  With normal test chambers, post apocalyptic test chambers, old fashioned test chambers and many parts of the Aperture Laboratories that you have never seen before to complete and survive Portal 2 sure has a way longer single player storyline than the original Portal.\n\nPortal 2 is one of my favourite games ever.  It has a cool storyline and a great assortment of puzzles to solve.  With nine chapters and in single player mode and six co-op courses (both chapters and courses contain many missions/test chambers) you will never get bored.  You can replay the entire game multiple times and still find it fun.  Plus you can play other levels made by other gamers and even make your own!  I would rate this game 97.593141521/100 (yeah, I had to be that specific, this game is just so good).

Игра повествует нам о всё той же девушке c Челл которая была заточена в научно-исследовательском комплексе по исследованию природы порталов Aperture Science. Который в свою очередь находится под управлением искусственного интеллекта знакомого нам по первой части игры, а именно\"GLaDOS\" (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System). В игре всего 3 героя и все они главные: Челл, собственно \"GLaDos\" и модуль смягчения интеллекта \"Wheatley\" с которым нам придётся встретиться по мере продвижения по сюжету игры. Игра начинается с того что наша героиня Челл пробуждается после долгих лет сна в криогенной заморозке. Из всех испытуемых в живых осталась только она. За всё время её отсутсвия комплекс сильно изменился, частично разрушился и зарос травой. После пробуждения она встречает модуль \"Wheatley\" и с этого момента начинается увлекательное путешествие по разрушенному комплексу Aperture Science. Игра построена на относительно новой версии движка Source и имеет весьма красивую графику даже на сегодняшний день. Гемплей остался прежним что и в первой части за исключением введения в игру новых механизмов и разного типа гелей, которые так же используются при решении головоломок. В игру был добавлен кооперативный режим который повествует нам о жизни и взаимодействии двух роботов: \"P-body\" и \"Atlas\". Я однозначно рекомендую эту игру каждому любителю головоломок, хорошего сюжета и фанату серии.\n\nМоя оценка игре: 11/10.","timestamp_created":1448065555,"timestamp_updated":1542861045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523224711418151855","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19181860","author":{"steamid":"76561198088667520","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":927,"last_played":1449371427},"language":"turkish","review":"Güzel kafa karıştırıcı bulmacalarıyla 10 numara bir oyun","timestamp_created":1448060689,"timestamp_updated":1448060689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50971376895904541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19180923","author":{"steamid":"76561197992589140","num_games_owned":397,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":854,"last_played":1658403700},"language":"french","review":"Very cool game with an awesome Lore.

I have never gotten so deep into and emotional over a game since The Legend of Zelda, and not even that!!\n\n(THIS PART OF REVIW CONTAINS SPOILERS!) \nMy first real emotional moment while playing was when I found that radio in the corner of the laser room in an early chamber of Portal 2 playing 'Don't even try' and saw Rattmann's scrawls on the walls. It was so movie like!\n\nAnd Especially when my companion cube, Jasper from the first game came back barely still standing to die with me at the end after I was forced to incinerate him (Theoretically) thousands of years prior. I'm so sorry Jasper, I love you~  <3 \n\nNot forgetting that heart breaking scene with Wheatley at the end of the final battle. He just shot into outer space, and  I was screaming and hugging my computer screen. TwT \nand Living the view of the character as if it was a real movie throughout the entire adventure, which it might as well be!!!\n Not to mention after the game ended, I was talking and crying to the main screen for about 10 minuets about how much I forgive and thank Wheatley for his sacrifice and assistance. \n-\n\nIt just- Ahh. No words can describe, just... Just play if you haven't. You will not regret, I assure you 100%.  \n\nWords of truth: I Love this game. Its awesome.

Portal 2 took everything that was good about the first game, improved on it, and added even more new game elements such as gel and the gravity tunnels. The gel was a lot of fun to mess around with and the gravity belts made puzzles all the more complex.\n\nThough the best improvement in my opinion would have to be the Characters. Instead of the monotone GLaDOS from the original Portal we get a much more characterized GLaDOS, especially after Chapter 5 [spoiler] when Wheatley turns GLaDOS into a potato [/spoiler]. Wheatley and was such an enjoyable addition to this game with his cockney accent and great sense of humor. J.K. Simmons as Cave Johnson was a lot of fun too.\n\nOverall I have enjoyed Portal 2 far more than the original Portal, which only took 3 hours to beat for the first time (original Porta is still a good game, just too short). This is definitely one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played, and I haven't even started on co-op or community levels.\n\nStory 10/10\nGameplay 11/10\nGraphics & Visuals 10/10\n\nThis game is just so damn good if you have 20 bucks to spare just buy Portal 2.

Честно, не ожидал нтересный сюжет сдобренный черным юмором от компании Valve. Добавим сюда отличную музыку и своеобразную апокалипсическую атмосферу на протяжении всей игры - получаем в итоге шедевр!\n\nПо факту - играл в неё в далеком 2011 году. Единственная игра имеющая 98% положительных отзывов на трекере. Заинтересовался, попробывал и охренел! Не думал что головоломка может так захватить меня. Остроумные черные шутки заставляли глупо хихикать на протяжении всей игры. Иногда серое вещество в мозге просто кипело, но любопытство заставляло идти дальше и глубокое удовлетворение от прохождения еще одной камеры было наградой! Единственная игра которую я прошел от начала до конца.\n\nИтак!.... 10 дроидов-турелей из 10!","timestamp_created":1447857404,"timestamp_updated":1447857404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19144796","author":{"steamid":"76561198150563705","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":988,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":480,"last_played":1614642742},"language":"swedish","review":"Mmm Dat ass","timestamp_created":1447857299,"timestamp_updated":1447857299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ446PBjdECfIWESQ=="}
