Source je priamym konkurentom pre masívne hraní CS 1.6. Technická stránka hry je na kvalitnej úrovni a aj vďaka enginu Source, na ktorou beží aj Half-Life 2. Čo sa týka obsahu a noviniek je to priemer. Základných mapiek je málo, ale o rozšírenie sa postará silná a šikovná komunita. Dizajn jednotlivých máp je naozaj dobrý.

Práve MP je jadrom hry a poskytuje extrémny počet hodín zábavy. Pre tento dôvod je Source priamym konkurentom CS 1.6, ktoré bude veľmi ťažké opustiť.

Nella realtà non vedrete mai terroristi che cadono solo con colpi in testa, perchè il resto del corpo produce pochissimi danni, ad eccezzione di alcune armi, come la Night Hawk.

Тут вам есть и физика, и ничего лишнего вроде рангов, скинов, внутриигрового магазина. Зашёл в меню, выбрал сервер и готово. Не надо тратить время на выбор оружия, у всех всё на равных. Любимые сервера по мимо классических: GG - гонка вооружения, ONLY HEADSHOT - для тренировки убийств в голову, BHOP - распрыжка на полосе препятствий, HNS - догоняшки с элементами распрыжки. Плюс тут более стабильное сообщество игроков, если играть на одних и тех же серверах. Из минусов - бесит только сервера где перебор с модами, звуками и музыкой, или например общий чат на 60+ человек.. Ещё раньше были щиты у спецназа, могли бы их оставить (но сделать ограничение как с АВП - 1 щит максимум в игре, чтоб не портить баланс).
