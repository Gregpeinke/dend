A group of up to six players can team up to fight against specimens(Zeds/Zombies/ETC) to survive a total (of up to) 10 rounds. Each round has increasing difficulty to the point where one mistake can kill the entire team. An example of that happening would be if a medic healed the wrong person, or healed too fast, and couldn't heal the berserker, thus losing a huge source of damage. That kind of stuff. The game is made on an older Unreal engine thus allowing for it to run on most PCs old and new. Not as pretty as Left For Dead, but that's okay.\n\nWithin the game there are six different classes (potentially one for each player for an ultimate team.) including Medic. Support Specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, and Demolitions. Each having their own unique advantage.\n\nMedic: Focuses on heals and taking massive amounts of damage. Can't deal much damage on their own though.\nSupport Specialist: Amazing crowd control and awesome carry weight.\nSharpshooter: Can one hit big guys. Typically very low ammo, and very slow refire.\nCommando: A versitile class allowing the player to see health bars of enemies and cloaked hostiles are no longer a threat.\nBerserker: One of the tankyest highest damage classes. Very dangerous to play though, as you never get away from the zombies for very long. Takes some skill to get good with the class.\nDemo: Very expensive to play as. Huge AOE (Area of effect) damage. One hitting many \"zeds\" at once. Huge help at the end game boss. Again, hard to play, hard to level.\n\nWith all this being said..\nPros:\n+ Amazing late game experience.\n+ Fun situations tend to emerge from out of nowhere.\n+ High replayability if you're a fan of the genre.\n+ Runs on most PCs.\n+ Many many servers to play on. Lots of cool people.\n+ DLC\n\nCons:\n- Horrible music.\n- When trying to play multiplayer sometimes the game gets some game breaking bugs, forcing you to restart the game and/or steam. Though it's uncommon.\n- Gameplay CAN start to repeat itself if you don't try and mix it up.\n- Early game is very dull and uninteresting (As it's hard to level up, and most people derp around on low level servers.)\n- Single player is meh.\n- DLC\n\nThe game is worth $20.00usd in my own opinion. With my 250+ hours or whatever it is, I can strongly say I've gotten my money's worth. I've even purchased a few of the DLCs to mix it up a bit.\n\n8.5/10 will get all level 6s and become master of time, space, and zombies.","timestamp_created":1325037967,"timestamp_updated":1390114785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516917645931243896","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3163008","author":{"steamid":"76561198018431505","num_games_owned":444,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":58862,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57277,"last_played":1404756821},"language":"japanese","review":"見た目に騙されないで！ギャグゲーだから！","timestamp_created":1325037714,"timestamp_updated":1325037714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2016403","author":{"steamid":"76561198000987626","num_games_owned":531,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":18411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18179,"last_played":1599433931},"language":"english","review":"A very interesting zombie-killing experience; not cinematic like Left 4 Dead, but rather focused on tight teamplay, threat management, and knowing your environment.

Great for playing with friends. It's preferable to have someone knowledgeable of the game to guide you through the basics, as this isn't your standard run-and-gun FPS. On the harder difficulties, it requires much coordination. There are a bunch of perks to use and level-up, along with a huge variety of weapons.\n\nThe developer support for this game is phenomenal, as all the new content (new maps, weapons) released is free, apart from the skin packs, which are purely aesthetics, and don't affect gameplay. It's a great game overall, definitely worth the money if you get it on sale.\n\nThe game runs on the older Unreal Engine, which allows players with super old computers (ie. Pentium 4s) to play, which really broadens the accessibility and ease of access to the game. I've played this since release back in 2009, and I still play it today, as the replay value is tremendous. I would recommend anybody who likes FPS games to make the purchase.","timestamp_created":1325028674,"timestamp_updated":1404448914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"902833","author":{"steamid":"76561197981531318","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":24752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24099,"last_played":1454444468},"language":"english","review":"ANAL GAME!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1325027880,"timestamp_updated":1325027880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2249657","author":{"steamid":"76561198004614433","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2493,"last_played":1491709285},"language":"english","review":"Get it.","timestamp_created":1325027608,"timestamp_updated":1325027608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2014410","author":{"steamid":"76561198000959334","num_games_owned":1196,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":3949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2982,"last_played":1483506965},"language":"english","review":"poking them with knives is fun\n","timestamp_created":1325027605,"timestamp_updated":1325027605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1719625","author":{"steamid":"76561197996928324","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1183,"last_played":1497992999},"language":"english","review":"WELDIN' THIS DOAH!","timestamp_created":1325027586,"timestamp_updated":1325027586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2242401","author":{"steamid":"76561198004525748","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1553,"last_played":1428718099},"language":"english","review":"beastly","timestamp_created":1325027510,"timestamp_updated":1325027510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"501359","author":{"steamid":"76561197971200473","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":6823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6353,"last_played":1428756413},"language":"english","review":"What to say... it's alright alone.
