What can one say about a game that already has everything said about it?  Portal and Portal 2 both have the most terrific writing jobs I've ever seen on any video game, and they did a spectacular job of immersing the player in the world of Aperture Laboratories.  Portal + portal = space travel seems simple enough, but you will never truly know how awesome these games are until you play them.","timestamp_created":1324723732,"timestamp_updated":1324723732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"869175","author":{"steamid":"76561197980585584","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1297,"last_played":1406842206},"language":"russian","review":"Потрясающая, красивая, гениальная, великолепнейшая игра, постоянно вас удивляющая и радующая.
