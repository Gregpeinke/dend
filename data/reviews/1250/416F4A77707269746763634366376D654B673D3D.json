Игра скиловая большое количество сложностей, постоянно расширяется, недавно добавлены новые карты. Графика минимальна, но ориентированна она на любителей КС Квак Анрил, так что им не привыкать, высокая динамика, хоть и хоррор ничего страшного там нет. Сравнивать с Left 4 Dead не корректно, лефт игра классом выше, кооперация лучше, режим сражения уникальный (его взяли за основу в игру Natural Selection), килинг проще, больше игроков типа я один всех замочу, правда только до сложности самоубийство чего уж говорить о сложности АД, но не значит хуже, они не конкуренты, разные. Любителям поделать ачивки на 100% ее хватит надолго. Саундтрек можно добавить в избранное тому у кого там уже лежат треки Unreal T. В общем игра поддерживается, выходят паки всякй мелочи, один забег по карте обходится в 40 минут, так что рекомендую купить тем кто ценит время и прежде всего игру с людьми против AI.","timestamp_created":1404541368,"timestamp_updated":1404541368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579596638679504395","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11079972","author":{"steamid":"76561197962463189","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":32183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24084,"last_played":1635781577},"language":"english","review":"i'll tell ya that you will find there is nothing not to like about this game.  its a perfect balance of zombie killing mayhem, and competitive fast paced fps gameplay.  it is very challenging and has great co-op elements.  its my favorite game of all time next to the years of dedicated counter strike, quake, and unreal tournament style head hunting.  this game features a solid engine.. the graphics are stunning!  slightly dated, but immense artwork and detail makes that easy to overlook.  i mean really great textures with unique level design and feel.  there is a favorite map and character class for everyone!  its actually very fun leveling character classes and trying to get all of the available trophies.  if you're looking for a game that will continue to satisfy unlike the less than 1-2 year stint the new COD's have to to offer at a fraction of the cost then this game is for you.  it actually has a gaming community with complete admin control over all the game servers?  very well balanced overall gameplay, and extreme strategy components i can't emphasize enough will cease your heart and soul.  i recommend this game to all shooter/zombie enthusiasts.  best teamplay game i have ever played!  please do yourself a favor and buy this very affordable gem, and learn its greatness deserves more attention than the current run-of-the-mill mainstream FPS releases.  you won't be disappointed!!","timestamp_created":1404541345,"timestamp_updated":1404541345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11079921","author":{"steamid":"76561198028445243","num_games_owned":404,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":10208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9728,"last_played":1460046608},"language":"russian","review":"Веселенький корридорный замес)) огромное множество карт, действительно доставляющих радость, тут и веселенькие новогодние декорация, и подземные лаборатории бункер в лесу... музыка в тему, держащая в атмосфере, и приятное разнообразие оружия... минус лиш за одним, на сложности легче чем суицид играть ен столь фаново))) \n\nв общем рекомендую любиелям кровавых командных замесов против компь.терных противников)) будет весело)","timestamp_created":1404540991,"timestamp_updated":1404540991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494565218687057495","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11079880","author":{"steamid":"76561198081233575","num_games_owned":299,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":2984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1542542488},"language":"english","review":"So much raw freakin FUN!!!!!","timestamp_created":1404540633,"timestamp_updated":1404540633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11079846","author":{"steamid":"76561198011799043","num_games_owned":452,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":3344,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2870,"last_played":1440110405},"language":"english","review":"Put simply, the game just isn't fair.

(BLIMEY MATE). This uh...can get old fast, but funny for foreigners to hear.\nand arenas instead of linear maps...and leveling system...and rounds...\nIn fact, it's not the same at all.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, \nyou'll get that the second you load the menu,\n see the headache inducing graphics and ominous music, \nyou'll be feeling the game killing you slowly inside. (in a...good way?)\nIt's all intentional, the apocolyptic atmosphere, fighting desperately for your life against odds that get more impossible every round.\n\n It's draining, the maps are dark, run down, abandoned hell holes, and your only companions are your team mates, who will abandon you without a second though (rightly so too, you'll do the same).\nOh, I best mention, TEAM MATES. It's a multiplayer only game, ignore the single player, you don't want to go there, find lobbies with people in them that seem like they'll stick around, the more the better.\n\nIt brings people together, forces you to rely on allies, you're stuck in hell with them.\nThere are epic times to be had, especially with slow motion cam, and last second kills.\n\nThe skills in the game do little, with a grind curve that becomes tedious after a few levels. Only the most hardcore players sinking months of their time are going to get past certain levels, we're talking 10,000 headshots etc to gain small bonuses.\nThey serve badly as motivation to keep playing.\n\nAnd yet I do play this game still, years from the release, after buying many better games since, I come back and play it for a few hours, not often, but from time to time, every few months, whenever I'm in the right mood. \nIt fills a satisfying niche in my game library.\n\nI recommend you pick this up, because even though you'll grow tired of it, you'll end up wanting to play it again. How many games can claim to have the longevity of this?\n IT'S 5 YEARS OLD AND I STILL PLAY IT. \nIT LOOKS LIKE SH*T AND I STILL PLAY IT.\nIT's ATMOSPHERE KILLS ME INSIDE AND I STILL PLAY IT.\nEveryone should own this game. Nobody should play it regularly.","timestamp_created":1404538186,"timestamp_updated":1404538186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11079367","author":{"steamid":"76561198062441443","num_games_owned":439,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":973,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":744,"last_played":1468023991},"language":"english","review":"Burnslayer's #1 Babysitting game 2013","timestamp_created":1404537252,"timestamp_updated":1404537252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464396297931671143","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11079317","author":{"steamid":"76561198040414439","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":10396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10351,"last_played":1428204242},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would buy again","timestamp_created":1404536945,"timestamp_updated":1404536945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11079279","author":{"steamid":"76561198003037461","num_games_owned":352,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":64,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":64,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Great co-op fun","timestamp_created":1404536707,"timestamp_updated":1404536707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11079235","author":{"steamid":"76561198053242076","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2908,"last_played":1492032787},"language":"english","review":"Best zombie game on steam so far unil Killing Floor 2 comes out","timestamp_created":1404536381,"timestamp_updated":1404536411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11079167","author":{"steamid":"76561198118381331","num_games_owned":378,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1599287013},"language":"schinese","review":"我喜欢这个游戏虽然我技术不是很好！~画面虽然比不上什么神作但是可玩性是肯定有的！","timestamp_created":1404535795,"timestamp_updated":1404535795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537750363349914551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11079064","author":{"steamid":"76561198107733202","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":472,"last_played":1469668793},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game, cant get enough of it like seriously.","timestamp_created":1404535214,"timestamp_updated":1404535214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11079022","author":{"steamid":"76561197978005328","num_games_owned":648,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7295,"last_played":1451204615},"language":"english","review":"Awesome coop game!

Diferente de Left 4 Dead, que tem todo um enredo a ser seguido, Killing Floor foca no esquema de jogo em rodadas com até 6 jogadores simultâneos: Antes de criar o jogo você pode alterar a duração e a dificuldade da partida, e para principiantes, começar no Medium pode gerar uma certa decepção. Apesar de simples, o jogo tem uma boa dificuldade. Mate todos os zumbis que surgirem para encerrar sua rodada e corra para a loja para recarregar sua munição, reparar o seu colete e voltar a mais uma rodada - uma verdadeira corrida contra o relógio. Ao final de todas as rodadas, surge o Boss. Derrote-o e logo após outro jogo começa em um mapa diferente. Mais simples, mais rápido, porém não menos divertido. Além do modo multiplayer, você pode se divertir e treinar jogando sozinho, no modo \"Solo\".\n\nVocê também pode escolher jogar com diversos personagens e diversas classes diferentes, com limitações diferentes (exemplo: Sharpshooters usam pistolas e alguns tipos de rifles, mas não podem usar metralhadoras). Quanto mais você jogar com uma determinada classe, mais experiência você ganha e aumenta seu nível, ganhando assim melhorias. \n\nA versão Windows também vai com uma SDK para você mesmo criar mapas e mods para o jogo, além de contar com mais de 170 conquistas e várias DLCs, que não são mais do mesmo pro jogo. Conseguem mudar drasticamente o \"enredo\" e lhe dar mais tipos de jogo, com mais personagens, armas, mapas e conquistas (com o Bundle completo, o número de conquistas chega a 275!), mas a versão simples do jogo pode lhe atender perfeitamente bem, apesar de suas limitações. A jogabilidade é simples, os comandos são precisos e as teclas utilizadas não fogem muito do que já estamos acostumados a jogar. Uma boa jogada dos desenvolvedores foi remover a clássica mira que fica no centro da tela e lhe ajuda (e muito) na hora de jogar, exigindo mais habilidade do jogador. No início pode ser desconfortável, mas logo a falta dela se torna imperceptível. Outra maravilha do game é a trilha sonora regada a Heavy Metal, com guitarras pesadas e gritantes, que trazem mais emoção durante o game, e ao fim da rodada em busca da loja de armas, uma música calma e serena, apropriada pra situação.\n\nCom certeza deixei vários detalhes para trás, mas experimente jogá-lo um pouco.

матч Killing Floor - это набор миллионов различных ситуаций, к которым вы окажетесь не готовы. Невовремя перезарядились, и монстр измолол ваш труп своими шипастыми лапами? Кинули гранату, а она отскочила вам под ноги? Пропустили подкравшегося сзади самого хилого упыря, и он схватил вас, позволив орде уродов окружить вас со всех сторон и сожрать? Пожалели патрон в самом мощном дробовике, и теперь ваше безжизненное тело пожирают обезумевшие твари? Вы каждый раз говорите: \"ОК, я учту свои ошибки, и в следующий раз я убью их всех!\". Но затем вас настигают совершенно новые неудачи, и вы понимаете: недостаточно учиться на своих ошибках, недостаточно хорошо стрелять, недостаточно изучить все локации вдоль и поперёк. Чтобы выжить в отчаянной схватке, нужно быть таким же сумасшедшим, как и этот кровожадный, наступающий со всех сторон биомусор.\n\nИгровые локации наполнены ходами, тупиками и местами, откуда лезут полчища мутантов. Опытный игрок уже знает позиции, где легче всего обороняться... но \"легче\" - не значит \"легко\". И совсем не значит \"безопасно\". Также можно \"устраивать\" точки обороны, заваривая сварочным аппаратом дверь за своей спиной, это снижает опасность нападения сзади, но надолго кровожадных мутантов это не сдержит - рано или поздно дверь слетит с петель.\n\nВ уродливрй и депрессивной местности вы сражаетесь с отвратительными \"упырями\", всё это действует на нервы, угнетает, злит. Но не это ли нам с вами нужно иногда? Врубить бесящую игру, поотстреливать головы мерзким вражинам, пока они не отгрызут голову вам самому, и таким образом спустить пар...

Игра сразу можно заметить что не с самым лучшим как сейчас стало говорить \"Графоном\", но это совсем не мешает игре привлечь многих геймеров. Хоть я и не сильно слежу за графикой, но здесь она совершенно не мешает, а если поставить на самых высоких, то вообще отлично выглядит, сочетая такую тему, которую использовала КоД в Black Ops и в World War. Мы убиваем монстров или мутантов, которые приходят в волнах, а когда побеждаешь всех на волне, есть промежутки между ними, чтобы хорошо скупиться, и снова пуститься в бой. \nМне лично все понравилось, и графика вполне не плохая, геймплей вполне удобный, есть еще плюс, когда ты делаешь критические удары, то происходит замедление кадра, чтобы более эпично прочувствовать момент убийства.\nНо помимо всего этого есть и минус, который нверное многое портит... это то, что в игре хоть и есть мультиплеер и можно поиграть с друзьями, но очень уж трудно к кому, то присоедениться. Для меня это вообще был ад... мы с другом все пытались поиграть вместе. Мы пытались где-то час, и потом мы бросили эту затею... Сказать честно может я просто чего-то не знал как это сделать, но скажу сразу, всем кто хочет поиграть в эту игру с друзьями, вы должны иметь железные нервы, чтобы вытерпеть все, что это будет крайне не легко.\nТак что моя оценка игре вот такая:\n7 из 10","timestamp_created":1404500776,"timestamp_updated":1404500945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11072663","author":{"steamid":"76561198065055995","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1116,"last_played":1591413142},"language":"english","review":"Great co-op game fun to play with friends but it gets boring after a while","timestamp_created":1404500607,"timestamp_updated":1404500607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11072415","author":{"steamid":"76561198033565311","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7625,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4590,"last_played":1655257300},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor desde o seu lançamento é um jogo sensacional... espero que a franquia continue no mesmo ritmo","timestamp_created":1404499772,"timestamp_updated":1404499772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpritgccCf7meKg=="}
