sweet and straight to the point. \nThe story follows Gordon after the events in the previous game trying to escape City 17 with Alyx to regroup with the Eli and the rest. The characters aren't anything groundbreaking but they do a pretty decent job in giving the player some interaction. The story itself is pretty simple, but it moves the plot along really well which is really good. \nThe setting of the now destroyed City 17 is well portrayed with its dystopian feel with every area that you walk through being in complete destruction or just outright abandoned (apart from the denizens that roam around them). Valve has still kept up the quality that they produced in previous titles while also updating a few things here and there. \nVisually, it still looks like the second game, but with updated visuals such as better looking environments and especially characters with their facial animations looking a lot more smooth and realistic. The art direction still feels great and manages to keep its overwhelming sense of oppression that the citizens of City 17 must feel. \nSound and Audio are pretty much the same with the soundtrack making moments in gameplay feel intense like an action movie. The audio itself is pretty much the same which i wouldn't expect to change due to how recognisable and iconic they are to the series. \nIn terms of gameplay, it pretty much follows what the previous game produced. Gun play, enemies, etc. are identical to Half  Life 2, however there are moments in the game that give new ideas and unique gameplay opportunities that help it differ from the previous title. This can be things such as using flares to guide you in the darkness to both fight enemies and progress the game in performing a certain action due to your flashlight being able to run out, to guiding citizens from one spot to the other while trying to fight off the Combine. The downside to this is that there are very little of these moments which brings me onto my next point: This is a game for those who enjoy the Half Life series. For those who don't really have a strong interest in the series or the plot of the game may find this to be an experience not for them. The other issue is that this is an episode that doesn't last that long (took me around 3 hours to complete) so some people may not think that this short experience is worth the money. One thing i can definitely say is that you'll get more for your money that you would for something like Poppy Playtime!\nOverall, Half Life 2 Episode 1 is a really nice follow-up from the second game which i think fans of Half Life 2 will really enjoy, however if you haven't been invested in the series before, i don't think this will be worth your while.","timestamp_created":1652978780,"timestamp_updated":1652978780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115689966","author":{"steamid":"76561198084558047","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1652970452},"language":"english","review":"6/10","timestamp_created":1652970522,"timestamp_updated":1652970522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115653716","author":{"steamid":"76561198154823549","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":213,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1652912208},"language":"english","review":"epic","timestamp_created":1652900135,"timestamp_updated":1652900135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115649078","author":{"steamid":"76561199197336172","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1568,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1244,"last_played":1658882198},"language":"english","review":"its a good challenge but i hate the elevator","timestamp_created":1652893305,"timestamp_updated":1653941282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115624688","author":{"steamid":"76561198310535271","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":515,"last_played":1652845047},"language":"english","review":"i love the jank","timestamp_created":1652845162,"timestamp_updated":1652845162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115614406","author":{"steamid":"76561199155702610","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1651967288},"language":"brazilian","review":"Mesmo sendo o mais piorzinho alí entre o HL2, ainda sim é bem divertido e diversos Puzzles de quebrar a cabeça, além de uma dificuldade equilibrada com a jogabilidade, compre se irá zerar a franquia Half-Life inteira, não vai se arrepender e vai se divertir muito com esse Game.\n\nNota: 7,9","timestamp_created":1652826878,"timestamp_updated":1652826878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115605692","author":{"steamid":"76561198371892775","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1041,"last_played":1653259633},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 2's continuation in this episode is as industry-leading as it ought to be, considering it comes right on the heels of HL2 as little more than an expansion.
