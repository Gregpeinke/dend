Killing Floor представляет собой кооперативный шутер от первого лица в жанре Survival Horror, разработанный компанией Tripwire Interactive и выпущенный 14 мая 2009 года».\n\n      [i]Сюжет: Некий учёный по имени Кевин Кламели, сделав прорыв в области восстановления, научился клонировать людей и управлять их волей. По случайному стечению обстоятельств учёный теряет своего сына, но отказываясь принять судьбу, клонирует его. В семье возникает проблема, и жена разводится с Кевином, в ответ на это он создаёт её клона, а настоящую жену убивает. Учёный продолжает трудиться над своими достижениями и создаёт целую армию мёртвых клонов, которые управляются только мыслями безумного гения. С такими возможностями он решает захватить целую страну, начиная с Великобритании.[/i] \n\n      Как мы видим сюжет достаточно прост и банален, но он не является ключевой частью игры. Больше всего удовольствия мы получим в процессе геймплея. И сейчас, я постараюсь выделить его основные особенности: \n\n    †[b]  Кооперативный геймплей, включающий игру до 6 игроков одновременно (на неофициальных серверах это количество может быть увеличено).[/b]\n\n    †[b]  Система прокачки персонажа, состоящая из 7-ми непохожих друг на друга навыков.[/b] \n\n    †[b]  Большой арсенал (более 50-ти видов оружия), позволяющий расправляться с мутантами самыми различными способами.[/b]  \n \n    †[b]  10 видов монстров, обладающих уникальными характеристиками. К каждому существу придется искать особый подход для его уничтожения.[/b]\n\n    †[b]  Возможность выбора персонажа, за которого вы будете выживать до последнего (персонаж дает лишь косметический эффект, т.е. только особый внешний вид).[/b]\n\n    †[b]  Огромное количество различных карт (более 25-ти). Вы побываете в таких местах, как: Биолаборатория, Дом сумасшедших, Лунная база, Лаборатория Aperture Science и даже в Аду! Локации на картах являются полностью свободными, вы сами выбираете где и как сражаться.[/b]\n\n    †[b]  2 режима игры. Первый, включает в себя выживание определенное количество волн, после преодоления которых, вас ждет финальный босс. Второй режим дает нам шанс пройти карту, выполняя определенные задания, будь то защита и сопровождение NPC, либо поиск определенных вещей на карте, нужных для прохождения этапа. Заданий много и все они разнообразные.[/b]\n\n    †[b]  Функция замедления времени «ZEDtime», позволяющая разглядеть в подробностях все игровые моменты.[/b]\n\n    †[b]  Система достижений, не дающая вам заскучать в игре. Для их выполнения придется пройти все карты на различных сложностях, совершить специальные убийства и задания. Также, открытие достижений позволяет получить доступ к некоторым видам оружия и персонажам.[/b]\n\n    †[b]  Ежесезонные обновления, добавляющие новое оружие, карты и персонажей. Также происходит замена всех мутантов под определенное празднование, будь то Хэллоуин или Новый год.[/b]\n\n      Killing Floor идеально подходит для вечерней игры с друзьями, когда после тяжелого рабочего дня вам необходимо расслабиться и \"выпустить пар\". Прохождение на высоких сложностях потребует от вас точной, командной работы и планирование наилучшей тактики для прохождения карты. Игру следует покупать на распродаже, так как скидка на нее составляет более 75 процентов. Советую сразу покупать Killing Floor Bundle, со всеми вкусностями в комплекте!

I am a huge Left 4 Dead series fan. But, I think I've played more hours playing this game (and it doesn't even have a multiplayer vs mode like L4D). In any case, it's a great alternative to the epic L4D and resident evil franchises. (Sorry, but I don't count Call of Duty nor Dead Island since I never played those nor do I desire to.) It's almost everything I am looking for in a zombie FPS game (not including mods):\n+ 6-player co-op \n+ a wide array of guns to buy\n+ progressive classes rpg-like system\n+ the sounds of shooting and reloading of the guns are spectacular\n+ hordes of zombies to kill | headshots dominate as zombie-killing rules should be\n+ a sizable amount of default maps\n\nThe only things amiss in this game, imo, are:\n- while there are now plenty of skins to pick from, you can not customize your survivor/weapons\n- and while we are talking about skins (mainly characters, but some weapons), some of them are obviously overpriced items  with little effort done\n- the theme/atmosphere of the game may be a little silly. I understand that was how it was designed, but I like my zombie games with a more serious tone. (Plants vs Zombies is an exception lol)\n\nI am close to playing 600 hrs of game time and have done a majority of all the acheivements.
