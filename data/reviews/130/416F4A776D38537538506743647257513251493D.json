Like its predecessor Opposing Force, Blue Shift is an entirely new campaign featuring a new playable character, set during the Black Mesa incident. You play as Barney Calhoun, a security guard who finds himself scrambling to survive as the harmonic reflux ripples throughout the facilities and tears a hole into the border dimension Xen. As the facility fills with aliens and soldiers sent to cover up the incident, Barney finds himself accompanying a professor who just might know a way out.\n\nUnlike Opposing Force, Blue Shift is very much routed to the original game. There's no new weapons or enemies here, just most of the stuff you see in the base game, owing to the fact that the game was originally developed as a short bonus campaign for the cancelled Dreamcast port (which also explains why Sega of America is thanked in the credits). While this isn't really a bad thing, the loss of weapons like the Displacer Canon and the iconic Grappler are sorely missed. The lack of a HEV suit or PCV is also noteworthy, meaning Barney only has unrefillable armor that he finds about to protect him (despite this, HEV refill stations are still scattered around for consistency). On top of that, this is a short game. Very short. A first time playthrough clocks in at about 3 or so hours max, and even shorter if you know what you're doing. I played this for the first time recently and grand total playtime was around 2 and a half hours, and that was with breaks where i left the game running. These flaws build up to make Blue Shift the worst of the original trio of HL games. \n\nStill, Blue Shift is hardly bad. This is still good old fashioned HL fun that you can burn through in a quick single session. The general lack of cheap moments like in Opposing Force and the new story is simple and enjoyable (along with featuring what is possibly the only happy ending in the entire franchise). And hey, there's even a fancy new texture pack to make everything slicker, though this might be a downside depending on your POV. Given the super short length, and if you're new to Half Life, i recommend you buy this as part of the HL Anthology, which is around $13. You get two longer games and Team Fortress Classic thrown in for good measure. \n\nA fun but brief experience. \n\n6.5/10","timestamp_created":1619651646,"timestamp_updated":1619651983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91078148","author":{"steamid":"76561198833058293","num_games_owned":336,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1619650321},"language":"turkish","review":"Klasik serinin güzel bir oyunu, seriyi sevenler için oynayıp bitirmeden olmaz.","timestamp_created":1619650545,"timestamp_updated":1619650545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91038259","author":{"steamid":"76561198149396436","num_games_owned":841,"num_reviews":260,"playtime_forever":177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":177,"last_played":1561835648},"language":"russian","review":"Накал страсти такой, что физик ядерщик в супер костюме фриман со своим ломом и тау пушкой едва рядом стоит с приключениями простого быдловатого охраника с неоконченным средним в шлеме котелке и противоударном бронежилете. \nПока фриман воевал со всякой наглой xyйнёй на территории блэк мезы и спасал измерение, простой охранник без дополнительных средств защиты умудрился выбраться живым из зена и не заразится космическим герпесом.","timestamp_created":1619585975,"timestamp_updated":1619585975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.373862028121948242","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91031585","author":{"steamid":"76561198331754332","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":236,"last_played":1619571426},"language":"english","review":"About that beer I owed ya...","timestamp_created":1619571595,"timestamp_updated":1619571595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91030178","author":{"steamid":"76561199160391908","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1620151085},"language":"brazilian","review":"Apesar de ser uma expansão curta e com nada de novo,é divertida de se jogar e acrescenta mais um pouco na história de half life, então quem gostou do jogo e da primeira expansão eu recomendo comprar e jogar essa.","timestamp_created":1619568820,"timestamp_updated":1619568820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"91017932","author":{"steamid":"76561198849926916","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":335,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1623076178},"language":"polish","review":"Ta gra jest EZ.

Дополнение не сыскало любви у фанатов, и в целом получилось сомнительным. Если Opposing Force понравился некоторым фанатам даже больше оригинала, то про Blue Shift такого не скажешь. Так что-же с ним может быть не так? Разберём.\n\n[b]Плюсы[/b]\nНу, у этого дополнения своеобразный маппинг, свои мелкие детали и сценки, некоторые из них не похожи на те, что мы видели в прошлых двух дополнениях. Кроме этого, у мода есть эффект, что наш персонаж говорит, но не для нас, поэтому если поговорить с учёными, то они ответят нам \"Нет, я не доктор Розенберг\", что говорит само за себя. А так, в моде ещё поработали над сложностью, что хорошо может растянуть мод, ох... Никогда не забуду головоломку с бочкой, и как-бы я тогда догадался, что её надо ставить между проводами! Ну, короче, плюсов не особо много, ну есть ещё пара новых моделей, в частности модель самого Розенберга, которая сделана вполне достойно. Ну и на этом список всего хорошего заканчивается...\n\n[b]Минусы[/b]\nВо-первых дополнение очень короткое, несмотря на сложность, которая увеличивает время геймплея (А я всем рекомендую играть на харде) аддон всё-равно очень короткий, уж его можно легко пройти за день и даже не утомится, чувствуется что только в него внедряешся, а тут он блин, заканчивается! Кроме этого нас заставят тут вернутся обратно в локацию где мы побывали, что не даёт разнообразия в локациях, но является интересным дизайнерским решением, чувствуется, что аддон слишком сырой, хотя концовка порадовала, не только сценой где мы видим Фримена, но и сценой где мы телепортируемся отсюда вместе с учёными, где мы чувствуем напряжение, что пора скорее-бы отсюда сваливать, пока есть время. Ну а так, этот аддон вышел даже короче чем Episode One, но в целом не стоит забывать что это аддон, да и всё-равно видно, что в него вложили свою любовь дизайнеры.\n\n[b]Итог[/b]\nВ целом, дополнение неплохое, не идеальное, но и не совсем провал. Проходить его в очередной раз будет приятно, но думаешь что могло получиться нечто большее, чем это.

Calhoun, who is working at that research facility as part of a security force, and is responsible for the welfare of the research personnel, in addition to preserving the site. But what begun as a day-to-day security shift, soon turns into an escapade into an unknown world.\n\nThe world the protagonist is to navigate through, is seen from his own perspective, as if the environments are seen from his own eyes. The protagonist is to be controlled directly, and may travel in all directions. He may expand his arsenal of firearms, and increase his amount of available munition, by finding supplies in the environment. On occasion, electronic music may also be heard playing in the background, when passing through certain areas.\nSoon after the initial opening-scene, the protagonist acquires his security outfit, this includes a firearm and a light, which he may use in order to perform his duty as a security guard.\nThe play consists largely out of overcoming adversaries by making use of these firearms, and also by finding a path onward through the environments, this includes solving navigational puzzles, and figuring out how to overcome them. Various machinery may also be controlled by using the protagonist, and the environments are interactive.\nMost places the protagonist visits are geometrically connected to a previous environment, and occasionally, there are short loading sequences in between areas. There are adversaries who await the protagonist in these environments, or they may enter the stage when the protagonist passes through them. Story progression may be saved at any time, and an expansive training mission is available before the main story takes place.\n\nThe protagonist controls responsively and precise. Knowing where adversaries are, or which direction they come from, helps surviving hostile encounters.\nThere is balance between having to overcome the environments by navigating through them, and by overcoming adversaries by doing battle with them. Survival is made easier by a blue-coloured heads-up display, which shows information about the environment, the protagonist's medical status, his available munition, etcetera.\nNoticeable are the neatly finished environments, which show attention in respect to having a finished design. These environments are created by using detailed shapes, that are original to Blue Shift. The environments are also nicely textured, and most of the environments are in one piece, and relatively civilized, and not totally wasted by destruction.\nStory actors show attention to detail as well. For example, they have three-dimensionally rendered mouths, which are animated when they speak. These actors may also follow the protagonist, and interact with the environment.\n\n\nThis cleansing image shows an example of how a character may interact with the environment:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2457965544","timestamp_created":1618710014,"timestamp_updated":1631218628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90487739","author":{"steamid":"76561198172417955","num_games_owned":773,"num_reviews":156,"playtime_forever":168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":168,"last_played":1618695872},"language":"english","review":"[h1] ❤ Audience ❤ [/h1]\n☐ Beginner\n☑ Casual Gamer\n☑ Normal Gamer\n☐ Expert\n\n[h1] ☼ Graphics ☼ [/h1]\n☐ Bad\n☑ Alright\n☐ Good \n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Fantastic \n\n[h1] ♬ Music ♬ [/h1]\n☐ Bad\n☑ Alright\n☐ Good \n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Fantastic\n\n[h1] ☠ Difficulty ☠ [/h1]\n☐ Easy \n☑ Average \n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master \n☐ Hard\n☐ Unfair\n\n[h1] § Bugs § [/h1]\n☐ Bugs destroy the game\n☐ Lots of bugs\n☑ Few Bugs\n☐ You can use them for speedrun\n☐ Nothing encountered\n\n[h1] ☯ Story ☯ [/h1]\n☐ There is none\n☐ Bad \n☐ Alright \n☑ Good \n☐ Fantastic \n\n[h1] ⚔ Gameplay ⚔ [/h1]\n☐ Frustrating\n☐ Sleepy\n☐ Boring\n☑ Fun \n☐ Challenging\n\n[h1] ۞ Game time / Length ۞ [/h1]\n☑ Really short (0 - 3 hours)\n☐ Short (4 - 7 hours) \n☐ Few hours (8 - 20 hours)\n☐ Long (21-50 hours) \n☐ Very Long (51-100 hours) \n☐ Extremely Long (101+ hours) \n\n[h1] $ Price / Quality $ [/h1]\n☐ Full price \n☑ Wait for Sale  \n☐ Don't buy\n☐ Refund it if you can","timestamp_created":1618696547,"timestamp_updated":1618696596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534690439701080322","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90482675","author":{"steamid":"76561198960479049","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":26,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26,"last_played":1618581296},"language":"turkish","review":"çok güzel bir oyun ama tek sıkıntsı mouseu çevirirken takılması ama cidden tüm half life serileri çok iyi","timestamp_created":1618689699,"timestamp_updated":1618689699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90473302","author":{"steamid":"76561199042302441","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1618677923},"language":"english","review":"It was good.
