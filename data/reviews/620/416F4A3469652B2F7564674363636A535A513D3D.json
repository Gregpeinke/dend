I use a HP pavilion 15 and I run at least 170 FPS every time I get onto the game. When you alt tab or momentarily switch to another screen, Portal 2 is still on the other side of the screen waiting for you.

It features a single-player story set after the events of Portal's story; and a brand-new Co-op game mode, featuring additional test chambers designed specifically for Co-operative play. \nOne reason for its success was innovative game play.  Portal is a puzzle game masquerading as a first-person shooter. The player wields a “portal gun” which creates shortcuts through physical space: Shoot it at a wall and a glowing “portal” appears at the point of impact. Shoot again in a different spot and it makes a second portal. Now the player can walk right through the first portal, and out the second. Think of it as a teleportation gun that requires the player to shoot surfaces to identify the start and end points of their trip.Valve uses this mechanic in complicated puzzles where the player is required to get from one end of the room to another.Players create portals to jump over obstacles, get around barriers, and even crush enemies, teleporting stuff so it falls on top of them.","timestamp_created":1479910993,"timestamp_updated":1479910993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26762769","author":{"steamid":"76561198056617565","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":13044,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12456,"last_played":1588189565},"language":"french","review":"Gameplay original, scénario intéressant (fait penser au film The Cube).","timestamp_created":1479909072,"timestamp_updated":1479909072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26760376","author":{"steamid":"76561198333077317","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":867,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":704,"last_played":1500707541},"language":"schinese","review":"一款可玩性非常高的游戏","timestamp_created":1479895875,"timestamp_updated":1479895875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26758056","author":{"steamid":"76561198032030934","num_games_owned":403,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1506,"last_played":1513563108},"language":"english","review":"Everyone must place this game.

This game is a lot like the original Portal, except more polished and realistic. It has a proper story in it unlike the first one, and the choice of enemies is certainly interesting. I enjoyed sparring with GLaDOS again [spoiler] though Wheatley's betrayal came as a bittersweet surprise. [/spoiler] Learning about Aperture's history was also facinating and added depth to the barebones plot of the first game. \n\nGameplay has been expanded and this has been one of the best parts. Yes, the classic gameplay from the first game is still there (and yes, you can still make holes in reality) but to make it more interesting and worth your money (as opposed to say, if you have played the first game you have also played this one) you have more toys to play with. There are hardlight bridges, allowing you to literally walk on sunshine, various gels with various properties, and aerial plates that fling you up in the air, to name a few things. There are more variations in the envionment as you go through the different versions of Aperture Laboratories/Science. In other words, this is not exactly like the first game, and the puzzles are more changeable.\n\nThe only gripe I have is the odd placements of the loading screens from time to time. Sure, having loading screens in lifts makes sense, but sometimes you see it right in the middle of walking. That was a little confusing and it kind of broke the 'flow' a little. Still, minor trouble, nothing special.\n\nAll in all this sequel takes all the great stuff from the original, and revamps it as well as adds more mechanics to make it interesting.

From there, wheatley, a new AI sphere companion, busts you out of your stasis pod and tries to help you escape. From there, shit hits the fan and spirals out of control.\n\nportal 2's gameplay is more or less exactly the same as the last game. The controls do feel a bit smoother than the last one, and the puzzles are alot more difficult than those in the first. However, throughout portal two new mechanics, such as anti gravity machines, gel's and co-op are introduced. There are two campaigns, one meant entirely for solo play, while the other is meant for co-op only and requires another person to actually enjoy. I only experienced the solo campaign, so i will focus on that.\n\nThe solo campaign has all the charm the original had and more, everything from the humor to the creativty of the levels is ramped up drastically. While the original game was extremely funny at times, this one keeps that level of comedy constant throughout the campaign from start to finish. The new levels are also extremely satisfying to play through, like before, each level feels like a reward for beating the last, now with added dialog to make you laugh yourself silly. The plot, while relatively simple when you look at it from a objective standpoint, really is a step up when compared to the original, especially when you realize what is at stake. If you also read into some of the smaller details. this relatively dark humor based game becomes genuinely depressing to, such as the actual reason all the characters actually exist in the first place and just how sad those reasons are. Every bit of dialog exists for a reason, every little clue in the game is worth remembering as it will come into play at some point down the line, even the final boss battle requires you to remember one specific bit of dialog from earlier on in order to actually realize \"oh, so thats where i should aim\".\n\nThis all being said, the game is not without its flaws. Several puzzles later on in the game are really annoying, as very important aspects of said puzzle are hidden in obscure corners of the map and i only stumbled upon them by rage scrolling the mouse frantically. The levels in the old part of the labs are great, but there is more visual clutter, which can distract from the elements of the puzzles. While this does not make any of the puzzles extremely difficult, this does cause minor frustration at times.\n\nThe game has seen massive amounts of polish though, visually, the game is stunning, even compared to most modern games. The soundtrack is back with a vengence to, unlike the previous game where it was always there and wonderful, but easy to forget about, portal 2 features a much more noticable, distinct soundtrack with a wider variety of tracks that doesn't distract you from the gameplay unless you actually stop and listen. I was even informed by a friend that [spoiler] they deliberately timed how long it would take light to travel from the surface of earth, all the way to the moon in order to accurately depict the time it would take for a portal to form up there. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, Portal 2 is everything good from portal two, with more polish and greater variety of gameplay. If you were a fan of the original, you will love this. If you found portal one a bit bland but liked the gameplay, portal two improves on the clean cut graphics and adds in more dialog. If you love puzzle games, get this and the original. Even if you don't like puzzle games, there is still something for you as the puzzles aren't mind-bendingly hard but still difficult enough to make you think.","timestamp_created":1479572915,"timestamp_updated":1479572915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26694092","author":{"steamid":"76561198278673573","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1242,"last_played":1644252279},"language":"hungarian","review":"Nekem nyagyon tetszik!

There's way too much right with this game, and not enough wrong! It's awesome!\n\nI suppose I'll go into full detail, without trying to spoil it.\n\nIn Portal 2, you play as the last game's protagonist, Chell, and, after being reawakened from a state of suspended animation by a small core named Wheatley, you will be put through another series of reality-bending tests by GLaDOS, the last game's antagonist. However, this time around, things get a little more advanced, with new mechanics such as [spoiler] the Propulsion Gel\t[/spoiler], [spoiler] Propulsion Gel[/spoiler] and [spoiler] Conversion Gel[/spoiler], as well as another unlikely villain for you to battle.\n\nThe concept of the game, for those who've never touched anything in the Portal series, is as follows:\nYou are in possession of a scientifically engineered tool known as the \"Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device™\", and are tasked with the key objective of navigating through and completing a series of perplexing tests created by a sentient AI known as the \"Genetic Lifeform and Disc Operating System™\", or GLaDOS. \n\nThis series is one of the most unbelievably brain-picking, head scratchingly clever and difficult that I've ever had the absolute delight of getting into. The visuals, robotic personalities and Companion Cubes™ are so pleasantly charming, and the humour is actually some of my personal favourites. Compared to the astoundingly astronomical experience that the first game was, this was a massive improvement, and thanks to these improvements, this game is somewhat a completely different experience than the last, with story and character development (GLaDOS and Wheatley, not Chell), the return of the \"Aperture Science Weighted Companion Cube™ and puzzles galore, as well as an awesome multiplayer side story, there's plenty to do, and even though I've done it all on PS3, I had to come back and play again here. I've not even finished it yet, due to playing multiplayer for hours with my brother.\n\nPROS:\nPuzzles to wrack your brain like never before.\nPortal-based conundrums make the game so memorable and fun.\nThe genius writing for GLaDOS in this game makes for some of the greatest humour of gaming history, In my opinion.\nThe puzzles are some of the most memorable. Examples include most of the ones you get stuck on for hours at a time.\nBeing stuck on the puzzles for hours.\nListening to GLaDOS' commentary at the start and end of every chamber.\nMULTIPLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nEvery other thing in the game I haven't mentioned.\n\nCONS:\nThe puzzles in multiplayer, especially the last few, drove me to check online guides for the answers. That or I'm dim.\nThe sadness you feel when the game ends. \nAnyone who wants a refund for this game.\n\nOverall, this game, in my personal opinion, gets 10 Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cubes™ out of 10.\n\nBuy this game.

It is far easier to rant about something you hate rather than give out glowing praise. The other reason it that I'm not too great at it. However, I abandoned all those foolish notions and am currently tapping my review to the rhythmic sounds of 'Want you gone', humming quietly to myself in my basement, with all the lights off save my computer, in my Wheatley Laboratories hoodie, a turret at my left and my mousepad at my right, not having slept for a longer time than I would care to admit, nearly done with playthrough god-knows-what, five and a half years after this game's release while I listen to the sounds of people telling me Portal is dead slowly fade into the background as I turn up my music. I literally cannot give a higher recommendation. This is my favorite game of all time.\n\nThe sheer fact that a main story as short as Portal 2's could manage to give me not only so much playtime, but also the willingness to spend 4 times the game's cost worth of money on merchandise, It really shows just how amazing a game can be. I'm not one to spend money on a whim, either. But this is all besides the point. \n\nThe story is very short, and if there is a drawback, and it has some pacing issues once you know what to do in all the puzzles (that's hardly fair though). I haven't even looked into speedrunning techniques but I can finish the normally 8-12 hour campaign in around two hours simply taking the most direct routes and knowing exactly where to go and what to do when you get there. However while the story itself it relatively short, believe me, it makes up for it in sheer quality. It doesn't have any moving political commentary or complex morals (or any at all, really) and the plot at it's base definitely isn't anything new, but if you're looking at buying this game and somehow have not heard about the beautifully clever and witty dialogue gracing the three or four characters, oh man, you are in for a treat. The best of them by far is Wheatley, with practically every line he says being something you can laugh at (I have an entire folder with about 30 pages of drawings of just him saying some of his more quoteable lines), but every character has their time to shine. GLaDOS has a lot of good stuff in the latter half of the game and I've straight up seen Cave Johnson's \"Do you know who I am?! I'm the man whose gonna BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN! With the LEMONS!\" on t-shirts. The writers over at Valve are a seriously gifted bunch, I must say. Portal's dialogue was great, but it does not in any way compare to it's younger brother. Portal 2's plot is actually surprisingly dark once you begin looking deeper into it, especially if you've played the game as much as I have. Spoilers ahead obviously, but you watch Cave Johnson go from a slightly reckless happy scientist to slowly losing finantial support from the government, losing test subjects and employees and finally poisoning himself accidentally with moon rocks, where you hear his dying wishes to put Caroline in charge (who is actually part of GLaDOS now) followed by a 'Good-bye, sir.' from the Caroline in GLaDOS that honestly gets me everytime. Looking into more of Aperture's backstory and revealing how nearly everyone was killed by a rogue GlaDOS, aside from one man who is half going insane and ended up being the one that saved Chell from the fate that claimed all of the other 10-15,000 test subjects holed up in Aperture's relaxation center at the cost of his own life and it ends up weaving this fantastic story where the darkness of what really happened to these characters is hidden within lighthearted and hilarious dialogue that makes the darkness interesting, but never overwhelming. Anything potentially ominious goes with something you can laugh at (see anytime anyone makes a death threat, ESPECIALLY Wheatley) so you never feel weighed down by some of the gravity of the deeper story. I honestly cannot praise it enough. It is something to behold.\n\nGameplay wise I can't say anything that won't be repeating someone else, but puzzles are highly inventive, never too convoluted or frusterating and all enjoyable and even on your first go, and figuring the game out is very satisfying, even if the level isn't too terribly hard. It has become the game I play to relax, and I love it like a son because of that. The only real issue is far too many of the puzzles are dependent on falling somewhere to launch yourself somewhere else, but to be fair that is a pretty efficient way of getting places sooo... I don't know. I will say though while that is prevelant, it is used in plenty of different ways, so it feels fresh each time it appears.\n\nThis was honestly the best 20 bucks I've ever spent, even if it was far, far after the hype had gone. I'd like to say, if the fact this is an older game discourages you from buying, don't let it. I have gotten far more enjoyment out of this than most things I've had in my life, and despite the fact I jumped on a bandwagon that had been abandoned at the side of the road long ago, I don't regret a thing. The dialogue still makes me laugh and the characters are seriously top notch, and I haven't tired of it this far through. That has to be a mark of quality of some sort.","timestamp_created":1479435778,"timestamp_updated":1480377535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26664275","author":{"steamid":"76561198040943104","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":817,"last_played":1465250665},"language":"brazilian","review":"É bom.","timestamp_created":1479432358,"timestamp_updated":1479432358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26663987","author":{"steamid":"76561198091178281","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":4435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1950,"last_played":1647566487},"language":"english","review":"yes.","timestamp_created":1479430746,"timestamp_updated":1479430746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26651246","author":{"steamid":"76561198048859736","num_games_owned":343,"num_reviews":148,"playtime_forever":2202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1909,"last_played":1534943988},"language":"russian","review":"Испытательская игра.","timestamp_created":1479417479,"timestamp_updated":1522776363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26650465","author":{"steamid":"76561198074843195","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":2515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2056,"last_played":1527355034},"language":"russian","review":"Сюжет прекрасен.
