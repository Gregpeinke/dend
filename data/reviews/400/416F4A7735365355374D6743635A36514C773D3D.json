Historically, the concept of there being a known set of the laws of attraction evolved from the laws of affinity, which numbered up to ten depending upon which chemist was sourced.\n\nIn c. 391 BC, Plato built on Empedocles’ conception of philia (attractive force) and neikos (repulsive force) by postulating the first law of affinity that “likes tend toward likes”, e.g. earth to earth or water to water, etc. In 1250, Albertus Magnus applied the conception of ‘affinity’ to chemical systems and postulated four laws of affinity.\nIn 1687, Isaac Newton proposed that chemical affinities were due to certain forces that would likely follow similar laws analogous to the three laws of planetary motion. He expanded on these views in ‘Query 31’ of his 1704 Opticks. In 1718, after translating Newton’s Opticks, French physician and chemist Étienne Geoffroy proposed a new law of affinity that ‘whenever two substances are united that have a disposition to combine and a third is added that has a greater affinity with one of them, these two will unite, and drive out the other.’ Using this law, he published the first ever affinity tables.\nIn 1749, building on Geoffroy’s affinity table, French chemist J. P. Macquer published six truths of chemical affinity, which encompassed both Plato’s and Geoffroy’s affinity laws, as well as four new ones. In 1766, he published seven types of affinity in his Dictionnaire de chymie.\nIn this manner, most consider Isaac Newton to be the one who stimulated the discovery of the \"laws of attraction\". Before this, however, the ancient Greeks knew from magnetic interactions that \"opposites attract\" and \"likes repel\". This factor is modelled essentially via Coulomb's law.\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, the theory of electromagnetism, unified by James Clerk Maxwell in 1873, is the physics of the electromagnetic field; a field encompassing all of space which exerts a force on particles that possess the property of electric charge, and is in turn affected by the presence and motion of those particles. This effect, as modeled via Maxwell's field equations, can be thought of as the electromagnetic laws of attraction and repulsion.\nWith the discovery of sub-atomic particles, such as the quark (1964), and the fundamental forces, the term \"laws of attraction\" has been replaced with the conception of field particle exchange, and the bonding effect created therefrom. Subsequently, in the 20th century the laws of affinity were replaced by the laws of quantum chemistry and chemical thermodynamics.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1412694400,"timestamp_updated":1412694400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12399638","author":{"steamid":"76561198149684988","num_games_owned":355,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":106,"last_played":1429698096},"language":"schinese","review":"一款十分有趣的游戏","timestamp_created":1412689766,"timestamp_updated":1412689766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12399460","author":{"steamid":"76561198060623172","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":139,"last_played":1484755167},"language":"english","review":"extremley fun game, not too long however would reccomend if you plan on purchasing the sequal also.\n\n6/10","timestamp_created":1412688735,"timestamp_updated":1412688735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12398836","author":{"steamid":"76561198154194915","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":558,"last_played":1413807300},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bomm!\nRecomendo!!!","timestamp_created":1412684471,"timestamp_updated":1412684471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12398663","author":{"steamid":"76561198117639423","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":297,"last_played":1411212211},"language":"english","review":"One of the most Amazing game ever made! \n11/10","timestamp_created":1412683100,"timestamp_updated":1412683100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518203914165496826","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12396856","author":{"steamid":"76561198061150978","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1473842400},"language":"english","review":"Fun, challenging, entertaining, and a great story line.

Quizá demasiado corto, pero cuando juegas a la secuela (Portal 2), ves que el primero sólo fue la introducción a una obra magnífica e inolvidable.\nUn personaje (GLADoS) con un humor fantástico y una personalidad única, todo combinado con un estilo limpio y una batalla final que más que física se basa en algo innovador: la psicología.\nEs una buenísima inversión, no tanto por éste juego, sino por la segunda parte (que supera unas 100 veces a ésta innovando, creando nuevos personajes, conociendo el pasado de \"Aperture\" y con una historia magnífica en la que descubrirás a GLADoS y, quizá, a tí misma).\nUna primera parte magnífica para lo que, combinado con Portal 2, será inolvidable.

The portal gun can create two distinct portal ends, orange and blue. as you get farther and farther into the game the guide voice named GLaDOS helps you through the levels, and also briefs you on any legal liabilitys that Aperture may have and souch. your prommessed  a party with... Cake on completion of teh cource. but as you get closer and closer to the end, things get more and more shady untill you finally complete all of the tests. your being weeled along on a platform to 'your party' when you kind of notice its moving towards a massive pit of death. but if you act quickly then you can escape. GLaDOS doesnt know what your doing at first. you twist and wind your way through the service area's of the facility putting more and more peaces of the puzzle together. GLaDOS thinks your trying to find the exit and keeps telling you \"im not mad. just turn back and we can all have cake, you not even going the right way. i was only joking about incinerating you\" and so on. but you find the hidy hole of what seems to be the last protagonist. he seemed to be living there a wile. his hidy holes walls were covered with writting invlueding \"the cake is a lie\" over and over again. wich is when you realies shes lieing about my cake -_-. wich leads to the finall battle and the cliff hanger for the next in the series. \n\n\nits an amazing game, with charm and profile that will never leave the world. its a little outdated now, graphics mainly, but they remind me of halo 1 & 2 wich are still amazingly popular games. i would recomend grabbing this, before you get II. its realy worth it even when its not on sale. its a great game and frankly if you havent got it, then YOUR a lie. so get it. and enjoy it. try and play through all of the bonus advanced maps after you finsih it because the game isnt as long as things like Halo wich may or may not be anoying. but still its an amazing, trippy, magical game with the best steam achivemants ever. if you spawn a portal on the roof then the floor belowe it, then fall through the floor and out the ceeling then through the floor agin and again and again and it allmost made me through up watching the room fly past hundreds of times and watching hundreds of myselfs belowe me falling as well. but they did it so well that i just love it!\nand i think you will too. if your more into downright deathmatches then dont get this game because it requires a level of Patience that isnt found often. but if your into your puzzle games and souch, this game will be a peace of... cake. im not lieing.","timestamp_created":1412401607,"timestamp_updated":1412401607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12356631","author":{"steamid":"76561198078132285","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":137,"last_played":1425250356},"language":"spanish","review":"Simplemente genial.
