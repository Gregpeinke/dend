This is for new and potentially new players. Vets of the game already know why TFC is still for sale, and not F2P like it's \"decendent\". \n\nTFC is a game I've been playing for over 15 years. It is, without a doubt, the most FUN game in my library. \n\nYou have the same 9 classes as TF2, however, with many differences. The Spy can't turn invisible, but can \"feign death\". Be careful with this ability, as it's not impossible to spot a Spy trying to pull their tricks.\n\nGrenades! TFC has grenades, and lots of them! Every class(except Sniper) has a class specific secondary grenade. All classes(except Scout) have your normal issue \"Frag\" grenade. Using these grenades can help you either kill an enemy, or assist your movements. \n\nWhen you first begin playing, you WILL get your butt handed to you. A lot. This is normal, and all TFC players have been through it. Don't let that deter you. The game engine has lots of nuances for you to learn, but it takes time. Really, it takes lots of time to learn, but many players are willing to teach you. All you have to do is ask. \n\nYou may encounter players who have forgotten what it's like to be new to the game. Ignore them, or mute them. I may not be the best TFC player around, but I'm a team player, and I don't mind teaching what I know. Feel free to friend me, and just ask.\n\nDon't expect \"Hats\". TFC is a game where tactics and skill are utilized, we don't need no stinking Hats. ;)\n\nEdit: One more thing I'd like to add...\n\nWhile I'm not the best player ever at the game, I do know lots of tricks, and skills. If anyone would like me to teach  you some of what I know, feel free to add me as a friend on Steam, and just ask. New players will keep this game alive for another 17 years, and if I can help you along to enjoy the game more, I'm quite happy to help.\n\nEdit 11/23/17:\n\nAnother sale comes, and along with it, many new players. With that in mind, I'm editing my review to be even more helpful.\n\n\"Beginners\" classes: Many new players choose the HW-Guy because of his strong health and armour. However, the class is the slowest in the game and the \"chain gun\" takes a second to \"spin up\", leaving you vulnerable to attack. Players with experience can evade your fire and kill you if no one interferes. With that in mind, I recommend NOT choosing that class.\n\nHere are general class desciptions, along with a rating for ease of learning basic skills:\n\nSoldier: I recommend this class to new players, as he has a good mix of speed(on the slower side, but still nimble for combat), strong weapons(Rocket Launcher and Super Shotgun), and good health/armour combination. Soldier is strong enough to utilize \"Rocket Jumping\", \"Grenade Jumping\", and the all important \"Combo(rocket/nade) Jumping\". His secondary grenade(Nail Grenade) is perfect for taking down enemy Sentry Guns, and cutting off a choke point for several seconds. Given the \"Splash Damage\" effect of rockets, I recommend this class for new players, as you don't have to actually HIT your target to damage/kill them.\n\nDemolitions Man: Another well balanced class for combat. Like the Soldier, you don't need to actually HIT your target to do damage. However, the downside to this is that your pipes bounce the way physics actually work. Blue pipes explode either when they hit a target, or after a few seconds. Green pipes, however, can be spread into a \"trap\", and detonated by the player. They will eventually explode if you don't detonate them, but that's after a few minutes of inactivity, or if you try to spread more than 8. The Demoman also carries a \"Detpack\". A heavy explosive that can be set for either 5 seconds, 20 seconds, or 50 second timers(bind a key to +det5/20/50, depending on how long you want it to sit before exploding). It takes a few seconds to set, during which you are vulnerable to attack. However, once set, only an EMP grenade from an Engineer can set it off prematurely, or it can be disarmed by a Scout. One skill that you can easily learn is \"pipe jumping\", whereby you place one or two pipes on the ground, run and jump over them, and detonate them. You will take some damage, but it's a great movement tool. The Demoman also carries your standard \"Frag\" grenade, and also the \"MIRV\" grenade(very high damage). \n\nEngineer: Engineers(Medium-Light class) can build Ammo/Armour dispensers, Teleporters, and Sentry Guns. His best combat weapon is the Super Shotgun. Sentry Guns are built at level 1, and can be upgraded to level 2 and 3. Sentry Guns are used primarilly for Defensive purposes, but can also be placed in enemy territory for a surprise. Sentry Guns can not detect disguised Spies, and are vulnerable to grenades and Nail Guns. An Engineer can also repair buildables, and team mates armour with their wrench(spanner). \n\nCombat Medic: The Medic is a light class, and probably the best class used for carrying/capturing flags. He's a speedy class, with light armour and health. However, the Medic regenerates his own health slowly but can use his Med-Kit to heal team mates instantly, and even give them a temporary \"boost\" of health above 100%. His best weapon for combat is the Super Shotgun. Aside from healing team mates, his Med-Kit can be used to \"infect\" enemy players. Infection can NOT be cured by health kits in resupply areas. Only another Medic can heal the infection, which will spread to team mates if they get too close to an infected team mate. Along with his primary \"Frag\" grenade, the Medic also carries the Concussion Grenade. This secondary grenade serves two very different purposes. It can be used either to give an enemy player a \"concussion\"(makes their screen spin for a few seconds), or as a movement tool. The Conc grenade can propel you very far, very fast. Combined with \"air strafing\", you can often evade enemy fire once you learn the mechanics of it.  Medic can be learned easily enough, but only practice will make you \"good\" at the movement skills. \n\nSpy: The Spy can disguise himself as any class of either his own team, or the enemy team. He carries enough health and armour to be able to use Frag grenades for a movement/jump boost, but it will cost pretty heavily. Once you learn the nuances of proper infiltration, this class can be used to rip an enemy's defenses to shreads. His primary combat weapons are the Super Shotgun and the Knife. The Knife can be used to \"Backstab\" an enemy for a 1-hit kill(takes practice). Along with the standard Frag grenade, the Spy carries up to 4 \"Gas\" grenades. These secondary grenades will cause an enemy player to halucinate, and disorient them. The Spy also carries a \"Tranquilizer\" gun(takes a LOT of practice to become proficient at). If  you hit an enemy with a Tranq dart, they will move very slowly, but it will also reveal you from being disguised. Another \"trick\" the Spy has, is the ability to Feign death. This can be done either loudly(lets out a \"death\" yell) or silently. Once feigned, a Spy can watch the area around him, wait for an enemy player to pass by, stop feigning, and knife them from behind. It is important to note that firing ANY weapon will reveal you. You can also lose your disguise if you're touched by an enemy Scout. Throwing grenades does NOT reveal your disguise.\n\nSniper: Sniper is another \"high skill\" class. Primary weapon is the Sniper Rifle(which also has an \"auto-fire\" version. The Sniper only carries Frag grenades, and has no secondary. In close combat, the Sniper is easily outmatched. From a distance, a fully charged shot can \"one-hit\" kill any class with a headshot. Sniper carries light-medium armour, and one Frag grenade can kill him. I do NOT recommend this class for new players.\n\n(See comments for the rest.
