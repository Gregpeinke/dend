The perks are all good and unique, and the fact that you can weld doors shut is extremely useful and can be the difference between life and death.\n\nHighly recommend the game for any zombie game-lover, L4D2 lover, or horror genre lover.

This game was among my first ever purchases on Steam, (in fact I think it is), and needless to say that this game has all things you can want from a zombie survival shooter.  The maps, the zombies (zeds or specimens), the weapons, and even the music makes you really feel immersed in the environment.  When they added their own objective gamemode, it really added a good creation of balance.  Not only that but Killing Floor is very Co-Op friendly in both internet latency and skill spanning gameplay.

This game takes tactic and skill along with friends who won't act as though you are an AI to be beaten with ignorance and the cold shoulder. \n\nThis game has a unlimited amount of maps allowing for gameplay that is never the same, requiring new tactics and skill every map. \n\nOverall, Killing Floor is well worth the perchase if you are a FPS fanatic and strategy genius.","timestamp_created":1316699178,"timestamp_updated":1316699178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3539908","author":{"steamid":"76561198024413818","num_games_owned":687,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":4244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3307,"last_played":1610104505},"language":"english","review":"Awesome multiplayer!!!!!  =D","timestamp_created":1316695943,"timestamp_updated":1316695943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1998139","author":{"steamid":"76561198000751467","num_games_owned":671,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":39228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38338,"last_played":1480883919},"language":"russian","review":"Уебищное кривое говно, собранное на коленке двумя студентами-индусами, не додумавшимся прикрутить к старому КФ-моду ничего, кроме ГРАФОНА, да ещё и мыльному.
