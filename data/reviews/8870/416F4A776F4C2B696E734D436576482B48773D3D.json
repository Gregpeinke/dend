I won't pretend that this is a complete review, since there are gaming websites for that, but I will try to avoid making any judgements that aren't backed up with something concrete. I'll have a short takeaway at the end, so feel free to skip to the end if a few paragraphs are too long for you.\n\nWhat is good about Bioshock Infinite is that it, like earlier Bioshock games, is dripping with environmental effects. The artistic detailing and the graphics engine that supports it makes for some stunning and beautiful scenes that can draw you into a fantasy world. On the gameplay side the combat system is varied enough that there are plenty of options for how you want to clear your way through the various areas. Between vigors, guns and Elizabeth based support options you don't feel limited in your style of FPS play. Elizabeth as a support character makes sure you never run out of ammo and also provides money while pointing out lockpicks you need to unlock optional bonus rooms that are a good source of powerups as you play through the game. \n\nThere are problems, however, with the way that this support feels excessive. You constantly receive ammo and money to the point that conserving ammo and tactical choices become less meaningful. There are also no bad choices; pulling out an extra dimensional chuck of rubble is always good for you or at least ambivilent. Similarly the game likes to give you small choices that don't seem to actually have any real impact. Because the game, despite allowing you to go back a few times to receive bonus powerups after finding a key, plays on a more linear track there are no options for dynamic choices. This ends up making a game that feels like it should be larger take up a scant 20 some hours of gameplay or so. As much as the environmental effects make the game world engaging, the track is so rigid there isn't enough time or space to actually fall in love with the world being made. It is like you get to see the world through a looking glass from one location, there should be more to see, but it is impossible to actually see it.\n\nI won't get into the racism and sexism aspects of this game, because there are plenty of strongly written articles out there that do the job well enough. Just be aware that the portrayal of women and non-white people in this series comes with serious problems that aren't justifiable under an artistic portrayal of a particular world. (Portraying a racist world is different than having racist portrayals of non-white people in that world).\n\nTLDR: It was fun, if short lived game, that suffers from some flaws that I wish weren't in the game for the sake of making a better experience and a longer one. I suspect the shortness of the game helps sell DLC's and therefore designing a more open world with dynamic choices would have made them less money...but that is neither here nor there so suffice it to say that especially at a discount the game is worth playing through once or twice.","timestamp_created":1388344520,"timestamp_updated":1388344520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511278212070465088","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8404365","author":{"steamid":"76561198017354335","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":810,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":792,"last_played":1388927968},"language":"russian","review":"сумасшедший сюжет","timestamp_created":1388343946,"timestamp_updated":1388343946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8404248","author":{"steamid":"76561198018385415","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":761,"last_played":1400794020},"language":"russian","review":"Просто шедевр.","timestamp_created":1388343721,"timestamp_updated":1388343721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8404237","author":{"steamid":"76561198061739760","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":471,"last_played":1606895756},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic story and great looking.

The Story is as you come to expect from the creators of Bioshock, you wander around a city for awhile trying to complete a goal that will lead you to the big twist at the end of the game. It was done very well because of the voice acting, pacing, writing, and its impact. \n\nHowever, the gameplay was extremely boring. First off, all you did was verse the same 2 enemy types that never change over the course of the 17 hour campaign. Then you have the vigors , which are explained in a cool way but are just various forms of stun that distract the enemy for about half a second. The Handymen  and the Motorized Patriots were sad attempts at trying to recreate the Big Daddy that didn't offer any reward. Next, you can only carry 2 weapons that never seem to have enough ammo and make you feel underpowered. Finally you can't carry salts or health packs, so when you run out you have to wait for Elizabeth to \"fetch\" you some. \n\nIf you like a good storybased game then i would recommand this game for you.
