Klasyk, do którego warto przysiąść oraz nadrobić go w wolnej chwili.\nZa śmieszne grosze, dostajemy solidny kawał mięcha, który rozpoczął rewolucję gatunku pierwszoosobowych strzelanek. \nNareszcie udało nam się wyzwolić od ciasnych, długich i mrocznych labiryntów, oraz naparzania w demonów czy szeregi nazistów na każdym kroku; bowiem małemu studiu z wielkimi ambicjami i zapałem, udało się wpleść prostą, niezwykle dopracowaną w formie prezentacji fabułę, a do tego opracować zupełnie nowy silnik fizyczny... i [b]Voilà[/b]!\n\nFabuła jest w porządku... jest spójna i w miarę logiczna, aczkolwiek dla niektórych może wydawać się nieco infantylna przez temat jaki porusza.\nLecz to nie sama fabuła czyni tutaj cuda, a sposób w jaki jest ona przedstawiana w trakcie postępu gracza.\nGrafika jak na swoje czasy była niezwykła. Osobiście nie jest dla mnie odpychająca; mamy doczynienia z tytułem, który ma na karku grubo ponad 20 lat. Można się tego spodziewać.\nGra stawia także na elementy platformówek oraz łamigłówki podczas kampanii, gdy akcja nabiera tempa. Dla mnie był to jeden z smaczków, który zachęcił mnie do dalszego zapoznania się z serią jak i całym gatunkiem.\n\n[h1]Według mnie; każdy gracz, niezależnie czy młody czy stary, powinien ograć pierwszego HL.[/h1]  [b]Polecam![/b]\nJeżeli jednak mocno preferujesz taktykę, nudzą cię sekcje platformowe i łamigłówki, bądź wizualia są dla ciebie najważniejszym z kryteriów... lepiej odpuść.","timestamp_created":1598229167,"timestamp_updated":1598229167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563557565212249756","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74805223","author":{"steamid":"76561199014646160","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1004,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1651405766},"language":"english","review":"I admit, this is probably one of the greatest games of all time, but it's in one of the most broken states I've ever seen of any game that got released by a big publisher.

I Hate The Stupid Tram Part and The akward Gravity and Platforming In XEN is pretty Annoying.

I would recommend disabling blood and gibs via the parental control in the options, as things can get rather violent at times. every chapter of the game has multiple mini-bosses which you have to fight using not only locations on the map (such as electro-frying a gargantua), but also cooking headcrabs, houndeyes, bullsquid, and everything under the sun with half life's weapons. even though the gravity gun didn't exist yet, and some today call this game's guns rudimentary, it's still impressive. even if you like modern graphics or better weapons, if you want to blast some HECU marines, aliens, or even your own allies, then spend some money and get ready to mind-blow your friends with this game!

only had this game for a couple days and it is amazing. the graphics look great for that time and it is really fun. the only gripe i have about it is the difficulty. yes i just started playing 2 days ago, but this game is genuinely hard. other than that, this is a great game and i recommend this to everyone with a steam account

It just didn't happen. It all started well, but I found myself using guides more often as I progressed through the game. Progression it's hard, sometimes due to graphics: some platforms or even creatures just don't look like you can stand on them. \nIt also pushes you somehow to take advantage of broken mechanics due to the difficulty of a few parts (more specifically, trying to avoid sliding all the way down that \"ramp\" and throw grenades like there's no tomorrow  at the Gonarch in the third stage. I tried to do it the right way, but even when I used video walkthroughs as a guide, most of them just used that same strategy.\nI've read some people saying combat in this game is better when you take a more tactical approach instead of just shooting everything that moves. But this is impossible to do the first time since enemies can LITERALLY spawn right behind you. You need to die several times and memorize all these spawning spots before you can think of a \"tactical\" approach that loses all meaning since you already know what enemies will do. \nI notice why this game is so special. It sure is incredible for its time, But maybe if will not be the best experience if you're trying this series for the first time. I'm gonna pospone Opposing force and Blue Shift for some time. And it will take a bit before I feel like playing Half Life 2.\n\nAgain: not a bad game. But maybe it's better for those who played it back in the day.","timestamp_created":1597984898,"timestamp_updated":1598037800,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74644173","author":{"steamid":"76561199055006626","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":4541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4151,"last_played":1654794526},"language":"english","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1597975055,"timestamp_updated":1597975055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qYmvh/QCfazfnAI="}
