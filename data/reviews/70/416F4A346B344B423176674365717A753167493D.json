They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you","timestamp_created":1617933790,"timestamp_updated":1617933790,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.436201781034469604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89973784","author":{"steamid":"76561198869077276","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":239,"last_played":1630084642},"language":"turkish","review":"1998'de √ßƒ±kmasƒ±na raƒümen bug√ºn bile kendini oynatƒ±yor","timestamp_created":1617924076,"timestamp_updated":1617924076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89973138","author":{"steamid":"76561198369865684","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":79,"playtime_forever":137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":129,"last_played":1627571290},"language":"english","review":"overrated game it's only useful for mods","timestamp_created":1617922977,"timestamp_updated":1617922977,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.334549874067306519","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89971334","author":{"steamid":"76561199017987798","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":24,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1660499656},"language":"english","review":"It's one of the most influential shooters of all time, and sure it's aged a little sloppily but I think it still continues DOOM and Quake's legacy into the first person shooters of today.","timestamp_created":1617919875,"timestamp_updated":1637880533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89969326","author":{"steamid":"76561198160571298","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3451,"last_played":1650145601},"language":"latam","review":"¬øQu√© se puede decir que no se haya dicho ya de uno de los pilares del g√©nero shooter?
