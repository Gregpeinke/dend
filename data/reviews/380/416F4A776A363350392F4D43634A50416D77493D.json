Прогремел сильный взрыв и, казалось, из-за него остановилось само время. Это конец? Господи, надеюсь мы дали шанс сопротивлению, мы сделали все что могли, это конец нашей истории. Всего лишь последний миг и такой большой поток мыслей в голове. Что? Кто это?! Снова он?! Неееет! Аликс! Вортигонты? Как им удалось?! Еще один шанс? – возможно где-то так думал в эти минуты Фримен, уж точно не о больших и сочных пончиках. Но, о чем бы он не думал, но продолжать спасать мир предстоит снова нам. И уж именно мы в ответе что произойдет дальше.\n\nЭпизод первый является сюжетным дополнением ко второй части. При прохождении она может показаться весьма короткой, но причиной этому является тот фак, что изначально разработчики планировали одну большую игру разбить на 3 эпизода, тем самым позволив им чаще давать контент игрокам. По мимо этого, как мы можем видеть, сравнивая HL2 и два эпизода, улучшать игровой движок и выпускать улучшенные версии игр. Что касаемо нововведений, то по геймплейной части их можно пересчитать по пальцам одной руки, новый зомби-противник, и мини оружие – перепрограммируемые мины. Основными же изменения стала графическая часть игры: HDR, улучшенная лицевая анимация и другие мелочи. В целом, это все тот же HL 2, а точнее, его сюжетное продолжение.\n\nСтоит ли вам покупать эту игру? Бессомненно да!

The game designer's plan is that the player should run from the enemy until he finds a powerful weapon at a specific spot and kills the enemy with it.  \nWell I managed to kill that enemy without fleeing and by using only the weapons I had at this moment .. Guess what happened? the game sent me another enemy of the exact same kind... Really annoying.  \nEventually I had no choice but to find the escape path the game designer wanted me to take. It took a lot of trial and error and deaths.\nAnd instead of being a dynamic action scene as probably intended by the designer, it was a succession of dying and reloading until I found the way I was supposed to do things and eventually killed the enemy from the intended spot with the intended weapon. And then no additional enemy came back and I could progress.\nIt felt forced and not enjoyable.\n  \nHaving known this stuff (and considering how the plot does not progress), I would have just skipped this episode.","timestamp_created":1597469796,"timestamp_updated":1597470020,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.45778229832649231","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74324848","author":{"steamid":"76561198208605243","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1597417690},"language":"english","review":"It's great, buy it if you haven't already","timestamp_created":1597458646,"timestamp_updated":1597458646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74318128","author":{"steamid":"76561198410798793","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1597288259},"language":"brazilian","review":"Assim como o jogo base, o Episode One manteve o nível de qualidade altíssimo. Mesmo sendo curtinho, não o impede de ser excelente.
