historia desde otra perspectiva.\n\nBueno quiero empezar esta reseña diciendo algo que le quita MUCHOS puntos a opposing force y blue shift Y ES...\nEL ERROR DEL MOUSE.Me refiero ala vista que se traba pero si no saben como resolver esto yo les explico rapido pero les voy a contar una muy breve historia:cuando yo compre el Half Life Opposing Force me salio este bug y yo queria un reembolso pero al final me jugue todo el juego asi y menos mal que no reseñaba pero HOY 05/10/2020 encontre la manera de arreglarlo y fue un alivio lo mismo con blue shift...Bueno despues de esto explico como arreglarlo si les paso.\n\nSOLUCION:\nvan a opciones y tocan la opcion de raton, tienen que cambiar la sensibilidad del mouse (Yo les recomiendo que lo pongan a 8.0) luego tienen que dejar en tic de bueno en estas opciones:\nVISTA DEL RATON\nRAW MOUSE INPUT \nEl resto de las opciones simplemente dejelas sin el tic (Osea no las activen).AH no ser que jueges en joystick\n\nLA RESEÑA EN SI.\nEl juego es muy entretenido, tiene la misma jugabilidad que el half life 1, antes de continuar les dijo que no supera al half life original.\nLa historia es curiosa y entretenida debido a que eres un militar y cambias de perspectiva talvez lo MAS interesante del juego son las nuevas armas y los nuevos monstruos.Tal vez el momento mas random del juego es el final boss que no se ustedes pero salio de la nada.Me gusta el cameo de Gordon Freeman saltando a Xen y que nos deja saber cuando pasa tal cosa y cuando la otra.Otra cosa que le resta muchos puntos a opposing force es la falta de suministros,me refiero al que juego no te ayuda tanto cuando tenes poca vida o balas (sobre todo vida en mi caso).La verdad esto -no me gusto para nada ya que el juego no ayuda al jugador en eso ademas que el juego NUNCA te da un respiro uno sale de un lugar y ya le estan esperando monstruos y otras cosas.Creo que los de Gearbox la hicieron muy mal ahy,ya que Valve era justo con las vidas y las balas y te daba respiros, aca Gearbox no.\nEN FIN\nMis reseñas son cortas y no tan bien explicadas pero creo que se entiende lo que quiero decir, es un juego entretenido este talvez sea la mejor expansion de las 3 (osea esta, Blue Shift y Decay), tiene como cualquier juego errores y es injusto en varias ocasiones.Es a grandes rasgos un juego nuevo y con una historia y jugabilidad exquisita y te la recomiendo plenamente si te gusto el half life\nCALIFICACION\n\nCalificacion:\nHalf Life Opposing Force:

Добавлено больше врагов которые на мой взгляд получились намного сильнее чем в оригинальной игре, да и вообще сама по себе эта часть хардкорная как не странно бы звучало. Добавлены и новые оружия - холодные оружия, (Но с ломом не сравнится ни что) с которыми на много интереснее играть чем в оригинал. Теперь за место фонарика у вас будет ночное видение, с которым в некоторых местах удобнее играть, а в некоторых местах и нет. Ну и самая вкусняшка заключается в том, что с вами, в нескольких моментах будут бегать и помогать ваши соратники. Неплохой подход к геймплею. В этом Gearbox Software отлично постарались.\n\nСюжетная линия тоже завораживает, но вот правда диалоги получились тупые. Постоянно слышишь нытье солдат, которые каждый раз повторяют: \"Нужно сваливать с этого места\", \"Забудьте о Фримене! У нас тяжёлые потери! Мы отступаем!\". Это немного меня настораживает. Ведь они солдаты, нытье оставлять должны при себе.\n\nДополнение получилось хорошим, чем то и лучше оригинала, но не более того. Пройти стоит если вы проходили первую часть, ну а если же и нет, то тоже стоит.

While the plot isn't exactly weak, it wouldn't hold up as well if it were a stand alone game rather than an expansion of Half-Life--[/i]\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\nThat being said, HL:OF is a great addition to the lore behind the Black Mesa Incident! I can say with confidence after playing Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force back-to-back that experiencing the Incident through the eyes of Shepard rather than Gordon was a delight.\n- I really enjoyed all the plot beats where you as the player are able to pinpoint where you would be as Gordon Freeman. [spoiler]Watching [strike]yourself[/strike] Gordon Freeman jump into the portal to Xen is just super cool, what else can I say.[/spoiler]\n- An aspect that was greatly improved upon from HL1 is [spoiler]G-Man's importance to the plot. With HL1, it's pretty easy to miss him when he appears. And when he does appear, it's either him watching Gordon or him walking around. With Opposing Force, the player is given clearer hints as to what G-Man's intentions are for Shepard. You know he is the [i]only[/i] reason Shepard is alive AND the only reason he remains at Black Mesa longer than he was supposed to. G-Man staring at you through the glass as you're left behind was amazing. Another great detail is him reactivating the Black-Ops bomb which pays off in the end for players who are able to catch that moment.[/spoiler]\n- Valve PLEASE [spoiler]release Adrian from his stasis helicopter, I'm begging you[/spoiler]\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIn terms of gameplay, it's generally the same as HL1 but I feel they improved on many smaller aspects that would go unnoticed to players who only played HL:OF rather than both HL1 and HL:OF.\n- I feel the devs realized how the flashlight in HL1 was lackluster due to it not being a fixed point on the screen and mended this by giving Shepard night-vision goggles, which are far superior to the HL1 flashlight.\nThe weapons are greatly expanded, my only gripe with them being the auto-aim feature. Unless I missed a menu option, there isn't a way to turn it off which is extremely frustrating when some weapons [strike]Desert Eagle[/strike] are virtually unusable due to the auto-aim's random inaccuracy.\n- The alien weapons are way more fun than they were in HL1. I used them A LOT more often than I did in HL1, which is probably due to to them feeling less finicky than they did before.\nI think the Barnacle grappling hook was a cool idea although navigating exactly where you want is pretty difficult and the concept felt pretty shoehorned in.\n- One of my favorite aspects gameplay-wise was the soldier NPCs. While they suffer from not-following-you-quickly-and-efficiently syndrome like every other NPC in this game, this didn't hinder their strengths as much as I expected. Going through certain sections of the game with them tagging along really felt like I was the leader of group. I was concerned with their well-being because they helped in tight firefights and made certain parts less intimidating.\n- The game felt more challenging than HL1 the further I went through the game. The new enemy types were great and it was fun seeing all the new Xen creatures and figuring out what they did.\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nRather than being a plane reskin of Half-Life 1, Half-Life Opposing Force offers an expanded Half-Life experience, both in plot and gameplay. If you enjoyed Half-Life 1, you'll definitely enjoy Opposing Force!","timestamp_created":1600425156,"timestamp_updated":1600425156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76154444","author":{"steamid":"76561197995081446","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1600061489},"language":"spanish","review":"En este juego, juegas en paralelo la historia de Half-Life con el soldado Shephard de la HECU.
