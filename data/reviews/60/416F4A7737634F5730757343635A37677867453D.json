Buy it on sale if you want, but otherwize don't spend 5$ on it.\n\nEh...\n\nThis game was never meant to be a big IP for Valve; it was just squirted out in a random Half-Life update back in 2000, and is really more of a simple experiment to see how easy it was to make a mod on the then-new Goldsrc engine. In light of this scenario, I judge this game only as a small, almost minigame you can buy for 49 pennies on sale. (5 US Dollars otherwise.)\n\nSome Valve games, like Half-Life, have an overarching story that progresses throughout its campaign and shapes itself according to the player's actions. Some Valve games, like Left 4 Dead, have an easily-explainable backstory that explains the events of the main game. In Ricochet, the story is, you are throwing discs at each other on floating platforms in space. There is no explanation, there is no exposition; but neither does there really need to be. You are simply throwing discs at each other on floating platforms in space. Nothing else needs to be said.\n\nThe game is fairly rudamentary, featuring less than a handful of multiplayer maps and only (AFAIK) two gameplay modes; good old-fashioned deathmatch, and arena, featuring two players facing off in a number of best-of rounds. The gameplay is simple yet engaging - all players are armed only with three regenerating discs used to knock each other off their platforms, usually meeting their dooms in a death screen you will see very, very often. You can also throw powered discs to decapitate opponents instead. Aside from a couple of disc power-ups, that's it. It is a very easy to learn game.\n\nAs far as multiplayer compatability is concerned in 2019, you can (usually) find at least one server with a couple of players on it for a quick game.\n\nUnless you really want it, however, I would suggest only purchasing it on sale.","timestamp_created":1562113634,"timestamp_updated":1562113634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53255400","author":{"steamid":"76561198417478449","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":134,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1566697039},"language":"turkish","review":"niye böyle bi oyun var hayır illa valvenin yaptığı eski oyunlardan biri diye beğenmem fln gerekmiyo :D","timestamp_created":1562108901,"timestamp_updated":1562108901,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.443718791007995605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53234574","author":{"steamid":"76561198808367806","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":91,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1617569390},"language":"english","review":"It's a pretty good game to be honest, I'm actually surprised people still play it!","timestamp_created":1562100435,"timestamp_updated":1562100435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53222262","author":{"steamid":"76561198292620373","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1501156194},"language":"russian","review":"хуйня полная","timestamp_created":1562096279,"timestamp_updated":1610316094,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577255427837371826","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53206275","author":{"steamid":"76561197997154522","num_games_owned":334,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":118,"last_played":1577894534},"language":"english","review":"Legend","timestamp_created":1562091078,"timestamp_updated":1562091078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53191753","author":{"steamid":"76561198090196297","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":15,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1561908693},"language":"english","review":"I want ricochet 2","timestamp_created":1562086614,"timestamp_updated":1562086614,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53184359","author":{"steamid":"76561198203643092","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":16,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1567244360},"language":"english","review":"Ricochet is a very unique game, with a great ideas and some fun gameplay.

The map you and the enemy fight in is confusing, its not like a normal map but it's a series of circular platforms and the way you navigate through out the map is by standing on arrows that will either take you to the next platform or bounce you to the upper platforms.\n\nThe game is actually pretty fun though I dunno what it is, but I kinda find the game eerie. The skybox is a dark and purple void with no music, and when you fall off the map, your camera will snap above you and start to spin faster and faster as your character screams as he disappears into the nothing.\n\nA big problem with the game is that it is dead. I was lucky to get a match with another player, so I recommend if you get this game, see if your friend will get it with you and play it together.","timestamp_created":1561995395,"timestamp_updated":1561995395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52836652","author":{"steamid":"76561198243915750","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1561886882},"language":"czech","review":"nostalgie :D dobrá hra co dodat","timestamp_created":1561984525,"timestamp_updated":1561984525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52799702","author":{"steamid":"76561198338786600","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1510665929},"language":"danish","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1561976502,"timestamp_updated":1561976502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52797957","author":{"steamid":"76561198272521421","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22,"last_played":1580591707},"language":"english","review":"this game is like a fever dream","timestamp_created":1561976120,"timestamp_updated":1561976120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52782243","author":{"steamid":"76561198126372859","num_games_owned":837,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1472014569},"language":"english","review":"a neat high fantasy adventure","timestamp_created":1561972479,"timestamp_updated":1561972479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52780593","author":{"steamid":"76561198276397563","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1611931822},"language":"russian","review":"Каво?!","timestamp_created":1561972079,"timestamp_updated":1561972079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52765983","author":{"steamid":"76561197988032445","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":91,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":91,"last_played":1561932379},"language":"english","review":"Doesn't matter how old this game is - it still holds up perfectly for a great run with friends on LAN.","timestamp_created":1561968306,"timestamp_updated":1561968306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52758967","author":{"steamid":"76561198163050623","num_games_owned":450,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1561997594},"language":"english","review":"Ricochet","timestamp_created":1561966285,"timestamp_updated":1561966285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52743309","author":{"steamid":"76561198138533683","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":43,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1561952852},"language":"english","review":"It's an alright game.

La solución es ir a opciones ---> Mouse ---> Activar Raw Mouse Imput.[/b] [/u]\n\nRicochet vio la luz como un mod de Half Life. Fue desarrollado por Valve y publicado el 1 de Noviembre del 2000.\nEs un juego FPS de estilo Deathmatch inspirado por viejos videojuegos arcade. Tomó como guía principal para su desarrollo a la película \"Tron\" y a su videojuego \"Discs of Tron\" (Juego arcade estrenado en 1983).\nEl objetivo del juego es ir saltando de una plataforma en otra lanzando discos a los rivales para hacerlos caer al vacío. Con el click izquierdo se lanza un disco recto, y con el derecho un disco potente que puede decapitar al rival que se tenga enfrente. Cada vez que caiga un enemigo, con un lanzamiento directo sumaremos un punto, y si hacemos rebotar el disco contra las paredes, dos puntos. Además, en Ricochet los discos pueden tener cinco poderes diferentes provenientes de un power-up que flota en el centro del mapa: \"power shot\", \"freeze shot\", \"fast shot\", \"triple shot\" y \"dragon's fury\".\nEste juego trae solo tres mapas para poder jugar: uno estilo arena y dos estilo deathmatch.\n\nLa verdad que no lo recomiendo. Una de las razones es porque la idea del videojuego no es original y, si bien es entendible que Valve haya querido basarse en un estilo de juego ya creado para aplicarlo en su producción, no termina de convencer la manera en que fue llevada a cabo para acompañar al videojuego y a lo que este quiere transmitir al jugador. Solo fue una idea que quedó estancada y nada más.\nOtro de los puntos criticables es que no contiene nada de música que acompañe al título.\nTambién considero que Ricochet es un desarrollo pésimo de Valve porque no hay personajes con carisma a quienes recordemos ni tampoco una historia, más que nada porque la empresa nos tiene acostumbrados a ese tipo de cosas en sus títulos. Somos un hombre que tiene que saltar en plataformas y tirar a sus rivales al vacío, idea antes vista en un videojuego de máquina arcade. Solamente es un juego para jugar con amigos y soltar alguna que otra risa por 1 hora o un poco más.\n\nSi lo desean comprar, que sea con el pack de Valve, pero sino pasenlo por alto.","timestamp_created":1561931208,"timestamp_updated":1562001763,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555555582046508789","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52617678","author":{"steamid":"76561198158198598","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1590355371},"language":"english","review":"BEST GAME EVER\nnow tbh i have only played 3 mins but it is way better than any other valve title, there is just so much gameplay potentiol you can jump on pads, you can push people ,you can jump on pads all around amazing game with a lifetime woth of play \n\n1/100","timestamp_created":1561930066,"timestamp_updated":1561930066,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52610144","author":{"steamid":"76561198080016502","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":16,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16,"last_played":1385546877},"language":"english","review":"This game poop.","timestamp_created":1561928945,"timestamp_updated":1561928945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52511870","author":{"steamid":"76561198167371867","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":94,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1559746257},"language":"turkish","review":"Zıpla abi parkur zamanı zıp zıp sevenler için nostajik bir oyun","timestamp_created":1561917096,"timestamp_updated":1561917096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52509221","author":{"steamid":"76561198415741790","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1561916629},"language":"russian","review":"Иконка красивая, и оптимизация ниче так, буду с друзьями по локалке играть.","timestamp_created":1561916654,"timestamp_updated":1561916654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567459404468536377","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52507632","author":{"steamid":"76561198280987073","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":394,"last_played":1652711263},"language":"english","review":"Yet again, Valve blesses us with the best game there was in history\neverything deserves 5/5\nperfection.","timestamp_created":1561916396,"timestamp_updated":1607881033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52482951","author":{"steamid":"76561198214467979","num_games_owned":403,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":434,"last_played":1636740812},"language":"turkish","review":"Her hafta yeni içerik geliyor çok güzel :d","timestamp_created":1561911880,"timestamp_updated":1561911880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52473925","author":{"steamid":"76561198843774405","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":35,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35,"last_played":1531993611},"language":"english","review":"One of the most memorable and fun game from my childhood days,\nhoping one day this game will get the reboot it deserved.","timestamp_created":1561910102,"timestamp_updated":1561910102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52411640","author":{"steamid":"76561198354192242","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":77,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1574068092},"language":"english","review":"Ok game, verry ded with no player base only bots.

Oh, this game is also great to practice your strafe skillz, good for all your Valve titles.
