Killing Floor has you holed up in a medium to large map surviving waves of zombies as you pick your class, weld doors and buy weapons from traders. The gameplay is great -- a lot of care was put into this game and it still shows years later. The player base ranges from godly to retarded. The graphics look dated, although weapons have an incredible level of detail to them. The sound effects are good, but the music is downright abysmal; it sounds like your 12 year-old next door neighbor's Nu-metal band practicing. Lastly, they have a few very inexpensive DLC available (nothing game-breaking, just character skins) which are very high quality if you're looking for some variation after a few dozen hours of gameplay.

Pick one of the seven player perks (you can change yours per wave) for bonuses to things like healing and damage done. Buy weapons that will help fend off the fuglies. Weapons are 'aligned' to perks and will be more effective when playing that specific perk!\n\nKilling Floor is regularly updated by Tripwire Interaction with new maps, weapons, achievements and player models in the holidays, to give people a reason to keep playing. At the core, KF is the same as it was upon Steam release, but that consistency along with the content updates are why people have been playing this non-stop! Join in the bloody fun and support your team online!\n\nKF is not a complicated game but there is plenty to learn about it, and to that end there are a whole bunch of guides to help you out with learning the fine details of the game mechanics. Never be afraid to ask questions either, as you knowing more about the game is a good thing for your team.\nIf you're going to purchase Killing Floor, try checking out a beginner's guide (like the one I'm working on!) and jumping in a low difficulty game with a friend to get acquainted with the game.\n\nNote: Your gameplay experience, as ever, varies depending on your playstyle and behaviour as well as that of other players you encounter. While there are many decent and nice players out there in public games, it's always recommended to play with at least one friend!\n\nBuy this...\n-If you like a little RPG element in your shooting games. \n-If you want a game where teamwork is key to victory. \n-If you prefer to play shooter games where you have to think a little. Not every perk/weapon combination is good and not everyone can take on all types of enemies. Sometimes you have to leave a specimen for your teammates or run, regroup and retry!\n-And if you like your 'horror' games to have more than the garden variety slow zombie in them.\n\nDon't buy this...\n-If you're expecting Left 4 Dead, there are some similarities (some of the clones may remind you of L4D's special infected) but where L4D is a fast-paced action shooter, KF tends to be based more on tactics and decision making, for example deciding who plays with which perk in the team and who takes on what role.\n-If you want to jump into higher difficulty games instantly. 'Zeds' (clones/specimens) on higher difficulties are tougher and more dangerous. To be able to take them on you need to put in the time to learn about the game and raise your perk levels!\n-If you want your wave survival games to only stop when you die for a high score. At the end of the game (4, 7 or 10 waves depending on the server setting) you will face a boss and either end up victorious or you will be killed.
