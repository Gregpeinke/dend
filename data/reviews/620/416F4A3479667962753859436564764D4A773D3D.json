With that knowledge in mind, we can answer a few key questions:\n\n1. Will it achieve the same level of originality as the first?\n2. Will it strike the player as equally as intriguing as the first?\n3. Will it offer a story as witty and wonderfully constructed as the first?\n4. Will it be as good as the first?\n\nIn my humble opinion the answer to these questions is as follows:\n\n1. It'll try.\n2. Yes-ish\n3. Sort of.\n4. Definitely not.\n\nThe fact is, Portal is the greatest video game ever created. There are simply too many wonderful things to say about the original game, and hardly anything negative to add. However, the sequel has made the mistake of giving plenty of negative things to mention. Too often does the player find themselves in a room of empty space. Grand, yes, and very open, sure. A wonderful showing-off of the Aperture Science labs, but lacking in motivation. It's not much fun to just walk around looking for the one place on the wall that's lit up and able to hold a portal. The game consists of too much, \"Where next?\" and not enough \"How do I get to there?\"\n\nThere is the added element of the gels, and this is a wonderful new feature that adds a whole new dimension to the gameplay. That being said; I found them to be a bit underused, not even being introduced until somewhere between half-way and three-quarters of the way through the game.\n\nThe story is great, don't get me wrong. Of course, it's pretty hard to mess up the perfection of the story the first game presented. I really enjoyed how, though the game was a sequel, the player was taken through history in order to answer the questions that led up to the events of the first game. In this way the sequel acts more like a prequel, and that's something that I think should be praised. Certainly the new cast of characters (specifically Wheatley) is worth mentioning, and they add a wonderful new level to the game as well. \n\nUltimately however, I feel like the first game was a happy accident. A side project that ended up being the greatest thing Valve has done. Whereas, with the sequel, they knew exactly what they were getting into. They knew that, no matter what, their creation would be met with great admiration and excitement. Quite frankly, there was no way Portal 2 could fail. Through a combination of (dare I say) over funding and over ambition, coupled with the knowledge that failure would not be a possibility, Portal 2 attempted to take Portal 1 to new heights....but instead falls a little short.\n\nStill, this is a Portal game, and that's enough for me.\n\nFour (and a half) Stars.","timestamp_created":1402519001,"timestamp_updated":1402528204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10429959","author":{"steamid":"76561198064854301","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1722,"last_played":1423228683},"language":"polish","review":"Świetna gra, pod każdym względem lepsza od swojej poprzedniczki\n\n*Dodany tryb kooperacji, zarówno ze swoimi znajomymi jak i z randomowymi ludzmi\n*O wiele dłuższa kampania dla jednego gracza\n*Możliwość grania w poziomy stworzone przez społeczność steam\n*Możliwość grania ze znajomym na poziomach społeczności\n*Możliwość tworzenia własnych poziomów\n*System czapek/gestów u naszych bohaterów\n*Świetne komentarze w każdej części gry\n\nPozdrawiam :)","timestamp_created":1402508733,"timestamp_updated":1402508733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10429874","author":{"steamid":"76561198131961527","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":22358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9676,"last_played":1619377180},"language":"english","review":"great game, not much replayablity in the base game but the level editor is nice","timestamp_created":1402508334,"timestamp_updated":1603228700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10429601","author":{"steamid":"76561198047848070","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":764,"last_played":1403954570},"language":"german","review":"Eigentlich würde ich das Spiel empfehlen , da es ein sehr spaßiges und vielseitiges Spiel ist, indem man oft Stunden lang an einem Level sitzt , weil einem die Lösung nicht einfällt , jedoch sobald man es dann geschafft hat ist es das schönste Gefühl aller Zeiten...

I just absolutely love this game.\nThe entire story was absolutely perfect. Portal 2 made me go on a turret collection and the characters; just loved them, every single one from Wheatley to Cave Johnson. Every. Single. One. Their personalities were made just perfectly even for their expressionless robotic appearence (although Wheatley had many expressions thanks to his robotic eyelids and blue orb). The voice acting was great and played with my emotions through out the entire game. GLaDOS and Wheatley made me laugh, cry, and hate with a burning passion.\nThere is even a Co-op version of this game, even though you and your partner may have difficulties when solving these tests; WHAT this Co-op experience does it that it tests HOW you and your partner get along in frustrating and difficult situations and WHY you have difficulties with eachother.\nSounds like a good therapy session, don't you think? \nI love this game.\nI loved how at first I saw the game as all science and nothing to do with what happened behind aperture, and what they kept behind all those A.I. machineries. Just playing through the whole thing and discovering the darker side of the Aperture Enrichment center literally stopped me from everything else; taking breaks to figure out WHAT happened, HOW it happened, and WHY it happened. The tests made me think more than anything, even more than an SOL would, and plus fun was added and 2x frustration into the thoughts. Puzzles are what this game gives and the storyline will make you think WHAT, HOW, and WHY all at once. I was fascinated by all Portal 2 provided and it even made me cry at some points but that's just me. Portal 2 made me want to play it over and over again so I could find what I could've missed and so far, since I also have it on Xbox360, I've played it only a total of 16 times. If you really want a game that makes you think and discover secrets and have a moronic yet hilarious companion who has a great and reassuring way of speaking (AKA someone like an A.I. named Wheatley) Then just get Portal 2 and play through the whole thing, play it over and over so you can find WHAT you could have missed, HOW you could find it, and WHY it means that much to you.\nThis is my first review but take my word for it and play this game.\nPortal 2 is FANTASTIC!","timestamp_created":1402247070,"timestamp_updated":1402247070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10396146","author":{"steamid":"76561198064439155","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1816,"last_played":1614369085},"language":"english","review":"I definitely recommend to play Portal 2.\n\nIt is an awesome and unique game!

En resumen, una buena iluminación y sombreado, buenas texturas, y unos shaders de detalle bastante logrado (10/10)\nJugabilidad: Este juego destaca sobre todo por su inmensa jugabilidad. Con el Dispositivo Portatil de Portales, con el que podemos hacer dos Portales (se entra por uno y se sale por el otro, facil mecanica de juego), y podemos usarlo para resolver puzlez, teniendo que aprovechar los elementos de nuestro entorno y las propias propiedades fisicas, le dan a este juego una amplia jugabilidad a la que le doy un (10/10).\nArgumento: El argumento esta tambien bastante logrado, aunque el juego no este centrado en el mismo totalmente, si no más en lo que viene a ser en la resolución de los puzzles impuestos por nuestra querida \"amiga\" GLaDOS. En mi opinión, podrian haberse centrado un poco más en el argumento, dando más detalles historicos de Aperture, e involucrandonos un poco más profundamente en todo lo que rodea a esta empresa, y a los experiemntos que hacen (como por ejemplo, ¿porque experimentan con el dispositivo de portales, con que fín? son preguntas que se me quedan en el tintero). (7.5/10)\nMultijugador: Tambien bastante logrado, el modo cooperativo añade mucha más versatibilidad a la jugabilidad de este título, ya que necesitamos usar en algunos puzzles hasta los 4 portales, y tendremos que jugar con una cooperación tanto cronologica como espacial, para poder superar puzzles. (9.5/10)\nPor ultimo decir que la posibilidad que nos da el juego de crear nuestras camaras y de jugar las de los demas, hacen que este juego sea prácticamente infinito, y nos permita poder jugarlo y disfrutarlo mucho más alla del modo historia y cooperatico.
