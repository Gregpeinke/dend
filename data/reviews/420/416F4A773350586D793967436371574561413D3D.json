The combination of visual aesthetics and aural details immerse you. This is probably the biggest detail I don't see talked about enough.\n\n-Combat: Every weapon connects very well and gives you solid feedback which makes the firefights feel fluid and dynamic. The big selection of weapons lets you decide how you want to play.\n\n-Movement: As in every Valve game, the movement is very flowing. The ease of jumping and sprinting make the movement feel more controlled than in most games.\n\nThe Half-Life series is my favorite and I hope you consider these notes to play this game!","timestamp_created":1480036506,"timestamp_updated":1480036506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27356467","author":{"steamid":"76561198139994108","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":337,"last_played":1467852356},"language":"english","review":"Game that deserves a sequel yada yada","timestamp_created":1480035653,"timestamp_updated":1480035653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27356065","author":{"steamid":"76561198144657692","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":773,"last_played":1637765567},"language":"spanish","review":"Ese final me tiene impactado 2 años despues de haberlo jugado","timestamp_created":1480035450,"timestamp_updated":1480035450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27356023","author":{"steamid":"76561198133793886","num_games_owned":508,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1582404522},"language":"spanish","review":"Half-Life 2: Episode Two nominado para:\n\"GAME THAT DESERVES A SEQUEL \"","timestamp_created":1480035434,"timestamp_updated":1511408715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":33,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.768223941326141357","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27355027","author":{"steamid":"76561198056279804","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":90,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":90,"last_played":1541049117},"language":"english","review":"it needs a sequel","timestamp_created":1480034927,"timestamp_updated":1480034927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27354673","author":{"steamid":"76561198004957767","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":294,"last_played":1427633715},"language":"tchinese","review":"GAME THAT DESERVES A SEQUEL\n\n所以我說那個續集呢？","timestamp_created":1480034753,"timestamp_updated":1480034753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27354539","author":{"steamid":"76561198074115452","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":367,"last_played":1406041129},"language":"english","review":"half life 3 pls","timestamp_created":1480034691,"timestamp_updated":1480034691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27353380","author":{"steamid":"76561198074203076","num_games_owned":314,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":474,"last_played":1484168521},"language":"spanish","review":"El episodio dos.
