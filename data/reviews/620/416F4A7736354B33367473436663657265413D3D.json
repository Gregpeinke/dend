For starters, do not do like me. Despite being a puzzle game, the story behind the game is at least as compelling as the adrenaline rush of solving that new puzzle, and this game is packed full of references to the first game of the franchise. So, save some time if you have never played the first game and go play it, then return here. Leave this review paused in the background.\n\nSo the story... yeah, it's awesome. Full of twists, very, very funny. And the voice acting? Probably the best I've seen in a game. I admit I was always waiting for the lines from some of the characters, and sometimes I would just stop playing just to listen to all of it.\n\nThe game is not young and it runs in a even older engine, but the visuals are still sharp. You can spot bad textures here and there, and probably nothing shines from today's standards but you will have the general feeling of quality, and the game has no reasons to be ashamed.\n\n2 – GAMEPLAY\n\nHow do you play this? You have a portal gun that... shoots portals. It sounds strange but it's quite clever actually, and after the first 2 or 3 puzzles you can handle the mechanics perfectly. Valve introduces new mechanics regularly, like bouncing gel, or speed gel, or cubes or lasers. It's a very intelligent way of keeping the game fresh and interesting. You never feel overwhelmed with mechanics since you will learn them one at a time.\n\nAll the levels are very fair. You can start by looking to a chamber and thinking that there's no way you can solve that puzzle, but then you start to do something, and gradually the solution will come, and that's very rewarding. I admit I've never got that feeling of being intelligent but the opposite. Most likely I ended up thinking that the solution was very simple, it was just hidden in plain sight. And that's another positive aspect of the game.\n\nYou have a co-op mode where you can play with other player to solve problems with the double of the portals. I've never could progress much in that mode since all the players logged of one or two puzzles after starting.\n\nBut the campaign alone is enough to buy this game, and you will still have tons of fun, even considering that the replay value is not high, at least for me.\n\n3 – CONCLUSION\n\nThis game totally worth the pricetag. You have story, narrative, gameplay, co-op, scy-fi, puzzles and very fun moments in the same game. This is probably one of the best games I've ever played, and ofc I recommend it!\n\nAs usual, some gameplay:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RFrEERdPpuA","timestamp_created":1494116960,"timestamp_updated":1494116960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31592874","author":{"steamid":"76561198208819600","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":657,"last_played":1532224474},"language":"spanish","review":"Simplemente hermoso!!! :)","timestamp_created":1494116543,"timestamp_updated":1494116595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31590792","author":{"steamid":"76561198353841297","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":821,"last_played":1619765045},"language":"english","review":"really worth every cent","timestamp_created":1494107335,"timestamp_updated":1494107335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31587279","author":{"steamid":"76561198166120616","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":765,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":698,"last_played":1643716234},"language":"koreana","review":"gg","timestamp_created":1494095772,"timestamp_updated":1494095772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31584551","author":{"steamid":"76561198032304250","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":2858,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2848,"last_played":1489861337},"language":"english","review":"i don't know how many times i got through the campaing, each time with stupid chalanges","timestamp_created":1494087652,"timestamp_updated":1494087652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31583815","author":{"steamid":"76561198095022362","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1935,"last_played":1542831633},"language":"spanish","review":"ta bien","timestamp_created":1494085631,"timestamp_updated":1658887237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31583305","author":{"steamid":"76561198182705170","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":1544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1023,"last_played":1564589480},"language":"russian","review":"Как не странно GLaDOS не погибла, а всего лишь ушла в сон.
