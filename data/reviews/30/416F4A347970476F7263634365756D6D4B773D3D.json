The gameplay is fun, gun damage accurate and maps are cool. I got this game for free with Counter Strike 1.6 so that is always a plus. This game is set in the World War 2 setting and so the maps, teams and guns match this theme. Not really special but for sure cool multiplayer with a variety of WW2 weapons. Though I haven't played that much this seems like a cool old-school type of multiplayer game and I'd recommend it.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1417911566,"timestamp_updated":1495267066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526499032974243164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13260315","author":{"steamid":"76561197974601388","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":402,"last_played":1423574869},"language":"german","review":"es ist ein klassiker aber immer noch TOP","timestamp_created":1417908833,"timestamp_updated":1417908833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600121140480041504","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13232994","author":{"steamid":"76561198158009142","num_games_owned":757,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":18,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1417783572},"language":"danish","review":"2/5","timestamp_created":1417740913,"timestamp_updated":1417740913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13223029","author":{"steamid":"76561198083732711","num_games_owned":449,"num_reviews":148,"playtime_forever":137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59,"last_played":1494252120},"language":"russian","review":"Я эту игру не купил пока я не ушёл на каникулы с друзьями.

Better late than never, especially with Day of Defeat!\nThis game is like wine! It's a bit old, it may even be a little ugly in some areas, but Day of Defeat is still one of the best online FPS games on Steam. Unlike other Gold Source games like CS 1.6 and Half-Life, DoD is a realistic and terrifyingly ambient take on the close quarters combat scenarios of the second World War. The game is dark and somewhat nerve-wracking; buildings are smothered to rubble, the cities are dark and shaded, and the sounds of the war are all around. The realism of the weaponry gives the player a greater sense of responsibility as each class has a specific role. Things such as muzzle flashes, footsteps, reloading, squad commands, and changing weapons makes a sound that must be considered when operating on the battlefield. Needless to say, Day of Defeat is a game everyone needs in their library! \n\nDoD is not so realistic as to have an almost \"cheesy\" outward appearance (like Red Orchestra), but it is not your average FPS online shooter - no \"jump shotting\", \"quick scoping\", \"'nade spamming\", etc. - Day of Defeat relies on the seriousness of the player, and the cohesiveness of the team. \n\nIf you are used to playing Day of Defeat: Source, I would suggest buying DoD Original as there are a lot of things this game has that DoD:S does not: more weaponry, ambient maps, gameplay opportunities, and the ability to play as the Royal Army. \n\nGENRE: 10/10\nATMOSPHERE: 9/10\nFUN/THRILL: 9/10\nREPLAYABILITY: 8/10\nGAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: 9/10\nOVERALL: 93/100","timestamp_created":1416214977,"timestamp_updated":1416215400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12979333","author":{"steamid":"76561197977654452","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1107,"last_played":1378895855},"language":"english","review":"This game is pretty fun ! :D If you're into fps-games","timestamp_created":1416214095,"timestamp_updated":1416214095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12974340","author":{"steamid":"76561198079459449","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":388,"last_played":1489340157},"language":"english","review":"Better than the newer one and I look like the Nazis","timestamp_created":1416174092,"timestamp_updated":1416174092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12940465","author":{"steamid":"76561198141790091","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":152,"last_played":1416756614},"language":"russian","review":"Осторожно,задр*ты!

Capturing points is not the only gamemode, but most played, if not only one, around. You could get betas of the game for free as mods for Half-Life 1, but the final versions were released as paid Retail product by Valve. And as you can see, it got on Steam too.\n\nFirst thing first, since it's a multiplayer title... How is community of this old game? It's doing well! It may not have overwhelming amount of players, but you will always find few almost-full servers. And while dod_avalanche map appears to be favourite among the community, you still will get to enjoy some maps variety on various servers. Not so much on game type variety though, capturing the flags points is most played.\n\nAs said, Day of Defeat is a WW2 shooter. Team and class based. A mix between arcade and realism. Weapons are as deadly as in many such shooters, just having single person rush forward will do no good, should do that in team. Many weapons also have big recoil, which depends on your stance: moving, standing, crouching or prone. Being prone is the slowest and clunkiest, easy to hit from above, but harder from long distances, also giving character almost no recoil when shooting. Yes, camping is a viable strategy here, but I feel that I have more chance to break through camping than in, say, Counter-strike. Players can respawn any time, so putting yourself to risk isn't bad idea. Each character also have a stamina, which is used when you spring and jump, slowly recovering afterwards. The slowing effect after using it is quite punishing, so you should sprint from cover to cover. Don't use sprint when moving to the front from the spawn point.\nMaps are designed to be more of pipes, like classic maps, not open fields, providing a main path and few flanking routes. Even more curious, the maps are assymetrical, which may possibly provide some inbalance (I think that Nazis in Avalanche map have height advantage). Breaks the usual symmetry monotony though, more interesting. Some maps even feature British forces instead of American ones. (they have less classes though)\nNo, this one doesn't have vehicles, it is not Battlefield after all. \n\nEach team has up to 10 classes. The only difference most have is primary weapon and whether they have or not grenades to spam at corners and choke points. None have ironsight, if you wonder, aside from scope for sniper rifles. And most of primary weapons tend to be quite similiar to each other, which I don't like, as I prefer classes to be more diverce... something what Day Of Defeat Source did. Classes can be divided into:\n1) Close Range Assault classes - have guns with light recoil, good for running and gunning, and then getting one-hit killed by another rushing rifleman.\n2) Assault Support classes - more recoil, medium range, they better occasionally crouch or stand to be able to litter enemies with bullets at close range.\nClose range and Support get mixed a bit together, making other classes.\n3) Riflemans - Killing mens with one bullet per few seconds, medium-long range class. Well, and short one too. Only bad when rushed by few mens. Just crouch occasionally\n4) Machine Gunners - limited, they can deploy their machine gun on sandbags or while prone. Their machine gun allows them to give your team control over area. Just watch out for snipers and grenade spam. No grenades.\n5) Snipers - not really much of different from Rifleman, just got scope and more accurate while scoped. No grenades though.\n6) Bazooka - You got rocket launcher. And if you imagine infantry going \"whee\" from rocket - too bad. It's a utility weapon, which only very few maps have use for, like blowing tank in some map (that I didn't get to play in public servers yet). Very annoying whenever Random keeps giving you this class.\n\nThe graphics technically are quite outdated, but still provide it's own quirk. The music is almost non-existing. Only main theme and victory tunes are there.\n\nSo, nice game, especially when measured with other HL1 mods. Still fun and still has active multiplayer.
