The gameplay is certainly subpar, with lots of elements removed from previous titles. There is a nicely large variety of weapons, but this is completely undermined by the utterly unnecessary two weapons limit, which serves only to stifle player choice and undermine the upgrade system as well. Enemy variation isn't much to write home about. The regenerating shield is the first time that regenerating health has been tried in this series, and unfortunately really hurts the combat, since it makes cowering behind boxes and popping out to fire one of the most effective combat tactics. Also the only boss fights which occur in this game are terrible. Not just hard, but horribly designed: infinitely respawning enemies, limited weapons and a bullet sponge boss, with money deducted and enemy health restored every time you die.\n\nThe story starts off quite strongly, although as more of the plot is revealed, plot holes spring up all over the place and the conclusion is confusing, rife with its own plot holes and unsatisfying. The world is also poorly constructed, with the player murdering hundreds of innocent people for the crime of being law enforcement officers, then continuing to have normal conversations with Elizabeth, making Booker seem completely insane. Vigors are an adapation of plasmids from earlier games, but while plasmids were integral to the plot in Bioshock, vigors are very much an afterthought, with basically no bearing on how the city operates.\n\nElizabeth as a character is confusing. She has spent her whole life locked up in a tower, yet seems to be normally socially adjusted, which seems unusual. As a gameplay element, she is strangely shoehorned in. She cannot be injured or captured by enemies, who will completely ignore her, and can occasionally \"find\" ammo, health or salt (vigor power) around the battlefield, although these are not available through standard searching, only through Elizabeth. Her addition to gameplay is redundant, and only serves as an excuse for poor design in terms of ammo.\n\nVisual design is fantastic, but there is little else to recommend about this short game, especially replay value. Don't buy it.","timestamp_created":1385712967,"timestamp_updated":1385712967,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454428553581237793","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7819938","author":{"steamid":"76561197979927213","num_games_owned":223,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1282,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1282,"last_played":1385756463},"language":"english","review":"So so good.

It's presented in a way that doesn't overly confuse the player and when it hits, it hits hard. It tells a tale that mixes elements of both fantasy and science fiction that hasn't really been done in this fashion before. The art direction is stunning and you get a real feeling of place in the world, thanks to the smaller details and liveliness of your surrondings. The soundtrack swells during emotional moments, helping to drive home the fact that the story is not only a mentally stimulating one, but one that can still manage to pull at your heart strings from time to time. It boils into a loud, bombastic clash of strings and percussion instruments that is very reminiscent of Stanley Kubriks \"The Shining\". The major fault of this game is that if your looking for a game with strong gameplay, enough so that it can carry you through it on its own, you might be dissapointed. The gameplay lacks any kind of depth or complexity and while this is probably done to give the player's mind a rest after the more logically complex moments of the story present themselves, it is still only a mindless shooter with gimmicky, if fun, elements tossed into the mix. The skyhooks and elizabeth's tear powers do add complexity, but little do they help to make the player think in battle. The vigors are much less a carefully chosen set of skills the player has with them to deal with specific tasks, as much as they are general use and really used as either stuns, Area of Effect, or damage utilities. While this may sound bad, believe me when I say that Bioshock Infinite is truly a marvelous experience, worth the money and time, just not as good of a game. Certainly better gameplay than Call of Duty, but the quality of the game itself does not stack up to the quality set forth by the rest of the package.

Bioshock Infinite. First, people loved it, then they kinda didn't and now everyone I ask is more or less indifferent about it.\n\nTruth be told, I still really like Infinite. I see the game as a sort of antithesis to the Bioshock ethos, both ludic and narratively. The original Bioshock was a game about great Ideals, A game whose hyperviolent Aesthetics and binary moral-chioce system actually reflected the world you were interacting with. A game that made giant metal beasts with drillheads for arms and superpower-granting syringes seem like plausible things in the context of your surroundings.\n\nBioshock Infinite is all of that too. And it is also not.\n\nThis discrepancy is felt in every moment of the game and it can ruin your entire experience. Vigors (Columbia's spin on Plasmoids) feel entirely out of place. Almost no character in the entire game seems to act rationally. The level design is predictable and formulaic, albeit nicely done. Meanwhile, the Big-Daddy-replacing handymen are frightening at first but quickly become glorified meatsponges as the game progresses. The final battle is a tedious and frustrating endurance test that made me stop playing for almost a week. And yet, I still feel like these things are justified in a certain way.\n\nI won't spoil the game, but I will give you my 2 cents on Infinite's Storyline: If you feel like the plot is going to collapse on it self, let it. That is all I'm saying.","timestamp_created":1385678654,"timestamp_updated":1385678654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7814436","author":{"steamid":"76561198006210523","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":171,"playtime_forever":1267,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1046,"last_played":1476440290},"language":"italian","review":"Un FPS sontuoso: bello da vedere e divertente da giocare!","timestamp_created":1385677742,"timestamp_updated":1385677742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7813583","author":{"steamid":"76561198041691089","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1152,"last_played":1381425369},"language":"english","review":"Yes","timestamp_created":1385674363,"timestamp_updated":1385674363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7813460","author":{"steamid":"76561198001136236","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":6288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5463,"last_played":1410734316},"language":"english","review":"This is a fantastic lead off from bioshock and has small ties to bioshock 2 which was a crushing defeat as far as starting concept goes.

You get a few chances to take to the clouds, but I really wished there was more emphasis on living in the sky and was hoping for more air fights. At many points in turns into a call of duty duck and cover til you win strategy type of game.
