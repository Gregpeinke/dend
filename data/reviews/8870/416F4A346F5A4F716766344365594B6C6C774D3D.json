A jogabilidade está melhor, menos travada, mas como o arsenal de armas aumentou, e aumentou MUITO, você quase não usa plasmideos, que aliás, sofreram um GRANDE nerf se comparado com os dos outros games. O positivo de Infinite é sim sua protagonista Elizabeth. Não, Booker não é o protagonista, você pode até jogar com ele, mas quem rouba a cena é definitivamente Elizabeth. Ainda mais com a DLC \"Bureal at Sea\", que fecha não só Infinite (meio que salva o game, porque a DLC é melhor que o game principal, tanto em história quando em uso dos plasmideos, que finalmente são uteis) mas fecha a trilogia perfeitamente, com chave de ouro e um final lindo e triste. Então se for comprar Infinite, e ainda mais, for jogar a DLC, recomendo comprar o pacote completo, os 3 games + as DLCs.","timestamp_created":1640831178,"timestamp_updated":1640899944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106868884","author":{"steamid":"76561198980026911","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1645481299},"language":"english","review":"2k","timestamp_created":1640826757,"timestamp_updated":1640826757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106865670","author":{"steamid":"76561198115912593","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1024,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":981,"last_played":1640827198},"language":"brazilian","review":"Esse jogo consegue se destacar até mesmo nos dias atuais, seja pelo seu roteiro bem desenvolvido, que constantemente trás reviravoltas e referências a antigos jogos ou pela sua direção de arte e gameplay variada que faz com que o jogo não envelheça sequer um dia.

It's a great FPS game with great soundtrack, detailed textures and an absolutely amazing world to explore as well as a very intriguing (and somewhat complicated) story at that. But let's not pretend it's perfect. Unlike Bioshock and Bioshock 2, which are two of my most favorite FPS games ever, Infinite just didn't click with me as much as they did. The first two games had a much darker story with a lot of amazing characters (Ryan, Lamb, Tenenbaum...), let's not forget about the Big Daddies and the Little Sisters concept which made \"Bioshock\" the game. However, Bioshock Infinite definitely has its moments, and its unique story really conveyed a shocking twist when you figure everything out; it blew my mind for the most part. There were a few plot holes for sure, which didn't affect the story that much in my opinion but I think the Burial At Sea DLC made it worse, so basically if you didn't understand the ending of the main game and played those two episodes in the hopes of getting your questions answered, you'll only be more confused, but the DLC is still worth playing just for the sake of going back to Rapture. I actually think that the developpers did a great job making the connection between Rapture and Columbia. Overall, Bioshock Infinite is a hell of an FPS game to play and that alone is enough to try it out. In other words, if you want to enjoy it as much as you can, be patient, read between the lines and just let it tell you its story. Highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1640814392,"timestamp_updated":1640814769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":61,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.81207352876663208","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106854752","author":{"steamid":"76561198381204831","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1089,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1089,"last_played":1640812961},"language":"brazilian","review":"quase chorei","timestamp_created":1640813013,"timestamp_updated":1640813013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106854145","author":{"steamid":"76561199077203538","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1654724627},"language":"brazilian","review":"simplesmente sensacional","timestamp_created":1640812502,"timestamp_updated":1640812502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"106846764","author":{"steamid":"76561198381180330","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1115,"last_played":1640802210},"language":"english","review":"Elizabeth is the best companion of the decade.
