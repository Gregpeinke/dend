4 Dead - это классический survival-horror по сюжету которого США поразил неизвестный смертельный вирус, вызывающий у зараженных бешенство и мутации, превращая их в страшных монстров. Вирус быстро распространился в некоторых штатах и власти начали эвакуацию еще не зараженных людей. Четверо главных героев (именуемых Выжившими), обладающих иммунитетом к вирусу, не успели эвакуироваться и теперь им предстоит спастись из окружения мутантов.\n\nВ основе игрового процесса лежит борьба Выживших с толпами Зараженных, с целью эвакуации из зараженной зоны. В каждой кампании есть несколько уровней, при прохождении которых Выжившие смогут эвакуироваться из зараженной зоны.\n\nВ игре присутствует искусственный интеллект, называемый Режиссёром. Режиссер влияет на игровой процесс, подстраиваясь под уровень мастерства игроков. Он меняет места и частоту появления Зараженных, а так же на их количество. Благодаря Режиссеру каждое прохождение игры станет уникальным и неповторимым.\n\nТак же в Left 4 Dead присутствует четыре игровых режима: Сражение, Выживание, Одиночная игра и Кооператив.","timestamp_created":1462716845,"timestamp_updated":1462716845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487804889678955078","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22861905","author":{"steamid":"76561198297403444","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":86,"last_played":1517351213},"language":"brazilian","review":"otimo","timestamp_created":1462709235,"timestamp_updated":1462709235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22861878","author":{"steamid":"76561198269492547","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":33947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33926,"last_played":1638082436},"language":"russian","review":"лучше быть не может","timestamp_created":1462709108,"timestamp_updated":1638080536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22860050","author":{"steamid":"76561198202145349","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":388,"last_played":1463448556},"language":"english","review":"   -","timestamp_created":1462700943,"timestamp_updated":1462700943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22855212","author":{"steamid":"76561198017138733","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":111,"last_played":1434568509},"language":"spanish","review":"Genial juego cooperativo de 4 jugadores y mas jugadores, y en modo versus , podras pasar horas y horas ! recomiendo que solo compren el left four dead 2 ya que no hay tanta gente on line en este juego y el 2 trae la mismas campañas que el 1 incluidas.","timestamp_created":1462673772,"timestamp_updated":1462673772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22853326","author":{"steamid":"76561198053988672","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":147,"last_played":1475702471},"language":"english","review":"surprisingly fun","timestamp_created":1462662966,"timestamp_updated":1462662966,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr7XgxtQCfuyWVw=="}
