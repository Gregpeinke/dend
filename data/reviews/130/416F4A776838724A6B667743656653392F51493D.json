It is the second expansion to be released for the main game, with Opposing Force coming 2 years before. Blue Shift stars Barney Calhoun as the protagonist, offering yet another perspective during the events of Half-Life, but from a security guards' eyes. The story takes Barney throughout alien-infested facilities as he fights off both aliens and the military on his quest to escape the Black Mesa Research Facility.\n\n[b]Blue Shift- An expansion with little new to offer[/b]\nThere isn't anything new in this expansion besides the new maps to traverse and Barney's adventure, which is a shame since Opposing Force introduced plenty of new features that added a lot to that game. There's no unique weapons or enemies to be found in this game. [spoiler]There's not even a final boss (or \"bosses\" in general), which makes for an anticlimactic finale.[/spoiler]\nThat's not all, either. Blue Shift is only around 3 hours long! That's even shorter than Opposing Force's campaign, which was about 5 hours long. \nThe experience wasn't bad, though. I found myself enjoying Blue Shift's story, I liked the references to Half-Life and Opposing Force, and I had fun playing through the game as Barney.\n\n[b]Rating: A shift with little impact[/b]\nI'd give this game a 6/10. Blue Shift has a campaign that's worth returning to the world of Half-Life for, but it doesn't add as much as Opposing Force did, making Blue Shift the weaker Half-Life expansion.","timestamp_created":1634810328,"timestamp_updated":1634903958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101368888","author":{"steamid":"76561198060650120","num_games_owned":271,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5751,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5751,"last_played":1389429419},"language":"english","review":"listen, the only reason I have this many hours in this game is cuz I left it open over a weekend by accident.","timestamp_created":1634778487,"timestamp_updated":1634778487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101362728","author":{"steamid":"76561198354431054","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":387,"last_played":1634766017},"language":"english","review":"Bit short compared to Opposing Force, but is still a must-play for Half-Life fans as Big Barney kicks arse (No wonder he was brought back for Half-Life 2).","timestamp_created":1634766162,"timestamp_updated":1634766162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548901975154876709","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101352206","author":{"steamid":"76561198809308852","num_games_owned":569,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1628946867},"language":"turkish","review":".","timestamp_created":1634750025,"timestamp_updated":1634750025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101347943","author":{"steamid":"76561198050237511","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":147,"playtime_forever":669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1634787661},"language":"latam","review":"Así como Opposing Force, Blue Shift no aporta nada sustancial a la trama.
