The game that put VALVe on the map, Half-Life is still a blast to play. I love the survival-horror feel of this game, which HL2 sort of lacked (aside from Ravenholm), and the massive arsenal Freeman builds up throughout his journey. As well, the enemies you meet are more varied (who can forget the Blast Pit sequence and first encounter with the Garg). While the source remake Black Mesa is great too, nothing beats the original (nostalgia might be something to do with that). It's outdated for sure (jumping puzzles, platforming, blocky graphics) but don't let that stop you from playing one of the best action games out there.","timestamp_created":1418715521,"timestamp_updated":1418715521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13381191","author":{"steamid":"76561198059630159","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1564748157},"language":"italian","review":"Good Game!","timestamp_created":1418668890,"timestamp_updated":1418668890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502881050109863281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13379169","author":{"steamid":"76561198068641773","num_games_owned":305,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":854,"last_played":1613407281},"language":"english","review":"get as many half lifes as you want, but you aint getting just 3","timestamp_created":1418659798,"timestamp_updated":1418997512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":17,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492402732372283936","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13379128","author":{"steamid":"76561198035000398","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5349,"last_played":1571630058},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom, pra quando nao ter nada pra fazer","timestamp_created":1418659625,"timestamp_updated":1418659625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13372402","author":{"steamid":"76561198150063017","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1530217495},"language":"english","review":"Half Life is and will always will be the greatest FPS in history.

And Half-Life IS fun, Its got a wide and diverse range of weapons and enemies (as well as some cool bosses) and some brilliant AI that still impresses me today.\n\nBut what really makes Half-Life a really stand out game is what it does that is different. Rather then going the way of a metal gear solid game valve opted for a really interesting minimal storytelling approach in which everything is witnessed through the gameplay, there are no cutscenes of any kind. The less is more approach works and instead of long pieces of poorly written dialogue the game lets you observe first hand the chaos and destruction in the aftermath of the Black Mesa Incident. It works and the atmosphere feels like the aftermath of some kind of horrible and ongoing disaster like a huricane or a Nuclear blast In which you must fight for your life throughout the game to escape.\n\nRather than explain everything to you Half-Life will show you a lot of things or occasionaly say things that may confuse you. This is because you are just one man and its impossible for you to comprehend the big picture, you are small and insignificant in this grand scheme going on and while you get vague hints throughout the game as to this bigger picture the game leaves you guessing which gives the game a large sense of a forboding and sinister mystery .\n\nThis game is built on atmosphere and while the graphics have aged a lot, it is still a breath taking experiance to witness the disaster and destruction of Black Mesa. The sounds and music are top notch and aid with this of course.\n\nIf you are one of the few people who has not played Half-Life yet I really suggest that you get around to it, you wont just have fun but I think It will probably influence your opinion on how Video Game stories and atmosphere should be handled in relation to gameplay.","timestamp_created":1418008077,"timestamp_updated":1418008113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.615560650825500488","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13277682","author":{"steamid":"76561198054960040","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":454,"last_played":1419629782},"language":"english","review":"I only got this game because it was on sale and I have always heard so much about it.

Starting with a crowbar and ending with a laser, you will shoot your way through Black Mesa, solving simple puzzles and navigating sometimes complex coridoors.\n\nThe plot is simple yet effective, as is the gameplay. Overall, a very satisfying game, and worth checking out regardless of reviews, due to its impact.","timestamp_created":1417846019,"timestamp_updated":1417846019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537892818450927734","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13247033","author":{"steamid":"76561198097839210","num_games_owned":357,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":866,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":686,"last_played":1533955063},"language":"english","review":"For being from 1998, wow, just wow.

Да и сейчас в него стоит поиграть не только для ознакомления, но и ради развлечения и много других причин. Сюжетная часть здесь стоит не на первом месте, но зато проста для понимания. Вы - физик Гордон Фримен, которой стал причиной страшной аварии, в ходе которой был открыт портал в параллельный мир, наполненный страшными существами, которые незамедлительно ворвались в наш мир и в быстром порядке захватили исследовательский комплекс \"Чёрная меза\". Начался ад. Существа уничтожили практически весь персонал, а те, кто сумел миновать их \"зубы и когти\", были расстреляны солдатами-чистильщиками. Повсюду трупы, кровь на стенах, следы разрушения, и страх. Страх того, что за углом может оказаться какая нибудь тварь (или твари), а патроны не бесконечные. Страх того, что вы в любой момент можете оказаться в смертельной ловушке, шанс выбраться их которой практически близок к нулю.\n\nПо сути, это шутер с элементами фантастики, который плавно перетекает в простой шутер. По сути, игра разделена на три части. Первая часть: вы, держа пистолет в руке, мечетесь по корридорам, отстреливая пришельцев и зомби. Вторая: вы, словно Шварцнеггер, крошите отряды спецназовцев и их технику (танки и вертолёты). Третья: снова возвращение к первой части, только уже в другой вселенной. Все эти три части гармонично связаны между собой прекрасной динамикой и атмосферой, а так же сюжетом, который ближе под конец превращается из \"спастись, как можно быстрее\" в \"борьбу бобра с ослом\".\n\nПричём не стоит удивляться, что простой физик способен противостоять практически всем войскам армии, ибо разработчики снабдили его костюмом, который служит и бронежелетом, и фонариком, и противорациационным костюмом. \n\nГеймплей, несмотря на постоянные пострелушки, зачастую становится разнообразен. Просто так пройти из точки А в точку Б нельзя: вам обязательно надо уничтожить врагов, либо повернуть рычаг, либо сделать что нибудь другое. Всё это прибавляет к общей сложности игры, и играть становится порядком интереснее. \n\nЛокации запоминающиеся, особенно последние в другой вселенной. \n\nВердикт: достаточно динамичная, мрачная, сложная, атмосферная, да и просто запоминающаяся игра.

Later he is told that soldiers have arrived to rescue them, but is it really so?\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is fun and interesting, and was at the time different from most First-person shooters. Half-Life focused less on the guns and required more thinking to succed. This is a great thing. The guns are still there, and most of them are fun to use, like the Shotgun and Pistol. Overall, the gameplay is superb, and holds up well even today.\n\nMusic: The music is great, and fits the game perfectly.

G-man a.k.a Government Man (The slang is right here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Man_%28slang%29 if you don't know what it means) interests me because of his mysterious behaviour & everyone still wants to know if he fights for good or evil but some things in life can't be answered but I don't know if we could all handle the truth.... if you really want more questions added I would suggest this video it gives out some good theories on G-Man & many others you can watch on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HmxQi09brI\n\nThe game has few minor bugs but the game still holds out as one of the grandfathers of the FPS genre & still popular for a 16 year old game so my final verdict is to get this game. Don't forget keep some head crabs as souvenirs on your grand adventures in Black Mesa, Freeman's grandkids might want it for their school project or for bragging rights on how cool their grandpa was back in his scientific glory. (If you feel like I missed something feel free to leave feedback)\n\nBonus: This is a great video if you want G-Man & Nihilanth talked about at the same time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzkPO_nDdFU\n\nBonus 2: You should check out Black Mesa if you can find it http://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Black_Mesa:About_the_Mod\n\nHere's a gameplay vid of the mod - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kgO9el3eT4\n\nBonus 3: Here's a list of popular mods I found - http://www.moddb.com/games/half-life/mods?sort=rating-desc\n\nFun Fact: Cry Of Fear was originally a Half Life mod & in the beginning of the game it has a Half Life poster in one of the rooms \n\nThe mod is on steam if you want to try it out http://store.steampowered.com/app/223710/","timestamp_created":1417614253,"timestamp_updated":1417693431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597099542617797852","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13210960","author":{"steamid":"76561198104648747","num_games_owned":203,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1255,"last_played":1434310555},"language":"english","review":"11/10 would review again","timestamp_created":1417604741,"timestamp_updated":1417604741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13210536","author":{"steamid":"76561198123379687","num_games_owned":218,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":3903,"playtime_last_two_weeks":12,"playtime_at_review":2975,"last_played":1660369229},"language":"english","review":"well the best fps is half-life it might have not aged that well but 10/10","timestamp_created":1417601352,"timestamp_updated":1448610890,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13205688","author":{"steamid":"76561198019081930","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1040,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":811,"last_played":1608598018},"language":"english","review":"10/10\nLast boss drags a bit but it's a great game!","timestamp_created":1417565706,"timestamp_updated":1417565706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13205213","author":{"steamid":"76561197990574293","num_games_owned":402,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":621,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":621,"last_played":1527291187},"language":"english","review":"Still great, though age has not done it a great service, and it is more enjoyable as a cultural artifact.  \n\nHL1 has several memorable moments, enjoyable combat, and challenging scenarios, but be prepared for a game hampered by old design methodology.

More than any other game in a while, in one go.\n\nFirst, the bad: The polygon count is very low, so the graphics look very dinky at their worst. But thats about it for the low-lights.\n\nThen the good: As I said, the plot and the pacing are solid. The game can draw you in if you let it. The graphics have been updated to some extent, so they are much better than when the game was first released, and with straight walls and square objects, the polygon count doesn't matter.\n\nThe controls are very responsive, and all the modern elements of an FPS are there, so nothing retro here except the graphics. I played it at easy, because that's my skill level, and found the campaign suitably challenging. So I can only assume that if you crank up the difficulty you can make the game very hard.\n\nThe campaign took me about twelve hours to complete, so that's a somewhat average amount of content, I guess.\n\nSo, overall, in my opinion, not just retro lolz, but a timeless gem.","timestamp_created":1417436429,"timestamp_updated":1417436429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13178190","author":{"steamid":"76561198086893094","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":930,"last_played":1587996968},"language":"spanish","review":"La primera entrega de Half life;gran historia,motor gráfico y todo en general.\nObra maestra.\nLo único que canviaría serían los tiempos de carga.","timestamp_created":1417426345,"timestamp_updated":1417426345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13177698","author":{"steamid":"76561198128171205","num_games_owned":2158,"num_reviews":313,"playtime_forever":366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":258,"last_played":1440581243},"language":"turkish","review":"Efsaneler unutulmaz ! \n\n-Bana şimdiki oyunların çoğundan daha çok zevk veriyor :)","timestamp_created":1417422619,"timestamp_updated":1417422619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508450329303741455","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13172962","author":{"steamid":"76561198123816515","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":1084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2,"playtime_at_review":522,"last_played":1660490699},"language":"brazilian","review":"Se você nunca jogou esse jogo, não pode se considerar um gamer.
