Sure the vehicle controls are bit iffy when playing on a keyboard. But that's just a nitpick. You can just play this game with a controller. \n\nThe game is pretty straight forward like the first one. You are 'now' legendary Gordon Freeman. You are thrusted back into the world that you \"left behind\" to come back and realize the world is different while you've been gone. A new threat has taken over the world and now it's up to you and the Resistance to put an end to the Combine.\n\nAnd of course, the game doesn't really give you everything all at once.

Half Life 2 isn't a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but it blows my mind that the reviews are overwhelmingly positive. It has ups and downs, and I can definitely see why it was such a massive success when it comes out. The story is a little overworked, but compelling. It isn't particularly interesting by itself, but like many before me have pointed out, the levels are beautifully designed aesthetically speaking, effortlessly mixing in-game mechanics like cover or obstacles with an immersive setting.\n\nThat said, my single biggest gripe is the gameplay. It isn't fast enough to be a third-person bullet hell like the original, and the levels are waaaaaaaaaaay too long to be enjoyable. The Airboat scene especially comes to mind - I couldn't force myself to get all the way through it (I played it for roughly 8 hours and then quit - mostly offline, hence the low number shown).\n\nIt's a solid 7 or 8.
