With the combination of the voice actors, the fights against the Combine, and the story line (as well as Episode One and Episode Two). I never really understood why everyone was making \"Half-Life 3 Confirmed\" jokes, after the long gap from 2007, of the release of HL2: Ep.2, but after playing HL2, and both of the available episodes, I have somewhat joined the hype train. Not to the point where I try to set up equations to which the answer is 3, but enough to make me want to see where this series is going. Although HL2: Ep.3 or HL3 might never be released, what the series has right now is great, and anyone who doesn't own Half-Life 2, and Episodes One and Two, should get the games right now, and experience one of Valve's greatest game series to date.","timestamp_created":1503202222,"timestamp_updated":1503202414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34364503","author":{"steamid":"76561198272976227","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":145,"last_played":1507595643},"language":"english","review":"Wake

In \"City 17\" wird Gordon Freeman \"der richtige Mann am falschen Ort\" Teil der dortigen Untergrundbewegung unter denen sich auch ehemalige Black-Mesa-Arbeiter befinden. Zusammen mit einem H.E.V.-Suit, einer Brechstange und Alyx geht es nach Black Mesa East und rein in die Action.\nDer Nachfolger des Ego-Shooters Half-Life ist mit Release 2004 zwar schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen, ist aber auch heute noch gut spielbar und technisch über jeden Zweifel erhaben.\nDie Handlung ist zwar sehr linear, aber dennoch recht gut und interessant. Jeder Abschnitt kommt einem fast vor wie neues Spiel, so stark unterscheiden sich diese von der Stimmung und der Atmosphäre. Über Action bis hin zu Horror bietet das Spiel ein recht breites Setting und ein makelloses Gameplay.\nHL2 hat sehr viele Dinge angestoßen und somit zukünftige Shooter und andere Spiele maßgeblich beeinflusst. Auch Steam haben wir diesem Spiel zu \"verdanken\", da die Vertriebsplattform gleich mitentwickelt wurde. Alleine schon deshalb ist dies eines der bedeutendsten Spiele auf dieser Plattform und ein Stück Spielegeschichte.\nHL2 macht durchgehend Spaß, ist nie frustrierend, und weiß immer wieder zu überraschen. Von mir ein klarer Daumen nach oben.\n\nPS: Falls ihr den Cut der deutschen Version umgehen wollt: Startet das Spiel mit Konsole (einmal Rechtsklick auf Half Life 2 -> Eigenschaften -> Startoptionen festlegen und da \"-console\" eingeben) und dort gebt ihr dann folgenden Befehl ein \"g_ragdoll_lvfadespeed 0\".

Depending on the difficulty level, the AI can range from somewhat challenging to brutal. Having someone fight with and help the player (like Alyx) and giving commands is nice. Weapons are very different from one another and are mechanically logical and either original or improved, ranging from the basic pistols, shotguns, and submachine guns to the iconic box-breaking crowbar to commanding an army of spawning bugs with bugbait to the Gravity Gun for picking up, zapping, and throwing things, the aforementioned of which makes an honorable addition in combat and puzzles. There are more opportunities to do in the game, such as using a buggy, an airboat, or even a crane as both a utility and a weapon, as well as doing completely idiotic things that provoke a response of astonishment from the other characters. It retains the fast pace, and it is more destructive, immersive and adrenaline-inducing, and interactive than the original.\n[b]++[/b] The scripting is the closest to perfect. One cannot simply dismiss any of the characters as inanimate or unwitty without trying to make oneself do so, and Alyx would be considered the greatest NPC sidekick at the time of release. She not only delivers the lines, but also is caring, looking out for Gordon, and strives to help him in any dire situation. The setting, unlike most games before or since, manages to capture the horrors of living in dystopia under fascism, and allows us to take it seriously and care for the slaves. Surely, games with similar stories attempted to capture the same image, but they often are taken too lightly to provoke any feeling of despair in the setting. Again, there are no cutscenes, and the plot points are orchestrated well enough to leave out inconsistencies and also elaborate on the events of the original [i]Half-Life[/i] and what the Breen Administration (the administration of Wallace Breen, the Earth's dictator and representative) is doing to control humanity. The role of previously hostile Vortiguants as part of the Resistance is also amazing, and fighting as a rebel against the cops is satisfying. It ultimately involves in accomplishing the most daring of all: the coup d'état of Breen's government.\n[b]++[/b] While obviously outdated by today's standards (though not for 2004's), Source engine is perhaps one of the greatest engines in history. The graphics are nVidia-photorealistic, and the physics at the time of release were the closest to being real-world physics. The sound quality is also laudable such that there do not appear to be any artifacts during the recording of the sounds. It is as interactive and animate as the GoldSrc engine, and like that engine, Source supports mods, with excellent possibilities.\n[b]=[/b] For those who like multiplayer, this game does not include the mode, although it is sold separately at half the price, and there are folks that hardly ever play multiplayer anyway.\n[b]-[/b] Though fairly divisive in functionality and somewhat more original and improved, with three fewer weapons than [i]Half-Life[/i]'s 14, the weapon arsenal is a bit more casualized than I would have liked it.\n\n[b]SCORE: 98%[/b]","timestamp_created":1502843197,"timestamp_updated":1522371082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34265981","author":{"steamid":"76561198018946662","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1565563206},"language":"english","review":"After recently playing Half Life 2, it is hard to recommend it, but it does not mean that the game is bad in any shape. In my opinion it suffers from something other games of its age mostly don’t. It has aged quite poorly. \n\nNo doubt that at the time the game came out it was very advanced (except maybe AI), and still to this day many people like the Source engine for its detailed physics. But the source engine is in many aspects the main issue. Other popular Valve games made on the Source engine have been released, and they have a very similar feel to them. Take Garry’s Mod for instance. It uses many Half Life assets, and you have probably tried it out already. Half Life 2 combat just does not feel as fresh or interesting after you have played other Source games for countless of hours. Meanwhile on the story side it is just as good as it came out, and stands out among other single player shooters. \n\nIt is a great game, but I recommend trying out the first Half Life either with mods or not first. \n","timestamp_created":1502839701,"timestamp_updated":1502839701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34265438","author":{"steamid":"76561198363013344","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1639701754},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de los mejores juegos. tiene gran historia, me entreteni mucho mientras lo jugue, me encanto muy buen juego 10/10","timestamp_created":1502837064,"timestamp_updated":1502837064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34265212","author":{"steamid":"76561198155095795","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1531261591},"language":"dutch","review":"Woaw.
