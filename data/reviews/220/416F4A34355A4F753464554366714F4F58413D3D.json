Я являюсь лютейшим фанатом этой замечательной серии и для меня все части HL - если не идеальные, то как минимум, хорошие игры; так что если вы ищете более серьёзного, не фанатского мнения, то листайте дальше. Ну, а теперь приступим к самому обзору.\nWARNING: Много букаф!\n\nНачнём с хорошего, с плюсов:\n1)\nАтмосфера.\nДа, первое, чем берёт эта игра, - несомненно своей атмосферностью. Лично для меня одной из важнейших составляющих игры является правильная подача задумки разработчиков. И Вентиля™ великолепно подали их. Буквально-таки каждая деталь игрового мира позволяет погрузиться в этот по-своему привлекательный пост-апокалиптический мир. Отдельно стоит отметить особенность всех игр серии - весь сюжет проходит от лица главного героя, в игре нет абсолютно никаких катсцен, а главный герой всё время молчит, что ещё сильнее позволяет погрузиться в игру с головой.\n\nОценка: 10/10. \n2)\nСюжет.\nВроде бы, сюжет в Half-Life 2 не отличается ничем диковинным, в нём нет особенных сюжетных поворотов и, кажется, что можно предугадать его сразу. Но после прохождения этой части и двух эпизодов все равно остаётся куча вопросов: \"Кто такой G-man?\", \"Откуда изначально появился Альянс?\" и т.д. Из-за этого многие так и ждали 3-ю часть, которая, судя по всему, никогда не выйдет. К этому добавляется запоминающиеся персонажи (Аликс, Барни из первой части), и получается хороший, но в то же время не нагружающий игрока сюжет.\nОценка: 8/10.\n3)\nГеймплей.\nШутерная составляющая в игре тоже хороша и по сей день. К особенностям геймплея добавилась физика, на которой основываются некоторые головоломки (хоть и лёгкие, но интересные) в игре, новое оружие, новые враги взамен убранных пришельцев Зена (игра теперь основывается не на сражениях с монстрами, а с людьми или как там ещё назвать солдат Альянса, у вражин теперь довольно серьёзный ИИ и ещё много всякого добра), и, самое главное, грави-пушка - оружие, благодаря которому можно практически не использовать огнестрел и экономить патроны для боссов и более серьёзных врагов. Особенно большую роль грави-пушка сыграла в главе \"Мы не ходим в Рейвенхолм\", где можно с помощью циркулярных пил красиво разрубать зомби напополам. Есть даже ачивка - пройти эту главу с одной только грави-пушкой.\nОценка: 9.5/10.\n4)\nГрафика.\nВ 2004 году Half-LIfe 2 была одной из самых красивых, графенистых игр, наравне с Far Cry, Doom 3 и ещё чем-то там. Особенно порадовала шейдерная вода в игре - она прекрасно выглядит даже на уровне некоторых современных игр.\nОценка: 8/10\n5)\nСаундтрек.\nЗдесь действительно хороший саундтрек, который идеально подходит под атмосферу. Во время крупных перестрелок играет динамичная музыка, во время хоррорных моментов - дарк эмбиент или что-то типа того, описать её довольно тяжело, да и я никогда особо не разбирался в жанрах музыки, лучше послушать самому.\nОценка: 9/10\n\nА теперь пора перейти и к минусам, точнее к минусу - из существенных я нашёл только один:\n1)\nБаги.\nДа, этот минус присутствует во всех играх, но здесь он может помешать наслаждению от игрового процесса, поэтому я добавил его в список. Отряд повстанцев Фримена иногда ну очень жутко тупит, мешает во время перестрелок и доставляет ещё некоторые неприятности. Хотя и польза от них тоже имеется. Также сам движок Source выдаёт различные проблемы, иногда крупные, иногда не очень. Но в общем и целом, багов не так уж и много.\n- 0.3 балла.\n\nИтог: 8,6/10. Один из лучших шутеров вообще. Рекомендуется к прохождению всем. Если ещё не играли - бегом качать с торрентов, ну, или покупать, если понравится. Спасибо за прочтение обзора и т.д., и т.п.\n","timestamp_created":1468174100,"timestamp_updated":1468174100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497553020715713501","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24234675","author":{"steamid":"76561198301821796","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1467911921},"language":"russian","review":"Интересная игра особенно сюжет","timestamp_created":1468167425,"timestamp_updated":1468167425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24233540","author":{"steamid":"76561198118276310","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2025,"last_played":1639234046},"language":"english","review":"Half life 2 is a great game with amazing gameplay!

Where the heck do I begin? Firstly, I will tell you my only gripe. It is related with Valve and not the game. They continue to have Half-Life and all of the expansions at retail price even when it is a decade old. It is not marketable and the price should be lowered or be free for those who want to see the heart of classic games. Same with Half-Life 2.\n\nThe story in Half-Life 1, don't get me wrong, was great. The foreshadowing at the beginning leading up to the resonance cascade, the vivid and conflicted world and the characters interacting with you. The story was simple at its core. Get out of Black Mesa 'cause the creepy crawly aliens are coming. The story ended with a chat with G-Man, leaving you with a lot of questions. But there were many pieces that were not filled in.\n\nHalf-Life 2 takes that simple story of the resonance cascade and Black Mesa and runs with it. All the way. Valve made a rich environment in number 1, but this was an entire world they created in HL2. There are connections with the first story and you see some old friends from HL1 but this is really, really new stuff. The story is more complex, rich and filled with unanswered questions the deeper you look. Half-Life 2 is not your ordinary big-budget Micheal Bay explosion-filled \"romp\" action game. It deals with many philosophical and social issues, just in a hypothetical situation. The Combine and Dr. Breen may be fake, but we can gleam some knowledge in the real world. The story is not ultra-super-mega fast paced. It takes a while to build up parts of the story and leaves you with many thoughts. But we'll talk about that later. Half-Life 2 more often than not is a multi-genre game. It follows some fps conventions, but many times is transcends those lines. In parts, it feels like Horror game-ish as you anticipate for the next attack of zombies or other monsters. You create the horror for yourself. Other times it feels like a straight up action game as you run and gun through the streets of City 17.\n\nBeyond defying specific genres, it defies a lot of game logic. Instead of providing exposition dumps through character interaction, it provides it in tidbits and leaves you to make it what you want. There are no cutscenes and you see everything through Gordon's eyes. Many games have loading screens that bridge levels or sections and almost always drop you in a different place. HL2, however, has minimal loading time and maps flow with each other and cohesively connect, making feel less like a game and more like a journey.\nBut it doesn't stop there. Half-Life 2 decides to defy storytelling as a whole. The Hero's Journey is a monomyth, a common platform or template to tell stories and myths. In Joseph Campbell's The Hero With A Thousand Faces, Campbell says that \"A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.\" The Hero's Journey is a circle, starting with the normal world at the characters status quo, and finishes back where he started, but fundamentally changed. Others say that The Hero's Journey is only a part of the modern hero monomyth and that there are different forms.\n\nHalf-Life 2 goes an entirely different direction. The status quo is non-existent. The story continues from HL1. There is no call to adventure or departure to a region of supernatural wonder, rather a trail of questions and questionable ethics following the Black Mesa incident. There is no specific time of trials or tribulations or a mentor that helps the hero along as seen in many a hero monomyth. Gordon is living the trials of others and is a leader without peer, trying to answer the very questions that led him to that moment in time. The most insignificant factor but the most important is that Cambell notes \"Refusal of the summons converts the adventure into its negative. Walled in boredom, hard work, or 'culture,' the subject loses the power of significant affirmative action and becomes a victim to be saved. His flowering world becomes a wasteland of dry stones and his life feels meaningless—even though, like King Minos, he may through titanic effort succeed in building an empire or renown. Whatever house he builds, it will be a house of death: a labyrinth of cyclopean walls to hide from him his minotaur. All he can do is create new problems for himself and await the gradual approach of his disintegration.\" Gordon is not able to hide from \"his minotaur\". The actions have already been set in motion and are premeditated by the G-Man. The rise and fall of HL2's story, its peaks, and troths, at some point, begin to meld together. Not as constructive interference but as destructive interference. The different aspects of the geopolitical conflict between the humans and the Combine meld and are unrecognizable but visible if you look through the thin sheen of action game it presents its self to be. When these peaks and troths are light waves, destructive interference produces darkness. Similar to Gordon's predicament, he is thrown into a time of darkness. Not only for the value of human life and the situation that the inhabitants of Earth find themselves in but also a time of darkness socially. The world is collapsing at the fundamental seams and Gordon cannot reverse the effects.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a complex game. It is rich and complex as I said at the beginning. Ever since its inception, Half-Life has held up. Through age, the evolution of the market and even changes at Valve, it is still here. It, Stuart Brown said, is \"heralded as a shining star in the first person shooter genre that rubs shoulders with the greats...\" \n\nWhichever way you see the story or the gameplay is your choice. Just please try and appreciate it.\nAnd buy the darn game.","timestamp_created":1468064519,"timestamp_updated":1493576369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24204194","author":{"steamid":"76561198207913097","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1101,"last_played":1503774236},"language":"italian","review":"Bellissimo gioco meglio del 1 !

Помимо этого, игра собрала множество наград и более 45 титулов «Игра года 2004».\n\nВ 2012 году Half-life 2 была награждена на Spike VGA 10 (Spike Video Game Awards) как лучшая игра десятилетия. Разработка длилась шесть лет, на протяжении которых исходный код игры был даже похищен и выложен в Интернете. Основными технологическими достижениями разработчиков можно считать движок Source, предоставивший игрокам потрясающую анимацию персонажей, продвинутый искусственный интеллект противников, реалистичную физику и шейдерный рендеринг.\n\nНевиданный ранее уровень взаимодействия игрока с внешним миром был достигнут благодаря использованию модифицированной версии физического движка Havok Physics. На сегодняшний день продано более 12 миллионов копий игры[, не учитывая продажи через сервис Steam.\n\nВ 2005 году игра была переиздана в коллекционном коробочном издании Half-Life — игра года. В России и странах СНГ сборник был выпущен компанией Бука. На разработку игры было затрачено около 40 миллионов долларов США.","timestamp_created":1467991958,"timestamp_updated":1504011899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24183701","author":{"steamid":"76561198139480679","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":592,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":476,"last_played":1451559398},"language":"russian","review":"Игра детства 10000000/10","timestamp_created":1467989975,"timestamp_updated":1467989975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24183094","author":{"steamid":"76561198091345352","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1045,"last_played":1540332060},"language":"english","review":"Highly reccomended if you want to jump on the bandwagon, if not just be careful of the headhumpers.","timestamp_created":1467988036,"timestamp_updated":1467988036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24178347","author":{"steamid":"76561198130641474","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":578,"last_played":1550780892},"language":"russian","review":"И до меня всё сказано...","timestamp_created":1467971829,"timestamp_updated":1543084922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24177242","author":{"steamid":"76561198119692713","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":12844,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12042,"last_played":1621277329},"language":"english","review":"ive played this game a lot and its pretty good","timestamp_created":1467967659,"timestamp_updated":1467967659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454657614231109619","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24175809","author":{"steamid":"76561198196043725","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1618929843},"language":"english","review":"this game is realy cool designed and very fun to play I didn't found any glitches yet.\nYou chould defenetly play it .","timestamp_created":1467961305,"timestamp_updated":1467961305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24174293","author":{"steamid":"76561198195869925","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1003,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":543,"last_played":1619937791},"language":"english","review":"What Half-Life 2 has done to the video-game industry is unforgettable. It has not only changed the fps genre of gaming, but it has changed the way we make, and experience video-games of all genres today. Half-Life 2 truly introduced video-games as a complex form of narrative, and blew everyone's expectations out of the park. \nAlthough Half-Life 2 was released in 2004 it still exceeds today's standards in 2016 12 years later! This is really impressive especially considering the fact that the video game industry is rapidly changing, and progressing. Something that really stands out to me is the incredible art design, and how it helps to tell the story, as well as the level design. It's dialogue is superb, and realistic, and the facial and body animations make you sympathize with the characters.\n\nYou won't find any cut-scenes that clutter up the game, and make it feel hardly intractable, or objectives that seem completely irrelevant to the story placed to add on extra hours of gameplay. In fact Half-Life 2 doesn't have a single cut scenes in the game. It doesn't rely on cut-scenes to tell the story, but instead relies on animations that take place around you. This adds on to the experience, and makes you feel as if you are in the game yourself.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is nothing short of a revolution in the video game industry, and it is easily one of the best games that I have ever played.\n\nI would definitley reccomend Half Life 2.\n\nMy rating- 10 out of 10.","timestamp_created":1467954427,"timestamp_updated":1480140866,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24170862","author":{"steamid":"76561198313368826","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":746,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":211,"last_played":1475772364},"language":"russian","review":"good game ;3","timestamp_created":1467939270,"timestamp_updated":1467939270,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515418469905853271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24168974","author":{"steamid":"76561198128981787","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":600,"last_played":1546211178},"language":"czech","review":"Má cenu tohle recenzovat?\n\nKupte si hru\n\nNainstalujte ji\n\nUžijte si ji\n\nMáte další hru do seznamu svých oblíbených her","timestamp_created":1467932359,"timestamp_updated":1467932359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.628043293952941895","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24166467","author":{"steamid":"76561198055215308","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":769,"last_played":1543038738},"language":"english","review":"By far, the best single player FPS I've ever played. 10/10","timestamp_created":1467924573,"timestamp_updated":1467924573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24166417","author":{"steamid":"76561198167297040","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":334,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":334,"last_played":1455094403},"language":"russian","review":"cool","timestamp_created":1467924415,"timestamp_updated":1467924415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24165358","author":{"steamid":"76561198088887429","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":935,"last_played":1493895792},"language":"spanish","review":"Qué puedo decir que no se haya dicho ya.
