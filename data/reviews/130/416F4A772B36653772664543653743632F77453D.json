If you're in it for nostalgia or just a completionist (like me) looking to see it all, then pick up this game and give it a run. Otherwise, Half-Life and Half-Life: Opposing Force are far better installments. Blue Shift is both short and bland. There's very little enemy diversity, weaponry feels scarce, and the progression is fairly linear. I'd say this is more of a speed running game than it is an experience.\n\n[h1]My Full Review[/h1]\nHalf-Life: Blue Shift is dated in the same ways the base game and previous expansion is. This is to be expected of course! Overall, the gameplay is still Half-Life, but I feel like that's all it is... just \"more Half-Life\". This game is an easy pass to those less enthusiastic about the universe. You'll find the better experiences in Half-Life and Half-Life: Opposing Force.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nOverall, the game feels so linear and basic that it'd be overall forgettable if it wasn't attached to the Half-Life franchise. Not only is the weaponry more limited than even the base game, but even the enemies feel repetitive. Most of the environments in this game feel uninspired and in some ways underdeveloped than the previous installments. Other than a section or two, the game's progression is extremely predictable and unsatisfying.\n\nSpeaking of progression, it barely feels like there's any real progression happening. You spend most of your time running through various corridors or enclosed outdoor areas shooting a bunch of marines and head crabs. Point A to Point B with killing in between. If that's what you're looking for, you'll find just that in this game.\n\n[h1]Story / Plot[/h1]\nThis expansion takes place in the perspective of Barney Calhoun right before the incident infamously started by Gordon Freeman. Alike the other Half-Life installments, you spend the game finding your way out of the Black Mesa facility.\n\nThat's about it. While we get to play from a new perspective, there really isn't any new information provided to us as far as the story is concerned. This was always the biggest letdown for me, because a new perspective often insinuates new information to some capacity. This game severely lacks in this department compared to its predecessors.\n\n[h1]Graphics / Audio[/h1]\nIf you've played the previous Half-Life installments (which I highly recommend before attempting this installment), then you should expect all of the same. The graphics are definitely dated, but they're still very thematic to the universe and hold a visual mood that a lot of games don't come close to. No different than the first game, the audio is the weakest point here. The various sounds and voice lines are definitely showing age, but they were certainly fantastic for their time.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis game is an easy pass, however it's not a terrible pickup for the major enthusiasts and completionists. Overall, you'll find better gameplay in the previous two installments.\n\n[h1]Please Rate This Review[/h1]\nI spend a lot of time breaking down game design and development from a critical consumer's perspective. If you've read all the way through, please give it a rating.

Los mismos que en el juego original, sin ninguna incorporación de armas (hay menos armas en este que en HL1). Después te encontrás con un científico que te dirige a un lugar antiguo de Black Mesa, con las mismas funciones que el Lambda Core. Te teletransportan a Xen para activar una máquina y te hacen volver y te envían aún más abajo para que hagas algo con un líquido. Una vez terminado todo eso, vos y un grupo de 3 científicos (incluyendo al científico que mencioné anteriormente) escapan formando un portal (escapás luchando al final con varios HECU) y sos el último en ser teletransportado.

If you want to get a Half Life spin-off, get Opposing Force. HL:OP adds weapons, whereas HL:BS has less than the original Half Life. However, I do have to recommend this game because it explains Barney's backstory in an immersive way that only Valve can do.","timestamp_created":1586548464,"timestamp_updated":1586548464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67040548","author":{"steamid":"76561198094837233","num_games_owned":4133,"num_reviews":123,"playtime_forever":308,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1584827173},"language":"spanish","review":"Expansión corta pero interesante.
