Portal 1 was probably one of the best games in history and it came short to its predecessor.  Portal 1 showed that a good game can be short but fun, tell a compeling story, and still deliver on the game play.  Portal 2 is short on almost all of those.  \n\nThis game never had padding in the middle section something that its little sibbling did not have.   Most of the game play in old aperture involded the player not solving increasingly complex puzzels but looking for the one place to put your portal, thats about it.  However the sections of the games with the test chambers near the begining and end were nice and introduced new mechanics pretty fluently.  \n\nThe story was fairly weak as well.  nothing shocked, untill Winstin took over Glados.  In my oppinion that should have been the climax of the story and where the boss fight took place.  However good games must be long, just look at the recent Final Fantasy games or Xenoblade Chronicals that sold so well. (ok xeno was good but didn't sell well because of the 70 hour story)\n\nNow the Game play was just fine I loved the new mechanics I just wished theyy would have incorperated them together more offten, like in the final boss fight with Winston.  \n\nOverall it was a good game but not portal 1, story was lack luster and the middle part dragged on too long but the I was still fairly challenged by many of the puzzels but I would wait for this game to go on sale, I would buy this for 10 dollars not 20","timestamp_created":1462844378,"timestamp_updated":1462844378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22886507","author":{"steamid":"76561198119651749","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1147,"last_played":1592002380},"language":"turkish","review":"10 numara","timestamp_created":1462830752,"timestamp_updated":1462830752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22885121","author":{"steamid":"76561198164572341","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1673,"last_played":1638915625},"language":"german","review":"Grandioses Puzzel-Spiel mit einzigartiger Story und fascettenreich gestalteten Charakteren.
