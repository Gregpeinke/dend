A differenza di Episodio Uno, il quale poteva risultare stucchevole data la sua brevissima durata, la quale lo portava a soffrire di nuove aggiunte di gameplay o proseguimento della storyline principale, questo capitolo della serie è eccezionale, accostabile facilmente al primo Half-Life 2. Qui la scelta di Valve di proseguire con una saga ad episodi risulta eccellente, con un capitolo sì dalla durata corta, ma con tanto di quel contenuto che un videogioco moderno di 30 ore circa potrebbe anche faticare ad avere. Il finale è un colpo di scena astuto, un cliffhanger clamoroso, il quale soffre però di una mancata continuazione. Non lasciatevi intimorire però, seppur adesso non ci sia nessun finale, è essenziale e doveroso recuperare questo mastodontico pezzo della storia videoludica.","timestamp_created":1623722021,"timestamp_updated":1627677366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93752511","author":{"steamid":"76561198131335163","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":466,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":466,"last_played":1623695796},"language":"turkish","review":"Bu

half life 1, 2, capitulo 1 y 2) odie el primer capitulo porque no se sentia como una extension de la historia sino un agregado de ultimo momento, este por el otro lado aunque prolongue conceptos al punto del cansancio termina el juego con un muy buen tono que no se noto mucho en half life 2 y sus extensiones, la ultima mision en particular nos permite ver sobre lo capaz de las habilidades narrativas del equipo, tomando tambien un tono rapido y frenetico del gameplay, me entristece el ver a la mascota del doctor llevar vuelo porque en el universo de half life no existe mucha inocencia y la dinamica simple que tenian que fue mostrada sobre el curso de su arco era una buena adicion a el cast de personajes, en si lo unico que le da sentido a este episodio son los ultimos minutos de gameplay, tras eso las aventuras y el dialogo que muestra alyx no me dan mucha empatia o apego al personaje, aunque tambien puede ser por la mala decision de forzar al jugador a requerirla para el progreso de los capitulos en forma de llave, ademas de que la relacion que toma alyx tampoco ayuda, hasta seria mas interesante alternar los roles del padre/hija ya que estan mas conectadas y daria mas sentido y cohesion a los viajes y familiaridad al ser compañeros de trabajo desde el incidente de black mesa, el mundo en si de el segundo half life resulta opaco y similar, no tan distintivo como el primero que aunque sin las mejores resoluciones estaba lleno de colores y contrastes y sobre mismos terrenos generaba diseño de niveles mas unicos, al ser una instalacion unica por capitulo tiene sentido que empiecen sin items y que progresivamente enseñe los fundamentos de cada arma, debido a que no necesariamente se puede garantizar que el jugador haya jugado ningun otro juego de su tipo, en este punto puedo darle un punto al segundo capitulo sobre el primero que nos permiten usar las armas a un mayor paso que en el anterior, sobre la forma en la que se enseñan aunque simples el diseño del juego principal es mas fluido, pero de nuevo, son simples mecanicas y realmente la gran mayoria podran entenderlo a los minutos de conseguirlas. sobre todo si tuviera que alabar algo de la primera mitad del juego es cuando alyx se queda a cargo del rifle de francotirador, esta reseña es subjetiva, si queres un gameplay de calidad consistente personalmente no recomendaria este dlc pero lo hare igual por el final que lo redime y porque es vital jugar este dlc de ser que a futuro se anuncie la trilogia, esta a tu propia

In the present day, we have the new Half-Life Alyx to draw hope from, but let it not be forgotten that this game here was the FINAL Half-Life release the public would ever see for a whole twelve or thirteen years. As if that weren't enough, the game ended on gaming's greatest - and cruellest - plot cliffhanger ever conceived. And as if THAT weren't enough, Valve Corporation refused to utter so much as a word about the Half-Life franchise for the remainder of the 2000s and all the way through the 2010s. The fabled Half-Life 2 Episode Three never saw the light of day, and to say this was a disappointment is rather an understatement. Imagine if the original Star Wars trilogy ended after Episode V and we never saw full closure in Episode VI. \nBut I'm not going to go on about that. Let me tell you why Half-Life 2 Episode Two is a masterpiece. This episode is a fair deal longer than Episode One, and probably equates to about half of Half-Life 2. It's no wonder Valve probably saw so much pressure with the innovation of a third and better episode. Anyway, Episode Two has got it all: epic driving sequences on a pimped-out muscle car, helicopter fights, a huge showdown with an army of striders, a pulse-pounding escape from an enraged giant alien... and to top it all off, the game sets itself in an absolutely gorgeous (and expansive) open world of lush forestry. \nYes, for whatever reason, the game seems to have shifted its location from eastern Europe to the pacific northwest - even though we are still in view of the citadel's remains far off in City 17. It's my personal opinion that Valve clearly drew inspiration for the game's green landscape from where their offices are based - Bellevue, Washington!  \nThe first chunk of the game gives us our final battle against the vicious antlions, including new ones that spray acid, and sees us trying to revive Alyx with the help of a friendly vortigaunt (voiced by Tony Todd). And let me say, a lot of people point to the first Half-Life as being the most 'scary' or 'eerie', and I can disprove that when I say that the scene in Episode Two when being chased by a ferocious antlion guardian in a maze of dark caves is much, MUCH scarier than anything we've seen yet. The sounds of the beast lapping at your heels and panting down your neck as you sprint to a small nook of safety is terrifying as hell. It actually reminds me of the xenomorph from Alien Isolation.  \nLater on, after a lot of driving, we see the main cast gang back together (lacking Barney, for unexplained reasons) as well as the new Doctor Magnusson. This character was introduced to create a sort of negative atmosphere among the characters who are all a little too jovial and happy for his tastes. I adore him.\nI can't spoil the famous ending of this great game, but to sum it up: we want to know what happens next, damn it!\nGame-play wise, I think there's a really nice balance of zombies throughout, but the antlion action outdoes the Combine battles by a slight fraction, I think. I never mentioned this in my Episode One review, but there seems to be a real lack of ammo in that game which really spices things up and has you rely on the gravity gun more. But for Episode Two, Valve go back to their old ways of showering the player with ammo and health at every turn. Oh, well. \nAnd if it's worth noting, the H.E.V suit has been slightly upgraded so that the torch mechanic is now separate from the rest of the suit's auxiliary power. The developer commentary tries to explain and justify this change, but I think this change is a little arbitrary and is too little too late. I coulda used that mechanic in that damned Lowlife chapter in Episode One! \nLastly, the hunters (no, not the ones from Left 4 Dead) are a cool new enemy. They're annoyingly spongy, but that's their gimmick entirely. \nAll in all, I think I can safely say Episode Two is the PEAK of Half-Life 2's brilliance, with a great linear story, amazing set-pieces and really fun enemies. It's just an awful shame it had to be the last game... at least for a while. \nPick up that crowbar one last time and set off for White Forest. \nAnd for God's sake, just put that gnome back where you found it.","timestamp_created":1623259034,"timestamp_updated":1641930112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50285714864730835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93471768","author":{"steamid":"76561199067972275","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":389,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1634921525},"language":"english","review":"gud","timestamp_created":1623258463,"timestamp_updated":1623258463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93467903","author":{"steamid":"76561198948456057","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1083,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1083,"last_played":1620500562},"language":"russian","review":"жду 3-й эпизод!","timestamp_created":1623253379,"timestamp_updated":1623253379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93460315","author":{"steamid":"76561198190812747","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":5265,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5162,"last_played":1640989273},"language":"english","review":"Half Life","timestamp_created":1623243561,"timestamp_updated":1623243561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604529798030853271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93459909","author":{"steamid":"76561199049843654","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":226,"last_played":1623184971},"language":"turkish","review":"[h1] Half-Life 2: Episode Two [/h1]\n\n[code] Half-Life 2: Episode One'dan sonra çok iyi geldi.Oynanışa kattığı yenilikler, hikayenin devamını görmek(sonunu değil) için oynamalısınız.
