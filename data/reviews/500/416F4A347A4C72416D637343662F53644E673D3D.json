(will also be a part of this in the bads area.)\n\nThe bads\n\nNot as many players as Left 4 Dead 2\n\nMay have levels created by other people but does not have steam workshop. So you will have to do more work going on sites and downloading levels and placeing them in the right spot. (Yep i said there would be a part to that one up there that was going to be in the bads.)\n\nNow and again on expert you will get a random person who joins and kills the whole team for fun.

Also tank ran faster on fire so burning him would mean he can run faster then you now.\n\nAll the weapons and special infected have different stats.\n\nOverall\n\nI say give it a try if you have friends to play with because all the campaigns from Left 4 Dead made it into Left 4 Dead 2. But you will not have the stuff that was only in Left 4 Dead and the level lay outs are a little Different for these levels in Left 4 Dead 2 but keep in mind you only get all of the survival maps from Left 4 Dead if you own Left 4 Dead While in Left 4 Dead 2 you still get two of No Mercys and all the Sacrafice ones from Left 4 Dead. \n\nWhat i am trying to say mostly get Left 4 Dead if you have a few friends who will play it you want to see how Left 4 Dead was compaired to Left 4 Dead 2 or you Like Survival Mode.\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1425135953,"timestamp_updated":1425135953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487431645393371582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14672961","author":{"steamid":"76561198157464084","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":271,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":173,"last_played":1446271364},"language":"koreana","review":"재밌기도 하고....중독성도 있긴 한데... 레포데2에 비하면 진짜... 레포데 1이랑 2랑 비슷한건줄 알고 샀는데 많이 달라서 약간 실망도 했고.. 레포데1은 절대 사지마요 2를 사요 그돈으로","timestamp_created":1425027133,"timestamp_updated":1425027133,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512658238410949707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14671701","author":{"steamid":"76561198000106434","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4471,"last_played":1329033600},"language":"english","review":"A great Co-op zombie shooter.

You play as 1 of 4 survivors (Zoey the college student, Bill the war veteran, Francis the biker, Louis the IT guy). The character doesn't seem to matter, it's just a different voice and skin. They will talk to alert you of things like health, weapons, reloading and where you should go next. Left 4 Dead is geared toward online multiplayer, but you can play solo through the game where your computer partners are competent enough, but need to be guided by you. Instead of online multiplayer where the other players seem to just run right through each level.\n\nThe controls are simple, point and click to shoot like any first person shooter, right mouse button is for melee for when foes swarm around you and they will. You have a long range weapon (shotguns, oozies, assault rifles and so on), a pistol (or 2) with limitless ammo, a medipack to restore your health or someone else's, pain pills that will temporarily give you a health boost and finally an explosive thrown weapon like a flaming cocktail or pipe bomb. You can jump or crouch for better weapon accuracy and that's it. The combat feels very limited because of this.\n\nThe big drawing point to the game is some sort of smart engine called the director that will generate random zombies to come at you, so no play through is the same twice. Such as a zombie that was at point A of your first play through might be a wall of zombies or no zombies, or a female zombie in your next play through. These zombies will race toward you after a few moments of shuffling their feet that might result in your terror, but an entire game of zombies running to you gets old very quickly. Zombies can climb up areas, go under truck trailers and the animations are good in general. Weapons and ammo scattered outside of safe rooms will not be in the same place twice.\n\nThe game is broken into campaigns and levels that you can access any one at any time. The campaigns are brief and really take you out of the action when you need to load a new campaign after completing one. The levels have good atmosphere, dark, spooky, but it gets old very quickly. Most every level feels the same with generic buildings, generic exteriors, generic trucks.\n\nBetween the levels are safe rooms. Leave a safe room and make it to the next safe room to cap off the level. Then at the end of the level, you see your score and how you did against the other players. Who killed the most zombies, who took the most damage. Stuff like that.\n\nTo be honest it's not that good. It feels very one dimensional. Within the first few levels, you've seen all the game has to offer. You will quickly see all of its small variety of enemies zombies run straight at you, witches that stay huddled until you put a light on them, stalkers pounce on you until you are saved, smokers use a tongue to strangle you until you are saved and explode smoke, exploders that vomit on you and tanks that can throw you and take a giant amount of punishment. You will really need to rely on others for survival. The computer players will be very willing to help you, but the players in multiplayer may not be as willing or can't when you've been left behind or gone ahead.\n\nThat's it. The game isn't very long and for a game that touts its random enemy generator, it doesn't make me want to replay the game again and again. Combat is simple, enemy variety is lacking, but the game plays very smooth. Essentially left for dead is about mowing down tons of zombies and if that's your thing, this is the game for you. If you need puzzles in your FPS or weapon depth, it's not for you.","timestamp_created":1424570487,"timestamp_updated":1424570487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":35,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.739592909812927246","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14583933","author":{"steamid":"76561198008863008","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12354,"last_played":1575346275},"language":"english","review":"this game has been a favorite of mine for years.\nit varies how the level plays out just enough to keep me interested.\nit a good game to pick up with your friends and promotes good team work specially since it's team work that is going to get anyone over the finish line.","timestamp_created":1424556070,"timestamp_updated":1424556070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14569347","author":{"steamid":"76561198079033421","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":2949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1807,"last_played":1580568145},"language":"english","review":"the game is good but the plays are just jerks cause i got kicked off 2 servers for no reason i mean,REALLY?","timestamp_created":1424486404,"timestamp_updated":1424486404,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14565742","author":{"steamid":"76561198089648044","num_games_owned":379,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":537,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":537,"last_played":1385150943},"language":"english","review":"Left 4 Dead offers the best zombie fighting experience I've had gaming and with great play functionality allowing gamers from all walks of life to start playing without experience.

The background items and members of the zombie horde are a little vanilla (i.e. repetative), but the game is still incredibly fun, regardless. After all, you're not really critiquing the fact that all the zombies with the green shirt are all missing their left eye in-game...because you're too busy trying to shoot them before they can zig, zag, and mob you to death. As far as I can tell, as you increase the difficulty, the normal infected become more alert, dangerous, and ready to jack you up, and the number of special infected spawning through the map really ramps up.

L4D é um jogo coop, no qual você e seus companheiros (geralmente 4 players no total) precisam enfrentar hordas e hordas de zumbis até chegar em um objetivo. Falando assim, até parece um joguinho meia boca, mas não é bem assim não... Depois de uma experiência como gamer, percebi que a Valve pegou uma grande inspiração em Killing Floor em certos aspectos da mecânica de gameplay, e, depois que percebi isso, achei muito incrível, pois sou um grande fã de KF. A mecânica do gameplay de L4D é simples e bastante intuitiva: Você precisa matar os zumbis em seu caminho, e sempre ir buscando abrigo. Cada campanha tem diferentes fases, e no final de cada delas, tem uma safe zone que termina a fase para começar a próxima. No final da última fase, os sobreviventes entram em algum veículo e saem da campanha que jogaram. E é no meio de tudo isso que começam as particularidades de L4D: No jogo não há diferenças entre os players, todos são sobreviventes iguais, com a mesma quantidade de HP, e sem nenhuma habilidade especial. O arsenal não é muito vasto, porém, cada arma tem suas particularidades e seus pontos fortes, e além das armas, existem as bombas e os medkits para ajudar os jogadores. E, dentre os seus inimigos, existem os infectados especiais. Cada um deles possui habilidades diferentes para dificultar ainda mais a vida dos sobreviventes. E além de tudo, tem o Tank... Nem preciso comentar nada sobre o Tank, né? E, o ponto mais forte de Left é o modo coop, em que 2 times se enfrentam: Um de infectados e um de sobreviventes. É um modo muito divertido, porém foi superado em diversão pelo seu sucessor. L4D é, sem dúvidas, um marcador de águas em jogos coop de zumbis. 8/10","timestamp_created":1424053181,"timestamp_updated":1424098104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546525299549102783","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14491295","author":{"steamid":"76561198041357059","num_games_owned":1489,"num_reviews":136,"playtime_forever":117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":117,"last_played":1421006240},"language":"english","review":"It's aite.","timestamp_created":1424045234,"timestamp_updated":1424045234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474874377250671387","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14490117","author":{"steamid":"76561198054282101","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":758,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":473,"last_played":1630211511},"language":"english","review":"One of my all time favorite games.

Whatever platform you own this on, fun times are to be had.\n You take control of one of four survivors of the Green Flu (Virus?), a nasty disease turning the population into flesh-eating horrors. The rest of the survivors are either A.I., or players (treat the A.I. nicely, and you shall be rewarded). You then proceed to embark on a journey from safehouse to safehoue, 'till the finale, where you must hold out for an amount of time before escape is available. In order to even make it to the finale, or move on at all, tight teamwork is needed. You can share items, heal others, and use z and x to say things such as Help and similar call-outs (after all this time, i still don't know what they're called. Voice commands? I don't know. Someone tell me.) to further help the team.\n Now, about the zombies. They are fast. They come in large groups. They are smart. There are certain events which cause them to come in endless hordes, unless something is done that stops them from being attracted. Or the A.I. Director (the thing controlling all the zombies) can send a horde (this one is NOT endless) your way if you spend too much time in one place, or if it feels like it.\n There are special infected (each special infected has their own music que, and there can be only around 3 in-game at a time) The Boomer spits bile at you, attratcing zombies. He explodes when shot, showering you in bile. He can also detonate at will, so if he's in your face, shove him away before shooting, or before he explodes.  The Smoker produces a long tounge that drags it's prey to it, where it then claws the living hell out of you. Shoot the tounge, or shoot it before then (it likes to stay far away form the group, so be careful). The Hunter can jump super long distances and great heights, screaming every time. He will pounce on you, clawing you until soemone gets him off, or kills him.   The Tank. The name speaks for itself. This thing is insanely strong, requiring the whole group to put it down. Each punch stuns you and sends you flying. Also, he can throw cars. Fun.    Finally, the Witch.  If you hear any crying women, turn your flashlights off and stay away. Sneak around her. You can shoot her, just expect her to make a beeline for whoever disturbed her, and proceed to down you in one hit. She also has very large health, and does the most damage in the game. \nWell, that's all there is. It's a great game to play with friends, or alone. Multiplayer matches, or no.

L4d ist ein gutes Zombie Game das man sowohl im Single als auch Multiplayer spielen kann obwohl ich deutlich sagen muss das der Multiplayer besser ist vor allem das man noch Addon Maps runterladen kann und Spielen kann ist auch sehr Positiv. L4d besitzt aber zu viele Bugs die zum Teil das Spielen unmöglich machen und im Multiplayer kann es zwischendurch oder mehrfach Spieler geben die einen einfach nur aufhalten oder Tot schiessen und sich dann selber töten nur um einen die Kampagne kapput zu machen. Man kann zwischen 4 Charkatern auswählen die gut in das Spiel reinpassen. Über die Bots schreibe ich jetzt mal nichts weil man die eh nicht gebrauchen kann so wie es in den meisten Spielen der Fall ist. Die auswahl der Offiziellen Maps von L4d ist sehr Mager und mit 6 Maps nicht gerade der Hit aber man kann ja Addon Maps hinzufügen wie weiter oben beschrieben.

Both games are meant to be cooperative, but after getting rather good at L4D1, I feel that it's somewhat broken in terms of your partners being indispensable. \n\nIn L4D2, you absolutely need to work together as a team in order to accomplish your goals. If there's inexperienced people on your team or if you end up playing with bots, the challenge becomes much more difficult. Some of the guns have been nerfed in order to reinforce the need for partners. Also, you can't melee forever, like you are able to do in the first game. Your character eventually fatigues and your character will start to melee more slowly after a while. The maps are designed to prevent the group from hunkering down in a corner and waiting out the horde. Instead, you are meant to run and gun, trying to lessen the amount of damage you will take, since you can't hide in a corner and melee, which would allow you to prevent taking any damage at all. The finales are much more varied and definitely require some teamwork. Without human players backing you up, the finales on some of the new maps would be near impossible.\n\nIn L4D1, on the other hand, the infected are pretty easy to dispel if you stay in huddled in a single squad. All you need your partners for is to give you a shove to save you from the occasional special infected. As long as you stay in a team, you can save each other from any hazard. The game is simplistic and pattern based. All you need to do is follow audio cues to know what to expect. Hear some piano keys playing? A Hunter is nearby. Hear a howl? A horde of zombies is coming. It's at that point that you just look for the nearest building corner and crouch. Then, you melee and shoot until the horde eventually dies. The game is extremely simplistic, once you've learned how to read its cues. The finales are also a very simple pattern of horde, Tank, horde, Tank, followed by the rescue, at which point you have a horde and a Tank at the same time.\n\nIt's for this reason that I play it, though. I enjoy playing it while talking to friends or use it as an opportunity to make friends. I can spend hours talking to people while killing zombies. For me, it's like a chatroom with a teambuilding exercise built into it. When I play L4D2, on the other hand, I spend so much time focusing on the task at hand, that I can't stop and chat. Not to mention that it's an entirely different gaming experience, which I have yet to acclimate to. In other words, I still suck at L4D2, so I can't easily chat and play at the same time. So, for how I use it, I definitely recommend L4D1.","timestamp_created":1423212533,"timestamp_updated":1423212533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.595505654811859131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14338888","author":{"steamid":"76561198209635756","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":505,"last_played":1547768773},"language":"english","review":"A lot of fun!

Deberemos colaborar con nuestros compañeros, pues la IA del juego nos tenderá emboscadas y nos atacará con oleadas de zombies e infectados especiales cuando menos lo esperemos, o mas jodidos estemos. Este es uno de los puntos fuertes del juego, exceptuando algunos, la gran mayoria de hordas e infectados especiales que nos atacarán seran aleatorias, podemos jugar un mapa varias veces, que los enemigos atacarán en distintos puntos cada vez.\n\nSUPERVIVENCIA: Deberemos resistir el maximo tiempo posible en algunos mapas de la campaña contra una interminable horda de zombis, conseguir llegar a 10 minutos es poco menos que un milagro, en este modo aparecerán un monton de infectados especiales.\n\nENFRENTAMIENTO: En este modo se formarán dos equipos, uno controlará a los supervivientes y otro controlará a los infectados especiales, son los mapas de la campaña, de hecho los supervivientes deben llegar al refugio, y los infectados intentar impedirselo.\n\nPodemos controlar a 4 personajes distintos que son supervivientes resistentes a la infección, estos son:\nZOEY: Una estudiante universitaria\nBILL: Veterano de Vietnam\nLOUIS: Un oficinista negro\nFRANCIS: Un motorista, prototipo de tipo duro\nA pesar de ser distintos, no tienen habilidades ni estadisticas que los diferencien a unos de otros, por lo que realmente da igual a quien coger a la hora de jugar.\n\nEntre los infectados especiales se encuentran:\n\nSMOKER: Un capullo de primera, atacará desde lejos a veces desde angulos casi imposibles, nos atrapará con su lengua y nos arrastrará hacia el, si no nos salvan de el nos asfixiará o dejará que los zombies nos devoren.\n\nBOOMER: El mas lento y debil, se trata de un gordo que escupe un moco, que a demas de dejarnos temporalmente ciegos atraerá a una horda de zombies hacia los supervivientes que acaben manchados con el, mucho cuidado con matarlo de lejos, pues de cerca explotará cubriéndonos de moco\n\nHUNTER: Pequeño, agil y rapido, si nos pilla nos destrozará con sus garras\n\nWICH: La oiremos llorando en algunas partes del escenario, podemos evitarla apagando luces y avanzando en silencio o ir a por ella y arriesgarnos a que destroce al atacante\n\nTANK: Su nombre lo dice todo, parece un culturista mutante con exceso de esteroides, lento pero duro, a pesar de que un superviviente corre mas que el, tiene la posibilidad de arrancar piedras del suelo y arrojarlas derribando a sus victimas, una autentica maquina de matar si tiene coches a su alcance.\n\n","timestamp_created":1422645978,"timestamp_updated":1422645978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14234324","author":{"steamid":"76561197970884972","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3293,"last_played":1372399056},"language":"english","review":"Still gold, smooth gold","timestamp_created":1422585202,"timestamp_updated":1422585202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14221095","author":{"steamid":"76561198090973735","num_games_owned":344,"num_reviews":128,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1398652327},"language":"english","review":"did the reveiws backwards and did left4dead2   first, but it's pretty much the same as that one. so\n\n10/10gameplay\n7/10 sound\n7/10 graphics\n\n10/10 would recommend to any zombie lover.
