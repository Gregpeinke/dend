[u]Graphics and story[/u] [i]10/10[/i] ([i]Half-Life 2[/i] is the continuation of the story of the mysterious character [u]Gordon Freeman[/u]. We could say in a general way that the story takes place after the events of [i]Black Mesa[/i]. We’ll not only contemplate the work on the graphics engine (a novelty at that time), but also the visual narration and the development of a story as a film. The game maintains the sci-fi narrative with a dose of survival and we’ll be an [i]anti-citizen[/i]. But different scenarios have been added to the game which often appear to be an «open world» game. All the characters continue to develop and unfold in each plot of the story. We’ll see a world in a utopia (landscapes between country and city with architecture from ex-soviet countries) with a high quality graphic work and excellent change of nuances. [u]Each object in the game plays an important role in the narration (as is the singularity), in addition to the lines of dialogue of the characters[/u]. The graphics engine has made it possible to give the characters a less artificial and robotic look, but without becoming something unpleasant. That same graphic engine has allowed an important novelty, our participation in the development of the story as if we were also the protagonists. We can see the scenes in what the developers call [i]real time[/i], that is, actions of the characters without having an awkward movie that can be skipped with enter. It’s a nice work-art!)\n\n2. [u]Playability[/u] [i]10/10[/i] (Something that I liked about [i]Half-Life 2[/i] is the development of the player within the game. The controls begin with simple handling, until later the player will have challenges and difficulties proposed by the narrative plot. We could say that the more the player progresses, the more you learn to function within the dynamics of the game. [u]Something like this: a game with pedagogical instructions to overcome obstacles[/u]. The game begins with a teaching and later apply it in field practice. A simple teaching to a complex problem. [i]At all times of the game, there will always be premises about the problem and how the player can solve it[/i]. The rest consists only of developing and applying what has been learned. We can also interact with objects and with other characters, as many of them will be able to indicate the way to overcome the problem.)\n\n3. [u]Music and FX[/u] [i]10/10[/i] (My surprise was to hear the soundtrack of [i]Half-Life 2[/i]. From the Valve Company I started with the game [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i]. From that game the first thing I heard is Valve music. Music played as Barry shows the suit to Freeman. The soundtrack presented in the game offers a dynamic, narrative and immersive sound. The music has been well crafted with elements of electronic music and dark ambient. It bears a resemblance to the soundtracks of films, whose idea is to give the viewer an audio narration that accompanies the visual narrative symmetrically and whole. Each scenario has its own music. If we only listened to the music, we could possibly recognize the place in the game. Sometimes we’ll hear soft and mysterious music, other times music of tension and agitation. I think music is a subject that has been carefully into the game and all tracks will always be different.)\n\n4. [u]Duration[/u] [i]9/10[/i] (The game has a considerable duration. All the scenarios that the player progresses will be different. I liked the contrast of the scenarios between country and city, between a closed world and an [b]open world[/b]. The ending has a classic sci-fi look. A place where all the problem of the game is concentrated. Everything seems an industrial look with an atmosphere of abandonment. Sometimes the player will be able to explore and other times remain in constant action. Depending on the difficulty of the game, it can be long or short-lived. A single player game. You can get the game in the famous [i]orange box[/i]!)\n\n[h1]Recommendation: 10/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1610317253,"timestamp_updated":1610317253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52702707052230835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84456960","author":{"steamid":"76561198042010263","num_games_owned":299,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":1149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":611,"last_played":1615518190},"language":"english","review":"Without a doubt one of the greatest fps games I have ever played. IMO surpassed the original in every aspect, and even today, gameplay and level design still hold their own against modern AAA titles. The additions of weapons such as the gravity gun really made the game have a new twist to what the player can do, and new traps and enemies require you to learn how best to defeat them. For its time, Half Life 2 seems to have been ground breaking in the mechanics and what Valve achieved. \n\nNow with that said, there were some issues gameplay wise which frustrated me. The biggest concern with the Half Life series is that there are certain areas which punish you for having little to no health, with bullet sponge enemies that kill you and respawn over and over until you manage to figure out the perfect path to dodge bullets grenades and rockets. That is not fun. It is a chore to not die, rather than gameplay which should be about solving puzzles with a sense of urgency. My other gripe with this game was the terrible friendly AI, which often just got in your way in doorways or halls. At least they were able to kill things, but damn the AI really showed its age.","timestamp_created":1610316319,"timestamp_updated":1610316319,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84456020","author":{"steamid":"76561198144017360","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3674,"playtime_last_two_weeks":430,"playtime_at_review":2503,"last_played":1660509954},"language":"russian","review":"Потрясающая игра, особенно нравится интересный захватывающий сюжет, хорошая графика, разнообразие локаций, реалистичная физика игры.","timestamp_created":1610315118,"timestamp_updated":1610315118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84455148","author":{"steamid":"76561198363155234","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":783,"last_played":1610299630},"language":"english","review":"It's Half Life.
