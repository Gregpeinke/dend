While doing so, you get some co-op like assistance from Alyx Vance, which is one of the main features of this mini-sequel.

Justo cuando creíamos que todo había acabado ahí para Alyx, vemos que en la escena aparecen un grupo de Vortigaunts para detener el tiempo, salvarla, y teletransportarla a un lugar más seguro; por otro lado, cuando pensábamos que Gordon iba a ser puesto en suspensión temporal indefinida una vez más por G-Man, este es detenido por los mismos Vortigaunts, quienes, mientras liberan a Freeman, intentan con sus poderes suspender temporalmente a G-Man. Una vez que comenzamos el juego, notamos que la torre principal de la Alianza se está desmoronando y el núcleo de la ciudadela a punto de estallar. Nuestro objetivo es claro, ya que junto con Alyx, debemos escapar cuanto antes de Ciudad 17.\nComo único punto negativo criticable es que el juego sigue siendo víctima del largo tiempo de carga entre nivel y nivel, no habiéndolo solucionado desde Half-Life 2.\nLos puntos positivos a destacar son que, al ser una continuación de HL2 dividida en episodios, desarrolla bien el escape de Gordon Freeman y Alyx Vance en la duración propuesta, no llenando la historia de relleno innecesario y si incluyendo acción constante y algo frenética. Además, como en su predecesor, es extremadamente destacable la calidad gráfica del diseño de los niveles (como por ejemplo al inicio cuando vemos la tormenta en la punta de la torre de la Alianza y como esta se va cayendo a pedazos a medida que avanzamos, el nivel en que hace presencia el núcleo de La Ciudadela, o lo mismo al final cuando explota el núcleo.)\nOpino que Half-Life 2: Episodio Uno cumple con lo que promete, si bien al ser un juego es corto en duración, no olvidemos que cumple bien en ese sentido al ser un episodio de un conjunto de dos (Y deberían haber sido tres). Además, incluye un nuevo zombie (Zombie de la Alianza), un estilo de juego renovado (ya que la mayor parte del tiempo vamos a estar acompañados de Alyx ayudándonos a escapar), y unas 3 o 4 horas más de entretenimiento y desarrollo en la historia.\nMás que obvio recomendar jugarlo, ¡buen juego y buen primer episodio!\n\n\nPD: El primer juego que completo todos los logros al 100%!!!! :D","timestamp_created":1587859388,"timestamp_updated":1587859703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60120844841003418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68026599","author":{"steamid":"76561198159661280","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1135,"last_played":1587897582},"language":"english","review":"Worth the money, not as good as Hl;E2 or HL:2 but has its merits, if you're doing achievement its also very rewarding and \"The One Free Bullet\" is a very fun challenge. \n\nIf you're on the fence, its a good time sink!","timestamp_created":1587859174,"timestamp_updated":1587859174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68025451","author":{"steamid":"76561198864793776","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1590146441},"language":"russian","review":"Дополнение что надо , пойдет для прохождения , 3.5 часов.\nРекомендую.","timestamp_created":1587857367,"timestamp_updated":1587857367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68024097","author":{"steamid":"76561198802372576","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1577,"last_played":1587644662},"language":"czech","review":"best game","timestamp_created":1587855259,"timestamp_updated":1587855259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68022753","author":{"steamid":"76561197964475259","num_games_owned":624,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":791,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":791,"last_played":1587805206},"language":"english","review":"Hardware: i7-7700HQ, 32GB RAM, GeForce GTX 1070\nOS: Windows 10\n\n>Pros:\n+Pacing is as good as ever\n+Cool gameplay dynamic with Alyx\n+Improvements to the lighting system makes things even more atmospheric and moody\n+Some great set pieces\n+Cool environmental puzzles\n+Soundtrack as good as ever\n\n>Cons:\n-Alyx AI will a lot of times literally get in your way\n-Doesn't really bring much new to the table\n-No new weapons\n-Visually, environments mostly feel like a retread\n\nA few subtle visual improvements like HDR really help make a difference, but in the end it looks just a tiny bit better than HL2, which isn't a bad thing per se since HL2 looked pretty good back then, but HL2EP1 definitely has a few visual effects going here and there helping it age better in that regard.\nThe game is short, as it was meant to be, but it's a formula that feels tuned to near perfection.

Then I've completed first HL2 game and I've started realizing. \n\n When I've started playing, for about 1 hour I was repeating G-Man quote \"Rise and shine mr Freeman, rise and shine\", I just love G-Man. The graphics was amazing, when I was playing it I've didn't feel that this game was created in 2004. Voice actors were amazing too, they did great job. Sometimes it was annoying, because something I wasn't able to do anything, then I've realized I'm stupid because it was one of the easiest levels, but it happened only 2 times to me. Music in it was the best thing. When I've ended every episode of HL2 I've downloaded the soundtrack with the speed of light\n\nI recommend Half Life 2 to everyone.

Das liegt nicht daran, dass das Spiel auf irgendeine Weise schlecht wäre. Es ist nur kurz und für ein nicht allzu kleinen Teil des Spiels befindet man sich im Combinetower und nutzt das Gravitron. Wenn ich jahrelang auf ein neues Half-Life gewartet hätte, dann wäre ich dementsprechend etwas enttäuscht gewesen. So vollends hat mich Episode One einfach nicht überzeugt. Allerdings bietet es recht interessante Neuigkeiten. Beispielsweise ist Alyx nun für längere Zeit deine Begleiterin und hilft dir im Kampf. Insbesondere die Mechanik, dass man im Dunkeln Gegner anleuchten soll, damit sie auf sie schießt, fand ich sehr interessant. Dabei lässt sich auch dieses sehr coole Detail finden. Alyx wird nämlich von meiner Taschenlampe hier geblendet:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2070043098\n\nDie Rätsel mit dem Gravitron zu lösen, oder die Löcher der Ameisenlöwen mit Autos zu stopfen waren auch sehr interessante Mechaniken, die es ruhig auch im Hauptspiel hätte geben können.\nHalf-Life 2: Episode One setzt da an, wo die Handlung in Half-Life 2 aufgehört hatte. Glücklicherweise fand ich doch das Ende in Half-Life 2 vielleicht ein klein wenig zu abrupt. Gefühlsmäßig hatte auch die Episode One etwas mehr Humor als das Hauptspiel, oder zumindest hat hier der Humor bei mir mehr gezogen. Alles in Allem ein Pflichtkauf, wenn einem schon das Hauptspiel gefallen hat.\n\nKommen wir für die Schnellen unter uns einfach mal zur Pro-Contra-Liste:\n\n[u][b]Pro:[/b][/u]\n\n+ Das Hauptmenü verändert sich bei fast jedem Kapitel und zeigt eine gewisse Szenerie. Besonders die plötzliche Ansprache von Dr. Kleiner hat mir sehr gefallen\n+ Die Objekt basierten Rätsel, bei denen man seine Umgebung genau im Blick haben muss, haben mir sehr gefallen!\n+ Im Gegensatz zu Left4Dead 2, oder Portal 2 kann man in Half-Life 2 sogar sprinten!\n+ Untertitel haben unterschiedliche Farben für unterschiedliche Charaktere, zumindest, wenn innerhalb einer Diskussion mehrere Personen teilnehmen\n+ Menschliche Animationen, wie Gesichtsanimationen sehen ziemlich gut aus. Allerdings weiß ich nicht, wann, oder ob die von Valve mal überarbeitet worden sind. Wenn die allerdings schon im Jahre 2004 so aussahen, dann... meine Güte, welche meisterhafte Arbeit!\n+ Man kann mit überraschend vielen Dingen interagieren (auch wenn ich es stellenweise schwierig fand, zu erkennen mit was überhaupt)\n+ Zerstörbare Objekte\n+ Eine recht interessante und fesselnde Geschichte!\n+ Großartige Charaktere!\n+ Abwechslungsreiche Orte, die immer wieder etwas anderes verlangen können\n+ Man erhält im Verlauf des Spiels enorm viele Waffen, die sich auch grundlegend unterscheiden. Man hat da so seinen Standardkram und auch ausgefalleneres Zeug\n+ Einige Gegner waren recht interessant. Vor allem herauszufinden welche Waffen bei welchem Gegner am effektivsten ist\n+ Alyx ist für längere Zeit eine hilfreiche Begleiterin\n+ Keine Fahrzeugabschnitte, die schneller mal langweilig wurden\n\n[u][b]Contra:[/b][/u]\n\n- Auch wenn das Spiel auf Deutsch vertont ist, so sind einige Synchronsprecher wirklich schlecht. Zumindest in einigen Wörtern, oder Satzteilen. Der Synchronsprecher vom G-Man ist das grausigste, was ich bisher gehört habe, die Sprecherin von Alyx und Barney nuscheln besonders und vor allem die Aussprache von Wörtern wie \"Dad\" oder \"Gordon\" haben mich bei der Sprecherin von Alyx extrem gestört. \"Dad\" wird von ihr \"Dat\" ausgesprochen und statt \"Gordan\" zu [u]sagen[/u] sagt sie tatsächlich \"Gord[u]o[/u]n\". Weshalb ich das Spiel das nächste Mal auf Englisch spielen werde\n- Das Spiel hat keine einheitliche Soundpalette. Geräusche der Lebens- und Schildstationen sind ohrenbetäubend laut, Musik ist viel zu leise und Schussgeräusche wieder zu laut. Auch die Optionen sind nicht umfangreich genug dieses Problem konsequent zu lösen\n- Kurze, unterbrechende Ladesequenzen, die ohne jegliche Vorwarnung auftauchen und so den Spielfluss dezent stören. Allerdings sind diese, wenn man ein geübtes Auge dafür entwickelt, schneller zu bemerken als noch im Vorgänger\n- Befreundete NPCs können nicht mehr getötet werden, um deren Munition zu klauen. Das ging im Vorgänger nämlich. Ich fand es schade, dass das in Half Life 2 (und in der Episode One) nicht mehr funktioniert\n- Es gibt keine Schnelltaste für Granaten, wie noch im ersten Teil\n\n[u][b]Prontra:[/b][/u]\n\n+- Die gewählte Musik ist zwar gut für die jeweilige Situation, aber kein Soundtrack, den ich abseits vom Spiel hören wollen würde\n+- Das Aufladen von Leben und Schild an den Stationen dauert recht lange. Ich vermute, dass man vermeiden wollte, dass man die Gegner dorthin lockt und sie von dort aus bekämpfen kann und sich währenddessen immer wieder Leben zieht, aber dergleichen habe ich nie ausgenutzt, weshalb ein Aufenthalt dort immer recht lange gedauert hatte\n+- Ich fand es teilweise recht umständlich von Leitern herunter zu steigen, wenn man an ihr zuvor nach oben geklettert ist, bis ich dann bemerkt habe, dass man sie mittels \"E\" betreten und wieder verlassen kann. Davor habe ich immer versucht von ihr herunter zu springen, was schlecht funktionierte\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode One darf man sich als Half-Life-Fan natürlich nicht entgehen lassen. Das Spiel ist dabei jedoch recht kurz, ob da der Normalpreis gerechtfertigt ist, muss jeder für sich selbst wissen.\n\nIch danke fürs Lesen und wünsche sehr viel Spaß beim Spielen! ;-)\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/380/HalfLife_2_Episode_One/","timestamp_created":1587543412,"timestamp_updated":1587543412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504984915256500244","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67802536","author":{"steamid":"76561198970424785","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":376,"last_played":1593537198},"language":"russian","review":"это просто отличное продолжение, актуально и в наши дни, очень приятно проходить","timestamp_created":1587541970,"timestamp_updated":1587541970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67801348","author":{"steamid":"76561198967201567","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":441,"last_played":1590146331},"language":"polish","review":"zajebista przygodowa gra polecam","timestamp_created":1587540196,"timestamp_updated":1587540196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67800943","author":{"steamid":"76561198848837941","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":315,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":313,"last_played":1657024476},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic game with a great storyline!

It was horrifying since there are zombies everywhere and you are completely blind without the flashlight.","timestamp_created":1587450331,"timestamp_updated":1587450331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67736345","author":{"steamid":"76561198174753503","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1587444369},"language":"english","review":"Short and sweet - If you enjoyed the base game then this small expansion is sure to delight.","timestamp_created":1587445351,"timestamp_updated":1587445351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67736267","author":{"steamid":"76561198889997809","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":246,"last_played":1587445127},"language":"english","review":"Alyx wasnt an annoying npc that stops you from moving around, she was a genuine helper","timestamp_created":1587445177,"timestamp_updated":1587445177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67735308","author":{"steamid":"76561198041161199","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":95,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":95,"last_played":1471644527},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1587443433,"timestamp_updated":1587443433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67733692","author":{"steamid":"76561197967296378","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":460,"last_played":1587440273},"language":"english","review":"Continue with a good game... :)","timestamp_created":1587440399,"timestamp_updated":1587440399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67733131","author":{"steamid":"76561198213143565","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1587688828},"language":"english","review":"It's quite a short episode though it's entertaining","timestamp_created":1587439354,"timestamp_updated":1587439354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67730439","author":{"steamid":"76561198831093150","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1587515863},"language":"spanish","review":"Si.","timestamp_created":1587434642,"timestamp_updated":1587434642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67723511","author":{"steamid":"76561198021093053","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1587096285},"language":"english","review":"Short but totally amazing!","timestamp_created":1587423386,"timestamp_updated":1587423386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67706459","author":{"steamid":"76561198057111284","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1013,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":370,"last_played":1654919941},"language":"english","review":"very good continuation to the half life series","timestamp_created":1587413162,"timestamp_updated":1587413162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67703281","author":{"steamid":"76561198838001871","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":285,"last_played":1587412884},"language":"russian","review":"Крайне классная часть игры.
