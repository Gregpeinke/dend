The sequel to the legendary title released in the Orange Box. It is without a doubt a worthy successor to the original Portal and a must-have for any gamer. By the way, I'm loaded with quotes from this game.\n\n-------------------------\n\nI doubt I need to explain the story of Portal 2 this late after its release, but I'll do it anyway. You, Chell, have woken up after \"9999999--\" days in suspension to a little robot named Wheatley knocking on your door. He introduces you to the jump mechanic in a humorous way, and leads you to \"one of the old testing tracks.\" From there, you explore the facility by \"follow[ing] the rail, actually,\" finding and reactivating the Genetic Life-form and Disk Operating System (GLaDOS). She takes over, and forces you to \"test[strike]ing[/strike] for the rest of your life.\" You probably know more about the story, but I won't spoil it here. Great ending though.\n\n-------------------------\n\nLike the story, you probably already know the gameplay. You've got your portal gun. It's \"a gun that makes holes. Not bullet holes.\" Blue and orange. Inextricably linked. The game gives you the ability to move everywhere and nowhere, somehow making a very free-form chamber very linear in its solutions. That probably sounds bad, but in practice, it works very well. It offers a multitude of possible solutions, with only one or two being correct. It's masterfully designed.\n\nThe game's difficulty ramps up very well, introducing new mechanics constantly, and doing it in such a way that gives the player time to react and think about the solution in a manner that lets them think without fear of death. For example, a very early chamber teaches the idea of using the orange portal as an entrance, rather than only an exit. This is reinforced in the next chamber and allows the player to continue through the game properly, not being confused about a simple concept. Each chamber uses a different method of application for these techniques, and 'introductory' levels are never timed, allowing you to come up with an idea while not under pressure.\n\n-------------------------\n\nNow, you'll probably finish the story and wonder: \"Well, s--t, what am I supposed to do now? I've finished the game, surely there's nothing else to stop me from uninstalling!\" But that's wrong. Valve has included a multiplayer mode. While I've not actually (entirely) finished it, I have played enough of it with various friends. It goes something like this:\n\n1st play session with friend who's played before: BRUH UR DOIN' IT WRONG, DO IT LIKE THIS!\n2nd play session with noob friend on unplayed levels: Alright this is fun, we're solving these together!\n3rd play session with noob friend on levels you've played: BRUH UR DOIN' IT WRONG, DO IT LIKE THIS!\n\nIf you don't get my meaning, here it is plain and simple: Play multiplayer with someone who hasn't played it either.\n\n-------------------------\n\nAlright, now you've finished the multiplayer. Guess you'll uninstall now, right? Wrong. Valve has also included extensive workshop support, allowing anyone to create and share their own levels. I've spent more time in those than I have in the main game, in part because puzzle games have almost no replayability (almost). I've [strike]enjoyed[/strike] ripped my hair out during countless hours in the top-rated puzzles section. You'll find \"that guy\" who makes amazing and interesting levels that you can play whenever, and you'll just add a ton of them to your subscriptions. Each one, slowly introducing and warping mechanics, using them in ways you've never seen. Then there are the guys with knowledge of the Hammer editor, who can come up with their own items. At peak absurdity I found a level that changed gravity... (Level spoiler: [spoiler]Never had to place a light bridge upside-down before![/spoiler])\n\n-------------------------\n\nAll in all, Portal 2 remains a very important staple of gaming years after its release. A fantastic story and well-designed puzzles make a very good game. It even has a multitude of player-created content, extending its replayability a hundredfold. You won't run out of things to do or new ideas to integrate into levels. I hope you have as much fun as I whilst ripping your hair out over something you find simple in retrospect.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE: 5 July 2020\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the midst of quarantine, I've started speedrunning Portal 2. At the time of writing, my PB is 1:21:04.58. With that, I can definitively say: this game has a very high skill ceiling. You wouldn't really expect a puzzle game to have a high skill ceiling, but the mechanics laid out by Valve do just that. Skill-based movement like you'll find in a lot of older Valve games (due mostly to bunnyhopping, to be fair) and precise tricks makes it so that new routes are being researched even now. I may have put a hundred hours into the game the first time through, but with speedrunning I've dropped the same amount in only a few weeks.\n\nWhether you're a casual puzzle-lover, story-interested gamer, hardcore speedrunner, or creative puzzle-maker, this game has something for everyone to enjoy, and I simply cannot recommend it enough. Play Portal 2. Please.","timestamp_created":1525651493,"timestamp_updated":1593994976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41896236","author":{"steamid":"76561198327610694","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":160,"last_played":1650124423},"language":"english","review":"This game is Amazing and way ahead of its time.\nIf you are thinking about getting the game, the answer is YES, \n in all its a great game so get it.","timestamp_created":1525646562,"timestamp_updated":1525646562,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494809657335281372","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41895746","author":{"steamid":"76561198303323163","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1659106601},"language":"spanish","review":" De mis juegos favoritos junto a su primera entrega, los dos son juegos de puzzles bastante entretenidos y algunos de ellos si te haran pensar un rato.

(Aunque no crean que cuando dije que te hacen sentir peor lo decía como si se tratase de algo malo. si te estuvieran alagando por cada estupidez que haces en un juego, haría que no te lo tomes enserio, sin embargo, el que no solo NO te alaguen, sino que te digan que lo hacés mal, o que lo hacés bien pero con sarcasmo incluído. hace que te den más ganas de seguir jugando, además también incrementa el sentido del humor del juego y el carisma de los personajes.)\n\n-Contenido:\nDe por si, la historia de este juego no es nada corta (Aunque tampoco es inmensa) y eso no se debe a su dificultad, puesto que la curva de dificultad del mismo es balanceada y con simplemente aplicar los conocimientos de pruebas anteriores se puede pasar el juego sin complicación alguna.\nEsto tampoco significa que el juego sea fácil, el juego es bastante difícil, pero con un poco de ingenio se puede sobrellevar bastante bien. No es ni demasiado fácil ni es extremadamente difícil como para hacer Rage Quit. es una dificultad perfecta.\nAdemás, siguiendo con el contenido del juego, este posee una gran comunidad y una Workshop bastante grande, por lo cual incluso cuando te pasas el juego tienes aún más contenido por ver. y totalmente gratis. (Además de poseer historias alternas creadas por fans que incluso se pueden encontrar en steam que son realmente buenas, por lo que con este juego tienes aseguradas muchas horas no repetitivas.)\nTambién posee un modo multijugador que tiene bastantes niveles y por si fuera poco también hay niveles hechos por la comunidad para este modo. ahí ya hay incluso más horas de diversión.\n\n-Historia:\nEste juego, es claramente una continuación del conocido Portal, por lo que la historia va ligada al título anterior. no es un spin off ni un Alternate Universe. es una continuacióin directa, llena de humor, personajes carismáticos, regresos en personajes de anteriores entregas, referencias al Companion Cube del Portal. Referencias a la batalla final del Portal. y nuevas formas innovadoras de utilizar las herramientas a disposición como la portal gun.\nEsta vez comenzamos en una habitación haciendo una rutina de \"Ejercicios matutinos\" (Claramente, observar el arte y escuchar 5 segundos de música relajante es una gran rutina de ejercicios). sin embargo, cuando despertamos, una inteligencia artificial nos cuenta que tenemos que escapar y nos \"ayuda\" (si se puede considerar ayuda a cargarlo mientras seguimos el único camino que hay) a cumplir ese objetivo.\nSinceramente considero que el boss final de este juego es muy interesante y que el final en si es MUY bueno. (SPAAAAACE) o al menos, mejores que en la primera entrega son (Y eso que me gustó demasiado la primera entrega).\nAdemás, solo escuchar la canción del final hace que valga la pena el haber pasado por todo (Well here we are again, it's always such a pleasure)\n\n-Puzzles: \nSi jugaste la primera entrega, te darás cuenta que los primeros puzzles son muy similares. (Obviamente con un gran cambie estético) esto se debe a que, claramente son los mismos. esto es debido a que el pasar otra vez por lo mismo hace que el estilo narrativo del juego se enriquezca aún más, sin embargo esto solo sucede en los primeros puzzles, cuando la Inteligencia artificial que nos rescató decide aparecer, el juego toma un gran cambio, muy pero que muy bueno. y de la mitad del juego para arriba... ufff... el ver el pasado de Aperture simplemente es una experiencia inolvidable. además de que a partir de ese momento se añaden MUCHOS elementos a los puzzles que los hacen más dinámicos y divertidos. así que no pienses que el juego es simplemente una reutilización de puzzles, porque no es así.\n\n\n\n-EN DEFINITIVA-\nEste juego merece el título de obra maestra. no debería de haber ninguna duda al comprarlo puesto que es de lo mejorcito que se puede conseguir, no te pide ningún requisito del otro mundo y te sumerge en una historia digna de ver. no se que hacen viendo esto, deberían estar jugando al Portal 2.","timestamp_created":1525552157,"timestamp_updated":1525552157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41873406","author":{"steamid":"76561198347886431","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3408,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1706,"last_played":1653495020},"language":"english","review":"There isn't really any way to put it except I fucking love this game.\n\nThe original Portal game had me addicted from the start. I played it for for 3 hours straight and then played the challenge maps. But I always felt it was lacking in a certain department. I couldn't really tell what it was, until I figured out it was the lack of change. Valve have always been good at doing this. Take Half-Life 2 for an example. While the concept is pretty standard on paper, in practice it is great. In Half-Life 2 you go from so many locations, from fleeing across rooftops and railways to shooting down giant bioengineered aircraft and smashing through ranks of giant bugs in a weaponized racing car. The Half-Life series has always had some kind of drastic change in location and tone throughout the game, whereas Portal had very few. Sure there was the transition from the bland, white test chambers, to the winding maze of pipes and ducts belching smoke and chemicals. But even then the lack of change across enviroments still annoted me,\n\nAnd then came Portal 2, the next entry in the series. I jumped in. The first thing I see when I start a new game was a clean, normal room, with curtains and a painting. Instead of a hibernation vault there was a normal bed. A nice change from the stark, white test chambers of before.\n\nAfter we go back to bed, and hibernate for to long and are introduced to Wheatly and all that, the game finally let's you play it. You jump down from the wrecked remains of your room, into one of the best sections of the entire game.\n\nI loved the starting section. The first level was one of the old levels from Portal, the opening one, where you are introduced to the portals. But in this one, everything is different. While you were asleep, it seems that Aperture has really fucked up, for this chamber has been trashed. There are vines growing all over it, the glass is broken (and the fucking radio is STILL there!). The portal opens, just like in the first game, and you are introduced to the mechanics. This section is just a remake of the first game's opening test chambers, but I still love it. It was really cool to play the same, simple test chambers, but this time there are vines growing all over it, everything is trashed, and the graphics have seen a great improvement. It was great to see the same chamber, but without the blaring white walls. It made me feel as if I was guiding my own way through the facility, not being forced through by it's design.\n\nSo then you retrieve the Portal Gun. Not much to say about this part, except that like the entirety of this game, it's well executed. If you happen to be uncultured swine, and don't know what the dual Portal device is, let me explain. The left trigger fires a blue portal, and the right trigger fires an orange portal. If you walk through the blue portal, you end up where the orange one is placed, and vice versa. A very original and fresh idea, instead of some shooty shooty hidey behiney the cover fps game.\n\nYou then meet up again with Wheatly, the annoying british robot, and try to escape the facility. You unplug Wheatly from his rail and carry him along. For a robot, I think his facial animations convey human body language very well, so that's a plus. You then attempt to go through Glados' chamber, which is destroyed recreation of her super evil lair from the original game. You pass through the chamber unscathed, and Wheatly tries to do some super advanced hacking, but fucks it up and accidentaly wakes up Glados. Idiot. Glados pulls herself back together (literally) and separates you from Wheatly. She throws you down down down, through the same fiery pit that you used to burn her brain cells in the first game.\n\nSpeaking of Glados, I thought she gave a great performance in this game. In Portal, you didn't see Glados until the end of the game, when you had to fight her. But in this game, you see her before she starts talking to you. In my opinion, this gives more of a force behind the voice that is talking to you through speakers for the rest of the game. As you procede through the levels, she insults you vigourously, at least 1 insult per chamber. Your character, Chell, says nothing back of course. I thinbk this forges an interesting relationship. One of my problems with Half-Life 2 (probably my only probelm), was that Gordon Freeman never replied to any of the compliments people gave him. If he replied, like a regular person, it would makes these compliments or just the dialogue in general seem perfectly normal. But since he doesn't say anything back, it makes the complimenter seem incredibly patronising. If someone complimented you, and you ignored them, it would seem rude, and then if they do it again, it seems like there's something wrong, since your hostility would make them less likely to say more good stuff about you. This was certainly a p[roblem in Half-Life 2, but in Portal 2, it works like a charm. When Glados insults you, it makes sense, considering the fact that you killed her and all. But when Chell just ignores her, and doesn't even stop (well, unless the player stops) it forges an interesting relationship between them. Not a friendly or positive one, but one that compliments and works well with the situation that Chell is currently in. It also makes Chell look like sort of un-human, the way she doesn't react in any way to Glados' threats or insults. Later, we learn that Chell is mute, but I think the fact that she can just casually brush critisism off really works well with the rest of the game. I cant really describe it but it works.\n\nAs the game goes on it stays consistant and just awesome in general. You pass through different sections of Aperture, and (my personal favourite) discover Aperture Scince Innovaters, the company's division from the 1950s. This is my favourite part of the game by far. You get to traverse massive areas that have been destroyed and are rapidly deteriorating. You also get to play some of the tests from the 1950s Aperture, and they are great. We have a new narrator too, Cave Johnson, the founder of Aperture Science. He is informal, casual, somtimes emotional, and just interesting in general. He also makes several references to Black Mesa and how they \"copied\" him. All of this sevtion is great in my opinion. And if you are like me, and fucking loved this area, there is a mod for it: Portal Stories: Mel. It tells the story of a completely different tester, Mel, and takes place in 1950s Aperture. If you enjoy Portal, you should definitely check this mod out. It is free and AWESOME. Give it a go.\n\nAnd finally, there is the co-op.\n\nCo-op for Portal 2 is great. I really enjoyed playing with my friends and playing with strangers alike. The people I met were all very friendly, and I would like to declare my matchmaking experience in Portal 2 Co-op salt free. However, with friends it is a different matter entirely.\n\nI used voice chat to complete the co-op mode with one friend, and that went well, it was nothing but fun, robot dances, and FRUSTRATING CHAMBERS THAT TOOK US 30 MINS GAHHH.\n\nBut then I tried to play with another friend, one who isnot of the Rick and Morty watching demegraphic, and is fairly lw in IQ. That was certainly fun too, but we had several arguments where he wanted to use cheats to complete test he kept dying on, and we did nothing but come up with inventive ways to kill each other (once he killed me by slicing me in half with a light bridge, and I gotta admit it was pretty good). If you are a fan of the stupid, killing each other over and over agin type of co-op, I would suggest you buy Death Squared on the Nintendo Switch, invite a group of friends over, and spend the next 3 hours screaming at each other in front of a TV as you try desperately to push all your no-longer \"friends\" off the map and/or into lazers. Great game.\n\nSo that concludes my review of Portal 2. And what can I say but, buy it!

Я решил порадовать себя и приобрёл вторую часть данной игры, тем более, что продавалась она со скидкой 50%.\n\n\n\n\nИгра является головоломкой от первого лица. В ней нужно решать множество задач с помощью всего двух порталов (вход и выход). Игра проходит, как в замкнутых комнатах, так и на открытых пространствах.\n\n\n\n\nВ отличие от первой части в игре значительно увеличилось количество различных механизмов, лазеров, добавились гели со специфическими способностями. Всего и не описать. И чем дальше, тем головоломки становятся сложней и изощренней.\nИгра разбита на главы. Которые принципиально отличаются друг от друга, что придало игре разнообразия и неповторяемости головоломок.\n\n\n\n\nХочется отметить юмор игры. Как и в первой части, приходится постоянно слышать речь роботов. А она, поверьте мне на слово, очень забавна, будь это робот, контролирующий всё помещение, или, просто, робот-охранник. Также присутствуют юморные головоломки, которые поднимают, и без того хорошее, настроение.\nЗвуковое сопровождение отличное. Звуковые эффекты нареканий не вызывают. Музыки не много, но она здорово поддерживает атмосферу происходящего.\nТакже в игре присутствует возможность построения комнат. Так сказать, блеснуть сообразительностью и создать, почти, неразрешимую головоломку и послать в сеть. А можно играть уже созданные кем-то комнаты, загрузив из той же сети в Стим.\nМожно играть и вдвоём, но я не пробовал, поэтому сказать ничего не могу.\n\nПройдя данную игру, я остался очень доволен. Нисколько не пожалел о сделанной покупке. Эта игра отлично подойдёт людям, желающим пораскинуть мозгами.
