Kısaca bahsetmek gerekirse, spoiler vermemeye çalışarak, araştırma üssüne bir taş benzeri bir madde ulaşmıştır, maddenin uzaydan geldiği varsayılmaktadır ve M.I.T'den mezun olan Gordon Freeman'ın ekibi olan olağandışı maddeler ekibine üzerinde deney yapılması adına verilmiştir. Ardından yapılan deneyde bir aksaklık olur ve macera başlar. Bundan sonrasını anlatacağım merak edenler için. Altta bir link verip oraya yazmayı planlıyorum. Oyunun altında oldukça ve oldukça sağlam bir hikaye var.\n\nBiraz da oyunun tarihinden bahsedelim. Valve'in çıkış oyunudur Half-Life. Gabe Newell ve bir kaç arkadaşı eski Microsoft çalışanıdır. Windows 95 ve 98'de çok büyük katkıları olduğu söylenir Gabe'in. Microsoft ekibinden daha önce ayrılan bir ekip id software'i kurmuştur. Çıkarttıkları oyunlar ile iyi bir başarıya imza atmıştır. Bunu gören Gabe, id Software'dan olan arkadaşları ile iletişime geçer ve Microsoft'dan ayrılır. Ardından Quake'in oyun motorunu düzenleyerek ilk Half Life'ı yaparlar. GoldSrc adlı oyun motoru ile Half Life sunulur. Half Life FPS tarihindeki ilk hikayeli oyun olma tahtına da sahiptir. Ondan önceki oyunlar sadece vur ve ilerle mantığında idi. Valve, Half Life ile yepyeni bir FPS devri başlatmış ve çok çok büyük bir başarıya imza atmıştır. Ardından kendi source motorları ile tekrar ele almışlardır.(1.6 sürümü source ile yapılmıştır.)\n\nOyunun havası oldukça kasvetli. Her an her yerden saldırabilecek düşmanlar, her tarafta onun dışındaki cesetler, çok az canlı insan, havalandırmalarda geçen yollar,kısıtlı cephane.. Oyun atmosfer olarak size o an oradaki insanın psikolojisi nasıl olursa aynen onu yaşatmakta. Karakter Gordon Freeman ise soğukkanlı ve kolayca bağ kurulabilecek bir karakter. Kısacası oyunu oynamaya başladığınızda kendinizi oyunun içerisinde hissedeceksiniz.\n\nSingle Player'dan sonra efsanevi multiplayer'ına geçersek, Multiplayer'ı da Single Player'ı kadar efsanedir. Oynanabilirliğin çok yüksek olması ve kısa sürede adapte olabilmek oyunu daha da çok oynanabilir yapmıştır. Hala daha oynayanı vardır.Çünkü onun deneyimini ne battlefield'dan ne call of duty'den yada başka bir fps'den alabilirsiniz. Bambaşkadır.\n\nOyun kısmından çıkarsak, Valve geliştirdiği bu motorun üzerine bir çok oyun daha oluşturmuştur. Şüphesiz bunların en meşhuru Counter Strike'dır. Ardından Ricochet, Team Fortress, Deathmatch Classic gibi oyunlarını da eklemiştir. Bir kaçını yeni versiyonları ile günümüzde görmekteyiz.\n\nHalf Life'ın başarısının hemen ardından Valve, Orada olanları farklı gözlerden anlatan Half Life Opposing Force, Half Life Blue Shift, Half Life Decay oyunlarını da çıkartmıştır.\n\nArtıları ve eksileri ile özet geçersek\n+Mükemmel bir senaryo\n+Oynanabilirliğin çok yüksek olması\n+Harika atmosfer\n-Oyunun artık eskimiş olması (Aslında bu bir eksi değil, oyunun yeni source ile yapılmış hali olan Black Mesa Source'u oynayabilirsiniz. Ancak oyun şu anda oyunun son 2-3 bölümü henüz bitmemiş halde- ücretsizdir ayrıca, biraz araştırma ile rahatça erişebilirsiniz.)\n\nDaha önce oynamadım, oynamak istiyorum diyenlere şiddetle tavsiyemdir. Daha iyisini bulmanız pek mümkün değil.","timestamp_created":1596969098,"timestamp_updated":1596969098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.594345390796661377","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74018525","author":{"steamid":"76561198121443358","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":588,"last_played":1660489288},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life is a good game.\nMake yourself a favor and get it.\nNow.","timestamp_created":1596963253,"timestamp_updated":1596963253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74012507","author":{"steamid":"76561198963156727","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1629513626},"language":"spanish","review":"ta bueno","timestamp_created":1596952761,"timestamp_updated":1596952761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74005223","author":{"steamid":"76561198864333770","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1627672641},"language":"english","review":"Great game.

He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Physics is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be scientific. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.

The action's rather good when you encounter it. I found Half-Life packed with a surprising amount of environmental puzzles, many of which were easy enough to understand but the in-game physics made them frustratingly clunky to execute. I see what the developers were going for but a few obstacles came across as obtuse. For example, some enemy vehicles you can destroy while identical others you strangely can't. I also got stuck on a particular level because I didn't know you had to duck-jump onto a box; why not just add one more knee-high box to the pile? Overall though, Half-Life still became addictive in its gun-battling and its (mostly) clever level design. I can understand why it was so groundbreaking in its day.","timestamp_created":1596679381,"timestamp_updated":1596679381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73840197","author":{"steamid":"76561199028204356","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1588,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1658600482},"language":"english","review":"I love this game it is such a classic and it started one of the greatest franchises ever.
