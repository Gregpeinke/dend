Unlike Bioshock and Bioshock 2, this game is EXTREMELY railroad-y... you're basically just watching a really long movie and pushing some buttons here and there along the way.

It just felt downright silly at many moments.

Nowadays when I have grown up, when you start to think about the plot and other details, you can actually notice contradictions and plotholes. I will not going into detail with them because it takes too long and some people have managed to make over 30 min videos explaining them. You can find them on Youtube.\nThis is yet again one of those games that make me wish Steam had neutral yellow option for mixed/neutral reviews\n\nBut, does the game hold up with other aspects....let's see\n\n[h1] Bioshock Infinite [/h1]\n\nNow, I personally think that Bioshock Infinite is one of the most overated games I ever played, if you compare it to the original Bioshock. I'll list some things\n\n[b] Bioshock (2007) [/b]\n*All weapons are at your use when obtained\n*Different ammo types against different enemies and weapon upgrades\n*Hacking minigame and crafting\n*Manual saves, quick saves and autosaves\n*Research camera to earn buffs\n*First aid kits and EVE restorative items\n*Different plasmids with different outcomes\n*Gene tonics that give passive buffs (very good for different playstyles)\n*Some levels offered you a chance to plan ahead (set up traps, hack turrets and so on...)\n*The ability to go back to previous levels incase you missed something (gene tonics and other stuff could be found)\n*Despite it wasn't advanced, you could still sneak around and surprise your enemy\n\n[b] Bioshock Infinite (2013) [/b]\n*Your carrying ability is limited to two weapons\n*You can upgrade your weapons with money but theres only one ammo type for each weapon\n*No crafting of any sort and hacking is replace with vigor that does every automaticly ( also less damage to possessed units for some reason)\n*Autosave and no ability to save manually\n*No ways to gain buffs except for vigors and weapons\n*You cannot carry first aid kits or salt and you are forced to run around and constantly press F to find stuff when you are in a bad situation. (Fun???)\n*Plasmids are replaced with vigors, but you most likely are gonna stick to two because upgrades are expensive\n*Gene tonics ---> gone...now replaced with \"gear\" that offers some passive effects. (Not bad, but not great)\n*You are given less options to plan ahead, because most levels are linear\n*Less backtracking and not much reason to do that except for optional \"quests\"\n*What stealth?\n\nMy review might be biased, but just think about these when comparing two games. I know that things change when making a sequel, but if you change the foundation radically, you need to replace them with good alternatives while staying faithful to the original. The alternatives in Bioshock Infinite are not well designed or atleast are too \"casualized\" for the lack of better term. Some may like it that way, but are they honestly better?\n\nPROS (GREAT):\n+ Art style is incredible\n+ There are some great ideas in the game\n+ Music fits perfectly with the timeline and is just as fun to listen as 50's songs.\n+ The opening is actually amazing and feels like \"Bioshock\"\n+ Runs well\n\nPROS (ALRIGHT):\n+ Gunplay is decent for the most part and animations are beautiful\n+ Voice acting is good with the material they were given\n+ Skylines adds some originality to the normal shooting while they are a bit silly\n\nNEUTRAL/MIXED\n* Vigors are somewhat fun to use, but are a bit of downgrade compared to Bioshock and it feels annoying that it all comes down to the money and Vigor upgrades are expensive, so most likely you are just using two of them. Having no salt bottles in your invetory doesn't help too.\n* Elizabeth as a companion is alright I suppose, but there is no tension in fights because she cannot die and enemies ignore her and always shoot you\n*Lack of minigames. It would've been fun to actually lockpick, but it's reduced to press F to make Elizabeth open it. Making things too simplified can you you impression that devs think players are too dumb to do things themselves\n\nCONS (BAD):\n- Melee usually clunky, which sometimes lead to strange misses.\n- The main villain is weak and is not given reasonable explanation why he is what he is (if he has, please comment) other than being a racist. He just hates other races. oh, ok.....\n- I know the reason why choices won't matter, but if there wasn't any contradictions and choice prompts, It would've be OK. Don't add \"moral choices\" if they don't affect the game in a meaningful way. [spoiler] The first game had much better excuse and it didn't even add moral choices other than little sisters, which actually makes sense [/spoiler]\n- Why does this game have two weapon limit? What was the problem with the original system? Why not just improve the existing one? Could've made Bioshock Infinite it's own thing instead of copying elements from other FPS games.\n-Booker and Elizabeth make idiotic decisions considering the circumstances\n\nCONS (AWFUL)\n- I don't see any valid reason to not have manual save in Bioshock Infinite. What makes it awful is the fact that you lose money and enemies are given health back with you having less stuff. First Bioshock had manual saves....so....why.....\n- You cannot carry health packs/stims or salt just to make Elizabeth to do something. It's not fun to click everything to find food/drink items just because you are unable to carry health items. \n- The plot is full of holes and other stupid things. This wouldn't be a problem if the game wouldn't take itself so GODD**N seriously. If the game has deep plot, I'm going to think about it and the results are that most things in Bioshock Infinite don't make any sense.\n- [spoiler] I'm just have come to the conclusion that having time travel and multiverses in your games/movies make it a mess, with a few exceptions [/spoiler]\n- F**K handymans and [spoiler] ghosts...seriously [/spoiler]\n\nI'm simply don't understand why this game got so much praise and even GOTY awards, considering that they changed so many things that made Bioshock amazing. For me this is 6/10 at best. H**L, I think even Bioshock 2 is better than this game. Even with some positives, this game comes off as boring and I was waiting for it to end. \nIf you haven't played the previous Bioshocks, I guess this game could be for you, but I wouldn't recommend it if you loved the original Bioshock and 2.\n\nIf you think Bioshock Infinite has made good changes, please let me know in the comments below.
