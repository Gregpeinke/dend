Blue Shift scraps many superfluous weapons from the first game, settling on a modest but satisfactory arsenal. Its storyline, the events that occur and the spectacular sights, along with some quite satisfying puzzles, will keep you entertained the whole way through; that said, it's not very long, as the duration of the game only spans a somewhat 'measly' 6 chapters, so it barely even has enough time to wear out its welcome. However, several high plot points and subtle (or not) details that serve to further intertwine its story's timeline with that of Gordon Freeman himself make the game wonderfully memorable and worth playing, especially if you've played Half-Life first.  Simplified, short, and pretty dang fun, Half-Life: Blue Shift isn't quite that full of a game in its own right, but it seems \"just right\", with a reasonable arsenal, and a far more manageable length than the first.  Considering it's more of a sister story to the first game, I might even say it serves this function--and then some.  A short but sweet and enjoyable ride.  A memorable experience, it's worth checking out Half-Life: Blue Shift.","timestamp_created":1386372303,"timestamp_updated":1386372623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7943307","author":{"steamid":"76561198040349337","num_games_owned":836,"num_reviews":106,"playtime_forever":218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"An interesting insight into the original Half-Life story from a new perspective.","timestamp_created":1386362518,"timestamp_updated":1386362518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7933542","author":{"steamid":"76561198074406690","num_games_owned":266,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":152,"last_played":1443810750},"language":"spanish","review":"lo recomiendo","timestamp_created":1386297495,"timestamp_updated":1386297495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7915921","author":{"steamid":"76561198081513052","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":576,"last_played":1429629738},"language":"english","review":"Besides being short and not bringing nothing new to the table, it's still a fun game.

Released in 2001, 3 years after the original game. The development was handled by Gearbox - who one day would create games like Brothers in Arms and Borderlands. Blue Shift, was in fact their second game, so you could say that Gearbox was still in the process of learning.\n \nThe game consists of 5 lengthy chapters and 3 \"5 min\" chapters. I finished the game in 5 hours, so as you see, it's a pretty short game.\n\nOne thing that i did not like is that the plot did not really collide with the plot of Half Life 1 all that much. There were a few cameos, but overall it felt really separated. Basically, you help a group of scientists fix the teleporter and teleport out of the Black Mesa facility. The only cameo is at the start of the game when you see Gordon riding the train.\n\nGameplay wise, it's basically the same as the original game, except there are no \"Class 4\" Type weapons (gravity guns and such). The game also has a few puzzles here and there.\n\nIn the end though, i like the first expansion (Opposing Force) much more. It had it's own identity i would say.\n\nThis expansion is short, pretty much all assets are reused from the original Half Life, and thematically it just does not do a good job, unlike its predecessor - Opposing Force.","timestamp_created":1384961996,"timestamp_updated":1469976720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":44,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.778178095817565918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7684779","author":{"steamid":"76561198025027748","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1342335600},"language":"english","review":"If you played Half Life and enjoyed it, play this too.","timestamp_created":1384722616,"timestamp_updated":1384722616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7597134","author":{"steamid":"76561198018660341","num_games_owned":451,"num_reviews":74,"playtime_forever":336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":336,"last_played":1341471600},"language":"english","review":"Experience the game of Half Life through the eyes of Barney.

I think the points of criticism (no new Weapons, no Endboss, no new Enemies etc.) are valid considering the original Half Life and its quality. But surprisingly enough these points seemed very fitting to me. I mean after all we aren't the Hero of the story. We are nothing special at all. We are just a security officer that tries to get the hell out of the catastrophy he got into. Why should he use some super powered Weapons ? He uses what he can find. Why should he beat a giant Alien or Endboss ? He is simply trying to get away, not trying to save the world (like Rosenberg pointed out during the Elevator Scene). Other than that I have to say that I found the atmosphere to be really amazing. I felt like a confused lonely surviver trying to stay alive running for his life. All these dark coridors and the environment crumbling away. Electricity shooting out of walls and stuff like that. The biggest personal point of criticism for me is that it only took me 4 hours to complete the campaign on the hardest difficulty.

No new enemies, no new weapons, very short, uneventful, just honestly the same stuff from the main game. Nothing new besides a new set of rooms of Black Mesa to explore and go through. Pretty meh lots of glitches are not that fun.\n\n+Only $5 probably near $2 or so on sale\n+Exactly the same as Half-Life like everything about it besides the maps\n+Short? Ig\n+Cheats\n+Easy\n+Tutorial\n\n-Extremely short can be finished within an hour or so. The speedrun WR for this game is about 10 minutes\n-Not nearly as entertaining as the main game or Opposing Force. Just very basic no bosses no new enemies just very basic.\n-No bosses\n-No new enemies\n-No new weapons\n-Weird camera glitch that keeps making your camera angle snap back to a fixated position. Enabling mouse raw input in the settings appears to fix this\n-Several times you will just start walking on your own or firing your weapon without pressing anything\n-The part in the Captive Freight chapter where you are going through a set of stairwells and offices requires you to go outside and kill several soldiers by some cars. You are supposed to be shot by one soldier in particular in a window then go through the window in order to progress. However, he won’t break through the window unless you jump up near him, which I could only think you would do if you knew he was there from someone else’s walkthrough. Going back inside the stairwell without triggering the soldier coming through the window causes the door to lock making you unable to progress and are forever stuck as you cannot go back outside to go through the window.\n-Dr.Rosenberg's AI pathing when leading him back to the other scientist can be really problematic. Taking him to the bottom of the stairwell to progress through the lower levels will sometimes cause him to just run back up the stairs and back to where he spawned at. Trying to block him and interact with him again does nothing as his AI ignores you and runs away for no reason. Sometimes he will even run to the stairwell himself only to run back? So annoying he will eventually follow you for good after running back and forth several times. \n-Game has remote play? Yeah there’s no multiplayer in this whatsoever the remote play isn’t going to work it all\n\nThis is pretty much just an extension of gameplay so that you can play more Half-Life in a new set of maps. Nothing new besides that. The game itself is very short and uneventful and honestly would put this as not recommended but its $5 and probably damn near free on sale and its a 20 year old game like who even cares lol.","timestamp_created":1372983096,"timestamp_updated":1623550654,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543396234512329102","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1791209","author":{"steamid":"76561197998046529","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":100,"playtime_forever":467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":19,"last_played":1561370450},"language":"english","review":"The bluest Half-Life of them all.

Even after all this years it really holds well, and it's still a great entertainment. \n\nAlthough I kinda wish they would intertwine the story with original one to more degree and used opportunity to reveal more details from different perspective. Freeman is shown couple times, but wouldn't it be cool if you could sometimes see him running around, maybe accidentally helping you unlock a door or turn a power on (or off and make matters more difficult, that selfish bastard :). \n\nAlso It's kinda strange that as an ordinary (but brave) guard you're basically doing the same things as Gordon, only you're expected to do it without H.E.V. suit. Another great thing to see would be a little more humane and humorous side to the Calhoun having the worst job day ever. \n\nBut I guess it's easy now to throw all this ideas writing it on 2013, gaming was different back then (but still has it's charm).
