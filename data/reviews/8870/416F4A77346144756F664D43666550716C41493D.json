Me lo tengo jugado primero en la PS3, luego en una Xbox 360 y ahora en el PC, con todos y sus DLC's de antología. Panteón Marino diría que tuvo una historia un tanto floja, pues intentó conectar todos los vacíos argumentales que se quedaron entre Infinite y el primer Bioshock, sin conseguirlo del todo bien. Lo que sí pareció quedar claro es que a partir de Infinite la historia de Bioshock llega a comenzar realmente, y Panteón Marino sólo intentó conectar Infinite con el primer Bioshock, pero le faltó un poco más de sustancia argumental. Muchas cosas parecieron haberse quedado en el tintero y nunca se implementaron en los DLC's de Panteón Marino ni tampoco como posibles pistas en el juego base, pero igual me quedo con la historia principal que presentáron los DLC's, al menos por ahora, hasta que 2K Games saque una nueva entrega (del cual se rumorea que podría sacarla pero hasta ahora no se ha dicho nada oficial), y nos ayude un poco más con todo este embrollo de la historia. En cuanto a lo demás (jugabilidad, gráficos, ambiente, sonidos, música, todo OK).

The usage of vigors in the fight and jumping from one platform to another with your grappling hook is fast crazy and really satisfying.\nAction in this game the one thing that I love the most because there are many ways to eliminate enemies as creatively as you could. \nAction/Gameplay\nThe basic thing is your armory, which contains smaller guns, lighter automatic rifles, sniper based rifles with a scope, or some heavy stuff like machine guns or rocket launchers.\nThe more interesting type of weapon are,, vigors\", the thing that makes this game so unique. Vigors are your superpowers that you use in the middle of the fight and are recharged with salt. Let me give u a little example, you are out of ammo, hiding behind some barrel or wall and there are enemies ready to shoot you any moment, so you use vigor ,, Possession\" and turn one of the enemies against there own troops and escape while they are busy. I'm sure many would likely choose some more aggressive way like rushing into the action with vigor ,,Return to Sender\" and block all opponents firepower before reflecting it and throwing its all energy to them and if there is still someone who did survive you can always shoot them, stab them, ignite them, throw them over the edge of the map, lift them into the air and shock them with lightning, etc.\nStory\nThe story is happening in the city of Columbia floating in the skies. You are playing as Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt send to Columbia to find a young woman Elizabeth and for that service, your debt will be forgotten. Of course in your way will be many people trying to get her back and it wont be easy for you to always save her from them, except when you set your difficulty to easy.\nI must say this was the first BioShock game I ever played and didn't understand much of the story, it was too complicated and twisted with time travel and different dimensions that I was completely lost. After some time spent watching youtube videos explaining the story I finally get it. That of course doesn't mean the story is easy to ignore. Despite all that first time I played it, I enjoyed at least the action that the game provides.\n\nThis is one of the games that you can play as a total beginner with no knowledge of Bioshock lore who just wants to enjoy some action or a loyal fan of complex and complicated BioShock storyline. I can recommend this game to anyone who enjoys crazy action or revealing secrets of complicated and twisting storyline of BioShock.","timestamp_created":1594664121,"timestamp_updated":1594664121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72632686","author":{"steamid":"76561199070587695","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1326,"last_played":1628023058},"language":"russian","review":"Катарсис","timestamp_created":1594663291,"timestamp_updated":1594663291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72632375","author":{"steamid":"76561197987329500","num_games_owned":354,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1747,"last_played":1594552496},"language":"norwegian","review":"One of the best games of all time.

first of all, Bioshock Infinite is a good game i won´t doubt that.\nBut there are some downsides i can´t deal with.\nBut first everything what is good about BSI:\n-The graphics are quite good even in 2020\n-Columbia is such a beautiful place and very interseting and is the opposite of Rapture(The place of Part1 and 2)\n-the story is okay but not the best honestly\n-the characters are well written\n-the music is wonderful\n-the atmosphere is amazing (at the beginning i had goosebombs everywhere)\n-and the idea of a religous cult is very interesting\n\nNow my downsides:\n-you cannot save your game which is pretty annoying\n-they removed many gameplay mechanics(more about this later)\n-IT IS TOOOO EASY, of course there is the 99´s mode which is a bit challenging but you have to finish the whole game to enable it.Of course the difficulty should not be too hard but i played on the hard mode and i never had a problem at all because elizabeth just throws stuff like medikits and so on in your face when you need it!\n\nThese reasons are annoying but the biggest reason why I disliked this game is the gameplay or better said the changes of the gameplay in comparison with the games before.\nDon´t get me wrong. the gameplay on itself is not that bad but me as somebody who loved the 2. part( the 1. one too) can just be disappointed.\nFirst medikits like we know them doesn´t exist anymore. you cannot collect medikits like before and safe them for a later fight you can only use them right now when you find them.the same thing with the EVE or salt how it is called here.Little sisters doesn´t exist anymore and big daddys as well.the ADAM system was canceled and instead you buy your upgrades with normal money which wouldn´t be that bad if you hadn´t got so much of it.you have got so many ammo.That is why there is no need to explore the levels like in the parts before.it feels like i am playing a call of duty with less weapons a funnier setting and \"magic\".\n\nthis critic is very subjective and you could maybe even like the changes but for me bioshock infinite is just a try to get this franchise into the mainstream.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you have no problem with the gameplay and the difficulty you probably are going to have a very nice experience but if you want a BioShock like the ones before you are going to hate this game.\nI highly recommend the second part of Bioshock! The first is good too but the second one improved the mechanics of the first.\n\nThis critic may contain many grammar mistakes because my original language is german so please forgive me.","timestamp_created":1594642865,"timestamp_updated":1594642865,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496732026338577271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72616282","author":{"steamid":"76561198969415662","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":529,"last_played":1608379056},"language":"schinese","review":"很棒的一款游戏，就是不知道怎么弄简体中文，用的繁体中文，非常棒","timestamp_created":1594641581,"timestamp_updated":1594641581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72614976","author":{"steamid":"76561199015678019","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":196,"last_played":1595233885},"language":"schinese","review":"非常不错的一个游戏，画风也还可以，剧情出色，天空城构造的也很好","timestamp_created":1594639529,"timestamp_updated":1594639529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72613723","author":{"steamid":"76561198031534770","num_games_owned":1400,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":1789,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1110,"last_played":1595091079},"language":"french","review":"Derrière une direction artistique époustouflante, une compagne de route mémorable et charismatique et un jeu d'acteur excellent, se cache... un FPS raté. Vous ne pourrez porter que deux armes à la fois. Les toniques (plasmides) manquent d'inspiration. Vous serez constamment en manque de munition. Les combats manquent de punch, en grande partie à cause d'ennemis-éponges à balles. Il n'y a pas de sentiment de montée en puissance. Le joueur est systématiquement bridé dans son action.\nLa mini-map fait cruellement défaut, remplacée par une flèche directrice, emblématique d'un jeu extrêmement linéaire vous interdisant une exploration de ces lieux magnifiques.\nVous ne pouvez plus sauvegarder lorsque vous le désirez ; ce qui vous forcera à attendre 5-10 minutes que le jeu auto-sauvegarde et vous donne la permission de quitter.\nLe plus embêtant est que le sentiment d'être confronté à des ennemis vivants, dialoguant entre eux de manière crédible, avec une personnalité et un passé, disparaît totalement. Cela faisait la marque de fabrique de Bioshock 1 & 2. Vous n'aurez que trois ou quatre types d'ennemis... La catastrophe. De plus, ils se font rare. En 18 heures de jeu, je n'ai pas retenu une seule scène d'action vraiment mémorable.\nCe FPS vaut donc davantage pour son emballage que pour son contenu.

Je n'ai pas pris le temps de découvrir les sensations de chaque arme ou infusion (pouvoir) mais dans l'ensemble j'ai trouvé le feeling bien sans plus. La difficulté se fait clairement ressentir sur la fin du jeu avec une courbe de difficulté qui a un pic vers les deux tiers du jeu là aussi... je pense que c'est voulu au service de l'histoire.\n\nJe ne suis pas un grand joueur de FPS bien que je me pense au dessus de la moyenne et le combat final m'a donné beaucoup de fil à retordre en mode \"moyen\".\n\nDans l'ensemble une excellente expérience que je recommande vivement.
