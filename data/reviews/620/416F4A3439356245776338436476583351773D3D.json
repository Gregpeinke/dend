I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level. \n\nAnother thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.\n\nOverall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:\n\n10/10\nBUY THIS GAME.\n","timestamp_created":1441559197,"timestamp_updated":1441559197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17913597","author":{"steamid":"76561198165972216","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1127,"last_played":1602257844},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel hat eine Menge sarkastischen Humor was mir sehr gefällt :D 10/10","timestamp_created":1441553159,"timestamp_updated":1441553159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17913106","author":{"steamid":"76561198230943436","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":701,"last_played":1444770024},"language":"english","review":"This game is the best 10/10","timestamp_created":1441551293,"timestamp_updated":1441551293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17912585","author":{"steamid":"76561198093885179","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":542,"last_played":1528634336},"language":"koreana","review":"꿀잼","timestamp_created":1441549179,"timestamp_updated":1441549179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17909800","author":{"steamid":"76561198164521858","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1275,"last_played":1583055469},"language":"hungarian","review":"this is my favourite game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1441537075,"timestamp_updated":1441537075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17909754","author":{"steamid":"76561198234643388","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":16329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6326,"last_played":1647171467},"language":"english","review":"This is a fantastically addictive game that will really get the gears turning.

The only bits I got really excited were when you moved away from the testing facilities and walked around some parts of the facility with some dialogue here and there\n\nThe music, where there is some music, is really nicely done, so much so, that the music also creeped me out sometimes. The voice acting is superb, both from Glados and Wheatley. A big well done to the voice actor who voiced Wheatley, I absolutely fell in love with Wheatley from the opening of the game to even the end\n\nThe secrets the game holds is really surprising! And made me want to form the story from the origin, to Portal, to Portal 2 and beyond, which is really well done and made me really happy that Portal and its sequel to relate somehow to the Half-Life franchise, which really made me excited to play Half-Life in the near future! Valve games never seek to disappoint in anyway when it comes to storytelling!\n\nA new feature that was added into the game was Co-Op! Where you can basically play two other characters Atlas and P-body in new test chambers and with a new story and ending!\n\nOverall, even though the sequel does rinse and repeat some of the things that bothered me in the first game, it still did not disappoint me whilst I was playing, with its great characters and its great story! It never made me stop one bit, and this was the first game for me to sit down and play almost 3-4 hours in one sitting (Usually I don't play that long in one sitting)!\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]\n[i] THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

Creating two linked portals and gaining speed. P2 was sneakily hyped up and released in 2011 on PC, PS3 and X360. Also added coop play.\nIt also would later had \"free DLC\"/update that added extra chapter to coop campaign. And then get casual-friendly level editor and challenge mode. And it also had microtransaction where you can buy cosmetic stuff for your coop robot. But no one cares about that part and it has pemanent sale nowdays.\n\nNot sure how alive multiplayer is. It doesn't have browser of any sort, you either invite a friend or you are forced to random waiting player. I waited for 10 minutes and got none. It's 2015 by now after all. But it's a 2-player only coop, so it's better to play with friend than stranger.\n\nThe plot of main campaign is freshier than you would expect, while still remaining in same laboratories. Just ruined. With GlaDoS being resurrected. And funny eye-robot following you around, talking with British accent. And usual AAA-game storyline. With cutscenes and never ending chatter.\nYep, Valve's plot approach is no more there, it's more traditional. Which means that in this Valve game plot is more interesting in the game itself rather than in fan-made Wikia.\nAt least be thankful that it wasn't abusing main features of Portal 1, aka memes. Instead it tries to make it's own memes.\n\nOtherwise eh, single-player is bigger and fancier and longer. And such stuff. Nothing radical. A bit different atmosphere, more crazy. It does bring more features in enviroment that you can interact with. WIth portals. Mostly gels. So gameplay is improved, not stagnated. It uses more of lasers and um pulling force. I kinda like how it's more merciful when it comes to laser, it just knocks you around, while you main hero feels hurt.\n\nThough Valve lost a bit of a touch when it comes to pacing, ever since they stopped to work on Half-Life titles and moved off to competetive stuff. By the time you will get out from underground section, at 2/3 part of a game, you will feel exhausted and tired. At least I and my friend did. So not so great for beating in a single-sitting, a bit too dragged. Especially in underground section, where you actually have to search enviroments for that one batch of surface that you can place portal on.\n\nOn other hand, Coop is completely amazing. Well, at least experience with my friend was amazing, being bastards to each other while figuring puzzles for the first time, which require input from both users. It got enough of sillyness and ways to mess around while you are solving puzzles. Main part of Portal 2 for sure. But I imagine that it will be less pleasent with random griefers and trolls.\n\nIt also features rather unmemoriable music. Well, memoriable style, but not something I wanna be listening serapately. BUT it's implented in interesting way to give better atmosphere and feel during play. Like, when fast tempo music increases in volume when you are being knocked around by floor devices. One chamber even has menacing music out of three channel, which are activated when you turn on three laser grids. Great.\nOh, and graphics are your everyday pleasent Source. With style. Yes. Something. There, \"mention graphic\" quota done.\n\nOh. And it has one really nice developer commentary mode for both Single-player and Coop. Nope, not too focused on voice acting this time. Nice.\n\nOverall, Portal 2 is quite amazing and improvement over the first one, just because it's a sequel. It lost a bit of touch, but got more exciting plot, while also intoducing new elements. It does get a bit tiresome near the end. Yet Coop is great fun with friend.","timestamp_created":1441302040,"timestamp_updated":1441304146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512820541858673096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17864643","author":{"steamid":"76561198150120596","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1161,"last_played":1638571875},"language":"english","review":"THIS IS AWESOME","timestamp_created":1441298650,"timestamp_updated":1441298650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17864393","author":{"steamid":"76561198068117930","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1387234964},"language":"english","review":"Perfect story / short but great co-op - 9/10","timestamp_created":1441297763,"timestamp_updated":1441297763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17863542","author":{"steamid":"76561198150910665","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":117,"last_played":1435139860},"language":"russian","review":"Игрушка отличная , мозг после часа в ней кипит!

As soon as I heard of it I was hooked. I've played Portal (The original) and the graphics were a bit funky, quite a few bugs, and it was also a bit hard. Portal 2 continues the rather confusing storyline of Portal and enhances it by a lot! If you've never played Portal the beginning may be a bit confusing at first. The only hard part for me was when you ended up in the old Aperture Science area. I believe the name of the Chapter was \"The Fall\". I've played a bit of the Co-op and it was fun to play. Just try to actually do well or GLaDoS will go crazy and start insulting you just like she did with Chell. The graphics for this game are OUTSTANDING! After a while of playing you simply cannot stop unless someone pries your fingers off your keyboard. (Don't worry, that didn't happen to me) Although, after playing all this and figuring out all the puzzles, I have quite a few questions... What does Chell do after she escapes? Does she find civilization? Can she actually talk? Is she the only human alive now? And why the heck is Aperture Science in a shack?! This gives me the suspicion that they are going to make a Portal 3. You may be asking why. My reason is because in Portal, the story ends with a party escort bot dragging you back inside, and that's all she wrote. It fills your mind with questions. Then Portal 2 came out. In the ending of Portal 2, it simply ends with Chell escaping and Wheatley wishing he never betrayed Chell. Overall, I can tell the game had a lot of effort put into it. If I had to recommend this to anyone on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say 9. Why not 10? Because some of the puzzles can be quite difficult and can make you rage. Other than that, great game!
