If you havent got this game and like FPS then what the hell is wrong with you? This game is old now it released in 2004. I did my first playthrough of the entire Half-Life series this year so the experience is still fresh in my mind. The game follows a linear path yet has very open areas making the linear nature of the game seem less apparent. The gun play in this game is lacking by todays standards the guns sounds are sub par but this is just me nit picking. The story line for the game is incredible most of the story is told through the enviroment while the basic plot is told through the people that Gordon meets along his journey. The game is relativly long for an FPS it took me about 12 hours to beat the first time. I recomend playing this game multiple times though to fully grasp the story to help contribute to the massive story speculation of Half Life 3.You really have to play this game series before you die then only then will you understand how painful the wait is for Half-Life 3. 9/10","timestamp_created":1369657111,"timestamp_updated":1369657111,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7173858","author":{"steamid":"76561198090253657","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":666,"last_played":1577541114},"language":"russian","review":"Норм игра!Ток у меня на немецком!","timestamp_created":1369639743,"timestamp_updated":1369639743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7167698","author":{"steamid":"76561198089827357","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":267,"last_played":1421544869},"language":"english","review":"Okay, I know it's probably been said too many times to count but the Half Lifes series is one of the best things ever created.

I just think this game is too overrated.\n\nPros: Amazing physics engine, top notch sounds and voice acting, realistic A.I, for a old game it has AMAZING graphics, a wide variety of guns, good story.\n\nCons: Gordon Freeman is one of the most blank character ever, he could have so much potencial with the rich characters in the game, repetitive gameplay.\n\nOver-all: 8.0/10. A good game, could have been better if it had Co-op multiplayer. However there are Co-op mods in steam, one of them beeing ''Synergy''.\n\nSo, go buy it, and pray to Gabe Newell he makes a Ep.3 or HL3.","timestamp_created":1368037920,"timestamp_updated":1368037920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7005404","author":{"steamid":"76561198082338767","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":349,"last_played":1605967291},"language":"french","review":"LE FPS ! \n\nAller retourner dans vos foutue FPS commerciale tel que les Call Of Duty si vous ne connaisser pas ce jeux et son prédecésseurs !\n\nLa mytique saga qui a réveler le FPS ( Attention pas inventée je sais que Doom et Wolfstein était la avant lui ! ) L'incontournable de cher Valve !\n\nPour ce qui ne le savent pas Half - Life 2 est le PREMIER jeu a avoirs put être MODer alors aller chercher tout les mod / map / pack / suite en plus parce - que c'est pour moi LE MEILLEURS FPS DE TOUT LES TEMPS !\n\nJe tiens a précsiser que je prends le jeu dans son contexte a l'époque !\n\nGraphisme : 19 / 20 ( Inégaler jusqu'en 2008 alors qu'il est sortie en 2006 )\n\nSon et musique : 18 / 20 ( Qui n'a pas eu peur dans un métro abandonné où des hordes de zombies et de headcrab s'approche de vous dessus couplé a une musique stressante ! )\n\nScénario : 20 / 20 ( Totalement immersife dans son genre de par son univers unique et les personnages qui sont juste ultra charismatiques ! )\n\nA connaitre ou a avoirs !","timestamp_created":1368005582,"timestamp_updated":1392139895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477140843868255615","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5442190","author":{"steamid":"76561198049829657","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1477,"last_played":1493522106},"language":"english","review":"This game is the 2nd best source game behind Garry's Mod.\nIt has an extremely gripping storyline, it is worth every penny.
