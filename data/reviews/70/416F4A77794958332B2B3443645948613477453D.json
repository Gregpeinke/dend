After first playing the mod title, Garry Mod, which needs no introduction. I bought the Valve pack featuring many of a Valve's best and mediocre titles. I first played this game but around a very early part of the game, I couldn't figure out how to proceed so I quit and decided to jump straight to the sequel. Now returning to the game that started this amazing series, I got to say I really enjoy my second trip with the game I even managed to beat it!\n\nHalf Life is a First Person shooter set in the Black Mesa Facility during a catastrophe involving teleportation and aliens causing the facility to be over run by Aliens from the world named Xen. As the scientist Gordon Freeman you must fight your way through the facility and stop the Alien menace's attack. However, its just not Aliens you'll need to worry about, the HECU has come to fend off the Alien but they're not on your side at all and there is the mysterious Black Ops. \n\nThe Gameplay is much of a fight or flight style. Having you attack enemies quickly and efficiently to avoid taking damage or having a strategic method with hiding around cover or taking advantage of the environment. The levels are also design with puzzles and a bit of skill full platforming to break up the pace of the game. And with this game style comes plenty of familiar and unique weapons to Gordon's extensive arsenal, from Pistols to Shotguns and from RPGS to Xen's Hivehands there is plenty of variety in the weapons department. Plus there is even a bonus multiplayer mode! Overall for the gameplay, its clear why this gameplay was so well received then and now. \n\nFor the sequel their biggest breakthrough was the ground-breaking psychics at the time, for the humble original? Well, how about very complex AI? From Cockroachs to the hulking Gonarch, each entity in the game has some sort of unique AI setup, either used or unused. For example, Npcs will note the foul stench of a corpse if recently killed, certain enemies will not attack each other while other with butt heads during combat, or the Female Assassins and Tentacles reacting to noise that they hear. While most of this is very minor it helps make the game more real despite it aged graphics \n\nAs with the story, its just as interesting as it was back then, with the whole Black Mesa incident. Gordon being the first of Valve's silent protagonists help the player place themselves in the game as they were deciding Gordon's decisions on his journey through the game. If I had to give one gripe, I do think that most of the story explained through NPC is very tough to hear if there is background noise and unfortunately there are no subtitles like in the sequel, this can cause issue when a first time player doesn't know what to do since they couldn't hear their instructions. Very minor but I though I would mention.\n\nOverall, for Valve's first release. Half Life has aged but I think its still perfectly playable today, its Story, Gameplay and Setting make it one of the most memorable single player FPS campaigns and a fairly decent multiplayer game. While I don't down older games for having aged graphics I will say some of the levels haven't aged well such as the confusing Xen and a few of the puzzles. But recently the amazing remake of this game in Valve Source Engine, Black Mesa, is nearing completion with the Xen chapter and while at the time of this review, my computer isn't powerful enough to play the game, but I would say to play the remake if you desire the better engine.\n\n\"....Time, Dr. Freeman?\"\n\n\"Is it really that time again?\" - G-man.","timestamp_created":1576247402,"timestamp_updated":1576247402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.627329170703887939","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59768981","author":{"steamid":"76561198211227315","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1437,"last_played":1576360186},"language":"russian","review":"все","timestamp_created":1576247387,"timestamp_updated":1576247387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59767959","author":{"steamid":"76561198340999915","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1599000274},"language":"spanish","review":"SAQUEN HALF-LIFE 3","timestamp_created":1576246183,"timestamp_updated":1576246183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59767790","author":{"steamid":"76561198305271080","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":3628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":637,"playtime_at_review":612,"last_played":1659898098},"language":"german","review":"Es macht verdammt viel Spaß dieses Spiel zu Spielen.

Ciekawa jest również fabuła, która choć nie gra głównej roli, potrafi być naprawdę tajemnicza i utrzymać gracza do końca, a dodatkowo każdą lokację warto eksplorować, ponieważ zawsze można znaleźć coś interesującego. Oprawa graficzna nie ma tutaj znaczenia, ale trzeba przyznać, że trzyma się ona do dziś, a niektóre widoki wciąż zaskakują.","timestamp_created":1576160121,"timestamp_updated":1576160121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59713369","author":{"steamid":"76561198280629057","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1522,"last_played":1639764443},"language":"russian","review":".","timestamp_created":1576159532,"timestamp_updated":1576159532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59710738","author":{"steamid":"76561198091470514","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":27,"playtime_at_review":470,"last_played":1660492224},"language":"russian","review":"Думаю что за 21 год добавить тут особо нечего, крутая прорывная во всех смыслах игра, 12/10","timestamp_created":1576155910,"timestamp_updated":1576155910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59707468","author":{"steamid":"76561197971606171","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":808,"last_played":1578674180},"language":"german","review":"uraltes spiel aber immer noch interessant wenn man es nochmal spielt","timestamp_created":1576150635,"timestamp_updated":1576150635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59700599","author":{"steamid":"76561198881780643","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":960,"last_played":1585857564},"language":"english","review":"gud","timestamp_created":1576136641,"timestamp_updated":1576136641,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59697200","author":{"steamid":"76561198876018958","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":127,"last_played":1623958543},"language":"turkish","review":"Saygıdan aldım.","timestamp_created":1576128597,"timestamp_updated":1576128597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59696650","author":{"steamid":"76561198049539014","num_games_owned":324,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1009,"last_played":1576127428},"language":"koreana","review":"재밌음","timestamp_created":1576127452,"timestamp_updated":1576127452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59695225","author":{"steamid":"76561198802797138","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1597088492},"language":"brazilian","review":"Half-life é muito bom, comprei ele só pela nostalgia para poder jogá-lo novamente.

It has moderate gun-play and decent platforming. It's graphics are charmingly late 90's, and it's story is cleverly interwoven with it's two sequels (opposing force and blue shift) It has all the ingredients to be an amazing game to play, and yet I can't push myself to play more than an hour of it at a time.\n\nIt has the problem of being one of those games that is more fun to talk about than actually play.

It is quite clear that this game earns all the recognition it gets. The level design is interesting, the combat is intense, and the difficulty is certainly there. The story had me intrigued till the end. I found myself on the edge of my seat throughout the entire game. This game is extremely good and it has aged quite well. However, there are some minor issues with the game. If I am reviewing this game based on modern standards, it is quite clear that the graphics are outdated. This had absolutely no affect on gameplay though. Also, the way Gordon handles is very floaty unless you are crouching. It felt as if the character was walking on ice throughout the entire game. This was especially annoying during any precise jumping puzzles. Also, the last few chapters of the game were sub-par compared to the beginning. The area was interesting, but the level design felt weak, comprised of very annoying jumping puzzles. Also, the final boss was awful. You could stand behind a pillar and shoot at him for the majority of the fight. With this all being said though, most of the game is stellar and I would certainly recommend this to anyone who desires a good story-based FPS.","timestamp_created":1576116432,"timestamp_updated":1576116432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyIX3++4CdYHa4wE="}
