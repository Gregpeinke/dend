Never have I experienced such a relic of gaming brought forth to the human periphery with such genius, such valor, that shows the development of the video game industry within the past two decades. \n\nI have been wanting to play this game for the past six years, swearing to myself long ago that I would live long enough to get to learn the ins and outs of this elusive game. And that day has come at long last, my friends. Never have I been so transformed in my life by a creation of the human soul so meticulously crafted...\n\nThe engulfing darkness and intense silence enveloping the player sets the tone for this fantastic experience. Finding yourself in a horrifyingly deep, empty space, you play as Rick O'Shea: a condemnable spaceman who deals with the emotions of being forced to jump between tiny platforms in the middle of nowhere. The only items he commands at his disposal are 'discs,' seemingly terrible doughnuts that have hardened over years of inactivity, coming in a variety of flavors to meet his needs in battle. Despite existing on such a small area, it is possible he will come across other spacemen who aim to assassinate him for unknown reasons. However, the tragedy truly begins upon realizing Rick usually does not have a need for these weapons. Most of the time, he is forced to live in this never-ending spiral of space without coming across nary a human. The fear of finding others does not pain Rick; rather it is the fear of being alone that horrifies him to his core. Rick has become numb to being alone, so what good does him if he prepares to fight at every second of his life? And yet, he constantly reminds himself: what happens if he is not ready for a deadly encounter at the wrong moment; if another spaceman arrives on his series of platforms out of nowhere? The fear paralyzes him, and he proceeds to jump around the mere platforms he has in preparation for any enemies that may come to end his life... or, is it to appease his undying fright waiting for those who will never come? The magenta spiral below everything, symbolizing an endless fall to his death, reminds him at every waking second...

Or decapitate them.  There are 2 gamemodes, arena and deathmatch.  Arena is similar to arena mode in Team Fortress 2, as you cannot respawn.  There are teams, red and blue, with either 1 or 2 people on each team.  Unfortunately, there is only one map, rc_arena.  It's symmetrical, and pretty small.  Admittedly, I have not played much of this gamemode, because deathmatch is so much more fun.  Deathmatch is similar to arena, but there are no teams, and you can respawn.  There are 2 maps for this gamemode, rc_deathmatch and rc_deathmatch2.  They are pretty similar; they both have floors, and are both asymmetrical and much bigger than rc_arena.\n\n[h1] Controls [/h1]\nIt runs on the same engine as Half-Life 1, so it controls very similarly, though you cannot jump or crouch.\n\n[h1] Community [/h1]\nBarely anyone plays, but its fun when you can get a server of around 5 people.

Vejo-me eternamente endividado com qualquer divindade que tenha desencadeado o lapso momentâneo e a posição em que não só esta obra-prima é acessível, mas também que eu moro na conjuntura de viver entre os virtuosos que deram à luz a maravilha interativa. Como poderia uma única mente solicitar a inspeção de um monumento tão transcendente? Fique atento, caro leitor, que eu, nem qualquer homem, poderia esperar dissecar uma obra deste calibre por sua solidão. Diabos, recuso-me a considerar que um conjunto de mil fortes poderia decifrá-lo! No entanto, semelhante aos prodígios que a criaram, só posso esperar reunir as copiosas quantidades de gênio derramadas por esta obra e enfiá-la nos limites da língua inglesa.\nAo iniciar \"Ricochet\", você é recebido com tanto simbolismo para consumir que a maioria dos cidadãos comuns do nosso reino escolheria sair de uma tela tão densa e significativa. É demais para o homem com uma consciência anêmica. Eu mal sei por onde começar ao considerar levar este conhecimento ao povo comum. Começarei com como o trabalho aborda o aborígene da vida e da natureza em seu próprio nascimento. A tela anterior mostra muitas imagens, uma das quais tende a dominar a atenção do humano, pois é o ícone mais leviatã atualmente visível. O círculo gigantesco adornado por brilhos e estruturas futuristas é um símbolo do nascimento do indivíduo, bem como do nascimento do homem na era tecnológica. Permita-me elaborar. O anel neo-digital retratado é uma alusão óbvia ao canal de nascimento pelo qual a natureza concebeu cada humano para passar. O \"Ricochet\" prova isso através da proximidade da forma circular (ou melhor, um pouco poligonal) do artista. O momento é quase demonstrado como se sua cabeça estivesse prestes a passar, mas você ainda não está completamente fora. Você, caro leitor, pode estar se perguntando \"Bem, se fosse o canal de nascimento retratado, por que não há uma luz na outra ponta? Não é normalmente assim que o processo de nascimento é mostrado\"? Bem caro leitor, você está absolutamente certo! Observação importante para você, se eu mesmo o digo! No entanto, isto é claramente intencional coincidindo com a totalidade da premissa de \"Ricochet\". Vê, \"Ricochet\" propõe que em uma era digital que avança rapidamente, você nasce na sombra tanto quanto foi concebido originalmente, daí o design futurista da configuração. Se os artesãos desta peça pretendiam ou não implicar que estamos apenas indo nessa direção ou que já vivemos este conceito é inteiramente discutível. Há muito, muito mais a discutir sobre este objeto, mas por enquanto o quadro requer mais contexto, por isso vou deixá-lo assim. Passando para o próximo ponto de interesse, outra imagem se destaca. Sim, o ícone associado ao título do jogo (a ser discutido mais tarde) - o logotipo da característica. Na primeira observação, pode-se assumir que o logotipo é apenas uma recidiva de algo direto de um filme dos anos 80 - fonte e tudo mais. Seja como for, o visual tem uma profunda conotação. Quando o logotipo é girado 180 graus, a imagem parece imitar a seção inferior de um triângulo! É claro! Agora, como você poderia supor de tal trabalho, isto tem uma variedade de nuances. Entretanto, vou discutir minha interpretação do significado do logotipo. Veja, o fundo de um triângulo pode ser associado com as massas. O maior em número, mas ainda pisoteado por seus homólogos aristocráticos. Um caso clássico do proletariado contra a burguesia. O logotipo se prende ao trabalho - \"Ricochet\". Claramente, o autor da obra-prima tem a intenção de representar o homem comum. Não apenas isso, mas o logotipo sugere algo mais, pois é girado de modo que a parte inferior do triângulo esteja no topo, A rotação confronta a idéia de que esta peça dará aos proletários o poder de derrubar os poucos que os controlam e restaurar o poder de volta à própria humanidade. Embora isso não tenha acontecido, presumo que os artesãos que administraram \"Ricochet\" assumiram que isso iria acontecer. Essa é uma das principais razões para os cenários futuristas do jogo, afinal de contas. \"Ricochet\" não deve trazer luz ao povo até que a tecnologia e o povo tenham colidido uns com os outros, permitindo que o verdadeiro poder do trabalho se dissemine. Tal tenacidade legou o otimismo de minha alma para nossa posteridade. Que beleza de se ver, o dia \"Ricochet\" fornece seu néctar legítimo ao terceiro olho seco do público! Desculpe-me, eu tenho um pouco de paixão. No entanto, o principal ainda está de pé. Eu divago, há mais para discutir, e tão pouca coisa para uma vida inteira! O próximo elemento imensamente abstrato do título de \"Ricochet\" são suas quatro opções. É claro, um elemento importante para qualquer peça interativa: a escolha. \"Ricochet\" insinua que qualquer escolha que você fizer pode ser resumida em quatro decisões simples: \"Find, Create, Options, and Quit\". Permita que eu desenvolva cada uma dessas frases. Descobrindo, você escolhe fazer uma viagem de algum tipo para saciar sua curiosidade dada pela natureza. Você pode não apenas encontrar o que está por fora, mas também avaliar o que está por dentro. Criar... para criar... para fazer algo próprio. Usar suas habilidades para criar sua própria solução para qualquer problema. Criar é mostrar-se aos outros, como os artistas de \"Ricochet\". Opções - para alterar ou mudar como você vai resolver um problema. Você pode não resolver a solução da maneira mais eficiente, mas ao mudar a maneira como você opera, você pode evitar qualquer feedback negativo que alguém possa receber. E, finalmente, desistir - para parar, para anular qualquer progresso de seu coração e de sua mente. Para deter o mal, ou para abafar o bem. A escolha mais ameaçadora e dura de todas elas. Cada uma dessas escolhas pode ser entrelaçada, mas cada uma delas constrói uma experiência única. Seguindo minhas simples observações, as duas primeiras opções dizem especificamente a palavra \"Servidor\", juntamente com \"Encontrar\" e \"Criar\". É minha humilde opinião que a palavra \"Servidor\" serve como uma oportunidade para os criadores manifestarem uma dissecação das religiões e suas divindades e como elas são encontradas por muitas pessoas, e como cada uma delas também foi criada por muitas pessoas. Um \"Servidor\" é alguém que, bem, serve a outro homem. Muitos olham para os deuses como meros reflexos da humanidade, mostrando-os como perdão ou bênção, em vez de um criador solitário de todos. Os autores de \"Ricochet\" apontam a ironia óbvia de que a humanidade tende a se adorar quando estabelece religiões baseadas em torno de deuses. Estas divindades, embora em um nível superficial sejam mais elevadas do que os humanos, estão meramente lá para servir como uma tocha para mostrar ao homem seu caminho. Ricochet mostra estas duas opções uma ao lado da outra para demonstrar o quão cômico e tolo parece ser o conceito de religião. Embora você possa não concordar pessoalmente com essas declarações (e eu também posso não concordar), é a visão da humanidade que o trabalho constrói. Verdadeiro ou não, o trabalho ainda está de pé. Embora existam muitos outros caminhos da tela inicial, um homem não pode vê-los todos. Eu, por exemplo, não posso esperar compreender todos os conceitos exibidos. Portanto, devo continuar minha análise. Sem entrar nas conseqüências ainda imensamente compactas para selecionar uma das frases, os sistemas de \"Ricochet\" têm uma série de implicações. Em primeiro lugar, você, o jogador, controla um indivíduo claramente hominóide. Você representa um membro do público. Uma representação da base do triângulo de classe, como discutido anteriormente. Neste futuro, Você é colocado contra outro combatente. Duas equipes opostas se competem contra.","timestamp_created":1605478856,"timestamp_updated":1605478856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79288493","author":{"steamid":"76561198414434988","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1659273544},"language":"english","review":"Perfection","timestamp_created":1605415495,"timestamp_updated":1605780706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79286070","author":{"steamid":"76561198217542783","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":58,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1655074544},"language":"english","review":"Servers are dead, great game otherwise.","timestamp_created":1605411067,"timestamp_updated":1605411067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79261436","author":{"steamid":"76561198094291466","num_games_owned":755,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":22,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":22,"last_played":1594080636},"language":"english","review":"Happy 20th birthday!","timestamp_created":1605373724,"timestamp_updated":1605373724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.595907628536224365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79241212","author":{"steamid":"76561198808662868","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1605345070},"language":"russian","review":"Ну раз сегодня ей исполняется 20 лет, то можно и пожертвовать обзором.

This game is the definition of a masterpiece. Released in 2000 by Valve Corporation as an official modification for their obscure game Half-Life from 1998, this game stood out from the rest due to its marvelous execution, perfect gameplay, among other factors. First of all, the presentation. It's an ambigous, futuristic space-like ambient that fits like a glove to not only the game, but the time it came out. When starting, you listen to some beautiful sound effects and you see multiple men, dressed in colors and metal armors, with a visionary concept of how clothing would be in the future, shooting at each other with laser-like discs. Right from the beginning, you realize how masterfully crafted and polished the game is. The gameplay also enters in this category of perfection. The player smoothly moves throughout the scenario that by itself is a work of art, with extreme jumps, also a vision of the gravity in the future. The attacks are perfectly balanced, with only three regenerating discs, alongside unique powerups, never before - or after- seen. The graphics are beautiful, incredibly photorealistic, aesthetically pleasing. Every model, every part, every polygon in the entire game is beautifully made by the highest professionals in the industry. The sound design is simply revolutionary. Featuring realistic, high-quality sounds of futuristic battlefields, along with blood-curling, well-made screams, it makes you feel like you are in the game with an overall never-before seen immersion not even VR can replicate. Words can't describe how perfect this game is. This is, without a doubt, the best game ever made.","timestamp_created":1604427815,"timestamp_updated":1604427815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.651971518993377686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78401373","author":{"steamid":"76561198384717112","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":73,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1637637011},"language":"english","review":"perfect game almost as good as battlegun but not really","timestamp_created":1604069900,"timestamp_updated":1604069900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78373536","author":{"steamid":"76561199006407957","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":19,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1656903528},"language":"english","review":"i just want to say something just like tf2 can you add a command to add bots for this game and also deathmacht classic deathmacth classis half life 2 and tf classic please make it so you can add bots but all in all it is a good game.","timestamp_created":1604024086,"timestamp_updated":1604024086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78172368","author":{"steamid":"76561198180845457","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":308,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1627945735},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра, cool, только онлайн давно помер!
