Portal 2 is the drastic improvement of the original Portal with amazing voice acting, story telling, and gameplay. You play as the character Chell who wakes up in containment and is thrust back into her old surroundings as a former test subject. There is a deeper story to this game that I'm not going to spoil in this review, but it is a good one. As you may have figured out already, you are equipped with one weapon: A portal gun. This gun creates two holes on any white surface, one orange, one blue, in which you and other objects can pass through. You goal is to use this gun and a variety of other testing elements to help you complete many test chambers and get through hours of puzzles. The great thing about this game is that the dialouge, the story, and the sheer joy of completing a test chamber is enough to keep you addicted to this game. But you have to actually PLAY the game for yourself to enjoy it and appreciate how well-crafted it is. I'm such a huge fan of portal that not only have I played through it on steam, but I've also played it multiple times on my 360. The other great thing about this game is the Co-op, which offers many more hours of fun gameplay and humourus moments in a whole nother story with two unique characters: Atlas and P-Body. I CANNOT reccomend this game enough.","timestamp_created":1435118048,"timestamp_updated":1435118048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16666215","author":{"steamid":"76561198149837071","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1437732595},"language":"english","review":"Mindfucking simulator 10/10","timestamp_created":1435115345,"timestamp_updated":1435115345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16666032","author":{"steamid":"76561198086036952","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":571,"last_played":1558751952},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo fantástico, sem palavras.\n\njogabilidade ótima\ngraficos muito bons\nHistória fantástica\n\n11/10","timestamp_created":1435114696,"timestamp_updated":1435114696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16664988","author":{"steamid":"76561198027945168","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":777,"last_played":1638470341},"language":"english","review":"ohh yeah!","timestamp_created":1435110542,"timestamp_updated":1435110542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16664720","author":{"steamid":"76561198110754471","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":3421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2887,"last_played":1586585447},"language":"english","review":"Gameplay 10/10, story 10/10, characters 10/10, atmosphere 10/10, totally AWESOME!","timestamp_created":1435109493,"timestamp_updated":1435109493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16664510","author":{"steamid":"76561198130564617","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3143,"last_played":1499741860},"language":"english","review":"\n;0","timestamp_created":1435108700,"timestamp_updated":1435108700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16663894","author":{"steamid":"76561197961021429","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":7967,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7104,"last_played":1512713630},"language":"english","review":"This game is amazing, try it. :D","timestamp_created":1435106529,"timestamp_updated":1435106529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16663518","author":{"steamid":"76561198092293608","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1270,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1560527373},"language":"french","review":"Je m'attendais à enchaîner des salles de test une par une mais.....\nWaaaaah\nGé - nial !!","timestamp_created":1435105163,"timestamp_updated":1435105163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16663461","author":{"steamid":"76561198036867198","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":567,"last_played":1507828105},"language":"english","review":"If you love puzzle games and black humor,that's a game for you\nPS:Still don't know if the cake was a lie or not","timestamp_created":1435104951,"timestamp_updated":1435104951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501163959503173828","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16663154","author":{"steamid":"76561198138258151","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1858,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1500488535},"language":"english","review":"Very good storyline.

And while it is not absolutely necessary to have played the original Portal, it is highly recommended.\n\n  Starting off where Portal ended, you are a test subject for for Aperture Science that wakes up in a stasis chamber, only to be put back into stasis for tens of thousands of years. Until, the facility's power runs out and you awaken.\n\n  Being set so long after the events of Portal 1, there has been enough time for much of the Aperture facility to be reclaimed by nature or to just fall apart from age. This introduces new atmosphere that makes progressing through the game much less repetitive.\n\n  Throughout the story, more and more mechanics come into play and are utilized by their integration into the world. This allows for more diverse and enjoyable puzzles to be solved. From Aerial Faith Plates, to Propulsion gel, puzzles continue to get more complicated and more interesting.\n\n  With a compelling story, an atmospheric and unique world, and many interesting mechanics to use, Portal 2 is a must have for anyone that enjoys action, story-driven, atmospheric, or puzzle games. 95/100","timestamp_created":1435083212,"timestamp_updated":1435083212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16654507","author":{"steamid":"76561198096444974","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2339,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":928,"last_played":1571996467},"language":"russian","review":"Portal 2 - сиквел Portal, который продолжает историю о противостоянии подопытной девушки Челл и местной, главной системы в лаборатории - GlaDOS.\n\nПо сравнению с первой частью игра прибавила в сюжете. И если в Portal осторо-сюжетные события начинали происходить ближе к концу игры, то во второй части, всё начинается практически с самого начала. Действия игры происходят после многих лет событий первой части. Главная героиня по имени Челл просыпается после анабиоза и обнаруживает заброшенную лабораторию разрушенной. Пытаясь выбратся из комплекса, в чём ей помогает некий Уитли(модуль персональности), Челл натыкается на GlaDOS. После чего, снова приходится проходить старые добрые тестовые камеры, используя портальную пушку. Сюжетно игра имеет несколько неожиданных событий, что в свою очередь вызывает ещё больший интерес в игре. К примеру, в середине игры мы попадем в старую часть лаборатории, где можно узнать предысторию развития комплекса и изучения порталов. Удивила так же неожиданная концовка.\n\nНо больше всего игра порадовала своим обновлённым геймплеем, нововведениями и блестящими тестами. Принцип игры остался таким же. Используя портальное устройство, функции которого обусловлены созданием двух порталов, сквозь которые можно безпрепятственно проходить и проносить предметы, мы проходим сложные участки и задания. Карты постороены таким образом, где нам необходимо правильно уметь применять порталы, для прохождения тестов. И помимо классических элементов, пришедших из Portal, появилось огромное кол-во новых. К ним отсносятся \"транспортная воронка\", в котором может пассивно передвигатся игроку в одном направлении, однако его можно перенаправлять с помощью порталов, \"мосты плотного света\"- которые позволяют проходить с помощью них опасные участки, а так же другие... \n\nОсобо понравившимся нововведением для меня является гели трёх видов. Каждый из них имеет свои свойства, которые применимы в разных ситуациях. К примеру на одном из них, можно быстро разогнатся, на другом высоко подпрыгнуть или гель, который позволяет делать порталы на антипортальных поверхностях. Все эти новые элементы дают огромный потенциал для создания различных логических задачек и тестов. Игра раза в три длиннее по продолжительности от своего предшественника. При этом сложность повышается постепенно, а поочерёдная подача новых элементов, придаёт игре большей разнообразности.\n\nОтдельно скажу об дизайне карт. На смену минимализму первой части, приходит уже более детализированая картинка. Карты стали более насыщены, с большим кол-во деталей и предметов. Ну а их разноплановость вызывает дикий восторг. Заброшенная, разрушенная лаборатория, старый комплекс лаборатории в ретро стиле, новая часть. Всё это можно наблюдать на протяжении игры. Некоторые тестовые карты, траснформируются и изменяются в реальном времени.\n\nВ игру был добавлен мультиплеер для двух человек. Играть в нём необходимо за двух подопытных роботов, на которых GlaDOS проверяет работоспособность тестов. Данный режим отличается своими головоломками, где надо думать несколько шире и глобальнее чем в одиночной кампании. Каждый из игроков имеет свою портальную пушку, и порталы сделанные ими имеют связь лишь между собой. Однако, можно проходить в портал, созданный вашим напарником, чего практически всегда требует игра.\n\nКо всему прочему, игра имеет поддержку мастерской, где можно скачать понравившийся мод или карту от различных пользователей. А встроеный простенький редактор карт, позволит вам побыть самому в роли создателя тестов.\n\nПрекрасная игра и потрясающее продолжение Portal. Интересная одиночная кампания, не менее весёлое кооперативное прохождение, хороший сюжет. Игра однозначно стоит своих денег.\n\nОценка: 9/10","timestamp_created":1435081636,"timestamp_updated":1435081636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16654492","author":{"steamid":"76561198167168421","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1244,"last_played":1481532240},"language":"brazilian","review":"Sim, gostei do jogo sim, é bem divertido, desafiante, é de se passar horas jogando... muito legal mesmo.","timestamp_created":1435081602,"timestamp_updated":1435081602,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16654331","author":{"steamid":"76561198090629547","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2539,"last_played":1462002186},"language":"english","review":"Everything fun about the first PORTAL, and then some.
