Una historia impactante, unos gráficos excelentes y una jugabilidad adictiva. \nLa historia gira alrededor de Elizabeth que se encuentra \"atrapada\" en una torre a la cual deberemos acudir para poder rescatarla y nosotros estaremos en el papel de Booker DeWitt. \nLos enemigos y enfrentamientos son tan intensos que es dificil no perderse en el mundo de Columbia (una ciudad flotante). Aunque todo lo que conlleva este juego merece una felicitación, lo que más destaca, desde mi punto de vista, es el argumento que fue tan cuidado y con un final tan impactante que hará explotar tu cabeza en 100 pedazos. \nPróximamente se estrenará el último DLC del juego en cuestión donde veremos en acción como nunca antes a Elizabeth.

The story and progression is quite linear, but that isn't to say it is a bad story. It's quite good. The game looks gorgeous, comes with gruesome kills and a whole bunch of find-it achievements that were designed to cause your inner OCD child to have a meltdown, seeing as you can't backtravel if you missed something. \n\nMy biggest complaint is the bland combat. While visually exciting to watch the effects of certain vigors on the enemies, you're really only fighting them to progress the story and watch the violent outcome of your light gun. There is no grit to the combat. There's no rush from escaping impending doom, no real penalty for dying (even played on hardest difficulty, which I highly recommend to anyone who has ever used a mouse before), and with the exception of one obtusely difficult enemy which you only see a few (3?) times in the game, it's a walk in the park. Not including the one boss, and counting different colored grunts using a shotgun versus a machinegun as one type, there are only five (5!) enemies in the game. You're shooting things to watch them go boom so you can listen to Elizabeth discover the outside world.\n\nIf the exploration factor and the storyline wasn't as good as it is, I'd have put this down and been upset at my purchase. Really the only thing that made it difficult was trying to get all the achievements in one playthrough, a choice I decided upon as my own difficulty modifier, because the game was simply too easy.\n\nBuy it on sale, or wait for a sale. Also so far, season pass has Burial at Sea pt 1 (took me 2 hours, and that was turning over every stone and attempting all achievements), and a wave mode where you compete for high score with CiTC. Unfortunately, a wave mode is only fun if the combat is entertaining.\n\nTips:\n\n-Play on hard.\n-Once you leave an area, it's gone. Do your searching, side questing, and loot hording before you leave the area (you're prompted yes/no).\n-Upgrade the items you like. You will not obtain enough money to upgrade even half of your items and vigors. I died maybe 6 times (the only way to lose money, even then it's VERY minimal, almost trivial) through the whole game, and I'd like to think I hoovered every inch of everywhere.\n-You'll have enough lockpicks. Open it. It's always worth it.\n-If you buy the DLC, the only way to get your infusions is at the BEGINNING of the game. Don't try the game, then buy the DLC. You'll miss out on half of your early bird bonus.\n-If Elizabeth stops to look at a random pile of junk, you probably should too. 75% of the time, there's something there.","timestamp_created":1392137792,"timestamp_updated":1392137901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503414034843444824","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9055026","author":{"steamid":"76561198031010639","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2087,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1672,"last_played":1424980938},"language":"english","review":"Just like the previous BioShock games, Infinite is filled with an encapsulating ambiance that immerses you into an amazing world that is changing slowly and constantly.

It's sad, I really wanted to like this game being a big fan of bioshock 1 and 2. What I disliked the most was the combat. Running out of ammo is a huge pain in the ass in this game, it basically means you are dead especially if you are also out of vigor. Finding more vigor is a pain in the ass as well. I didn't particularlly like any of the vigors. The combat feels....wonky. Thoughout the whole game I could never have fun fighting. None of your skills seem to go together very well. The tougher enemies were boring and/or cheap. Fighting handymen is basically going on a rail until the handyman jumps on the rail, then jumping off and hitting the handyman until he's stopped being electrocuted and jumping back on the rail to repeat. The enemies I found were as boring and generic as the weapons I used to kill them. Some of the weapons you can use are very shitty, and you are forced to use them if you run out of a good weapon ammo and that weapon is the only thing close by.  I could go on and on but I'm sure there are other reviews that explain these problems much better than I can. What kept me going to the end of the game is the story, which is very well done.

Финал который ставит почти все точки над \"И\", но не все. Еще остается простор для домысливания. Эффект после прохождения игры близок к эффекту создаваемому концовкой фильма \"Начало\".\n\nИгра примечательна тем, что нас не сразу бросают в бой, дав консервный нож в одну руку и плазмид (который здесь называется \"вигор\") в другую. Мы можем побродить по Колумбии, удивиться чудесам инженерной мысли, красивым пейзажам, спокойствию чарящему на улицах.

Она не просто компьютерный болванчик, который будет молча бегать за вами, периодически попадая под огонь противника. Она как живая. То подойдет, рассмотрит постер, то присядет, то включит игровой автомат. В бою от нее только польза, потому что регулярно она будет находить и давать вам патроны, аптечки и соли (аналог адама).\n\nВ общем игра вышла исключительно хорошей, с интересным сюжетом, нескучным геймплеем и невероятно красивыми видами.

Но коридорный шутер того же качества, что и предыдущие части. Благодаря подачи сюжета, всех условностей рельс, по которым приходится бежать, просто не замечаешь. Средств уничтожения противников – более чем достаточно. Хочешь пулей, а хочешь магией. Хочешь сам, а хочешь натрави другого.  Картинка действительно прекрасна, как и ранее. На фоне всей этой сказочности и яркости особенно неожиданно смотрится первое довольно кровавое убийство в игре .Музыка, персонажи – все на высоте. Только как по мне - перестрелок можно было бы и добавить немного. Отдельно хотелось бы отметить няшную героиню – ей можно долго любоваться. Однако где те 10 из 10, что ей все ставят – мне не ясно. Игра просто действительно качественно сделана, но она не привносит в жанр чего-то нового и не открывает новые горизонты. Если бы мне кто-то раскрыл бы ее величие – был бы благодарен.\nЧто касается сюжета – последние мгновения все портят. Если поначалу действительно интересно, то ближе к концу все становится понятно и обыденно.

Создатели культовых игр System Shock и оригинального Bioshock продолжают соблюдать свои традиции. Необыкновенный сюжет, который с самого начала повествования захватывает вас, а под конец игры поражает. Если вы играли в оригианльный Bioshock, то   вы не останетесь разочарованы. На первый взгляд, кажется, что эта игра не имеет никакого отношения к той игре 2008 года, но это не так, и всё тесно взаимосвязанно. Дизайнеры постарались на славу и создали пропитанный атмосферой тех времён мир, в котором вам не предстоит заскучать ни на минуту. Особенно любопытные игроки смогут найти приятные мелочи оставленные разработчиками, не буду говорить какие. А после прохождения игры вам наверняка захочется пройти её вновь. Причиной тому сюжет, манера повествования. Кому то покажется неприемлемым, что для того чтобы самому понять всё что произошло, необходимо быть внимательным, а то и пройти игру не один раз, но как по мне это не недостаток, это большой плюс. В общем я не вдаваюсь в подробности, вердикт всему вышесказанному: вам стоит в это сыграть, чтобы понять до каких высот могут дойти современные игры и что не всё ещё потеряно и в мире есть разработчики игр, которые могут вас удивлять до замирания сердца. \n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1391968095,"timestamp_updated":1391968095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587138831615447998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9031653","author":{"steamid":"76561198030518502","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":872,"last_played":1391880330},"language":"french","review":"J'adore la fin","timestamp_created":1391954560,"timestamp_updated":1391954560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9031630","author":{"steamid":"76561198113477904","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":683,"last_played":1494403461},"language":"russian","review":"Замечательная игра с хорошим сюжетом и графикой, 10\\10","timestamp_created":1391954419,"timestamp_updated":1391954419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9031017","author":{"steamid":"76561198063782863","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1118,"last_played":1525024942},"language":"russian","review":"Приятная графика,отличный сюжет, яркая и интересная игра!","timestamp_created":1391951219,"timestamp_updated":1511388391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488886356353759766","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9030846","author":{"steamid":"76561198069807207","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1991,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":860,"last_played":1432870706},"language":"brazilian","review":"dando erro ao iniciar tentei de tudo e nao resolvei, nao comprem, vai ser dinheiro perdido!","timestamp_created":1391950287,"timestamp_updated":1391950287,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9030381","author":{"steamid":"76561198101614964","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":37,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1392411676},"language":"english","review":"Just plain awesome","timestamp_created":1391947317,"timestamp_updated":1391947317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490196079015731812","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9030122","author":{"steamid":"76561198050120194","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1085,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":842,"last_played":1621610443},"language":"russian","review":"плюсы: \n-Интересный сюжет\n-Геймплей из разных способностей и оружий\n-Эллизабет\n-Вдохновляющая атмосфера\nМинусы\n-Немного нудновата в середине игры\nМоя оценка:9\\10\nКомментарий: Увидев концовку я понял, что игра шедевр!","timestamp_created":1391945695,"timestamp_updated":1391945695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9030118","author":{"steamid":"76561198066106318","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2620,"last_played":1487604611},"language":"tchinese","review":"如果這個遊戲還不好玩的話 就沒有遊戲是好玩的了","timestamp_created":1391945674,"timestamp_updated":1391945674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9030084","author":{"steamid":"76561198017207137","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2178,"last_played":1483182986},"language":"spanish","review":"Fántastico.

After buying it on the steam winter sale it still took me 2 months before I took the time to play it. \n\nA few tings bother me, such as dying in battle doesn't really reset the battle, the lack of saving manually and loading, playing at Hard isn't really hard, the enemy just gets a bit more stubborn.\n\nBesides from those points, it's probably one of the better games I have played, I really love the story (some things make less sense but overall). I really like that Elizabeth doesn't  follow you in a sense as a linear sense and instead walk around in the area where you are. \nI really like the way the story goes, it has a few twists, some not so obvious as others. It feels like you have a choice in some scenes when you actualyl can't really change the outcome. Early in the game I started to think of some things that later turned out to be so but during that time I was unsure and it powered me to play more to find out. \n\nThe game has a range of weapons but you can only carry two weapons at any given time which forces you to pick one lighter weapon but with more ammo and one heavy hitter for those tougher enemies. \n\nThe Vigors/plasmids that are available are quite fun but I found that the \"Return to sender\" was a bit too overpowered. I mean, absorbing all bullets and then voila, you have a really powerful grenade. And with some boosts you can get ammo this way to...\n\nBottom line, this is a really good game. Compared to the original bioshock this game has a more obvious story from the beginning and it powers you to play more. It misses some elements from the original game where it was you against a crazy underwater city where you had to survive. In this game you have a clear goal that will affect how you percieve the gameplay and it's no longer you being alone against \"crazy\" people.\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1391872298,"timestamp_updated":1391872298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9017297","author":{"steamid":"76561198047946040","num_games_owned":328,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":89,"last_played":1392389095},"language":"english","review":"Just bought the tiple pack for R$ 13.99 i love you steam and your bugs!\nBtw, someone will be fired","timestamp_created":1391864744,"timestamp_updated":1391864744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9015787","author":{"steamid":"76561198028155880","num_games_owned":388,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":524,"last_played":1441599135},"language":"koreana","review":"와... 스토리 하나는 정말 대박이네요...\n그런데 슈팅게임으로서는 중반부부터 약간 질리는 감이 없지않아 있습니다.","timestamp_created":1391854244,"timestamp_updated":1391854244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9014917","author":{"steamid":"76561198042414905","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1090,"last_played":1617119865},"language":"english","review":"I would reccommend playing through the first two games before this one, for story reasons.
