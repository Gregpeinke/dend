Si, eso fue lo que pensé cuando pude despegar los ojos de la pantalla después de jugar al Portal. Bueno, esto nos ha pasado a todos pero es que pude separarme del ordenador no porque se fuera la luz (tengo un SAI XD) o porque mi madre y/o novia me estuvieran fustigando para que lo dejara (ya pasan todos de mi XD) sino porque se termino el juego. Bromas aparte, no soy de los que se suelen terminar un juego del tirón y con este he estado 4 horas delante de el y para mi que llevaba minutos.\n\nEntrando en el juego en si (aunque a estas alturas casi todo el mundo sepa de que va) explicare un poco la dinamica:\n\nTodo comienza cuando te despiertas y una voz robótica te guia (mas o menos...) por unas misteriosas instalaciones osea, que es una incógnita todo. La susodicha ordenata se llama GLaDOS y te enseña a usar una pistola que crea portales tipo agujero de gusano entre dos superficies. Un portal es azul y otro naranja de forma que cuando caminas hacia un portal azul, apareces en el lugar donde colocaste el portal naranja y viceversa. Con este aparatito deberás resolver puzzles que pondrán a prueba tu lógica donde además tendrás que tener en cuenta la gravedad y la inercia. También deberas ocuparte de los únicos enemigos que encontraras, unas graciosas torretas. Con la ayuda de esta pistolita debes ir avanzando quebrándote la cabeza de camino, lo mejor de este juego es que en ningún momento te sientes aburrido u frustrado (yo soy mu de frustrarme con los puzles sobre todo si hay cronometro de por medio) a pesar de poder estar media hora para poder salir de una habitación.\n\nEn cuanto a los gráficos nada que decir muy buenos para su época (usa motor Sourse de HL2: Episode ), cualquiera que me conozca sabe que para mi lo primero de un juego no son los gráficos, pero si valoro mucho el apartado artístico y en Portal hicieron un gran trabajo en la creación de los escenarios.\n\nEl apartado musical es bueno, un poco repetitivo, pero apenas te fijas en ella porque va acompañando la historia de forma sutil, complementándose a la perfección. Sin duda alguna hay dos cosas que nunca olvidare de este juego, la primera es GLaDOS, para mi uno de los mejores personajes de videojuego que existe. Su voz, su sarcasmo, ironía y humor son inolvidables. La otra cosa especial es.... bueno me da un poco de pudor.... este juego ha conseguido que me enamore de un personaje ficticio... seria algo \"normal\" si no fuera porque el personaje es un cubo del tamaño de un horno que ni habla ni na de na.... jajajajaja y luego me hacen matarlo (dos de las cuatro horas de juego me las pase llorando XD) ¡Te odio GLaDOS!.\n\nTodo no va a ser bonito claro, para mi lo malo es lo corto que se hace la historia (gran parte de la culpa la tiene también el jueguecito, si te aburrieras no te lo comerías de un tirón y seria más largo jajaja). de todas formas yo prefiero bueno y poco que mucho y malo (aunque si fuera bueno y mucho mejor claro).\n\nQuitando esto el juego vale cada céntimo que te puedas gastar, buena historia, excelente jugabilidad, 0 bugs, muy muy pulido, momentos muy graciosos con frases muy muy épicas que quedaran para la historia de los videojuegos... Si es corto, pero tiene los mejores créditos que he visto en mi vida, joder me dio casi mas pena que terminaran los créditos que el juego (no es broma ya vereis si jugáis).\n\nEn fin, si amas los videojuegos tienes que jugar esta saga si o si. Yo otro día iré a por el 2, hoy no que si no me tienen que poner una vía con suero glucosado...\n\nYa me callo que me he pasao escribiendo, solo comprarlo, jugad y solo recordad una cosa:\n\n\"The cake is a lie\"","timestamp_created":1421675064,"timestamp_updated":1421675064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14065595","author":{"steamid":"76561198131070624","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":25959,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3124,"last_played":1655806444},"language":"english","review":"Portal\n\nI've been through Portal twice and it is quite the experience. When talking to my friends, I have used the word insane to describe it. The game wants a few of things from you. Problem solving, dexterity, and to be quick. As you travel through one room to the next you may need only one of these tools, but there will be times you will need all of them to find the solution. Now in my sixties, I wondered if I still had good enough hand and eye coordination. I guess I have enough, because I got through the game. Younger people will probably do better then I did. It becomes obvious the games intention is to get your brains juices flowing, which is good for young minds. How often did I turn to find myself spinning past the opening I wanted to go through and thus losing the precious time needed to complete the task; I lost count. \n\nThere are two phases to the game. The first is a series of tests a computer program will talk you through and the second is a dark side that will remain mostly unspoken of, because that is part of the fun of this game and for the people who have no knowledge of this it would be a spoiler to mention to much of this. It actually is where the game becomes the most fun. Just know that the computer will not be helping you, remember Hal from the film \"2001 a Space Odyssey\", and to keep an eye on the walls for painted directions to tell you where you need to continue in your journey. \n\nAs you travel from dilemma to dilemma, you need to remember that you can squat and leap, besides just walking. You would be surprised how far you can leap from a standing position. You will being doing these a lot, so keep them in mind as you ponder a solution to the problems you face. You will also find yourself standing on moving objects. Be prepared to leap on to things as they move past you.\n\nAs I stated above, the game requires problem solving and good hand and eye coordination, I personally feel this would be good for someone at the age of twelve or above. As I said, there is a dark side to the game, so be aware of this for younger children. It is not that serious, but each parent has to judge for themselves what their child is ready for.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game. There were times I over-thought the solution, when something very simple was required and I would face palm myself for not seeing the clear path I needed, but that is part of the game. I will end by telling you two things. Besides the portal gun, there will be devices in some of the rooms you can use to your advantage and their use is required. Making quick saves after ever little endeavor will save going back over accomplishments you don't need to go through more then once.\n\nThe games is short, but very enjoyable. Wait for a sale. I got it in a package deal with Portal 2, which I have yet to play. I feel if the game were longer it would become tedious, so I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.","timestamp_created":1421673298,"timestamp_updated":1421673298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14061652","author":{"steamid":"76561198128260314","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":142,"last_played":1453104503},"language":"spanish","review":"Una clara demostracion de lo que realmente significa un juego, buena jugabilidad, reto y ambiente, Portal me dio un par de horas de diversión y aun por lo corto que sea el juego en si, goze cada segundo y prueba que se me dio, me encantaba la relacion de los unicos y principales personajes y todas las dinamicas que habia, sin duda tambien me encanto su maravilloso humor.

Non è uno di quei soliti puzzle game con storie a caso il cui unico scopo è risolvere l'enigma, al contrario. Dal primo minuto di gioco inizierete a pensare \"E adesso cosa sucede? Come finirà? Da cosa è partito tutto questo?\". Ha una storyline completa seppur non dia molti dettagli esplicitamente, ma che vi fa scoprire pian piano tutto quanto. Partirete in \"medias res\", per usare un termine specifico, cioè nel mezzo della storia, senza sapere nulla. E divorerete il gioco in un fiato per scoprire il perché di tutto quello che succede.\n\nLa grafica è semplicemente spettacolare per un gioco così leggero che richiede specifiche molto basse. Luci, colori, dettagli sono peretti. Non aspettatevi nulla di simile agli ultimi giochi usciti, al 4k o cose così, ma potrebbe tenergli testa considerando il rapporto qualità/specifiche.\n\nGameplay entusiasmante interamente basato sulla fisica e sulle abilità. Non c'è nulla di sempplificato, nessun suggerimento. Siete solo voi con la vostra Portal Gun e un carico di ingegno per superare le varie stanze. All'inizio può sembrare facile, ma man mano che si va avanti sarà sempre più difficile. E nonostante il gioco in sé può essere completato in 2-3 ore, è reso molto più longevo dai complicati achievement di Steam. E poi, personalmente trovo divertente rigiocare le mappe solo per sperimentare nuove vie e nuovi metodi risolutivi.\n\nAltro punto a favore è che non sono presenti nemici (a parte alcune torrette che però fanno solo parte del puzzle) o boss da sconfiggere ad ogni livello (a parte quello finale, anche se lo si dovrà battere sempre attraverso un puzzle). Non è il solito gioco che dopo la terza volta che lo rifai ti stufa. È molto più di un semplice puzzle game.\n\nIn sintesi, se cercate un gioco che vi faccia ragionare, ma allo stesso tempo vi emozioni e vi prenda tanto da volerlo finire in una volta sola, Portal è la risposta!

At times I even found the environment, paired with just the right amount of ambient music, vaguely unsettling with a definite ‘creep out’ factor and though this isn’t that kind of game, nor is it supposed to be that kind of game, you’ll gain a better understanding of why that is once you progress further in the game and learn what is supposed to happen to the test subjects, as well as discovering the scrawling of former test subjects in out of the way places along the way.  \n\nOf course Portal is overall much more lighthearted in orientation, with an absurd sense of humor that never disappoints (case in point: turrets actually talk and even scream as you knock them down or drop them off a ledge, etc.).  As is often the case with platformer/puzzle games, there is little ‘wiggle’ room as far as how you go about completing the games various test chambers but to an extent there is an easier vs. more difficult method, and the game’s REAL main character, the ingenious portal gun, allows you to go about figuring out the best means of doing so to awesome effect!

This simple description simply doesn't do it justice. The game's title is pretty upfront about what the game itself entails which is the use of portals. The use of portals may seem like something familiar but, the casual use of portals in the first person view introduces a whole different dimension when it comes to navigating yourself in the game, as well as introducing a whole new concept or approach to solving problems.\n\nAs intimidatingly complicated as it may seem when watching someone else play the game, it's hard to admit not to be intrigued yourself. When your brain finally manages to wrap itself around the concept and application of portals, it's every bit as gratifying being able to pull off complicated maneuvers yourself. The game not only has both the problem-solving and creative sides working together, but also leaves them hungry for more playtime in Portal.\n\nPortal also manages to accomplish having a massive and compelling storyline despite telling it in such a subtle and minimal fashion.","timestamp_created":1421234862,"timestamp_updated":1421234862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13980333","author":{"steamid":"76561198039654536","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":81,"playtime_forever":924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":908,"last_played":1422689437},"language":"brazilian","review":"Eh... mais ou menos, mais ou menos, mas não posso dizer que não gosto e the cake is a lie.","timestamp_created":1421229212,"timestamp_updated":1421229212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13980185","author":{"steamid":"76561198128542945","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":850,"last_played":1561998209},"language":"english","review":"Great puzzle game with interesting story and eerie atmosphere","timestamp_created":1421227885,"timestamp_updated":1585353110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13979556","author":{"steamid":"76561198103325342","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":197,"last_played":1637101808},"language":"spanish","review":"Obra Maestra.","timestamp_created":1421221163,"timestamp_updated":1421221163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13979433","author":{"steamid":"76561198126923042","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1418,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1407,"last_played":1584793893},"language":"polish","review":"Jedna z lepszych gier logicznych.
