I really dont know how to review this game but Ill do my best. This game is fun, has good puzzles, and isnt complicated. I had more fun playing with my friend online though, but he thinks Portal 2 is too old now so he wont play with me :(. Anyways, this game is good, and I reccomend playing with a friend. 10/10. HOWEVER, if you dont like puzzle games, you wont like this game.","timestamp_created":1406747505,"timestamp_updated":1406747505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11481203","author":{"steamid":"76561198062279764","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":946,"last_played":1409225907},"language":"spanish","review":"muy bueno","timestamp_created":1406745708,"timestamp_updated":1406745708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11480833","author":{"steamid":"76561198117563189","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":765,"last_played":1593658342},"language":"english","review":"Dope","timestamp_created":1406743928,"timestamp_updated":1406743928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11480161","author":{"steamid":"76561198053089997","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1195,"last_played":1488901628},"language":"german","review":"This is one of the best games ever!

Con saber cuarto cosas básicas del primer juego, no tienes por qué habertelo pasado. Además, este juego viene con modo cooperativo y una workshop increíble, para que cuando te pases la campaña puedas seguir comiendote la cabeza con los portales.
