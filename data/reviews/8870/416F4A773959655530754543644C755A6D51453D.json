Former Pinkerton detective Booker Dewitt, in order to clear his debts, accepts a mission to rescue a missing girl named Elizabeth. He travels to Colombia, where he is branded a \"False Shepherd\" and pursued by the authorities. When she reaches Elizabeth, this simple rescue plan takes several twists and turns, revealing the hidden secrets of Colombia and Comstock, and eventually leading to a shocking conclusion... \n\nAh, the visuals, visuals, visuals!!! Not enough can be said about the breathtaking visuals of <Bioshock Infinite>. Beautiful visuals that deserve marks more than a 10/10: largely based on the early 20th century America, so many attention to details(the people, the shops, the streets, the buildings, everything else!) that players can wander around hours searching for them. With less limitations than the nautical Rapture had, the atmosphere and the setting of the city certainly is an outstanding experience up in the air. \n\nGreat, memorable characters, with solid development, especially from Elizabeth, who may probably be the greatest female supporting character since Alyx Vance. Fabulous voice acting, particularly from the lead actors of Booker and Elizabeth.\n\nStory earns marks for richness, ambition and huge scale, but occasionally feels like it's throwing in too many elements, including political, religious, and social ideologies, racism, American exceptionalism, propaganda, alternate dimensions, poltergeists, AND Bioshock, to the point where the player forgets that they're actually playing a Bioshock game. Regardless, guranteed that this game will not be simple like the first Bioshock. Still would have been great enough if the creators stuck to the generic Super Mario formula.  \n\nOutstanding gameplay! Adrenaline pumping gameplay that will always keep you occupied. More weapons, unique superpowers, or \"Vigors\", and skylines which you can ride with a \"Sky-hook\" helping you with combat, and tons more! The game throws a lot of gameplay information at you but is not to the point of frustration. \n\nAn unforgettable experience in Single Player first person shooting with some of the best visuals and settings in a video game. You will never see George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin the same way you did again. \n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1519099839,"timestamp_updated":1519099839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598540186882019043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40240831","author":{"steamid":"76561198070366822","num_games_owned":556,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":1421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1399,"last_played":1575001438},"language":"english","review":"bioshock infinite is a really great game, it has one of the best stories in all of gaming and the ending is one for the ages.\ni only have one complaint with the game and it's that the combat happens super often to the point where it can get repetitive but the game itself doesn't overstay its welcome so it might not even be much of an issue for people. the gunplay is really great too so it doesn't hold it down too much. \n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1519093838,"timestamp_updated":1559599394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40240494","author":{"steamid":"76561198133943166","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":950,"last_played":1630282014},"language":"spanish","review":"Damm, Este juego, su historia, su Season pass con los capitulos Burial at Sea 1 y 2, y con un gran pegon entre la historia del infinite una locura..
