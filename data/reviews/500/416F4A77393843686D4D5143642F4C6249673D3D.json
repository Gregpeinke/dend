One person can't carry the whole team forever. Some of the game's zombies have certain abilities that FORCE the players to work together. If one player runs ahead of the group, there will be a zombie who incapacitates a player and the only escape is by the help of a teammate. \nLeft 4 Dead is the epitome of undead apocalyptic teamwork.
