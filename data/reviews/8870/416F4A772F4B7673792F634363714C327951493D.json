Interesting story, good gameplay, I liked it.  One thing I didn't like was the prevalent racism in the city of Columbia.  It's not a relevant to the story, it's never addressed, it's just there for no good reason.  Maybe it's because the game is set in the 50s but with no reflection, addressing it or anything it just sucks.  The game is also pretty short, 10h to finish the game and I played pretty slowly, picking up any trash from containers that I could find.\n\nThe DLCs aren't very good.  One is an arena mode, kill waves of enemies to get the highest score.  Burial at sea 1 didn't have enough ammo and wasn't very fun.  Half of the time I was forced to use melee attacks just because of ammo shortages.  Burial at sea 2 tries to turn an FPS shooter into a stealth game and while it's not terrible it's about as good as you could expect from a game without stealth mechanics in the base game.  You again don't get enough ammo and the DLC plays slowly because a lot of the time for story reasons you can only walk and not run.\n\nThe game was fun, I can recommend it if you get it on sale.  For full price it's a bit too short.","timestamp_created":1613301230,"timestamp_updated":1613301230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86616570","author":{"steamid":"76561198849606227","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1059,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1059,"last_played":1603658600},"language":"turkish","review":"serinin en sevdiğim oyunu olur kendisi. ağlamamak için zor tutacaksınız kendinizi. dlcde yazık ettiniz kızıma. o ne vahşet öyle.","timestamp_created":1613298247,"timestamp_updated":1613298247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86616426","author":{"steamid":"76561198002917100","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":378,"last_played":1613196214},"language":"english","review":"I'm sorry, but...

There's always some deeper thing you're trying to wrap your head around while you try to complete a more focused objective -- i.e. trying to figure out what these tears are and why Elizabeth has these powers, while you try to save Chen Lin and collect the weapons for Fitzroy.

The game play is fun and exciting, riding on rails and pouncing on my enemies was awesome, and the most of the vigors were very useful and the game did a good job at making you balance out what you used. As for the gun play, you can only hold two weapons at a time so it's best to pick what best suits your play style. I went with the sniper rifle and shotgun most of the time because I liked to pick off enemies from a distance while having a powerful close range weapon to take down anyone who got too close to me. Elizabeth, the girl who you spend most of the game with is very helpful with getting you ammo, salts(ammo for vigors), health, and money. Plus she can spawn in items or allies to help you in a battle. The main story has an excellent plot that does take some thinking to understand what is happening, but it is really interesting to learn about.\n\nFor the dlc, in my opinion it's still good but not as good as the main story, episode 1 of Burial at Sea feels not as fun as the main story since there isn't many rails for you to ride on. Episode 2 changes up the game play with making you focus on stealth first and only using combat as a last resort. I wasn't overly fancy about going all stealthy instead of fighting my enemies head on, but it paid off to have patience and not take serious amounts of damage. The story of episode 2 is better than what episode 1 starts with as it connects with the first bioshock in a satisfying way. \n\nPerformance wise the game ran pretty good for the most part. The game had it's moments where the frame rate would drop when looking at certain actions from Elizabeth or a fireplace burning, or whenever I booted up the game and started from my last save. To be fair I do not have the greatest hardware and the frame rate never dropped during important moments of game play.\n\nOverall the game is fantastic and in my opinion is better than the original Bioshock. If your a fan of the original games then I highly recommend you give this game a try.","timestamp_created":1613194688,"timestamp_updated":1613194688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86517711","author":{"steamid":"76561198120215905","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":729,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":432,"last_played":1623630060},"language":"english","review":"uwu\n","timestamp_created":1613194454,"timestamp_updated":1613194454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86516753","author":{"steamid":"76561198431187856","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":692,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":625,"last_played":1640625148},"language":"english","review":"Great game.
