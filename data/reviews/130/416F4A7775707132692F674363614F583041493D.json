You are barney.mdl\nHalf Life Blue Shift это 2 дополнение к ХЛ. На этот раз мы играем за охранника под именем Барни Калхун.\nГрафика, Геймплей: Всё тот же хл 1. Даже новую механику, хотя бы кривую (да, я про верёвки в оппосинг форс) не завезли.\nСюжет: Мы едем на работу как вдруг наш кореш Гордон Фримен делаю каскадный резонанс. После этого нам приходится выживать пока мы не наткнёмся на военных. Они держут в заложниках одного учённого, который говорит про своего коллегу доктора Розенберга. Мы его находим и собираемся телепортироватся из Мезы (там ведь ещё бомба заложена, мы про неё узнаем в оппосинг форс). Как вдруг нам рассказывают про монстров которых мы встретили на пути. Они из пограничного мира Зена. Мы должны туда отправится и включить генератор для выполнения нашей цели. Но не тут то было, аккумулятор сдох. Мы находим замену и начинается телепорт. И вот когда мы должны свалить из мезы приходят 2-3 солдата. Мы их расскатываем и хеппи энд.\nСмысл разработки: расширение вселенной и бабло. Спрашивается, а фигли тут нет новых механик? Всё просто. Халф лайф собирались портировать на сегу дримкаст с новыми уровнями за охранника. Но всё пошло по канонам Халфы, а наработки выкидывать обидно.\nСоветую ли я покупать эту игру? Спорно, если хотите скоротать вечерок на часик-2 и если вам понравилась первая хл и оппосинг форс то

Half-Life: Blue Shift is still a good game after all this years.\n[i]Troubleshooting[/i] - Like the other two games from the first series, Blue Shift do not boot directly on Linux Manjaro, despite that it is a Linux native game. But again, the compatibility with the latest Proton 5.13-6 works perfectly. I mean too perfectly - even the (in)famous glitch from back in the day is here. After reloading a quick save the current weapon starts automatically shooting until it is switched. Well, when people are saying that Proton compiles games perfectly, I didn't expected that even the original glitches will be transferred. Anyway, as I said - most of the glitches are from the game itself and not from the compatibility layer. Also, it comes with installed HD-pack. This means that the Glock, the MP5 and the shotgun are reskinned to Beretta, M16 and SPAS.\n[i]Quality[/i] - Even that the game is much shorter that the previous two, it is still enjoyable. Honestly I rather prefer \"Blue Shift\" then \"Opposing Force\". Maybe because the main character is an average security guard instead of a spec-force commando or a scientist in a high-tech suit.\n[i]Final thoughts[/i] - As we all know: \"the best friend of the gamer is the seasonal sale\".
