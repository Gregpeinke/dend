Two\" takes everything from the original game and \"Episode One,\" adds to it, and builds to a roaring crescendo. Just as \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is often hailed as being the best part of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, \"Episode Two\" hits a home run as an absolutely crucial middle-act. It might even outshine its two immediate predecessors.\n\n(It's hardly the \"whole enchilada,\" but I do want to mention my opinion that the final setpiece battle completely eclipses any other game setpiece I've recently experienced. It's a fully interactive, epic-scale, yet 100% game-mechanic driven contest that delivers a climax without compromising the actual gameplay in any way.)\n\nAnyone wanting to make a killer game should dissect everything that went into this title. The developer commentary is especially illluminating as to the great pains taken to make the experience work as it does. From pacing, to art, to teaching the player the game mechanics in a natural way, the \"Half-Life\" team sets a very high bar.\n\nThe only problem with the game is that it produces a powerful appetite for the next title in the series - a title which has yet to appear.","timestamp_created":1420769075,"timestamp_updated":1420769075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473372787237167358","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13902501","author":{"steamid":"76561198063908231","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":131,"last_played":1410767347},"language":"english","review":"Valve really can't count to 3.

Главная особенность второго эпизода — большие открытые пространства; лесная местность даёт игроку свободно путешествовать на новом автомобиле, а геймплей становится менее линейным: согласно задумке, с разнообразной тактикой ведения боя каждая битва будет непохожа на предыдущую. Кроме лесных территорий, игрок пройдёт заброшенные шахты, гнездо муравьиных львов и ракетную базу — все эти локации так же будут отличаться своей масштабностью. Во втором эпизоде нет такого сосредоточения на кооперативной игре, как в первом: хотя сюжетно игрок проходит всю игру вместе со своей напарницей Аликс Вэнс, во многих игровых событиях она по тем или иным причинам не принимает участия. Кроме Аликс, игроку предстоит сражаться бок о бок с дружественными вортигонтами. Сюжет эпизода начинается там, где заканчивается Episode One. После взрыва Цитадели поезд, на котором уезжали Гордон Фримен и Алик Вэнс, попадает под взрывную волну и терпит крушение. Им приходится добираться до главной базы Сопротивления — комплекса «Белая Роща» — своими силами. Главная цель — доставить в Белую Рощу данные, добытые в Цитадели, где содержатся секретные планы руководства Альянса, а также код частоты сверхпортала, образовавшегося над разрушенным Сити 17. Этот портал должен вновь прочно связать Землю и вселенную Альянса, что грозит человечеству приходом подкрепления инопланетных захватчиков и повторением Семичасовой войны. Однако, используя код частоты волны портала, у повстанцев есть возможность закрыть его при помощи ракеты со спутником, на котором установлен «зен-резонатор», запустив его из Белой Рощи. Но все усугубляется тем, что разведка Альянса обнаружила базу и туда уже направляется ударная армия. Фримен и Аликс вынуждены поторопиться, чтобы успеть доставить данные и предупредить повстанцев о надвигающейся угрозе.\nЗа графику 10/10.\nЗа Game Play 9/10.\nЗа Сюжет 10/10.\nМоя общая оценка 10/10.\n","timestamp_created":1420141208,"timestamp_updated":1420141208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569752275943756104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13763471","author":{"steamid":"76561198028371657","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":724,"last_played":1459092465},"language":"english","review":"Gr8 gam","timestamp_created":1420132832,"timestamp_updated":1420132832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13760773","author":{"steamid":"76561198129421375","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":901,"last_played":1414848391},"language":"russian","review":"2 эпизод игры,появление новых врагов,усложняющих геймплей,сделан шаг в сторону нелинейности игры,неожиданная концовка,заставляющая хотеть продолжения игры,которое все мы еще ждем.","timestamp_created":1420124155,"timestamp_updated":1420124155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13752672","author":{"steamid":"76561198050545311","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":179,"last_played":1417873776},"language":"english","review":"Good game, downloaded and replayed due to sudden struck of nostalgia!
