Mit 3000+ Spielstunden ist wohl das meiste gesagt. Es gibt keinen zweiten FPS, bei dem man im Competetive-Play Konzentration und Aufmerksamkeit über die gesamte Rundenzeit (15min) hochhalten muss und derart auf seine Mitspieler angewiesen ist. (der übliche Spielmodus ist 6on6).\n\nIch kann nur jedem empfehlen dem Spiel - trotz seines Alters - eine Chance zu geben und es sich wenigstens einmal anzusehen. Das klassische Shootergenre stirbt mehr und mehr aus, die einzigen wirklichen Vertreter sind meiner Meinung nach noch CS:GO und DoD:S, daher sind wir auf jeden Spieler angewiesen! ;) \n\nWer CoD für einen \"richtigen\" Egoshooter hält, lässt bitte die Finger von Day of Defeat - es ist tatsächlich nicht dafür geeignet, um einen Abend in der Woche mal eben auf den Server zu gehen und alles abzuräumen. Die meisten noch aktiven Spieler sind lange Jahre dabei bzw. kehren die meisten auch nach längerer Abstinenz wieder zurück, sodass das Einstiegsniveau, um einigermaßen mithalten zu können, relativ hoch angesetzt werden muss. Zudem sind die einzelnen Waffen lange nicht so einfach zu handlen, wie das in den Weichspüler-Shootern der Fall ist - der Lernprozess ist daher lang und frustierend, ich spreche aus eigener Erfahrung.\n\nSind Light, Heavy oder Sniper allerdings einmal beherrscht, darf man sich zu einem (leider mittlerweile) exklusiven Klub zählen, der noch Wert darauf legt sich mit einem Spiel auseinanderzusetzen und nicht alle 6 Monate 60€ für einen \"neuen\" Teil ohne großen Neuerungswert auszugeben.

There is a really nice community and some good custom maps available for this game. If you think that Team Fortress is too full with hats and noobs and Counterstrike is too outworn, try DoD:S. Tactical and also fast gameplay is required in this game. By the way: I recommend the servers from the clan ''Deutsche Kampfgruppe''. For the IP just check out Google.","timestamp_created":1335753998,"timestamp_updated":1335753998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4279466","author":{"steamid":"76561198034969236","num_games_owned":437,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":20149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10349,"last_played":1470764888},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever played!!","timestamp_created":1335721392,"timestamp_updated":1335721392,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3573040","author":{"steamid":"76561198024920823","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1408,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":985,"last_played":1453415310},"language":"english","review":"I really like the game, but I couldn't find the stupid cake.","timestamp_created":1335042197,"timestamp_updated":1335042197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534883737564086914","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"972977","author":{"steamid":"76561197983390904","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":33023,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32086,"last_played":1612218590},"language":"german","review":"Hammer Spiel!","timestamp_created":1333753211,"timestamp_updated":1333753211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4437836","author":{"steamid":"76561198037153114","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":8916,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5182,"last_played":1606690829},"language":"english","review":"good old WW2 first person :D","timestamp_created":1333699055,"timestamp_updated":1333699055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3795563","author":{"steamid":"76561198027473248","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2301,"last_played":1569264972},"language":"english","review":"Good game, Decent Graphics Just isn't enough players....","timestamp_created":1333684738,"timestamp_updated":1333684738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518716573715209961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6019004","author":{"steamid":"76561198057345208","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1110,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":542,"last_played":1610590276},"language":"english","review":"If you just want to jump straight into a firefight WWII style, this is it.","timestamp_created":1333419203,"timestamp_updated":1333419203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m8v+urYCfPv6Fg=="}
