Even after beating this game numerous  times I still find myself completely enthralled by every aspect of this Valve masterpiece.\n\nYou fill the mute shoes of the theoretical physicist Dr. Gordon Freeman who, under contract from the mysterious G-Man, is thrust into the dystopian City 17 and the headquarters of the Combine Overwatch that rule over Earth and all of its citizens after a crushing victory over the human race in the accurately named \"7-Hour War\". Now it's up to Gordon and Alyx to lead the human resistance against Dr. Breen and his solders outfitted with high-tech, para-dimensional Combine technology. \n\nIn true Valve fashion, Half-Life 2 is an amazing First Person Shooter with highly inventive weapons like the Overwatch Standard Issue Pulse Rifle (OSIPR), Antlion Bug Bait, and the famous Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator (or \"Gravity Gun\" for short). Unlike other shooters, HL2 knows how to pace itself; allowing you to become immersed in the world it weaves around you before handing you your iconic crowbar and letting you off the chain. The battles are also broken up by simple, yet entertaining, physics puzzles along with some vehicle sections and exploration that rewards you with bonus weapons and ammo. \n\nThe characters are amazing in their own right too. While Gordon remains speechless to allow the player to project onto him, all of the other entities posses their own amazing personalities. From the quirky Dr. Kleiner to the alien Vortigaunts that aid the resistance, every character has their own story to tell, even if it's only for an instant as they get killed off by a different character with their own interesting backstory. Or by an Ant Lion, that happens a lot too. \n\nIf you have yet to play Half-Life 2 or the original Half-Life, then you are missing out. It's time to wake up, Mister Freeman.
