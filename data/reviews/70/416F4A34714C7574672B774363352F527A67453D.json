Bu yolculuk sırasında ve oyunun devamında Gordon Freeman adlı bir bilmadamını canlandırdığımızı, bu kişinin Black Mesa Araştırma Tesisi‘nde çalıştığını, tesiste ulaşımı sağlamak amacı ile bir raylı sistemin düzenlendiğini ve Freeman’ın yetişmesi gereken bir deneye yarım saat geç kaldığını öğreniyoruz.\n\nG-Man isimli gizemli karakter, özel olarak seçilmiş bir kristali Xen gezegenine giden insan araştırma grubuna teslim eder. Bu kristal yeterince incelenemeden deneyde kullanılır ve dünya ile Xen gezegeni arasında bir portal açılır. Gordon Freeman birkaç kez dünya ile Xen arasında ışınlanmış, Xen gezegenindeki yaratıkların dünyaya ışınlandığını görmüştür. Oyun, yanlış giden bu deneyin ardından Dr. Freeman’ın içinde bulunduğu Black Mesa’dan kaçışını konu almaktadır. Elimizde levye, başlıyoruz vurup kırmaya. Bu kaçış sırasında tesisin büyük bir yıkıma uğradığını, birçok çalışanın yaralandığını, öldüğünü ya da headcrab gibi yaratıklar tarafından zombiye dönüştüklerine şahit olmaktayız.\n\nBlackOps timi bu tesiste yaşananların dışarı sızmaması için tesisteki herkesin öldürülmesi üzere emir alır. Freeman giydiği HEV kıyafetinin de avantajıyla hem BlackOps timinin üstesinden gelir hem de Xen gezegeninin lideri olan Nihilianth‘ı öldürür. Freeman’ın bu yetenekleri G-Man’in dikkatini çeker ve oyunun sonunda G-Man, Gordon Freeman’ı bir seçime zorlar. Freeman ya G-Man için çalışmayı kabul edecektir ya da silahsız bir şekilde tüm yaratıkların arasına itilerek ölüme terkedilecektir. Freeman çalışmayı kabul eder ve G-Man tarafından Half Life 2 oyununun başına kadar uyutulur.\n\nBlack Mesa faciasından az sayıda insan kurtulmuştur. Wallace Breen (Black Mesa Başkanı ve aynı zamanda ikinci oyunun başında City 17’nin başındaki isim), Güvenlik Görevlisi Barney Calhoun, Dr. Issac Kleiner, Dr. Arne Magnusson, Dr. Eli Vance ve kızı Alyx Vance bu isimler arasındadır.","timestamp_created":1564057680,"timestamp_updated":1564057680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54285271","author":{"steamid":"76561198362486960","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1564070332},"language":"russian","review":"очень крутая игра, жалко что не запусткается!","timestamp_created":1564055363,"timestamp_updated":1564055363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54283407","author":{"steamid":"76561198138694996","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":682,"last_played":1642477566},"language":"english","review":"Named Game of the Year by over 50 publications, Valve's debut title blends action and adventure with award-winning technology to create a frighteningly realistic world where players must think to survive.

Данный обзор - лишь мнение автора, которое он вам не навязывает! Вы можете остаться при своем. Если с чем-то не согласны - пишите коментарии, мы обсудим! [/i][/b]\n\n[h1]✎ Предисловие:[/h1]\nЯ прекрасно понимаю, что в 2018 году писать отзыв на игру вышедшую в далеком 1998, как минимум поздно, но все же я сделаю его из чувства глубокой ностальгии и благодарности разработчику. Обзор чисто субъективный и описывать я буду те эмоции, которые игра вызывает исключительно в настоящее время т.к в прошлом эта игра являла собой эталон. Я прекрасно знаю, что существует фанатская модификация на новом движке - «Black Mesa», но там еще нет мира Ксен (Зен) и поэтому я решил перепройти классику.\n\n[h1]✔ Достоинства:[/h1]\n➜ Сюжет. Сценаристы потрудились на славу и мы получили прекрасную историю, которая вылилась в очень интересный франчайз со своим уникальным лором. Даже есть альтернативная концовка.\n➜ Локации. Каждая из них пестрит своим антуражем, имеет свое наполнение, которое гармонично вписывается в общую тематику игры.\n➜ Арсенал. Для истребления недругов разработчик преподносит приличное количество оружия. Вы определенно найдете себе что-то по вкусу! От обычного огнестрела до плазменных пушек или инопланетных орудий, стреляющих самонаводящимися насекомыми. Стоит упомянуть и про монтировку с которой наш герой не будет расставаться на протяжении и остальных частей.\n➜ Звуки и музыка. Все довольно неплохо и прекрасно подходит к происходящему на экране.\n➜ Геймплей. Динамичный и очень активный! Огромное количество перестрелок и беготни не заставит вас скучать! А лаборатории, которые превратились в своеобразные ловушки, заставят вас попотеть и улучшить координацию движений.\n➜ Противники. Главная изюминка игры – инопланетяне, а их в игре с избытком! Барнаклы, Буллскиды, Вортигонты, Гранты, Хаундаи, Тентакли и конечно же они – Хедкрабы! Так же присутствуют и другие, но их слишком много, чтобы перечислять. Каждый из них опасен по-своему и выполнен качественно и интересно. Расправляться с ними – сплошное удовольствие! \n➜ Неплохой ИИ. Он даст фору многим современным аналогам. Враги умеют объеденяться и действовать сообща, активно пользоваться укрытиями и метко швырять гранаты.\n➜ Живой мультиплеер. В данный момент играть приходится не на самом мощном ПК (а откровенно говоря, почти что на микроволновке. Только дисплей побольше) и как же я был рад увидеть кучу серверов с людьми! И сразу нахлынуло чувство огромной ностальгии по тому огромному количеству часов, которые проводились в «игровухах».. Как же это было прекрасно!\n\n[h1]✘ Недостатки:[/h1]\nНезначительные и выглядят как придирка, но все же я для себя их нашел. \n\n➜ Застрявание в текстурах. Довольно часто нам приходится перемещаться в трубах и Гордон натыкается на невидимый объект, а если еще и произошла загрузка локации, то шанс застрять в текстуре = 95%. Лечится «быстрой загрузкой», ну или придется очень медленно и ровно идти. Во время прыжков на некоторые объекты, наш протагонист все так же застревает (в каньоне очень сильно раздражало).\n➜ Немой протагонист. Вокруг царит такой хаос а он молчит… Хотя это и придает Гордону некий шарм, но он быстро улетучивается.\n➜ Физика стрельбы. Нет даже имитации отдачи.\n➜ Запутанность локаций. Иногда не совсем очевидно куда идти дальше. Особенно в междумирье - с трудом заметил эту щель в астероиде (она сливается с общей текстурой) и в начале игры был момент, где нужно пододвинуть ящик к обломкам потолка.\n\n[h1]⚠ Дополнения.[/h1]\nВ то время о такой вещи как «dlc», еще не задумывались, поэтому выходили маленькие ответвления - «Blue shift» и «Opposing Force» Первое расскажет об охраннике Черной Мезы – Барни Калхауне, который тоже пройдет тернистый путь, хотя и не такой как Гордон. А второе даст нам примерить на себя роль солдата и снова вернуться в комплекс лабораторий, начав глобальную зачистку объекта. Лично мне дополнения показались скучнее оригинала, хотя сюжетом они тесно с ним пересекаются. Можно увидеть Гордона и даже попытаться ему помешать! В дополнениях нам представят несколько новых видов противников и так же немного изменят арсенал. \n\n[h1]➥ Итог.[/h1]\n«Half life» – игра¬-легенда, породившая собой огромное число фанатов по всему миру. Позже именно на ее движке возникнет фанатская модификация, которая впоследствии станет самостоятельной игрой – Counter Strike. Эталон своего времени, к которому вполне приятно прикоснуться и сейчас. Если же вас все же смущает возраст продукта – то рекомендую приобрести «Black Mesa» и ждать когда в нее наконец-то добавят финальные локации.\n8 хедкрабов из 10 ( ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ )\n\n▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂","timestamp_created":1563995503,"timestamp_updated":1563995503,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54274577","author":{"steamid":"76561198359113537","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1599085722},"language":"brazilian","review":"melhor game da minha steam atualmente","timestamp_created":1563994334,"timestamp_updated":1563994334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54274102","author":{"steamid":"76561198976850725","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1077,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1564505959},"language":"spanish","review":"The game is good, but it has many example bugs: sometimes you get stuck in a wall and you can't keep moving forward and you have to restart the whole game ...

game has really changed the face of gaming as a whole, and it would be hard to articulate my unending love for this game. \n\nIn this game, you play as an MIT graduate named Gordon Freeman, with a Ph,D in theoretical physics. Already you can tell this game is different. Rather then being set in a maze with a bunch of enemies and a gun like other games at that time, you are set in a calm, pleasant train ride. A nice change of pace at the time, but soon, it wouldn't be such a nice time. \n\nAfter you're let into the test chamber by a security guard at Black Mesa Research Facility, you are given the task of slotting an unknown crystal into a mysterious machine, and the motives of this experiment were unknown. \n\nThen it goes down, and you are given your first weapon. I'd tell more, but you'd just have to play the game. \n\nYou were more than just a bad-ass killing machine with a shotgun. You were Gordon, and your motivation was to escape Black Mesa and survive. \n\nWords cannot describe how much this game means to me, but you would have to take my word for it. If you've been considering buying this, then please. Do purchase it. You will not be disappointed.\n\nNot to mention the countless mods and games this has spawned. Counter Strike, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress: Classic, and so on. \n\nThis game is revolutionary. A masterpiece. And the sequel, despite taking 6 years to complete, reaches the bar it's prequel put up, and even exceeds it in some aspects.\n\nI recommend this game to any gamer of any genre. There's always something to love here. Whether you agree with me that it's the greatest game ever made, we can at least agree it was PHENOMENAL. \n\nHands down the greatest game ever made, in my opinion.

[/h1]\n\n\nTheres nothing really wrong with this version of Half-Life, it's just not as good as the Source Engine port. Stuff like Graphics, sound, and physics are obviously better in the source engine version, but I also noticed a few things:\n\n- Some weapons seem less effective\n\nParticularly the shotgun; it feels like it does less damage or something. Whenever I used it against headcrabs I would often miss or have to use 2 shells to kill them despite being close and having the crosshair dead center on them. \n\n- AI is kinda glitchy\n\nI noticed multiple times that the AI of enemies and NPCs sometimes have trouble with moving around. One instance in particular was when I had a Guard following me, and I tried to lead him through a pair of double doors (which were both open). After I ran through, the gaurd's AI decided to close the door in front of him, and then just keep running into the door.\n\n- The Flashlight is GARBAGE\n\nThe flashlight in this game doesnt work like most games. Its hard to describe but in some areas it's just horribly ineffective. The best example I can give is when you're inside an air vent or other small, confined spaces with little to no light. The flashlight will only illuminate a very small area, making it very difficult to spot headcrabs in the vent ahead of you.\n\n\nNone of this is really game breaking, or ruins the experience, but I cant help but feel this version is inferior after putting dozens of hours into the source engine version. For this reason I do not recommend it.

I dont know how to explain this its just such a challenge to go on it feels good when you did it yourself, tho still getting mad on the game that they could just make it less of a pain in the ass like ids did.\nI think the thing I can compare it the most is if you played a build game, with platforms when the floor is ice, enemies are spawing, and they are at a place of advantage over you, ho yeah and you have to reaload unaccurate weapons.\n\nand I must say in second playthrough the weapons and the shootings is still not the best.\nplatforming is not fun at all\nand the floor is still ice\nBut if progression was a challenge motivation at first playthrough\nat second playthrough the progression is just pure entertainment motivation\nthe game just becomes much easier.\nenemies well still not super fun to shoot you know better what youre doing and game flow becomes really smooth.\nI really concider never playing it again after Ive completed Xen \nBut I was bored and you know if you know where to go, what to do, wheres the enemies, how to break line of site and all that.\nHalf life 1 is pretty entertaining game!\nThe story (the way it was told) is really interesting especially when youve played all the other games and the enviornments are (maybe out dated) kinda nice to look at.\n\nthe high light is not the shooting in this, but the pure progression is THE high light of half life one and its all what it is made of.\non first playthrough: 5/10 tho its a challenge I took for myself\nsecond playthrough; 7/10 not that bad really!\nI dont recommand you to start from this game, what I did that I want back in time from portal 2 to 1 to half life 2 to this.\neveryone that concider himself half life 2 and portals games and READY TO TAKE THE CHALLENGE, go for it man!
