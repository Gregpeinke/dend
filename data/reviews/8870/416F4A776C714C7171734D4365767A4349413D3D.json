Apaixonante. Inesquecível.\n\nSão poucas as palavras que conseguem descrever a experiência que Bioshock Infinite proporciona. Definitivamente um dos melhores games que joguei em toda a minha vida.\n\nÉ importante dizer, antes de mais nada, que Bioshock Infinite, apesar de se passar no mesmo universo de seus antecessores, não é uma continuação e pode ser apreciado mesmo sem a ter jogado Bioshock 1 e 2. Por conta disso, Bioshock Infinite é bastante independente. Toda as inovações já criadas na série foram repensadas nesse capítulo.\n\nNo entanto, a mecânica básica continua a mesma: arma na mão direita, Plasmids (ou nesse caso Vigors) na mão esquerda. Diferente do seu antecessor, os Vigors podem ser acessados a qualquer momento. No lugar dos perks, agora temos Gear, que são peças de roupas (chapéu, camisa, calça e sapato) que você pode usar e trocar a qualquer momento que alteram os atributos de seu personagem. Agora todas as armas e Vigors podem ser melhorados comprando upgrades nas Vending Machines ao longo do jogo. E se você acha que vai conseguir dar upgrade em 100%, esqueça, não dá. Ou seja, pense com cautela onde irá investir a rara grana que você encontra no jogo. Não tem mais Adam ou Big Daddys ou Little Sisters. E não vou dizer o que mais o game tem, pois eu sei que vou estragar a surpresa. Mas agora, o foco do game é outro: A HISTÓRIA.\n\nBioshock Infinite resolveu um problema que já levantei no review anterior de Bioshock 2 http://steamcommunity.com/id/salvego/recommended/8850/. A história continua muito complexa, mas a narrativa agora é muito mais clara e direta. Você sabe onde está e o que está fazendo e também tem claro quais os motivos de o estar fazendo. Bioshock Infinite apresenta a história de Columbia, uma cidade nos céus liderada por uma forte crença entre o Profeta e o Falso Pastor. A influência da religião na cidade é muito evidente. O preconceito racial muito forte. A perfeição do povo e da cidade mascara a podridão de suas fundações. Nesse capítulo a interação com outros persongens faz com que a narrativa flua mais tranquilamente, principalmente em parceria com a belíssima Elizabeth. Eis aqui uma das inovações que Bioshock Infinite apresenta: a conexão criada entre você e Elizabeth é extremamente forte e você sente isso a cada sala, a cada passo, a cada ação. Elizabeth não só te ajuda na batalha, como comenta cada detalhe do ambiente onde você está, analisa a situação, te ajuda em suas decisões. É uma parceira de valor durante o jogo e não apenas um NPC falante. Veja o doc com 7 minutos só sobre a criação de Elizabeth:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/frwhNLzmc-M\n\nA ARTE de Bioshock Infinite é simplesmente de fazer qualquer um passar mal. Passar mal de verdade mesmo. A união visual e musical é perfeita. Reconheci várias peças, que, percebe-se, escolhidas a dedo: Chopin, Mozart, Bach. A história contada através da arte de Bioshock me fez suspirar muitas vezes. E como sempre digo em meus reviews, o CUIDADO que a equipe da Irrational Games teve com o game demonstra que não mediram esforços para deixar tudo como deveria ser: PERFEITO. Resumindo Bioshock Infinite, não é apenas um jogo de tiro. É uma obra de arte cuidadosamente planejada e executada. Não é apenas entretenimento passageiro, mas uma peça que irá ser lembrada e comentada por várias gerações de games.\n\nSe David Cage queria inovar com os seus Heavy Rain e Beyond, obrigando jogadores a esmurrar botões para assistir um filminho, afirmando que games podem ser \"filmes interativos\", meu caro, ele deveria fazer um curso com Kevin Levine para entender do que se trata games e como uma história pode ser contada através de experiências interativas, transmitindo emoção, ação, amor e ódio. Meus caros, Kevin Levine é um ótimo contador de histórias que soube usar a mídia de games de forma magistral.\n\nE fica aqui a lição para o mercado: esse game não tem Multiplayer, não tem modo competitivo, não tem coop. É só uma história muito bem contada. Os desenvolvedores só investiram tempo naquilo que merecia.\n\nForam 13 horas de gameplay, boa parte dessas horas apenas apreciando a arte, a decoração, a arquitetura, ouvindo as músicas e sons dos ambientes e prestando a atenção nos diálogos dos cidadãos de Columbia. Bioshock Infinite usa todo o poder dos games para tirar lágrimas. Assim que terminei o game já tive vontade de jogá-lo de novo! E vou fazer 100% dele (já sei que o 1999 mode é extremamente difícil) e não vejo a hora de experimentar o DLC. Um game para ser lembrado e jogado para sempre.\n\nNão vou mostrar screenshots nesse review, por que espero que você veja com seus próprios olhos o que esse game representa. Nenhum screenshot ou vídeo conseguirá mostrar isso. Então o que está esperando??? Não perca mais tempo com os pew-pew-pew, e vá jogar um game de verdade, BIOSHOCK INFINITE!!!\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857493/][b]» Siga meu perfil de Curador do Steam e leia em primeira mão minha próxima análise![/b][/url]\n\n[i][b]Aviso Legal:[/b] Textos, fotos, artes e vídeos desta análise estão protegidos pela legislação brasileira sobre direito autoral.

Lore requires a sort of \"scientific magic\" to be present to give the atmosphere it's unique charm and it is also used for gameplay. That's just it: it's used in [b]atmosphere[/b] and [b]gameplay[/b]. Is does [u]not[/u] work as a centerpiece of the storyline. Story in Bioshock games has always been about morality. It's been about \"How much is \"too much\"?\". Infinite takes a turn in a different direction of pseudo-scientific plot twists (hence the name), in it's attempt to surprise the player, and unfortuntaley fails at is big time.\n\nThe story in infinite revolves around the a splified and twsited version of the alternate dimensions theory(ies), and without spoiling anything for you I can say one thing: the big plot twist of the game is basically this:\n\n\"LOL all this shit you did doesn't matter because the variable x in world 0x62756c6c736869742331 has crossed variable y at location (6,6,6) since rabbit stepped on his carrot that turned out to be a big daddy and eat the coordinate at a dinner party with ID 0x637261636b. I know this all shit is confusing and nonsensical, but you, the player, just need to understand that all you did was a giant waste of time. Plot twist! Ovations please!\"\n\nThe Mass Effect 3 syndrome™ is present in full with this game, where writers tried too hard to surprise and \"mystify\" the player and this Elizabeth character and ended up going way over their heads.\n\nThe game is also quite linear. Where I was hoping for hubs to explore, side-quests to take, people to help/hinder and affect the outcome of the main story with that, I found chocies that are only forced and meaningless (no effect on the story), no hubs, no side-quests and wholly linear level design and story (which makes sense for the latter since all you do is a waste of time so what's the point in making different variations and giving you chocies?). \n\nThe world of the game is great and certainly up to par and Elizabeth is also well-integrated into gameplay in a way that doesn't frustrate you, but also gives her an important role. But due to linearity and lack of interaction (the aforementioned lack of hubs and exploration), getting better aquanted withe the world is not really an option and the bits where you can observe the lore, are mostly set gallery pieces, with very limited interaction, the only exception being the beginning of the game at the festival, that lets you participate in activities (but not properly talk to people and no side-quests obviously).\n\nWhile having it's moments, Infinite is most certainly a big let down for me due to contrived and over-complicated storyline and linearity. I can only recommend it at a good discount (60% and less) and certainly not full price.","timestamp_created":1388760482,"timestamp_updated":1388760762,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447983324527740479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8533097","author":{"steamid":"76561198025778331","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":887,"last_played":1470704633},"language":"english","review":"Quite simply, this game is fantastic.

Zwar nicht von dem Shooter-Gameplay,\n das ich als durchschnittlich bis schlecht empfand, aber von der Story und der überzeugenden Welt.\n\n Mit Columbia wurde eine sehr tiefgründige Welt erschaffen, voller Patriotismus, Rassismus und religiösem Fanatismus. Man spielt die ersten Minuten und wird sofort in die Welt hineingesogen. Es gibt viele kleine Details, wie etwa ein Jahrmarkt, den nur die priviligierten Bewohner betreten dürfen, oder zwei reiche Schnösel die auf einer Parkbank sitzen und über den 'Pöbel' fluchen. Da habe ich mir aber ein Bisschen mehr erhoft. Leider wirken viele Themen nur angefangen, verlieren aber gegen Ende des Spiels an Bedeutung. Genauer möchte ich aber nicht darauf eingehen, wegen den Spoilern.\nTrozdem fand ich wärend dem ganzen Spielablauf immer wieder viele kleine Details, die einem eine sehr lebendige Welt vorspielen.\n\nIn dieser Faszinierenden Welt gibt es natürlich auch eine Story, die gerade gegen Ende hin sehr zum Nachdenken anregt und auch noch lange in Erinnerung bleibt. Zum Inhalt kann man eigentlich vorab nur sagen, dass man möglichst wenig von der Story wissen sollte, dem jedes kleine Detail kann im Spielverlauf schon einiges Spoilern. Zusagen ist nur noch, dass die Story auch zu einem erneuten Durchspielen motiviert, da es beim zweiten mal sehr viele 'Aha' 'Natürlich' Momente gibt und sich die ganze Welt nochmal ein Bisschen besser erschliesst. \n\nSchade nur, dass man um diese fesselnde Welt und die spannende Story ein so maues Gameplay gemacht hat. Ein typischer 08-15 Shooter. Nicht unspielbar, aber eben auch nicht das, was eigentlich das ganze Drumherum verdient hätte. Für Leute (wie mich :D) die das Spiel vorallem wegen der Story spielen woll(t)en, ist zum Glück ein 'Durch rushen' durch die Shooterparts einigermassen möglich, da sich der Schwierigkeitsgrad in Grenzen hält.\n\nIch empfehle das Spiel eigentlich jedem, der wiedermal eine richtig packende Story und Welt erleben will und sich nicht von den Shootereinlagen zu stark stören lässt. Achja, die ersten beiden Teile muss man nicht unbedingt gespielt haben (ich habe sie nicht gespielt) um einigermassen alles zu kapieren.

Volltreffer! Das Spiel hat mich auf ganzer Linie überzeugt.\nZur Story, auf die ich aufgrund ihrer Vielfältigkeit und um nicht zu viel zu verraten nur kurzgefasst eingehen möchte: In diesem großartigen Ego-Shooter spielt man den ehemaligen Pinkerton-Detektiv Booker DeWitt, der um Schulden zu begleichen den Auftrag erhalten hat, das Mädchen Elizabeth zu befreien. Diese wird in ihrem Gefängnis vom mechanischen Vogel Songbird bewacht. Man reist in die wunderschön gestaltete fliegende Stadt Columbia, die aber im Spielverlauf immer mehr ihre hässlichen Seiten zeigt. Es tobt ein Bürgerkrieg zwischen der Polizei und der Vox Populi, einer Rebellengruppe. Schnell wird der Spieler, welcher in den Konflikt hineingezogen wird, als Feind angesehen und verfolgt. Aber um unseren Auftrag zu erledigen, müssen wir hier durch. Und: Wer hätte geahnt, dass Songbird uns im Spielverlauf noch nützlich werden kann? \n\"BioShock Infinite\" macht aber nicht allein wegen der tollen Story Spaß zu spielen, sondern auch wegen dem nahezu perfekten Gameplay. Leicht entsteht das Gefühl nie einen anderen Shooter gespielt zu haben, so ideal wurde es vom Entwickler \"Irrational Games\" umgesetzt. Nicht zuletzt die liebevoll gestaltete Grafik macht dieses Spiel zu einem der besten seinesgleichen. Einzig die Herausforderung hat mir etwas gefehlt, aber ich denke auf der höchsten Schwierigkeitsstufe, die ich noch nicht gespielt habe, sollte auch dieser Punkt wieder durchaus positiv ausfallen.\nEin insgesamt sehr emotionales und mitreißendes Spiel, das den Spieler fesselt und ihm somit die \"Echtheit\" des Geschehens berührend übermittelt. Schade, dass der Entwickler dicht gemacht hat und somit keinen weiteren Teil der \"BioShock\"-Reihe entwickeln wird. Uneingeschränkt von mir zu empfehlen und nun werde ich mich nachträglich, besser spät als nie und voller Vorfreude, in die Tiefen des Meeres zur Unterwasserstadt Rapture begeben!","timestamp_created":1388712474,"timestamp_updated":1405622333,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601449251174926758","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8526016","author":{"steamid":"76561197990276925","num_games_owned":311,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2,"last_played":1398316820},"language":"english","review":"All you do in this game is look at the ground while looting corpses.

But, just like Bioshock again, any topics they bring up like racism for example has no commentary or explanation for it which is just bad. This is because it makes the setting and characters feel shallow, and because commentary and explanation can be interesting and informative in it's own right. \n\nThe interactions between Booker and Elizabeth are interesting and will probably keep you engage enough to see the story to the end, but most of the game is bad shoot people gameplay. \n\nPeople will argue that the gameplay is bad because B:I got rid of basically all the RPG elements in Bioshock and also made the map design completely linear, but I disagree with this. These people don't remember that Bioshock already had shallow RPG mechanics and poor map design. The maps were design so that each path was a deadend that the player had to backtrack through once a mission was done... instead of making things loop around. This happens in B:I still, but the linearity negates most of it to optional missions. \n\nIn B:I the vigors (plasmids) nearly all do the same thing (LMB to attack, RMB to make a trap) removing any strategy on which one to choose and removing any reason to mix them together (which atleast Bioshock had). You also can only hold 2 weapons, which ruins any chance of mixing up the gameplay. Like you have limited resources so you have to choose wisely on what weapons to upgrade so you'll probably only hold the same 2 weapons you've upgraded through the game because if you upgraded a 3rd weapon you won't be able to use it unless you randomly find it on the ground in the middle of the fight. \n\nAlso since you don't have an inventory Elizabeth will randomly throw you items that you need during a fight which means there isn't really any strategy to refilling your health/magic in the middle of combat. Yes there are items that have small refilling benefits but that doesn't replace potions. You also can buy refill potions that are applied instantly and also random refill areas in combat arenas so just abuse these locations?\n\nBut while they basically stripped down the gameplay to a bare FPS minimum, I think it was a step in the right direction for these developers. But they needed to go one step further, remove the gameplay entirely. Seriously, if this was a Themepark Simulator there would have been more time to flesh out the narrative, characters, and setting which the game greatly needed.\n\nI played the game on medium and I would not recommend playing it on higher difficulties because there are bullet sponge enemies and the only boss fight in the game is a bullet sponge that infinitely spawns enemies in which you fight the boss multiple times. \n\nI can't recommend this game because of the poor gameplay. I would recommend instead watching an LP (Let's Play or Long Play depending on your perspective c;) and buying some cool looking merchandise from Irrational Games instead https://store.irrationalgames.com/","timestamp_created":1388711580,"timestamp_updated":1388712091,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498964369297027588","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlqLqqsMCevzCIA=="}
