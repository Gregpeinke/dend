En el caso de la inteligencia artificial de los soldados (por ejemplo), ha mejorado un poco su puntería y movimiento: antes en el juego base, era bastante fácil matarlos puesto que a la hora de atacar, estos no podían llegar a nosotros. En algunas ocasiones iban de un lado a otro e incluso no respondían a nuestra presencia. Aquí por lo menos los encuentros con ellos son algo más frenéticos: muy rápidos para hallarte y disparar. En el caso de los gráficos debo decir que me dejó algo disgustado: Los efectos visuales además del diseño de los enemigos no me terminaron de convencer. Siento que estuviera jugando un Half-Life con shaders. Pero bueno. En el caso de los efectos de sonido debo decir que, si bien los diálogos llegan a sonar en muy buena calidad, tristemente sólo llega a ser momentáneo: de ahí no entiendo qué sucede y llegan a decir cosas por otras sin algún tipo de sentido o continuidad en lo que hablan. Aunque bueno, de ahí a los sonidos de las criaturas, helicópteros, objetos y demás, está decente. Lo menos llamativo de este juego son los bugs: por momentos se ve que todo tu alrededor se multiplica a lo bestia, siendo algo incómodo a la hora de jugar.\n\nEn resumidas cuentas: Si deseas jugar Half-Life remasterizado pues no te recomiendo probar esto. Tiene demasiados bugs y parece que Valve no le hubiera puesto el suficiente empeño.\n\n5/10","timestamp_created":1630279011,"timestamp_updated":1636642285,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535211265087127686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98473950","author":{"steamid":"76561198089241315","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":1061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1660053448},"language":"english","review":"Better then what I heard about it, the main thing I like is that it has the HD textures.

respecto a la versión original, se supone que es una remasterización con el motor Source, algo que si hicieron con Counter Strike o Day of Defeat por poner un ejemplo, pero realmente es un copia y pega de la entrega original con muy pocos cambios notables, el único que muchos recalcan es la textura \"realista\" del agua, además de un detallado mínimo en los modelos de las armas, todo lo demás está igual a la versión base de Half-Life, las físicas permanecen intactas y lo único que noté (y no recuerdo si permanece igual en la versión GoldSource), es un retroceso asqueroso en la MP5, haciéndola imposible de disparar al blanco a distancias largas, teniendo que convertir el arma en un arma, valga la redundancia,de disparo a corta distancia, y sin mencionar los múltiples errores que la comunidad ha encontrado, haciendo que el juego sea un dolor de cabeza a la hora de querer jugar, afortunadamente, si se podría considerar así, los únicos bugs que me topé jugando el juego fueron unos errores de iluminación horripilantes en el capítulo \"procesado de residuos\", y otro error que muy comúnmente ocurría era acerca de la IA de los enemigos, debido a que en muchas ocasiones, sin importar que tan cercas estés del objetivo, este no te atacaba, ocurriendo demasiadas veces con los cangrejos.\nEn fin, si tienes pensado jugar este juego, te recomiendo probar la versión original de 1998, o en su caso, si quieres obtener una experiencia similar a Half-Life Source sin ningún bug ni glitch, prueba \"Half-Life: Restored\" disponible en Steam, podrás descargar esa versión únicamente

Simples e bom é o que define esse jogo em 2021.\nJogar esse jogo é como voltar no tempo quando as coisas eram incríveis mesmo sem gráficos ultra.\nObrigatório para qualquer fã de video game.\nA diferença desse jogo para o Half Life original é que esse é mais arrumadinho. Umas texturas aqui, umas luzes ali, uns brilho fingindo ser reflexo lá. Ainda parece um jogo de ps1 mas é o mais bonito dos jogos de ps1.\nObs: É bom mas não precisa ter pressa pra jogar.
