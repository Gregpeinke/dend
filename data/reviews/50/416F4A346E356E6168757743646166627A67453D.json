В него стоит сыграть не только чтобы увидеть инцидент в чёрной мезе с другого ракурса, но и испытать  новшества, которыми не обделена эта часть, в отличии от Blue Shift.\n\n[h1]Сюжет:[/h1]\n\nНачинается примерно во время главы \"поверхностное натяжение\". Морпех Адриан Шепард вместе с товарищами был отправлен в чёрную мезу дабы истребить всё и вся, но не тут то было... В результате атаки электрических скатов выживает только Шепард, морпеху предстоит проделать нелёгкий путь через ксеновскую живность, тёмных оперативников и новых врагов - расу X.\n\nЛокации в основном отличаются от оригинала. Можно будет побывать в ядре лямбды, исследовательском центре из главы \"сомнительная этика\" и даже в тренировочном центре, который был только в Source, ну и конечно же, в ксене.\n\nНо таинственный G-man не обошёл Шепарда стороной, и тоже местами то тут, то там появляется.\n\nОднако многими игроками данная часть не считается каноном, из-за расы Х и морпехов, не убивавших учёных\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1777657220 \n\n[h1]Геймплей:[/h1]\n\nПомимо нового пушечного мяса, расы Х(пещерные трутни, шоковые солдаты и тд.), оперативники представлены ещё и мужчинами, в отличии от оригинала, здесь они основные враги, которые чем-то опаснее, чем те же морпехи в оригинале.\n\nНа протяжении игры перестрелок стало значительно больше, нежели головоломок, хотя и тут найдётся над чем поломать голову. Некоторые места зделаны весьма хардкорно, вроде тоннелей полных Валтигоров (здоровых и выносливых существ расы Х, способных буквально ваншотнуть персонажа) или места, где нужно закрыть шлюзы, через которые прут бесконечным потоком пещерные трутни.\n\nС новыми врагами появились и новые союзники, здесь и обычные солдаты с mp5, с M249, полевые медики и инженеры, выпиливающие дверь. Но в целом такие союзники куда полезнее, чем охранники со слабыми glock-ами.\n\nАрсенал оружия тоже обзавёлся новыми стволами : [i]Снайперская винтовка[/i], [i]Desert Eagle[/i] с лазерным прицелом, [i]пулемёт М249[/i], [i]шоковый таракан[/i](аналог рукоулья), [i]споровый метатель[/i](по урону что-то среднее между снайперкой и РПГ), [i]ручной барнакл[/i](прицепляется к определённым местам) и даже [i][strike]BFG[/strike][/i] [i]Телепортирующее орудие[/i], позволяющее при 60 единицах плазмы перемещатся в ксен. Итого имеем аж 7 типов оружия!\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1801246092 \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1837514839\n\nНо как и в оригинале, Opposing Force имеет боссов : пещерного червя, которого нужно победить, повернув вентиль Valve, активировав Steam и включив коробку передач Gearbox. Второй же, геночервь и тут тоже ест пасхалка, его \"голос\" это замедленное обратное воспроизведение фразы  «чтобы выиграть игру, ты должен убить меня, Рэнди Питчфорда».\n\n[h1]Итог:[/h1]\n\nOpposing Force - пример эталонного дополнения, предлагающего не только новый взгляд на ту же историю, но и новых врагов, локации, оружие, союзников, и другое впечатление от прохождения.\n\nРекомендуется всем, такая же бессмертная классика, как и оригинальный Half - Life\n\n[h1]9 мёртвых оперативников из 10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1566808733,"timestamp_updated":1567227886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.696761429309844971","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54807718","author":{"steamid":"76561197998784211","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":404,"last_played":1566792566},"language":"english","review":"This was sitting in my Steam Library for a long time.

In >current year, I'd not be surprised if the average gamer finds it very difficult. Unlike HL, this game focuses on combat (you're a HECU marine sent in to 'silence' the facility and all associated assets) and, though primitive, things like taking cover behind terrain, baiting enemies with grenades, scoring fat gibs with the handful of satchels the game gives you, and using your advanced AI (for the late 90s) squad members properly is satisfying, and a reward all of its own, not to mention the huge selection of new weapons that augment the arsenal.\n\nThe theme of the game, for those who are interested in such things, is 'survival at all costs.'\n\nThe game's fairly stingy with supplies, but early into the game, you're given a special weapon that's all-but useless for offensive purposes, but teleports you to hazardous breather locations, as it were, where supplies, healing ponds, and so on, may be found - however, ammunition for this weapon is extremely limited, so you'll at most be using it once per level.\n\nI played this when it came out, almost 20 years ago, and it still holds up today - though you'll want to set a more modern resolution, and tune the uber dark environments to accommodate 20 years of monitor technology and progress. About 8000k to 9300k monitor temperature  should do the trick, then adjust the actual contrast, and you'll be fragging like it's the 90s.\n\nHighly recommended. One of my favorite oldschool shooters. It was then, it is now, and likely forever will be.

Opposing Force is one of these. It introduces the greatest character in all of Half-Life... Adrian Shephard. The Opposing Force also adds changes a few things. As you may imagine at the end of the game you have different weapons than you'd have if you played OG Half-Life. It creates new interesting opportunities to make this experience unique and not only a repetition of the same as in one other expansion.\nThe marks I give in this review are mine and mine alone. I will be granting points, from 1 to 10, according to my choice and I will try to add comments whenever neccessary.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]Criterion[/th]\n[th]Mark[/th]\n[th]Comments[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[th]Story[/th]\n[th]8/10[/th]\n[th]The same events as in Half-Life although seen from another perspective[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[th]Audio[/th]\n[th]8.5/10[/th]\n[th]It goes well with what's going on-screen[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[th]Visual representation[/th]\n[th]5/10[/th]\n[th]In 2019 it shows the age[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[th]Gameplay[/th]\n[th]10/10[/th]\n[th]First person shooting in its prime, puzzles not too hard[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[th]Controls[/th]\n[th]9/10[/th]\n[th]Would be 10/10 if not for the crouch jump, Ctrl+Space is not intuitive, changing crouching key to key of choice makes it more bearable[/th]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b][u] Important notes [/u][/b]\nIf you finished this expansion and want more I recommend playing through another official expansion for Half-Life that was not released on PC. It is named [i] Decay [/i]. Thanks to the gracious Half-Life modding community all PC users can experience this expansion in full glory. To download the modification click >>[url=https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-decay/downloads/half-life-decay] HERE [/url]<<\n\n[b][u] Conclusion [/u][/b]\nLooking back at this experience I think I enjoyed this expansion a little more than the original Half-Life. I have finished it in 6 hours, but I am really bad at these kind of games. You can finish this expansion in half the time I spent on it. It is easily one of the best experiences I had ever pleasure of playing.","timestamp_created":1564705125,"timestamp_updated":1564705382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54399354","author":{"steamid":"76561198838627314","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1091,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":625,"last_played":1653090899},"language":"latam","review":"El juego es muy bueno pero lo que no me gusto es que el juego no esta en español eso es lo malo","timestamp_created":1564633637,"timestamp_updated":1564633637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54399178","author":{"steamid":"76561198095287156","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1096,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":875,"last_played":1564726250},"language":"english","review":"Opposing Force is a challenging, but fun game.

Suddenly, you are put into advanced training for dealing with top secret research facilities because of that pesky G-man and his employers, and are sent to Black Mesa after it all goes downhill.\nYou never received your orders..so you end up trying to make sense of all of the chaos while your fellow Marines perish as the chaos unfolds.\nScientists and security are reluctant to help, and you do run into sparse Marine specialists to help you along the way to Lambda Complex, where you are trying to prevent a serious alien invasion from destroying the area. \nEventually you win, and Adrian is put into a place by the G-man to be retained for 'potential future employment'\n\nThis expansion wanted to shed light on the Resonance Cascade through the eyes of the Black Mesa 'clean up crew', and see how it was on the other side of the fight. There are new mechanics, such as the ability to control specialized Marines that can open doors and heal you. There is also (awful) rope physics! Multiplayer was introduced in this expansion, but I have never played it so I can't speak for it.\nThe graphics, sound, AI, voice acting, controls, and general design of the game are exactly the same as the original Half-Life.\n\nPlay this if you want to see a side story set during the Resonance Cascade.

Personally, I didn't like the OG Half-Life TOO much, from the BS cheap enemy spawns and the overreliance on bad first person platforming that makes the player save scum whether they want to or not. Is all that still in this expansion campaign? Yes, but lessened, and the campaign is shorter so it doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nI also found the weapon selection, while only SLIGHTLY varied from the first one, is an improvement. The special ops handgun that replaces the magnum in the original is great, the .50 cal (I think it's an FAL, not sure though) rules, and the alien guns, I thought, were way more useful. \n\nThere's also more of a focus in this game on using survivors that you find and keeping them alive to help you out and use them in contextual situations than the first one, and I think that works well here. \n\nThe only down side was that there were some tech problems getting this one up and running, as it wouldn't open properly and Steam seemed to think that the game was running when it was not. So I had to restart my computer, open the game, close hl.exe in my task manager, have Steam verify the files, THEN open the game again and it would work. Luckily, I was able to beat the game in 3 separate sessions, so I could uninstall this one quick, haha. Yeah, maybe it was just a computer problem locally, but I haven't had that problem with any other game on my Steam library, except for a slightly similar problem with Hitman Blood Money. Strange, be on the lookout for problems with this one. Some troubleshooting may be required.\n\nThe plot is also pretty cool, as they did a good job having it overlap with the original game, where the first 2/3rds of this game take place over the second half of the original, but from a separate perspective, humanizing the military a little more where in the OG they were just 100% evil and unsympathetic. You also get to see that Freeman wasn't the ONLY person the G-Man was utilizing to fulfill his ends.\n\nAll in all, where the OG Half-Life left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth over the more aggravating aspects and flaws of the game that really built up near the end half, I didn't have as much of a problem with this one, as they had figured it out a little bit more and were just throwing together a short side campaign, and I thought it worked.\n\nIf you just care about the plot of Half-Life and the origins of Freeman, you're better off just playing the first one and then moving on to the second one, but if you just want to see what the gameplay of the original is like but want less frustrations, or if you REALLY liked the OG and want more of it, then try this one. It's less than $1 on sale, and if you bought the original Half-Life in a cheap pack on sale, then you already own this one.","timestamp_created":1563622731,"timestamp_updated":1563623121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52679365873336792","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54193128","author":{"steamid":"76561198904806596","num_games_owned":487,"num_reviews":111,"playtime_forever":321,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":265,"last_played":1563621938},"language":"schinese","review":"依旧老的“带不动”的版本，日常闪退，我的怀念经典的精神可以说很真诚了。这个版本是以一个军事专家的身份消灭大BOSS，游戏里还会碰到外星敌人，尝试一些新型武器，电脑比较差的可以玩玩（手动滑稽）","timestamp_created":1563619837,"timestamp_updated":1563619837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53586500883102417","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54189753","author":{"steamid":"76561198103175440","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":20,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1545734657},"language":"english","review":"A short version but still a lovely side story.","timestamp_created":1563600466,"timestamp_updated":1563600466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54188801","author":{"steamid":"76561198881966687","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1569036974},"language":"english","review":"best half life expansion pack","timestamp_created":1563594005,"timestamp_updated":1563594005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54188661","author":{"steamid":"76561198240380374","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1710,"last_played":1613260386},"language":"english","review":"Best half life YET!!!!\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1563593067,"timestamp_updated":1563593067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n5nahuwCdafbzgE="}
