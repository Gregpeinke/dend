Конечно же я решил купить что-нибудь,желательно с хорощим сюжетом. Мой выбор пал на Bioshock triple pack,но отзыв мой именно о последней части трилогии-Bioshock Infinite.\n1)Сюжет. Он действительно хорош,задевает душу. Порой игра преподносит нам такие вопросы,поиск ответов на которые становится для нас главной целью. Вы-Букер ДеВитт,бывший сыщик и герой войны. На дворе 1912 год. Место действия-летающий город Колумбия,смесь культуры девятнадцатого-двадцатого веков и высоких технологий. Цель вроде бы проста-найти и похитить девушку,но это оказывается практически невыполнимой задачей...\n2)Графика. Это,конечно,не фотореалитичная игрушка,однако графон отлично подходит к миру игры,меж тем радуя глаз. Детально проработано всё,вплоть до мимики Элизабет.\n3)Геймплей. Эта часть игры,как и предыдущие-шутер от первого лица. Помимо набора оружия того времени есть приспособление для ближнего боя-аэрокрюк,позволяющий отрубать головы и кататься по местным воздушным магистралям. \nДва пункта,заслуживающие отдельного внимания:\n4)Элизабет. Цель Букера,его шанс отдать все долги. Красавица,прямо как в сказке,с рождения томится в башне,а наша цель-спасти её. Мы не рыцари,но это не важно. Как я уже говорил,её облик проработан детально. Она действительно красива,а также \"жива\"-то есть,реагирует на события,возмущается,замечает предметы и врагов,грустит в плохие моменты. Она не просто груз-она очень хороший спутник,пусть и не владеющий оружием,но помогающий деньгами,аптечками и маной. Ещё она создаёт разрывы,но это спойлер.\n5)Концовка. Ох,это нечто. Её сложно понять,а ещё сложнее-принять. Серьёзно,разработчики умные люди.\nИтог: Игра более чем стоит своих денег,однозначный musthave! Несмотря на то,что пройти её-дело недолгое,вы будете серьёзно увлечены процессом. 10 разрывов из 10.","timestamp_created":1438542959,"timestamp_updated":1438542959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17355208","author":{"steamid":"76561198097274589","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":778,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":778,"last_played":1437900525},"language":"english","review":"This was an absolutely brillant game.

Horrendous.\n\nBioShock Infinite starts off as well as any other BioShock game, with a compelling opening, and a vague mission that eggs you on and drives you to explore and understand the whys and hows of this huge floating utopia.\n\nHowever, half-way through it becomes stupidly confusing, and that's when the game starts to drift away from everything you might've expected; a blooming story, with real-like relationships, profound choices, and so on... but no, none of this happens. Instead you're dragged around in circles until your head starts to spin with lofty concepts which only add to the totally underwhelming futility of trying to figure out what the f*ck is going on, and why any of it matters, and how any of it relates to the past two games. It doesn't, ever.\n\n\nIf you want an oversimplified art piece on the sublimity of quantum physics, this is your game.\n\nI understand, BioShock in the past has used some pretty high-brow concepts in its narrative and has been noted as a series than can be confusing, however the past two games were at least coherent, and had a more solid, and flowing narrative.\n\nInfinite... is just a mess. A hot, beautiful mess.\n\nMechanically, it lacks from the past two games. The combat is dumbed down into a generic FPS style, and you're allowed to carry only TWO weapons.. Frequently you will found yourself ammo-starved because the ammo-pick up is not only limited to two guns of your choosing, but is also tethered to the chance of Elizabeth finding and throwing you some, randomly. And plasmids (or in Infinite, Vigor) are ridiculously boring, upgrades are way too expensive, and everything about this game is just not as interesting as the last two games. \n\nDon't get me wrong, this game is definitely worth at least one play-through if its on sale. For sure, it's a good game. But it's not great.\n\nMainly, don't expect BioShock 3.\n","timestamp_created":1438506010,"timestamp_updated":1438506010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472131162881851196","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17346686","author":{"steamid":"76561198140957379","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1233,"last_played":1500203770},"language":"english","review":"Definetly recommend.

What happened afterwards? Were they somewhat thankless? Did they not appreciate the effort that you went through? To some degree this game really goes out to spoil you as a gamer. It spoils you with high definition graphics and art, it spoils you with a over the top music score and sound effects. Everything in the game is large, loud, vibrant and explosive. However all this spoiling has a downside too, the worst part is that it spoils you with giving you way too much advantage. The high graded weapons are too powerful, the various clothes you can wear have added perks which make the game too easy and the plasmids/infusions you get throughout the game make the difficulty of the game pretty much a no brainer. This game is so easy thanks to things like 'winter shield' I hardly found it challenging at all with the exception of the end. \n\nSeriously. Me. The guy who can't play csgo if his life depended on it, the guy who begins to weep openly when those front doors of tf2 open up, the guy who completely soils his pants everytime he sees a child in 'no more room in hell', me the guy who practically moans in every review that the game is too hard. Yes that guy, found this game soooooooooooo easy, that i was seriously yawning at parts as I ran ahead just pulling the trigger.\n\nIs the game scary? Hell no. The infusions make you so powerful, who even needs to hide in the game? Just sprint forward and kill everything. There is no need to stealth, no sneaking around required because there is a formidable opponent just around the corner waiting for you, because lets face it, if there is, he is the one in trouble, not you.\n\nThe game is designed by these people... http://irrationalgames.com/ and as you are all probably aware the Bio-shock franchise was largely inspired by this golden nugget found here http://store.steampowered.com/app/238210/ . However no matter how hard they try, none of the Bioshock games quite match the same level of brilliance as 'System Shock 2' which is where the true inspiration of the game originates from.\n\nThis is the third game in the series continuing from Bio-shock and Bio-shock 2, but instead of calling it Bio-shock 3 they have opted for the tag infinite. This is largely because the game plays around with the notion of alternate parralel universes especially in the contingency of the Bio-shock realm which has already been introduced in the previous two games. The problem with writing about quantum hypotheticals is that you can pretty much come up with any mumbo jumbo and they just about have.\n\nAccording to the alternate realities theory. Any action you do will automatically spawn another alternate universe where the opposite action/reaction was performed. For instance if you choose not to marry a certain girl in this universe, another version of you in another universe does marry that girl, which then plays out another scenario where you can have children or do not have children. Every decision/action made branches a new universe. Hence infinite possibilties, infinite universes, infinite you.\n\nThe game begins with you Mr Booker De Witt discovering that you have a specialised mission to 'bring us the girl to wipe away the debt', other than that you have very little recollection of anything else previously. Ofcourse this raises a number of questions, who is the girl? Why do i have to bring her? What is the debt? Who am i? Why can't I remember anything? Eventually as you progress you discover that the girl your looking for is Elizabeth who has the special power of opening up tears where you can travel to other alternate parrarel realities. You also find out that she is locked up in large tower by a feared and yet revered guy known as Komstock who has advertised to all his flock that a false shephard will arrive to take away the girl and that the false shepherd has a mark on the back of his hand consisting of two letters A.D. Other than warning all his flock to be on the look out for the 'False Shepherd' he has also devised a mechanical monster known as the 'songbird' inspired in creation from the 'Big Daddys' in the previous two games, two protect the girl and keep her locked up in the tower.\n\nThe biggest problem with the alternate universe theory is that there really is NO official time line. EVERY decision and action will branch a new reality. The game tries to fix this by getting you to follow the official timeline of the 123rd Booker De Witt where something different happens in comparison to the 122 Booker De Witts before namely that he survives a digested potion. From this point on your creating NEW ground where every action and decision again creates another hypothetical alternate reality. To further add to this confusion is that with the power of Elizabeth you can jump about through all these alternate realities influencing them too. By the end of it all you will be spoilt with the back stories of Elizabeth, Komstock, Columbia in the sky, the song bird and the list goes on spelling out everything and nicely tying up any loose ends made in the previous games. To tell you the truth the writers did a pretty superb job in solving pretty much everything, but it does not mean that this in fact works. IT DOESN'T. There are so many loopholes in this story that one could still write a book about it.\n\n(Serious Spoilers below)\n\nFor instance during the game you will work out that your opting out of baptism created a completely different character in comparison to the guy who went through it. At the end the only solution presented to you is that you must be killed so that no more Booker De Witts get created. You pretty much stand there and accept this fatality as a noble and essential happening to save mankind in general. In truth there are so many more ways the problem could have been solved. The only reason why you seek baptism is because of an attrocity you commited in the battle of 'wonded knee' therefore if you simply pulled out a gun and shot yourself in the foot before the battle began you still would have saved all mankind and yourself as well. But alas you never take such things into account and accept death. Ofcourse the fact that someone kills you in this reality automatically means that in another reality someone does not and hence the story continues infinitely.\n\n(end of spoilers)\n\nIs the game violent? The first encounter you have against hostiles is pretty much the worst when it comes to violence. You start off required to rotate a saw blade through the head of a few police and there is no way to really get around that, but it is short and before you know it your presented with a gun where you can shoot them all from a distance. As you power up the weapons though you can pretty much explode your enemies too, so keep that in mind.\n\nAfter all said and done, there is enough graphically and story wise to give this a solid thumbs up, however the gamers are spoilt ridiculously with having too much at their disposal. There is no horror survival, no stealth, no rationing your ammo needed here. I highly recommend you play the first two games before attempting this, I also highly recommend that you place this game on the hardest difficulty before you embark on the adventure so that you really get the most out of it. For most people the eyecandy alone will be enough for them, for other the simple fact that you get to shoot things and make things go BOOM would be another reason to love the game. However for the gamers looking for something really challenging do not get your hopes up. There is a LOT of hype with this game. Its a good game, but its by no means the GREATEST game ever.","timestamp_created":1438502822,"timestamp_updated":1438502822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570389926433563232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17346171","author":{"steamid":"76561198063853310","num_games_owned":316,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":1796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1632,"last_played":1475566522},"language":"czech","review":"skvela hra hodne lehka projeta na hard :)","timestamp_created":1438502264,"timestamp_updated":1438502264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553012490272521973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17346159","author":{"steamid":"76561198036644851","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1202,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1111,"last_played":1491154572},"language":"french","review":"Après avoir fini Bioshock 1er du nom.

O jogo possui uma história espetacular, é dificil não se envolver em alguns minutos de jogo.\n\nO capricho que os produtores tiveram neste game é algo raro de se ver, desde o inicio do jogo você vai perceber que o nível de detalhe é algo que até os mais exigentes vão ficar de boca aberta. Não é atoa que até hoje muitos sites de benchmark utilizam o Bioshock em testes gráficos.\nOutra parte boa do jogo é a jogabilidade, que traz uma dinâmica diferente dos outros Bioshock...É possível utilizar trilhos aeros para se deslocar entre edifífios ou até mesmo durante a batalha preparando uma melhor tática.\n\nNa parte de som o jogo honra bem aos antecessores, não deixando nada a desejar.\nO jogo possui varias dificuldade que vai da mais fácil até o modo 1999, a super dificuldade onde há varias limitações tornando o game muito mais interessante.\nPontos fortes que na minha opnião faz muita diferença nesse game é a Elizabeth, personagem que vai te seguir praticamente o jogo todo. Ela vai te ajudar em algumas situações, seja encontrando dinheiro pra você, munição, abrindo fechaduras e entre outros itens. O carisma dela é algo que faz esse game seja diferente de todos os outros.\n\nO game é leve e ele possui uma ampla variedade de opções para que até PC's mais modestos possam rodar ele sem problemas. Mais para ter a melhor experiência o ideal é ter a configuração recomendada...\n\nEu costumo dizer que Bioshock Infinity é uma das melhores aquisições que eu fiz.

De início eu estranhei um pouco este terceiro jogo da série. Não por algum problema ou algo do tipo, mas por este ser \"muito diferente\" se comparado à BioShock 1 e 2. A começar pelo novo cenário: a cidade flutuante de Columbia (que aliás, é tão fantástica quanto Rapture!). Tudo muito claro, céu azúl, sol, praia e muitas pessoas felizes. Completamente o oposto do clima tenso e obscuro dos jogos anteriores. Mas é jogando o jogo que você percebe que tudo tem uma razão. A história dessa vez tem uma pegada profética, a ciência ainda está presente e também temos um terceiro elemento que é o multiverso de realidades alternativas. [Lembro-me que, em BioShock 2, em uma sala que está toda congelada e tal, nos deparamos com um (Easter Egg) gato congelado de nome: Schrödinger... Sim o 'Gato de Schrödinger' da teoria/paradoxo do vivo e morto! Nota-se então, que BioShock já flertava com a Mecânica Quântica ainda antes de sua utilização em BioShock Infinite] Enfim, a história está toda amarrada e no final vai explodir cabeças! E é com o desenrolar de tudo que as coisas vão ficando cada vaz mais interessantes. Já sou um grande fã da série, e BioShock Infinite entrou fácil na minha lista dos melhores jogos ever!

Character development is a big deal to me and this game definitely delivered.","timestamp_created":1438437428,"timestamp_updated":1438437428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586206912994384766","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17333510","author":{"steamid":"76561198128372247","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":89,"playtime_forever":1500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":428,"last_played":1647997792},"language":"english","review":"OMG LOVE THIS GAME ! !","timestamp_created":1438437144,"timestamp_updated":1438437144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17333470","author":{"steamid":"76561198035387981","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":645,"last_played":1586933006},"language":"english","review":"Crazy game story with a very good FPS quality that put Bioshock Infinite amount with the best games.Then you play the game for 15 minutes you don't know what really is happening you are so confused and put yourself this question is that really the game that I want it? or Did i chose right to buy this?And the answer is simple YES.Trust me you won't injure your wallet.This game is awesome and deserve to be played by anyone who want to experiece some FPS action game.\n9/10","timestamp_created":1438436946,"timestamp_updated":1438436946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17332251","author":{"steamid":"76561198125654546","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3068,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":808,"last_played":1497525516},"language":"russian","review":"очень хорошая графика + сюжет захватывающий \n10 из 10","timestamp_created":1438431173,"timestamp_updated":1438431173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17332230","author":{"steamid":"76561198044338470","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":300,"last_played":1445979579},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever made...","timestamp_created":1438431075,"timestamp_updated":1438431075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17331776","author":{"steamid":"76561198201860531","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":83,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1438554363},"language":"german","review":"mega geiles spiel!","timestamp_created":1438428996,"timestamp_updated":1438428996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17331744","author":{"steamid":"76561198073787222","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1699,"last_played":1439149093},"language":"english","review":"This isn't a game, it's a joyful-tear-soaked-floating city of emotions with buttons.","timestamp_created":1438428797,"timestamp_updated":1438428797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17331648","author":{"steamid":"76561198073666347","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":406,"last_played":1438428146},"language":"english","review":"this game is 10/10 . one of the best storys In a game .

Вашему вниманию представляются: один из самых сложных и запутанных сюжетов в истории интерактивного искусства; харизматичные, интересные и живые персонажи, озвученные талантливыми актёрами; невероятная по своей сложности и красоте работа художников. Творение последних - суть проекта. Когда вы только попадёте в летающий город Колумбию, вы не сможете оторваться от тех красот, что перед вами открываются.
