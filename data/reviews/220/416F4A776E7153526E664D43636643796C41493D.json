Half-Life 2 one of the best games ever made. As someone who just finished playing it for the first time, I think so. The beginning had me hooked to the story and world immediately (much of this how well the story is told without cutscenes) and I never got bored of it. Each chapter, for the most part, had some new gameplay element that the chapter revolved around. This kept the gameplay fresh and unique. These chapters I thought did a fantastic job at exploring the intricacies of these concepts.\nThe level design in Half-Life 2 is among the best I've seen in videogames (to be fair, I don't play many modern games). Especially in the early chapters, I felt the level design evoked a sense that you were in a place that could actually exist, that just so happened to be traversable as a linear level. While I'm on the topic, one complaint I have about the original Half-Life is that for the majority of the game you're just travelling from room to room of an inconceivably large building, which often felt claustrophobic and monotonous. I never got that sense in Half-Life 2. In Half-Life 2, you're boating down large waterways, driving between outposts on coastal highways, travelling through a ruined town and dilapidated city; the variety and openness of many of the settings often make you forget just how linear the game is.\nMaybe my only complaint is that it could be longer. But the length of the game is certainly acceptable. All in all, one of the best games I've ever played (maybe only behind Ocarina of Time tbh), and I could totally see myself replacing this in the future.\n","timestamp_created":1594495894,"timestamp_updated":1594495894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72515818","author":{"steamid":"76561198830781954","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":92,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1660623615},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego, no hay nada más que decir. 9/10","timestamp_created":1594492838,"timestamp_updated":1594492838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72512642","author":{"steamid":"76561199060214924","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1590483771},"language":"french","review":"Bon jeu.","timestamp_created":1594488793,"timestamp_updated":1608403277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72511500","author":{"steamid":"76561199025074618","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":562,"last_played":1606652031},"language":"turkish","review":"Gayet Tadında Ve Uygun Bir Oyundu.

You can't beat this game on shooting alone! strategies and quick thinking must be used at every corner of every level to minimise health loss and to conserve ammo and supplies, the game will present you many situations where you may not have to fight or give you tools which are more effective than your guns. \n\nProblem solving is scattered all through out the levels too, where to commence the level you must slow down and use the physics engine to solve certain problems you might encounter. I really haven't seen this type of level design in fps games before and I'm still yet to experience it (may be my narrow game knowledge idk).\n\nThe gameplay mechanics of this game make it incredibly satisfying to play. the fast movement, quick shooting and interesting level design is one of the biggest reasons I would replay this game many times for years to come and is also the reason so many people do speed runs. This also means each level can be approached differently per replay, you are able to perfect how you approach certain situations to a point where not a single hp is lost and minimal supplies are used in the process.\n\n\nSTORY\nWell written story, definitely not my favourite part of this game, I think there is alot more to appreciate other than the writing but an effort has certainly been made when it comes to it and there is a motive to keep playing because of it. I had found myself at times being motivated by story alone however there are many other reasons I would've played this game\n\n\nATMOSPHERE \nthe ambience and background noises of city 17 really set the scene for players to understand the kind of dystopian world they were dealing with and adds a new depth to the environment. Ambience in games are key and hl2 is a VERY immersive game and is thanks to its built in ambience. The lighting and colouring of the game is dull in shades of grey and can sometimes leave you feeling very isolated and alone in the midst of this universe, I know at times I felt it and goes to show the work that valve puts into the atmospheric components of the game.\n\nOverall all these factors join together to make an absolute banger of a game that has aged incredibly well in the pc gaming world considering it was released in 2004 (16 years ago at the time of this review). I would recommend this game to absolutely anyone who has a PC and basic knowledge of FPS games, I guarantee you will not regret your purchase especially because its about down to a dollar during steam sales.\n\nThank you to whoever read down this far and I hope this helps inform your decision to buy this game :)\n","timestamp_created":1594448435,"timestamp_updated":1594448435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543859660625457764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72481290","author":{"steamid":"76561198034709064","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":770,"last_played":1611596930},"language":"russian","review":"Ну что сказать один из лучших шутеров на свете,всю игру сплошное разнообразие.","timestamp_created":1594447569,"timestamp_updated":1594447569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72479980","author":{"steamid":"76561198367840511","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":436,"last_played":1654397366},"language":"english","review":":) It's very fun!","timestamp_created":1594445459,"timestamp_updated":1594445459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72479881","author":{"steamid":"76561199031327499","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1627337660},"language":"spanish","review":"Finished, Good chapter","timestamp_created":1594445292,"timestamp_updated":1594445292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72479255","author":{"steamid":"76561198983402073","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2909,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1543,"last_played":1652827922},"language":"spanish","review":"Aver aclaremos algo este es uno de los mejores juegos de VALVE y si no tenes que jugar comprar esto seria la razon de no hacer los deberes.
