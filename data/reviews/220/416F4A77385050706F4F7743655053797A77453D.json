Half life 2. Everyone was hyped. People watched the trailer over and over.\nIt had contributed so much to the gaming community. It shows what modern gaming can do.\n\n5 years later, i was a kid and i had no idea what half life was. I was stuck watching minecraft, playing minecraft. Watching lets plays, watching skits. Remember ItsJerryAndHarry? They contributed so hard to my life with a simple 12 second joke and is the reason why i'm here. It feels to me like a fever dream to me. Something unreal. Something that never happened and my brain made to link the 2 eras of me together. I have to find it.\n\nHalf life 2 is a game made for the Source engine, and for a game from 2004, it still holds up. Something about the source engine... appeals to me. Appeals to all of us. With never before seen level of physics, ragdolls, and level of detail, it's been classed as one of the best games ever, or atleast the most influential. Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman. Rise and... shine.\n\nIt's funny how this minecraft youtuber who had a fixation on FARTS managed to kickstart my gaming career with a simple clip, really. But i digress. I found [b] [i] it. [/i] [/b] https://youtu.be/7wXaeq1E1kg?t=4m28s\nPlay it again. Did you see it? They jokingly transitioned into tf2. For most people, this would fly under the radar. But for me...\n\nNo one is deserving of a rest until... well. Let's just say your hour has... come again. So.\nWake up and smell the ashes. \nSince i was not fueled by hype and just got the game and episodes for Garry's Mod, this review will be cold. Nostalgia goggles NONEXISTANT. The bandaid is off.\nHalf life 2 begins 20 years after half life 1 and the combine have invaded the earth. Freeman teleports onto the train and departs. He is \"interrogated\" by Barney and then set free. Gordon gets caught in an apartment raid but is rescued by Alyx and lead to Kleiner's lab. The teleport goes haywire and you end up outside the window of the lab. Gordon is instructed to go to Black Mesa East.\n\nThis 10 second clip. I wonder who i could've been if it weren't for these 10 seconds. I asked my dad \"what is that?\" and \"can i play that?\". The rest is history. My steam account is created, i used the same profile picture from incredimail and i downloaded Team Fortress 2 in 2013 and i found my true purpose: [b] GAMING. [/b]\n\nGordon goes through an action sequence with Metrocops, finds out how explosive barrels work, optionally how to crouch jump (over the ramp with boom barrels), chain reactions, and then eventually Aux Power. I. Hate. AUX POWER. It limits your ability so much that it feels like being stuck in a 1x1 room. Fortunately, there is a built in stress reliever. Shoot the glass, throw stuff through the glass, it's so breakable! Fun fact: This next water scene and the next water scene are the only times you can sprint underwater. Get ready for inconspicuous ladder extravaganza. Fun fact: you can softlock yourself at the see-saw scene by throwing the cinderblocks away. You're not missing much other than manhacks.\n\nI started playing tf2. It was like a caveman discovering the iPhone. I had unlocked a new era of gaming. A new me. I started server hopping. Slender, deathrun, x10, sandbox, stop that tank, tr_walkway, cp_orange, dodgeball, tf2ware, jump, prophunt, instagib, etc.. Then i found my dream game. Garry's Mod. I wanted it. I wanted it for 1-2 years straight.\n\nFast forward to Water Hazard. You drive your airboat around like an action sequence, but then you get slammed by a giant door. Okay, you go through the obstacle course of combine and you slam it open. Action sequence resumes then you get slamemd by another giant door. You look at ways to get up. 1. the fenced area which is fenced off, and 2. the thing that looks like stairs, which is too high to get to. You fumble around until you realize you gotta go the other way. You go through and WHAT IS THIS CAR BARRCADE AND WHY IS IT ON FIRE AND HOW DO I GO THROUGH IT. At this point i just skipped to the next chapter.\n\n2 years later, i had done it. I finally received the funds to buy garry's mod. The chains were off. I had unlocked the rest of the gaming community. Now i had 2 things in my hand. 1. Garry's mod. It has limitless potential. You could do anything in that.\nAnd 2. I could now purchase videogames without a fuss. Before, i had a Pair, but now i have a Full House.\n\nTurns out the lighting in Black Mesa East is broken. I had to play the rest of half life 2 on mat_fullbright 1 in my original playthrough.\nHere, you get the gravity gun, which you'll basically forget about after the tutorial because REAL GUNS DO IT BETTER.\nAnd then you go to ravenholm. Ravenholm is arguably the best chapter, but it still falls short sometimes. There's no real sense of direction, some windows can be entered, some are grigori only, and the lighting never shows where you have to go. It's also dark, so good luck managing your aux power with sprint and flashlight.\n\nI can't really remember what happened after gmod. I had begun working my way up the ranks, buying games, making it big. I made dupes. I played around. I met sascha, i met ectobiologist15, i started interacting more with player20hh. I remember making my first friend. It was on an achievement server on a map that is now decommisioned (achievement_factory) and i was just generally messing about, trying all the different things on it. This is it. Overtime.\n\nHighway 17 is the most boring chapter out of all of the chapters. You drive around with your jeep and sometimes you have no idea what you need to do. The lighting is broken here too. Not much to say other than the crane was a wasted idea.\n\nI grew out of TF2. I was attracted to games like Counter strike, rainbow six siege, and such. People change. I started hanging out with Ecto and co. It was status quo. Nothing i could do. I had no other connections.\n\nAfter sandtraps (yes i skipped sand traps) is nova prospekt. Wouldn't you know it, it has broken lighting! Gordon fights combine and keeps accidentally teamkilling antlions breaking shit in nova prospekt.\nEntanglement: Gordon and Alyx team up again as they rescue eli and mossman from nova prospekt. Hooray.\nAnticitizen One: it is pretty fun, second best chapter but it's still confusing where you have to go (with bricked doorways and such)\nFollow freeman: Gordon goes out on a date with Barney. Or something.\n\nOur Benefactors + Dark Energy: It's actually pretty fun flinging combine around with your physgu- i mean super gravity gun. Just remember to host_timescale 30 dr breen's wild ride. Gordon fucks with the citadel and kills dr bren.\n\n\n\"Tell me Dr. Freeman if you can. You have destroyed so much. What is it that you have created? Can you name even one thing? I thought not.\"\nHalf Life 2 does not hold up that well in 2019. Lighting issues, lack of direction, and lack of replayability without mods plague the game. My story had almost the same pace as half life 2. A fast beginning, then slowing down and down until a screeching halt.\n\nRather than give you the illusion of choice, i will choose for you. \nNo, i do not recommend this game in 2019.","timestamp_created":1564573033,"timestamp_updated":1564573070,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518056333065032959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54386687","author":{"steamid":"76561198940275977","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1008,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":915,"last_played":1612793949},"language":"russian","review":"Игра
