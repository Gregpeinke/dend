Miután sikerül úgymond GLaDOS-s másodjári is legyőzni a történetünkbe egy csavar keletkezik mivel Wheatley áttveszi az irányítást a labor felett ami hatalmas káoszt indít, és szépen lassan kévégzi az egész labort, mivel GLaDOS-on kívül senki nemtudja megállítani csak rá számíthatunk ezáltam az ellenségünk válik a segítségünkre! Olyan 5-10 Feladat után eljutunk Wheatley-hez akielől menekülnünk kell mert minden áron meg akar minket ölni! És ekkor kezdődik a Boss Fight. 3 Gömböt kell rátenni Wheatley-re, hogy a rendszere tönkremenjen és GLaDOS visszaálíthasson mindent a régi kerékvágásba.[spoiler] (Űr Gömb, Kaland Gömb, Tény Gömb) [/spoiler] \nAmindt Wheatley-en van mind a 3 a rendszere meghibásodik és kéri, hogy válljon le a rendszerről és illesszünk be valami mást irányítónak na ekkor jön képbe GLaDOS akit úgy tudunk ismét a trónjára helyezni, hogy egy piros gomb lenyomásával Wheatley-t kilöki a rendszer és GLaDOS kerül a helyébe! Ám Wheatley nem hadja ezt és a gomb mellé robbanóanyagokat helyez ami kilök bennünket a gombtól, ám életben maradunk... Miután megnyomtuk a gombot leszakad a tetőnek egy része ami a Holdra néz. Odaportálozunk ami beszívja Wheatley-t és minket is. Az űrben Wheatley-t ellökjük magunktól majd ő az űrben marad de mi visszakerülünk a laborba GLaDOS-hoz.

本作为2010年E3三项主奖项获取者：最佳PC游戏，最佳XBOX 360游戏，最佳PS3游戏。\nPC GAMER评分：9.4\nIGN评分：9.5\nMetacritic评分：95[/h1] \n\n剧情：本作继承了上一作的剧情和设定，但在故事编写方面则没有刻意将自身锁定为“初代传送门的后续”，而是讲述了一个几乎全新的故事，至于上一作的相关内容则选择在剧情内不断以“渗入”的方式交代给玩家，既让老玩家能感受到那种熟悉的氛围，又不会耽误新玩家体验游戏。\n  另外，本作的剧情发展跌宕起伏，很多故事的发展不仅出人意料，同时也让人不禁拍案叫绝。尤其精彩的是，在剧情中，剧本作者不仅借着两个人工智能对人性之恶进行了相当深刻的鞭挞和揭露，同时也很好地将人性之善的本真和美好展示给了玩家。尽管整部作品里有名有姓的角色不超过十个，露面的更是只有区区四五位，但故事的丰满程度却不亚于一些动辄千百人登场的大群像类作品。可惜的是，系列的剧本作者Erik Wolpaw，已经于今年二月份离开Valve。这意味着我们可能无法再享受到本作原汁原味的故事的接续了。\n评价：10/10\n\n图像和音效：诚然，Source 2010引擎的重心并不在图像的逼真和精巧上，但用来表达游戏中那种平板，机械而又有点单调的视觉场景设计却是相当合适，而且精巧的角色设计和场景风格也很大程度上弥补了图像引擎的平庸。声音方面，为两位机械主角GlaDOS和Wheatley配音的配音演员用他们极富感情的声音，给整个游戏注入了灵魂，甚至可以说，无论是这两个角色，还是传送门系列这个游戏的成功，都离不开他们用心配音的加分。当然，游戏的其他音效因为直接照搬橙盒系列的素材，而显得有些单薄，不过基本是无损游戏体验的。\n评价：9/10\n\n上手性和可玩性：游戏的主要内容就是在不断的解决谜题的过程中揭示故事，所以谜题内容的设计品质将直接决定本作的成败。这一点，传送门系列树立了一个相当不错的标杆，玩家所解决的每一个谜题都经过了开发者精心设计和调整，既不至于简单到一眼看穿，也不至于难到令人生畏。谜题之间的难度提升很平缓，解题思路的暗示也给得比较明确（例如灰色的不可传送墙和白色的可传送墙），进一步简化了解题中不必要的记忆负担，使得解谜的过程充满了乐趣。不过也正因为如此，一旦掌握了某个谜题的解法之后，玩家便很难有兴致再进行第二次的挑战，降低了本作的重复游玩性。\n评价：8/10\n\n配置要求：和其他Source引擎的游戏一样，本作的配置要求仍然是非常亲民的，甚至主流中高端CPU的自带集成显示核心也可以在中低画质下相当流畅地运行。\n评价：9/10\n\n其他：\n\n[list]\n [*]玩法新颖。即使在现在，类似本作玩法的游戏仍然凤毛麟角。加分。\n [*]天马行空的脑洞和笑点在游戏里随处可见（比如嘲讽windows的蓝屏）。加分。\n [*]数量庞大而优秀的自制地图和自制模组支持。加分。\n [*]数量众多的周边（流行服饰，模型玩具等）。加分。\n [*]和《半条命》系列之间的隐藏关联让人浮想联翩。加分。\n [*]GlaDOS是个萌点爆棚的死傲娇。加分。\n [*]G胖不会数三。减分。\n [*]G胖不会数三。减分。\n [*]G胖不会数三。减分。\n [*]G胖你要是再不数三我就把你扔给GlaDOS做成人脑CPU。减分。\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]总结：橙盒系列作为Valve的招牌，游戏品质当然是无可辩驳的。本作也不例外。多玩玩这样的游戏，或许能让你找回最初玩游戏时的乐趣和感动，而且，也相当有益于你的逻辑思维培养。至少在这些方面，本作“比那些打打杀杀的游戏不知道高到哪里去了”。\n\n\n推荐度：★★★★★★/★★★★★（必入）[/h1]","timestamp_created":1488442167,"timestamp_updated":1488447334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":105,"votes_funny":24,"weighted_vote_score":"0.859760403633117676","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30273811","author":{"steamid":"76561198076635170","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":12409,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11685,"last_played":1514495269},"language":"french","review":"The

2 is a lot of fun! Furthermore Portal 2 is better than Portal!\n\nLooks like the portal superfans are after me! I need to hide.\n\nJust kidding! But seriously I don’t understand why there are so many people who bitch about this not “recapturing the magic” of Portal one (Yahtzee, I’m looking at you!).\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong, I adored portal. I remember I invited two friends over to my apartment for drinks and since I didn’t have internet at the time (I had just moved in) we ended up staying the whole night playing it and finishing it (granted we started at 2 and ended at 6, which is not really the “whole night”).\n\nPortal 2 fantastically builds on the work of Portal by really expanding on the physics toolbox to include… well I don’t want to spoil it but I must say that it’s incredibly imaginative! The story is really good and the controls are also improved!\n\nAlso JK Simmons is in it!
