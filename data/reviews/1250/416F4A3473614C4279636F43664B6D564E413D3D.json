With that being said, let's get the bottom line out of the way: This is a great game.\n\n[i]Killing Floor[/i] is a first-person shooter that pits the player against waves of mutant creatures, each with increasing levels of difficulty. Sound simple? That's because it is. I'm talking about the gameplay mechanics, mind you. Actually playing the game can be quite challenging at times.\n\nThis game delivers on many fronts. [b]The graphics are good. Not great, but good.[/b] The gameplay is quick and tons of fun. However, the game can get a little repetitive - It's just the nature of the FPS genre. The multiplayer is a blast, especially with 2-3 of your friends. Although this game does have a 'Solo' mode, don't expect to find a campaign, much less a storyline - you won't find either of those things here.\n\nAll-in-all, [i]Killing Floor[/i] is a fun game that you can just pick up and play. There are many great things to be had with this title. If you are contemplating purchasing it, (and you're expecting [i]Call of Duty[/i] style gunplay and quickness), Put your money down now. [i]Killing Floor[/i] will quench your thirst for mutant blood in no time flat.","timestamp_created":1420173484,"timestamp_updated":1420173878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13772873","author":{"steamid":"76561198069519985","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2262,"last_played":1488688652},"language":"english","review":"this game is great\nshoot zombies\nget dosh\n10/10\n","timestamp_created":1420160510,"timestamp_updated":1420160510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13772738","author":{"steamid":"76561197965490709","num_games_owned":893,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2428,"last_played":1423887255},"language":"english","review":"I didn't really enjoy the Left 4 Dead games. I hate zombies and the whole zombie craze. I think tower defense games and wave defence games are stupid. However, somehow I can't get enough of this game. \n\nMaybe it's because it isn't endless wave after wave like the stupid Call of Duty zombies games; there's a definite end goal you're working toward (the Patriarch after the 10th wave in a long game). Maybe it's because of the Counter-strike-ish way you earn money to spend at the end of every \"round\" (every wave). It's a challenge in its own right to save up for the high-tier weapons every match. Maybe it's because it's a rare game that encourages teamwork and selecting different classes, even on a public server; playing solo or with a team that doesn't help one another is a sure way to get wiped out. Maybe it's because it's extremely well balanced, with no class or weapon being definitively better than the rest. Maybe it's because it has some awesome mods (AKF aliens mod, Shrekriarch, etc.). Maybe it's because the game doesn't take itself too seriously and the devs seem to care about the fans. \n\nAnd maybe it's because it's just fun as hell to tear monsters apart with katanas, rocket launchers, and AA-12's.","timestamp_created":1420159998,"timestamp_updated":1420159998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13772145","author":{"steamid":"76561198107384316","num_games_owned":344,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":988,"last_played":1484533827},"language":"english","review":"AMAZING GAME i have had sooo much fun on this game with my friends really suggest it to anyone who likes satisfaction.","timestamp_created":1420157977,"timestamp_updated":1420157977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13771731","author":{"steamid":"76561198093930818","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":533,"last_played":1431036691},"language":"english","review":"Pretty Good","timestamp_created":1420156683,"timestamp_updated":1420156683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13771254","author":{"steamid":"76561198000688088","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":482,"last_played":1600383688},"language":"english","review":"Who else gets pumped when the Patriarch theme plays?\n\n10/10 would kill floors again","timestamp_created":1420155259,"timestamp_updated":1420155259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13769896","author":{"steamid":"76561198023198272","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":151,"last_played":1482101817},"language":"russian","review":"Просто отличная игра!","timestamp_created":1420151193,"timestamp_updated":1420151193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.434782594442367554","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13769847","author":{"steamid":"76561198085253678","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":680,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":287,"last_played":1485637199},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game.

More stuff i guess, alright...\nWell somehow this game just doesnt get boring, be careful otherwise you will find yourself up at 4am clutching your sweaty mouse and tapping away at the keyboard (which will also be sweaty by now, unless its just me and I'm some kind of sweat monster).\n\nTheres a wide range of zombies and maps, which keeps the game interesting (a lot more interesting then cod zombies at the very least). There is also a range of classes which have unique advantages, and since the game is very team oriented, the class system adds a further level to the team dynamic. For example its useful to have a medic to heal the other players, while a firebug can use flame weapons to deal with a large amount of the zombies, and a support specialist to deal with the zombies up close with shotguns. Working as a team is vital, especially on the harder difficulties.\n\nIf you're an achievement maniac, then you will love this game! With over 200 achievements, it'll take you a very long time.\n\nThe killing floor community is also a very strong one, with people making new mods/skins/maps all the time. Its very hard to run out of things to do in this game.

The gameplay is nice since there are so many unique ways of killing these zombies ranging from burning them to using a rocket launcher. \n\nThe addition of perks too makes the game that much more enjoyable. Every team member specializes in a certain field of expertise such as an explosions expert to a firebug who uses only the flamethrower. This is fun and all, but perhaps my one dislike of the game is that it is sort of a grind to level up your perks. I bought this game expecting to just jump in and shoot every zombie without thinking, \"Oh just 5,000 more headshots and I'll make it to level three!\"\n\nAll that being said, I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants a fun, gory, zombie survival game.","timestamp_created":1419836102,"timestamp_updated":1419836102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13680733","author":{"steamid":"76561198116193812","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":7705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":951,"last_played":1432436562},"language":"english","review":"this game is old, but epic. with a whole lotta epicness.

The community is fantastic which is a huge place, the developers maps are amazing and the custom maps are sometimes even more amazing or just plain funny. The classes are all enjoyable to play, but it's no problem to just stick to your favourites. For a game from 2009 it doesn't feel that old. I know KF2 is coming out soon (and looks amazing) but I hope Killing Floor continues to have a strong online community.","timestamp_created":1419822723,"timestamp_updated":1419822723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13677250","author":{"steamid":"76561197996855120","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":10661,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7744,"last_played":1578578796},"language":"english","review":"BUY IT WHILE IS HOT, LADS.","timestamp_created":1419812110,"timestamp_updated":1419812157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13676762","author":{"steamid":"76561198062449987","num_games_owned":466,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":1603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":957,"last_played":1488054126},"language":"english","review":"While this is a fun game, there are a few negatives:\n\n-It feels kind of like a beta more than a finished game.\n-It can get repetitive really quickly.\n-The Workshop system is beyond broken for the game.
