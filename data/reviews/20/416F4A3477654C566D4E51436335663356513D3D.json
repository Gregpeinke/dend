It is a team-based FPS very much like TF2. It was originally a mod based on the 1996 game Quake and was eventually adopted by Valve to be it's own game in 1999. Hell, this game is as old as I am. Runnin on the Source engine, this game is one of, if not, the best game Valve has ever made. It's gameplay of having classes is what makes it stand out from the rest of the FPS games we all see nowadays. It has changed the gaming world and still is to this day with TF2. There are games out there like Battleborn and Overwatch that take on the class-based approach to FPS's, but none of them can compare to Team Fortress.

Oh yeah, and grenades.\nThere are a lot of elements of this game that tells you that this is, without a doubt, the father of TF2. Something most notable and most obvious is how fast paced they both are. Seriously, first 2 minutes of any game from both of these titles has more action then a James Bond movie on steroids most the time. Another thing I'd like to point out is that over the years, the classes still have almost the exact same elements and still have the same purpose (With probably the exception of pyro, but that's debatable.) It's suprising to see that even after all that's been added to TF2 and how much you may think that it's not close to it's orgin, but really, Everything you had from the first is pretty much right there (Other than 'nades XD).\n\nI seriously recomend this game and I aplaud the community that supports it. Even though it's old, it's probably one of the best games you could find on steam. It deserves a lot more attention. And in my opinion, It's certainly worth $4.99.","timestamp_created":1467155209,"timestamp_updated":1467155209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584800422191619873","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23890069","author":{"steamid":"76561198204507964","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1746,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":442,"last_played":1629834858},"language":"english","review":"This is a good game.

I feel like it's missing a lot of color and textures. I mean, compared to the other half-life 1 games, I feel like this is just missing that.\n\nand 3. (This goes along with repetitiveness) You are only stuck with certain weapons.

At first it's a hard game to jump into and can be quite annoying from time to time. There are many things that make this game what it is.\n\nFirst off, this game set the standard for what every class-based shooter should be. From the fast-running scout to the hefty Heavy Weapons Guy, this game introduces most-needed diversity in what any game should have to keep it running, and to keep players playing. Sometimes, however, it just doesn't seem like the classes are doing what they should. On maps like 2fort (CTF) or Dustbowl (TC), the Medics are the ones that are the guys pushing the flag by using their frag and concussion grenades to propel themselves towards the capture point, rendering the Scout useless and completely diverts the MEDIC'S role away from what it seems.\n\nThe game play of this game will keep you sitting at your desk for hours on hours. The on-going struggle to carry a piece of cloth on a pole to an enemy base will be as if you're running with a piece of pie dangling in front of you -- Long and annoying at first, but rewarding in the end. The stalemates of the grenade tosses at the beginning of matches can be aggravating, but you'll feel like a secret agent slipping through as a spy.\n\nOverall, this game is absolutely marvelous, and will live on forever. This game is worth the five bucks, it's tons of fun, and it will keep you entertained for years to come.","timestamp_created":1461151248,"timestamp_updated":1461151248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52480471134185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22526323","author":{"steamid":"76561197982682444","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8208,"last_played":1388626602},"language":"english","review":"This game really is a clasic.
