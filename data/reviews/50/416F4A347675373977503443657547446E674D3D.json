There are some more chaotic levels that involve less tactic and more RNG, it brings back those terrible platforming levels on Xen (albeit not many thankfully) and puzzles that require you to do things in a specific sequence that's not explained or hinted at or otherwise risk getting soft-locked and starting over again (i.e. that Pit Worms chapter). In between these events is mostly silence occasionally broken up by a random alien spawning out of nowhere. The sewer level is probably the worst offender being both buggy and tedious.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the buggy AI, Black OPS will have Einsteins IQ when attacking you but your allies will struggle to commit to the basic task of following you even though path-finding is literally built into each map. I have no idea how they messed that up. Oh yeah, and if you thought the Black OPS were challenging enough the game spawns them behind you in the chapter 'Worlds Collide' just to piss you off.\n\nNow there are some good things about this game; it has a wide selection of weapons, new alien species and some nicely designed areas but I struggle to find anything nice to say other than that.\n\nThe result of all this is an exhausting experience that ends up being more frustrating than fun.","timestamp_created":1643507878,"timestamp_updated":1643508487,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484848499298095703","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109061491","author":{"steamid":"76561198214784516","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":366,"last_played":1643498968},"language":"russian","review":"рекомендую","timestamp_created":1643499212,"timestamp_updated":1643499212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109060511","author":{"steamid":"76561199072771171","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":470,"last_played":1643497696},"language":"english","review":"This game has an amazing story, new weapons, great level design, lots of enemy types and much more, so it must mean it's a great game, right? Well, yes, it is, but an awful amount of bugs and glitches sometimes made me angry. I have experienced countless crashes, corrupted saves, many times I got stuck inside walls and sometimes levels bugged. The AI of your friendly marines can sometimes be annoying as hell, also the graphics and controls also didn't age well. It's a great game if you can withstand those things and if you like classic games. I would like this game on sale instead of the full price. If its on sale its usually -80%, sometimes even -90% or you can get it in a package with some other games. btw i forgot to mention you probably can download some patches but i never tried.","timestamp_created":1643498238,"timestamp_updated":1643498238,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"109048790","author":{"steamid":"76561198353260694","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":345,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":209,"last_played":1643731601},"language":"english","review":"If you love Half-Life, you'll love this game.

Opposing Force is a perfect example of how to make an expansion the right way. There's more weapon varieties, alien enemies, and chaotic battles to be fought with Adrian Shephard inside the Black Mesa Research Complex. This expansion scratches the half life itch I felt when I beat the first game. One small issue I had with the game was the AI for the marine partners breaking a lot for me and it happened frequently enough where I got annoyed at the game for a little bit but in the end it didn't ruin the experience for me.
