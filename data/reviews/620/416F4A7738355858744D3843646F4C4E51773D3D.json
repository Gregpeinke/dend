Ein mehr als würdiger Nachfolger und vermutlich auch Abschluss der Reihe und eines der besten Spiele, die man gespielt haben kann. Valve hat mit diesem Spiel bewiesen, dass sie Spiele mehr als gut entwickeln können und unbedingt weiter machen sollten!\n\n[b][u]Das Spiel allgemein:[/u][/b]\nDie Mechanik im Spiel knüpft an jene von Portal und verlangt über den gesamten Spielverlauf permanent Köpfchen. Mit unserer Portal Kanone erarbeiten wir uns wieder unseren Weg durch die Anlage von Aperture Science und testen, und testen und testen...\n\n[b][i]10 / 10[/i] Story:[/b]\nWas Portal an Story fehlte, hat Portal 2 auf jeden Fall wieder ausgeglichen. Ich möchte an dieser Stelle nicht zu viel spoilern, aber ich verspreche einen genialen Plot, einen genialen und verplanten Einstieg mit Witz, immer wiederkehrenden Sarkasmus und herrlichen Humor, verpackt mit ernster Gefahr und einem Ende, welches es in sich hat. Wie oben schon gesagt, man muss es einfach spielen. Dann versteht auch jeder, was ich meine.\n\n[b][i]09 / 10[/i] Grafik:[/b]\nAuch wenn die Texturen nicht die hochaufgelöststen sind, die man so findet, ist es durch den Grafikstil einfach extrem schick anzusehen und ein echter hingucker. An dieser Stelle scheitert es auf jeden Fall nicht, auch wenn man dem Spiel sein Alter langsam ansehen kann.\n\n[b][i]10 / 10[/i] Level Design:[/b]\nTest Chamber, Strecken abseits des weges, Easter Eggs. Nix fehlt. Auch wird die Atmosphäre einer alten Anlage sehr gut rübergebracht. Auch wird man zwischen vielen verschiedenen Ebenen durch die Testfabrik geführt und arbeitet sich durch die verschiedenen Zeitalter von Aperture Science.\n\n[b][i]10 / 10[/i] Technik:[/b]\nThinking with Portals. Alles funktioniert, keine schwerwiegenden Bugs beim ersten Spieldurchlauf gemerkt. Man kann es also sehr gut spielen, ohne von Fehlern überrant zu werden. Also ein Wort sollte hier reichen: löpt ^^\n\n\n[b][u][i]10 / 10[/i] Fazit:[/u][/b]\nZusammengefasst haben wir also ein sehr gut funktionierendes Spiel, mit ordentlichem Design, sehr guter Atmosphäre und einer grandiosen Story.

Portal 2 manages to soar far above the original Portal and add yet another level of intricate artistic enrichment and dazzling gameplay. I sometimes feel like I shouldn't be allowed to play this game because it is so fun, and should go back to playing other games that get dwarfed in comparison to this one.\n\nWhen a novel gives me a strong emotional response to its contents, I applaud it for being superior to many others. When a game does this, I know I'm playing Portal 2. Some of the dialogue is the funniest I've ever heard; some of it deeply bothers me and drives me, in true anger and passion, to beat the game and prove myself... to a character in a video game. I actually feel like I am the main character in this game. At the very least, I empathize with them 100%.\n\nAnd the gameplay... like I said, there is nothing like it. Riding the learning curve of Portal 2 and realizing that no, some of the levels really aren't impossible, are incredible experiences. The achievement and satisfaction of solving a difficult and very intellectual 3-D puzzle feels wonderful.\n\nYou may have heard people speak well of this game, and I'd like to speak greatly of it. But if all that hasn't convinced you to get it, then maybe this will: it's just fun. It's an FPS with no gun, a purely intellectual flourish of discovery, mystery, immersive gameplay, and, if you stay with it, the greatest victories you can find on Steam. Please get Portal 2 (after you get Portal). Please do it. I would be happy for anyone that decided to pick up and play Portal 2, because I would be absolutly confident that they will have as much fun in it as I did.","timestamp_created":1440719039,"timestamp_updated":1440719039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.665919125080108643","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17745019","author":{"steamid":"76561198147573678","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":5000,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3352,"last_played":1561335022},"language":"english","review":"great game buy, very fun","timestamp_created":1440713317,"timestamp_updated":1440713317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17744579","author":{"steamid":"76561198145420213","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":10333,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3625,"last_played":1644697157},"language":"english","review":"I really liked the game it was fun and awesome and i think people should get it","timestamp_created":1440711133,"timestamp_updated":1440711133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17744485","author":{"steamid":"76561198136343316","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1350,"last_played":1452217779},"language":"spanish","review":"Puzzles muy buenos, cooperativo muy entretenido, no esta mal la historia, buen juego.","timestamp_created":1440710721,"timestamp_updated":1440710721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17744413","author":{"steamid":"76561198009528631","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1877,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":950,"last_played":1604708554},"language":"german","review":"Eines der besten Spiele überhaupt, Nahezu perfekt.","timestamp_created":1440710350,"timestamp_updated":1440710350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17744072","author":{"steamid":"76561198204755027","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2019,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1230,"last_played":1503170632},"language":"english","review":"Absolutly spectacular game.

It is a sequel to Portal. Some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, but even so, Portal 2 received universal acclaim upon its release, with the game's writing, pacing, and dark humor being highlighted as stand-out elements. The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were strongly applauded by critics, and the additional cooperative mode also received praise. Some gaming journalists ranked Portal 2 among the top games of 2011, and several named it their Game of the Year. Portal 2 is definitely on the peak of my \"best games ever\" list. Here is why:\n\nPros:\n+ Heavily optimized Source engine.\n+ Amazing game writers = amazing story\n+ Perfection in voice acting and ambient music\n+ Simple graphics, but perfect in their way\n+ Side-story revealing with easter eggs and comic book\n+ Gameplay mechanics\n+ Ridiculously unique and fun solving chambers\n+ Amazing co-op gameplay\n+ Creative Achievements (single player & co-op)\n+ Trading Card system\n+ User made chambers, Robot Enrichment\n+ Hammer Editor ( level editor )\n+ Steam Workshop\n\nCons:\n/\n\nProbably first and only game, I can't find cons for.
