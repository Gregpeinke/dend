Fittingly, it's a game about a guy entering some strange new environment and shooting his way through it. I like it a lot, for the reasons explained below.\n\nIt's set in Columbia, an ultra-Christian-American-conservative sky city, with vehement racial segregation and pre-WW1 attitudes and spectacular architectural and technological wonders contrasted with appalling poverty. It's a veritable paradise if you're a white male, or a white female with no self-respect. However, it's also set 48 years before BioShock, although the game seems to forget that a lot in terms of what technology was available, even for a utopia that can [spoiler] steal stuff from other dimensions [/spoiler]; the social attitudes seem a bit anachronistic too, although that's obviously harder to gauge. Still, the world-building's impeccable, and Columbia can be a marvel to just walk around and look at.\n\nAnyway, you're Booker DeWitt, a protagonist who can actually speak and express character for once. You're sent to Columbia to get a girl by some mysterious people, from some other mysterious people. I'm not gonna try to explain the plot more, 'cause it gets kinda fuckin' complex, but I will say that I appreciate the gleeful abandon with which the protagonists hapazardly [spoiler] switch through dimensions to solve problems (even though this game has some really fucking weird ideas about how a multiverse would work). [/spoiler] Also, the story's really good overall, with an ending that simultaneously tied up the game's million dangling plot threads (well, most of them—I looked at the game's Wikipedia page after finishing it and there were a few things there that the game still hadn't told me) and really stuck with me. I recommend BioShock Infinite for the story, if nothing else.\n\nThe gameplay's pretty good, too, although certainly not innovative. Most of the gameplay elements are just reskins of BioShock stuff: Plasmids are now Vigors; Gene Tonics are now Gear and Infusions; Big Daddies are now various minibosses (and, in a more thematic sense, the [spoiler] Songbird [/spoiler]); bathyspheres are now rail travel, which looks ridiculously fucking fun; audio logs are now voxophones; Vita-Chambers are now just being revived by your friend on the spot; and hacking is now lockpicking and opening [spoiler] Tears [/spoiler], which is somehow even less involved than BioShock 2—you just press E on things and your NPC companion gets it. This works better in some cases than others. Rail travel is fuckin' sweet, while Vigors don't really seem to exist in the world for any specific reason besides \"It's a BioShock game.\"\n\nHowever it's not all reskins—some things have just been directly copied over, like how looting food and money works, and vending machines, and weapon upgrades, and the way enemies are weirdly durable, and the occasional orchestral stings when you do something in combat, and the fact that you travel through a bunch of areas owned by some famous local as you constantly get sidetracked trying to escape. Again, it works better in some cases than in others.\n\nAs I said, it's mostly like BioShock, but there are a few changes here and there. They got rid of that navigation arrow, unless you want it to just give you a hint. Manual save is gone, which is a bit of a bugger. The GUI has gotten better; it's moved from \"Art Deco\" to \"basic functionality.\" It takes a good cue from BioShock 2 by letting you use Plasmids—shit, I mean Vigors—and guns at the same time (as well as making the gameplay just smoother and faster generally). There's a regenerating shield on top of your health bar, which basically means that not every fight will leave you short on health. You can only hold two weapons, which is weak, and the game tries to make up for it by just having lots of different kinds of automatic weapon. You can read transcripts of audio logs now, which is convenient. Upgrades cost money, which might sound like a downer, but it's actually kind of nice because at long last money has a use in a BioShock game. None of these changes are major, but they generally make the game feel faster and more streamlined, if a bit less deep.\n\nYour NPC sidekick, Elizabeth, is an interesting, engaging, and believable character—if a bit anachronistically spirited and independent—but she looks and sounds more 24 than 19.\n\nThe game goes on a lot about how killing is bad and corrupts you, but then you also get to explode enemies' heads with headshots and electric shocks, set them on fire until they burn down to just a skeleton, decapitate them with your rail travel device, or lots of other goofy fun stuff. If you shot enemies once, and then they fell over and started bleeding all over the place and screaming for an uncomfortable amount of time, like in a Tarantino film, then they could really make the point that killing is bad. Making it cartoonish and fun, however, just sends a mixed message. Shut up about how I'm a monster, Elizabeth, I'm trying to have fun with this hand cannon.\n\nYour jump is unrealistically high, which is refreshing.\n\nThe game's really goddamn pretty.\n\nIn short, BioShock Infinite is a lot like BioShock, but with a lot of the gameplay nuance stripped out in favor of a greater narrative focus. The former gets on my nerves a bit at times, but usually it works well and I do really like the narrative. I really like BioShock Infinite, and recommend it highly. Not quite as much as BioShock, maybe, but certainly more than BioShock 2.","timestamp_created":1516158697,"timestamp_updated":1516293250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39403860","author":{"steamid":"76561198037986993","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1580,"last_played":1516332146},"language":"brazilian","review":"Cara, que jogo é esse. Sem dúvidas o Infinite e o Bioshock 1 estão no meu top 5 dos games. A história é muito intrigante e porque não dizer bem complexa.

los minijuegos de pirateo y su diseño de nivel deja mucho que desear ya que es bastante pobre y simple, realmente no vale la pena explorar, y aunque lo valiera, tampoco hay ni mucho que explorar, ni es muy interesante hacerlo, al menos en las zonas en donde hay enemigos pero, a pesar de esto, el juego suma bastante en muchos sentidos \n  Todo este gameplay más “procesado” y simple te deja bastante claro que este era un juego el cual estaba enfocado para un nuevo público, uno menos culto y acostumbrado a shooters como CoD y no a los de la vieja escuela, los cuales estaban más trabajados (aunque hay muchos de esta generación que tambien lo estan).\n En general el juego está bastante bien la verticalidad de los mapas cambia mucho el gameplay y es bastante divertido, lo unico que quizas

To do that, he has to enter Columbia and rescue Elizabeth, or at least that's the premise of the game.\n\nI think one of the greatest traits of the game is Columbia, the city they present us, a city that can maintain itself in the air with the help of the advance tecnology the Lutece twins were able to create. At the start presented as an utopia, we can find out quickly that the city is struck with the social problems that were common in the 1900s: religion, racism, differences between classes and various ideologies.\n\nLike in the previous Bioshock games, the story is expanded through visual narrative that you have to put together and several \"voxophones\" (voice records) that the player can collect and hear to achieve a better understanding of the plot, and although the game's pretty lineal you will have to be very sharp to collect them all.\n\nThe gameplay is amazing, very smooth and well done. The combat -a mix of guns and powers- is amazing and very entertaining. They managed to improve in an amazing way the mechanics of the previous games.\nThe most amazing thing I've seen though, is Elizabeth. Her IA is great, while you're wandering about, scavenging for ammo or salts, she'll sit or interact with the objects in the map. If you happen to stumble across a closed door, she can open it for you and while in combat, she will provide you ammo of your current weapon, salts, health packs and can bring very useful stuff from tears, not to mention that you don't have to protect her as she's able to avoid enemies.\n\nThe overall performance was flawless, I didn't have any frame drop or anything like it, so if you have a decent PC you won't have a problem.\n\nWell, to be honest I don't have anything else to say, you won't be disappointed if you buy this game at any price, the ending will be both heartwarming and breaking, you will want to replay it to put everything together for sure!\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e4Crth_Hb8 [/url]","timestamp_created":1515882863,"timestamp_updated":1518269700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.66240239143371582","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39321790","author":{"steamid":"76561198397170837","num_games_owned":669,"num_reviews":53,"playtime_forever":515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":515,"last_played":1515879539},"language":"schinese","review":"我除了需要缓缓我被闪瞎的眼睛以外还需要好好看看剧情解析。。。顺便开下海葬","timestamp_created":1515881186,"timestamp_updated":1515881186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590612173080444336","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39321498","author":{"steamid":"76561198086666300","num_games_owned":457,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1339,"last_played":1530606018},"language":"english","review":"This game is a MASTERPIECE. Starting off with the story: The story was a fantastic mind blowing experience with an amazing atmosphere, great colours, awesome areas and just a great story in general with so much to think of and as you keep playing it just gets so much better and makes you wanna play even more. The weapons are pretty straight forward but were still very nice weapons. The powers in the game were very nice looking and fun to use and you have so many choices on which ones to use. The graphics are magnificent and just makes the game feel so great to play. The Protagonist Booker DeWitt is a good character and a pretty cool bad ass. Elizibeth is a secondary protagonist and provides a lot for you, for example if you need ammo she'll throw you the ammo you need or health kits or salt for your powers and the bond between Booker and Elizibeth so nice and makes you feel connected to her very well. I'll be honest I prefer Rapture City much more over Colombia but Colombia gives a more friendly and more colourful look to it than Rapture City (that is why I liked Rapture City more.) The ending to this game will leave you with some knowledge of what happened but still leaves you hanging, that's where Burial at Sea comes in. With these two Story DLCS comes with a whole new story in Rapture City and each detail you encounter just further more explains the whole story of Bioshock. Episode 1 doesn't give you a whole lot of answers but Episode 2 everything is revealed and after finishing Episode 2 it just makes you look at the story in a completely different way. With all your questions answered it just makes the story so much more better and very interesting. Couple negatives I give this game is that I think the AI is pretty dumb sometimes and the stealth mechanic in the DLC story is poorly done, only because the engine of this game does not go well with stealth mechanics. Over all this game is without a doubt a HUGE would recommend.","timestamp_created":1515880438,"timestamp_updated":1515880438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39320249","author":{"steamid":"76561198257166012","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":419,"last_played":1516143583},"language":"english","review":"Much fun Amazing story you should get it with Bioshock pack so you get all DLC and all games!","timestamp_created":1515877133,"timestamp_updated":1515877133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39320177","author":{"steamid":"76561198158864085","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":322,"last_played":1593030375},"language":"russian","review":"COOL","timestamp_created":1515876943,"timestamp_updated":1515876943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39318823","author":{"steamid":"76561198307805738","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":475,"last_played":1515866598},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyunu orta ayarda yeni bitirdim ve oyunu eğer hikaye bazlı oyun seven biri iseniz tavsiye ederim ama oyun half life , cod gibi hikayesi öylesine gelişip biryere bağlanmıyor oyunla ilgili birsürü teori bulunuyor ayrıca oyununun içine kuantum fiziğinden çoklu evren kuramına matematikteki sabit ve değişkenlerin ayrıntısına kadar eklenmiş . ayrıca oyunun atmosferi şahane diyalogları özellikle elizabeth ile asansördeki durum değerlendirmesi konuşmalarımız ve hikayesi ise anlatılmaz derecede çünkü hikayesini büyük bir ihtimal anlamıyacaksanız oyunun sonu yarım baitmiş gibi gelecek ama değil oyun tam yerinde ve kafanızda binbir soru işaretiyle bitiyor ve oyun sizi o evrende yaşatıyor göndermeleri ile colubianın sert siyasi politikaları ırkçılığı ve yobaz bir dirn,peygamber anlayışı ile muhteşem. artı ve eksilerini sıralamak gerekirse ;\n\n+ Muazzam bir hikaye sunuyor \n+Yaşayan bir çevre var özellikle oyunun ilk sıralarında şehirdeki her vatandaşın kendi haline gerçek bir insan gibi takılması.\n+ana karakterleri harika(booker ve elizabeth)\nsilahlar ,vigorları ve teçhizatları yerli yerinde kullanarak iyi bir aksiyon deneyimi \n+ ve sayamayacağım derecede fazla ince ayrıntısıyla\n\n-Vur babam vur öldür babam öldür mantığı\n-her defasında elizabethi bulup kurtarma sorunsalı\n-Oyunun açık dünya olmaması\n\nama genel olarak harika bir oyun .","timestamp_created":1515873627,"timestamp_updated":1515873627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39317901","author":{"steamid":"76561198134699112","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1118,"last_played":1529514915},"language":"english","review":"That was great.

Extremely underhwelming your second playthrough. Which speaks to the quality of the plot - it was written to shock you and to inspire you to play it again to figure out what the hell it all meant. But once you actually pick it up a second time to have those questions answered, you realize that the story was written around the twists, when it should always be the other way around. Then while you're playing, the technical flaws poke through - flat characters, poor sound design, a hamfisted twist ending - and you're kind of left wishing it was your first-playthrough again, that all this was happening for the first time, not the second.\n\nBut that only speaks to the story. As a video game, it's great. Beautiful art direction, music that will give you goose bumps, well-designed vigors, mostly engaging combat (despite very basic and often dumb AI), and an overall enthralling experience.\n\nMy personal takeaway: I'm glad I got to experience this game.

Главным минусом Bioshock Infinite является то, что это топорный тир с убогим оружием, которое ну совсем не чувствуется. Всю игру, почти безостановочно, нужно просто стрелять в приближающихся врагов, которые постепенно становятся сильнее и растут в своем количестве. Далее, сюжет развивается слишком быстро. Вот мы только на лодке подплываем к маяку, а вот мы уже сражаемся с механическими вундервафлями на каких-то аэродромах и все это за 5 минут прогулок. Ну и финальный, завершающий минус- она абсолютно линейная. Ходишь по пустым коридорам, убиваешь полицаев, идешь дальше. И так было все время, что я в ней провел.\n\nОднако у игры есть как минусы, так и плюсы. Начнем с того, что у infinite отличный сеттинг, летающий город, приятная джазз-блюз музыка на фоне, присутсвует некая сказочная ламповость(до первых выстрелов). Хочется сказать про населенность города, однако тут вылазит еще один \"скрытый\" минус: ее можно будет увидеть ровно до той самой первой перестрелки. Дальше встретить мирного npc будет редкостью. \n\nТак как это шутер, а в шутерах главное- геймплей, Bioshock infinite получает от меня 4/10, теряя поинты Имхометра из-за топорности и линейности, но получая их за приятную картинку и сеттинг.","timestamp_created":1515824092,"timestamp_updated":1515824092,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529552936553955078","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39299852","author":{"steamid":"76561198054795373","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":884,"last_played":1603148768},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de los mejores juegos jamas creados 10/10","timestamp_created":1515822180,"timestamp_updated":1515822180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39298902","author":{"steamid":"76561198049536041","num_games_owned":966,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1086,"last_played":1518960833},"language":"english","review":"...","timestamp_created":1515818533,"timestamp_updated":1515818533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572438180446624756","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39298150","author":{"steamid":"76561198105309359","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":525,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":525,"last_played":1515772767},"language":"english","review":"WTF, just WTF","timestamp_created":1515815809,"timestamp_updated":1515815809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39297022","author":{"steamid":"76561198354974372","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":3754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3754,"last_played":1515811047},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente","timestamp_created":1515811527,"timestamp_updated":1515811527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39296346","author":{"steamid":"76561198056292185","num_games_owned":518,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1440,"last_played":1500740617},"language":"english","review":"One of the Best FPS games ever made.\n\nBut it can be better, XD.","timestamp_created":1515809215,"timestamp_updated":1515809234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39295477","author":{"steamid":"76561198113106350","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":7758,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1630935758},"language":"russian","review":"Good evening everyone,I want to share with you my opinion about this great game!(There will be a small spoiler), It's surpassed all my expectations,would not stop playing for days,cool graphics and fantastic story!I would like to note the soundtrack and the atmosphere that will not leave you indifferent!
