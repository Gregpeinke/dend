A giant arrow telling you exactly where to go with the press of a button, checkpoints that are extremely close to each other and worst of all, enemies you killed before you died remain dead after you reload the latest checkpoint. So if you reload often enough, at some point no enemies will be left and even your grandma can beat the game.\n\nThe gunplay is mediocre, as was to be expected from a Bioshock game. Guns lack punch and enemies take too many hits to kill (unless you headshot them). \n\nThe only positive thing about this game is its atmosphere. That’s clearly the one area where they put in the most effort.

A história flue de forma excepcional, Elisabeth mostra ser uma personagem impressionante, os criadores do jogo capricharam muito nela.\n\nGráficos: São bem feitos, impressionam pela combinação de cores, luz e sombra, ao contrário de Bioshock 1 e 2, nessa versão as cores são vívidas e alegres além de darem um clima de nostalgia.\n\nCombate: os combates são todos em FPS, as armas são bem feitas e possuem cada uma sua própria característica, não há uma evolução na força das armas, o destaque fica para o \"gancho de mão\", uma arma que parece que tiraram da idade média que permite que você literalmente destrua o inimigo além de auxiliar no transporte pelos trilhos aéreos.\n\nCoisas que eu não gostei: Muito sangue, nada contra jogos sangrentos, mas Bioshock Infinite exagera em muitos momentos, achei isso desnecessário.\nA versão do Steam possui alguns bugs de tela, por exemplo, quando a Elisabeth vai oferecer munição as vezes o ícone de munição fica na tela, e só sai quando ela oferece alguma outra coisa.\nTambém tem alguns bugs no áudio, as vezes o áudio corta no meio do jogo.\n\nEm todo caso, recomendo MUITO que comprem e joguem, vale cada centavo.","timestamp_created":1420920171,"timestamp_updated":1420920171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13929506","author":{"steamid":"76561198122654491","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":533,"last_played":1588602696},"language":"spanish","review":"Obra maestra desde mi punto de vista.

Eh bien finalement non, l'originalité fait que l'on prend plutôt bien ce changement, voir même mieux que les deux premiers. Car oui, le fait de changer d'un point à un autre (Et de distance titanesque ...) rend tout de suite un étonnement hors du commun. Cet étonnement peut-être exprimé de façon \"mauvaise\", du fait d'une immersion brutale, mais peut aussi être exprimé d'une façon \"superbe\", du fait que le changement n'est pas brutal (Etant donné que dans les deux nous sommes dans un environnement inconnu à ce jour dans l'IRL, cela ne gêne pas. Si on avait été dans le premier Bioshock sur la terre ferme, puis que l'on passe dans Columbia, là, y'aurait eu un problème).\n\nAu niveau du gameplay, décidément rien à redire : Les dures années de travail de Ken Levine et son équipe portent leurs fruits. Nous n'avons pas le temps d'un seul répit, que nous devons enchaîner. De cette façon, on ne manque jamais d'objectif, on ne s'ennuie jamais, et on ne trouve pas le moyen de dire \"Y'a rien à faire ...\".\nLa fin, que j'ai trouvé titanesque, a un rôle bien particulier dans le gameplay. Si vous avez (ou vous êtes sur le point de le finir) fini le jeu, vous le saurez plus que moi que l'intrigue et le suspens sont de tailles en fin. Rien à redire ...\nEn ce qui concerne le type de transport, l'armement, et ce domaine là, rien non plus à redire. Le fait est qu'un nouveau type de transport apparaisse ne m'a pas plus choqué que ça. Mais quand j'ai entendu parlé des Skylines, je me suis dit un peu \"Oula, bazard à gogo\". Eh bien non. Irrational Games a travaillé lourdement dessus pour en faire un outil d'armement mais aussi un moyen de transport rapide, complexe mais simple d'utilisation, tout en laissant le joueur apprécier la vue. Ce type d'invention est tout simplement révolutionnaire, puisqu'il n'a jamais été inventé auparavant. Un atout donc de taille pour la note du jeu, forcément (Dur de se taper tout à pied quand même !).\nPour l'armement, le fait de switcher d'arme (Les ramasser) est un bon concept. Cela ne nous impose pas particulièrement d'arme, et l'on peut même choisir facilement quand les utiliser. Les armes sont d'un nombre exceptionnels, encore que, mais surtout intéressantes pour leur fonctionnement et leurs qualités propres à chacune.\n\nEn ce qui concerne la ville en elle-même, le choix du thème de la RI (Révolution industrielle) en mode futuristique est un choix de taille. On aurait pu penser que le mélange des deux ne s'effectuaient que très mal ... En fait non. Très simple à assimiler, la ville regorge de coins à explorer, en plus des Skylines, avec des engins et bâtiments à droite à gauche à explorer, donc vraiment gigantesque.\nDe plus, des affiches et réclames sont toujours présentes, ce qui ne changera pas, cela donne un goût assez naturel à la ville, comme si ça avait toujours été comme ça.\n\nLes personnages, dont Elizabeth, ont été très bien pensés. Le fait d'incarner un ancien détective qui a des dettes à rembourser n'est pas forcément plaisant, mais l'objectif lui l'est. Si on avait incarné ce personnage dans un objectif différent, ça aurait complètement tout chamboulé ... Et ce jeu n'aurait pas fait fort. Pourquoi ? Car les personnages ont l'air réels, ils parlent, leurs gestes sont fluides et sont des gestes de tous les jours, leurs réactions sont naturelles, ce ne sont pas des robots qui font \"Oh, tu te fais attaquer, défonce le Songbird\".\nLe partenaire est souvent là pour vous aider, sans vous gêner, et vous accompagne dans vos missions tout au long du jeu, ce qui est un point positif.\n\nSi je devais dire ne serait-ce qu'un mot pour décrire ce jeu, je pense que ce serait le suivant : Phénoménal.\nTout ce que j'ai dis avant, n'est que le fruit de ce mot. En fait, Bioshock Infinite, c'est un univers encore jamais conquis, inexploré, mais ce vide vient d'être comblé par un incroyable opus qui restera gravé dans bien des mémoires, et sera un illustre du jeu vidéo.\nUne petite phrase maintenant pour le décrire : Phénomène et révolution du jeu vidéo, à thème plus qu'incroyable et histoire plus qu'immersive.\n\nVoilà voilà, je vous recommande ce jeu !","timestamp_created":1420917164,"timestamp_updated":1420917164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.645216941833496094","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13928681","author":{"steamid":"76561198059693432","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":369,"last_played":1421988711},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado en mi vida *¬*","timestamp_created":1420915191,"timestamp_updated":1420915191,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13928601","author":{"steamid":"76561198047975724","num_games_owned":360,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1874,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1798,"last_played":1574421006},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is a game beyond games, nobody can tell you how good it is, you have to play it.","timestamp_created":1420914814,"timestamp_updated":1420914814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13927883","author":{"steamid":"76561198080853284","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":571,"last_played":1608637332},"language":"spanish","review":"Esta es la definición de una obra maestra.

Começa tudo muito lindo em Columbia, você se apaixona pelos gráficos e pela cidade ser tão pacifica e bonita. Diferentemente do primeiro Bioshock onde somos colocados em uma cidade já em colapso com splicers tomando conta e tudo está decaindo. Após algum tempo de gameplay já percebemos que Columbia não é tão pacifica quanto parece (já era de se esperar), porém todos os personagens continuam maravilhosos e com uma personalidade marcante. Particularmente, gostei muito da mudança que temos do Bioshock para o Bioshock Infinite no que se diz ao personagem principal, é muito mais fácil se apegar ao Booker do que ao Jack. Levando em consideração que no Bioshock o Jack é totalmente algo em branco para o jogador, não demonstra nenhum pensamento e não responde a nada. \nGostei muito do gameplay do BI, era de se esperar que tentassem diferenciar o estilo do jogo dos outros dois anteriores, e acho que continou muito bom. A trilha sonora continua incrivel como os outros jogos da franquia, toca até Queen em um momento de tortura!! Achei o jogo principal um tanto curto, mas dá para entender a história completamente com o que apresentam. As DLCs Burial At Sea são realmente muito boas, principalmente o episode 2, jogar com a Elizabeth sempre foi algo que desejei desde o inicio do jogo principal. Todas as referências feitas no burial at sea em relação ao Bioshock me fizeram ficar arrepiada! \nPara finalizar, recomendo totalmente esse jogo e espero que todos se apaixonem por essa obra prima assim como eu.","timestamp_created":1420910128,"timestamp_updated":1420910128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13927310","author":{"steamid":"76561198105904546","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":2145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1518136054},"language":"english","review":"The best Bioshock, in my opinion.

Some say that the combat gets repetitive and boring, however, I don't find this to be true, I find it to be quite enjoyable actually. The storyline thus far is great and sometimes it can be hard to stop playing. That being said sometimes it IS hard to stop playing because of the lack of manual saves, forcing you to either replay the last ~15 minutes or to continue on to the next autosave. However, like I said the game is very fun, mostly due to Elizabeth. Without her, I feel, the game would lack depth and wouldn't be as intersting by a long shot. In most games followers tend to get in the way or are just plain annoying. However, Elizabeth is quite useful. She can find you ammo, money, and salts that can definitely help during combat. Along with her excellent voice acting and wonderful personality, she makes for a great follower. Overall this game is very enjoyable, it has a great storyline, great characters, the combat is quite fun, and above all Elizabeth is just wonderful to have as a companion.

It is the third Bioshock game, and hits on many of the same thematic notes, exploring a specific type of political ideology - specifically theocracy, in this case.\n\nThe combat follows the improvements which came in Bioshock 2, allowing you to gun with one hand and fire special magical abilities, called Vigors, with the other. Unfortunately, the combat can be a little haphazard at times, as there are a number of enemies that end up being little more than bullet sponges and can take the player character out rapidly - this is only exacerbated on higher difficulties. That being said, I enjoyed the game more than enough to play through multiple times on multiple difficulties.\n\nThe soundtrack and plot of this game are its crowning achievements. The character of Elizabeth is one of the best realized and acting characters in video game history. There's many layers and hints to the story scattered throughout which greatly reward successive playthroughs.\n\nThe graphical style is bright and vibrant and works VERY well for the tone they are attempting to convey.

Просматривая трейлеры я не нашел в этой игре нечего интересного. Но в канун Нового Года стим порадовал всех своими скидками, и я увидев эту игру со скидкой чуть ли не в 90% решился на ее покупку. И вот кинув деньги на счет стим я покупаю новенький Биошок, после установки я долгое время настраивал графику (ведь мягко говоря, пк мой не очень). \nПо прибытию в Колумбию я был удивлен на сколько все красочно и проработано до мелочей, я обошел каждый уголок начальной Колумбии и нередко засматривался на статую в которой живет та самая Элизабет. Вскоре мне надоедает бегать одному, но в какой-то момент мы попадаем к ней. В момент наблюдения за Элизабет она меня удивляет, впервые вижу такого живого персонажа, мимика лица чего только стоит. И вот мы особождаем ее. В момент когда мы лежим без сознания она услышав музыку бежит в то место от куда она играет, вскоре мы находим ее танцующей, она предлагает потанцевать и нам, но у Букера задание... \nВ последующем прохождении игры Элизабет будет снабжать нас солями(маной), здоровьем и др. Во время прохождения я нередко смотрел на неё, как она себя ведёт и тп. В конце концов по мере прохождения все встает на свои места, почему у нее нет фаланга на 1м из пальцев руки и тп. От концовки игры я ожидал большего, я надеялся что будут хотя бы 2 варианта концовок, но нет, создатели посчитали что одного будет достаточно. И так обобщим персонаж выдался очень живым и довольно симпотичным, часто помогает нам в боях. Про других персонажей сказать нечего не могу, ведь по моему в игре главную роль играет Элизабет, а не Букер. \n Плюсы игры:\n-Красочные локации\n-Очаровательный, запутанный и интригующий сюжет\n-Элизабет выглядит словно живой человек\n-Музыкальный подход\n Минусы игры:\n-Быстропроходимая\n-Концовка\n В заключении скажу, что игра стоит своих денег и потраченного времени на ее прохождение.

Don't expect hyper realistic character models, as they tend to be a little more stylized.  That being said, they fit perfectly into the environment (Columbia) perfectly.  The city of Columbia itself is gorgeous, easily lending itself to exploration.  The detail put into even into the small details is impressive and really helps the city feel real.  I spent extra time in each locale in the game just to look at the different pictures/statues/houses that inhabited the area.  \n\nStory:\n+Infinite has a very immersive story.  The original BioShock has an excellent environment which was the driving reason for me to finish the game.  Infinite also has a great environment, but I was more interested in what was going to happen next rather that just exploring.  The audio clip backstories make a return as voxophone recordings.  I've always loved these as they really add depth to the game and flesh out what is happening in the story.  The pacing in the game is good and you always have a clear goal.  Needless to say there are several interesting twists and turns in the plot, and the ending is excellent.  I won't go any further.  \n\nAudio:\n+All of the BioShock games do a good job here but I feel that Infinite sets a high bar.  I'm a sucker for oldies and classical and Infinite really scratched that itch.  Overall they do an excellent job of setting the atmosphere.  \n\nGameplay:\n+This is probably the most refined BioShock game as far as mechanics are concerned.  Shooting is crisp and clean in comparison to the first two titles.  I appreciate the diverse set of guns you are given to work with.  Almost all powers given to you in the game are actually useful.  However, probably the biggest improvement is the addition of a NPC as a partner.  Elizabeth really makes this game.  Her presence feels natural and really adds depth.  I'll be honest, you really grow attached to her.  \n\n\nNegatives\n\n-Maybe I just like my games to be very difficult....but this one felt overly easy.  I played through on Hard mode and didn't come to a single section that was too taxing.  I have yet to play the 1999 mode, but based off of how the death system works, I don't see it being too huge of a challenge.  This has been a common complaint of mine throughout the BioShock series.  \n-I wish that you could carry more than two weapons.  Obviously not a deal breaker, and more realistic in this setting, but having to pick two weapons when there are so many awesome ones was painful.  In their defense, they did an excellent job of placing weapons throughout the game so they were easy to find and readily available (i.e. come to a wide open area and.....oh snap, there is a sniper rifle over there! Just in time!)\n-I also wish there was a different way to upgrade weapons.  Being able to buy weapon upgrades took a huge element out of the fun of exploration for me.  In the first two BioShock games, I scoured the levels to make sure that I could power all my guns up.  Being able to buy them instead took this fun away.  \n\n\n\nAnywho, thats probably long enough.  Overall 10/10; would play again, would suggest again, would watch someone else play again.","timestamp_created":1420774761,"timestamp_updated":1420774761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13903072","author":{"steamid":"76561198099648155","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1864,"last_played":1645039174},"language":"english","review":"probably the best first person shooter game Ive played. i highly recommend it to anyone. love this game","timestamp_created":1420770492,"timestamp_updated":1420770492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13901834","author":{"steamid":"76561198046082096","num_games_owned":424,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":841,"last_played":1442724330},"language":"english","review":"the world is great, the story is even better, were this a movie it'd be one of the best of the decade, however this is a game and there's one more piece to meention: Gameplay.

The city of Columbia is beautiful and one of the most interesting and unique game settings to play in. \n\n+ Graphically both artistically and technically this game is gorgeous. Easily one of the best looking games on PC to date. \n\n+ The story is fantastic dealing with major themes such as racism, morality, religion and faith. A game that should leave a lasting impression on you long after you finish it. \n\n+ Elizabeth one of the main NPC's is incredibly helpful in and out of combat, providing you with health, ammo, money etc. The developers did a great job making her realistic and helpful and not a hindrance.  \n\n+ The game introduces vigors (identical to plasmids from previous Bioshock games) that give you special powers such as charging enemies, shocking, possessing etc that give you an advantage in combat.\n\n+ Plenty of weapons/vigors to fit your play style. You can charge in and blast your enemies with shotguns or stay back and snipe with a sniper rifle. \n\n+ The game introduces skylines for you to ride on adding an extra gameplay element to combat. You can jump on and off the the skylines at will to either attack enemies from above or to escape a potentially dangerous situation. \n\n+The three pieces of DLC are very enjoyable. Clashes in the Clouds is a horde mode across 4 levels and 15 waves each. The goal obviously is to survive each wave and if possible complete the bonus objective. Burial at Sea part 1 and 2 tie in the story of Infinite with the events of the first game. Although the story may be a bit contrived in doing so it was still nice to revisit Rapture from a different point of view. Each episode introduces some new gameplay elements. The first episode being more action oriented while the second being more stealth oriented. \n\n+ Great music and sound\n\nAverage\n\n- Other than the inclusion of skylines the gunplay introduces nothing new. You can also only carry 2 weapons at one time which feels very limiting compared to the previous games. \n\n- Throughout the game you will find pieces of equipment for you to wear. You can equip a total of 4 pieces. The problem is the vast majority of equipment you find is terrible and offers little to no value. The few that are good can really break the game. There is no balance. \n\n\n-The last gameplay segment is uninspiring. I got the feeling the developers ran out of time/creative ideas.\n\nConclusion\n\nYou really have to love the world, story and characters to really appreciate this game. If you play it solely for the gameplay you may find yourself a tad disappointed. I personally loved the game I only wish the world was more open ended for me to explore at my own pace.\n","timestamp_created":1420762881,"timestamp_updated":1420762881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.582292139530181885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13901731","author":{"steamid":"76561198044095216","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":407,"last_played":1530015480},"language":"spanish","review":"Una puta obra maestra por dioooos!!!!","timestamp_created":1420762346,"timestamp_updated":1420762346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13899839","author":{"steamid":"76561198097829583","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":975,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":139,"last_played":1545236848},"language":"english","review":"Fucking amazing.
