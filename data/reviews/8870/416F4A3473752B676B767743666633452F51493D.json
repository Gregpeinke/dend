And for good reason, she isn't a useless character, she is written well, the voice acting is superb, and the storyline actual leaves you remembering her.\n\nSpeaking of story, it is incredible. Coming from a writer's background, the story in this game is a little too good for a game. It is so shocking that they managed to write such a great story while also making it an engaging video game. Some games are games with story as a secondary, but this game has the story running right alongside the gameplay in quality.\n\nI could go on and on about this amazing game, but I don't want to inadvertently spoil it.

Definitely worth the try for those that likes fps games with an rpg element twist to it. The gameplay and storyline is in a way unique such that they try to blend in classic old vibes with a mix of what if sci-fi kinda realism (also kinda steampunk ish?) due to the technology and science in the game that seems quite fictious and advanced, yet also real and old. Good balance mechanics between the usage of weapons and abilities for a singleplayer story game series. The dlc minigames that they offer are also fun and the dlc expansion are really interesting and immersive. Overall game is worth it for those that have extra cash and want a good game with fps and rpg elements mixed in with a good story and gameplay.

You will see online that many people were dissatisfied with what they got because of several years of buildup in anticipation. I actually played this game before I even knew what Bioshock was. Going into it totally blind, this was an amazing experience. Elizabeth feels like a real person and is a great example of AI behaving cleverly in a video game. She doesn't become a hassle to protect because she hides and can defend herself. She doesn't become a hassle to escort because she constantly is tossing you money or items that she finds. Without spoiling it, her relationship with Booker is fantastic and the twist at the end regarding that made me unbelievably happy. The ending of the major narrative is nonsensical and is met with great disdain by most players. That's fair, because it is quite a bunch of nonsense. This is rectified in the  DLC, Burial at Sea.  You absolutely cannot play this game without playing Burial at Sea right afterwards.  Bioshock 1, BioShock Infinite, and Bioshock Burial at Sea is a Trilogy of games that have one continuous story. BioShock 2 is totally removed from this and is not canon, but is worth a playthrough anyway. The reason I give this game such a high rating is because in a time when every game coming out was dark and brooding and covered in brown pallets, this game is soaked with light and color. \n\nEverything you see has been vividly drawn and rendered and the devs are not afraid to utilize the most powerful colors they can find. I have to tip my hat to the artists that worked on this game, because  Colombia was a technical and visual achievement. Aside from that, the actual gameplay is fun and the game itself isn't very long. That might be a bonus or a detraction, depending on who you are, but I think it probably is just the right length. I absolutely recommend you give it a go, and playing it on easy mode is actually my a recommended way for a person who has never played an FPS to get into the genre.","timestamp_created":1632891497,"timestamp_updated":1632891497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100137714","author":{"steamid":"76561199178977217","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":641,"last_played":1632891409},"language":"english","review":"gud game","timestamp_created":1632891457,"timestamp_updated":1632891457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100135972","author":{"steamid":"76561198279644739","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1065,"last_played":1635045231},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo sensacional e uma obra de arte, melhor enredo que já vi na vida, Bioshock Infinite foi uma daquelas experiências extasiantes, ele te deixa pensativo no final, te deixa alucinado e te dar aquele gosto de quero mais.
