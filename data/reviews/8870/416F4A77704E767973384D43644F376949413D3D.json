I actually didn't enjoy this game as much as the original Bioshock.  Why?\n\nI think in part it has to do with the fact that Infinite feels like it's more story than gameplay.  The gameplay isn't bad.  It just doesn't feel inspired.  Bioshock 1 & 2 had about a dozen powers and a lot of sub-powers you could configure, plus hacking/stealth aspect.   Infinite drops all of that and gives you six main powers, and about two dozen or so sub-powers which can only fit in four slots.  All in all, it just felt rather simple, even with the ability to ride sky-rails, and it didn't hold my interest.\n\nThe checkpoint system was rather annoying, and the loss of cash on dying should have been a hard-mode option only.  I particularly loathed the fact that the game put me in this fun looking sky-city world -- and then punished me if I decided to take a leap off a ledge and see what was there.  Psst:  Developers, I would never have this complaint if you implemented a true save/load mechanism.\n\nThe story and visuals are top notch.  But this game feels like a Hollywood blockbuster to me;  All style, little substance.\n\nDespite that:  The world of Columbia didn't feel as real to me as Rapture.  Rapture was a disintegrating utopia filled with criminals driven insane by their mad desire for perfection.  A world of gibbering splicers running amongst the feet of prowling Big Daddies.  It was a circus nightmare and you were thrust into the middle of it.\n\nBut Columbia?  It was a nice, ideallyic 1950s American dream (yes, including the blatant racism).  And then you come in and tear it all down.  Because of that, I didn't feel sympathy for the protagionist.  I guess the devs were hoping for a \"YEAH SHOW THOSE RACIST ASSHOLES, GO IN THERE AND SMASH THEIR FACES IN!\" vibe, but honestly I find that far less interesting than entering a world already driven mad by its corrupt philosophy, as was seen in Rapture.  I want to see Columbia fail on its own, because of its terrible premise.  I don't want to actually be the cause of that failure.","timestamp_created":1389042636,"timestamp_updated":1389042636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495176851749420166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8597047","author":{"steamid":"76561197981977456","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":709,"last_played":1511322092},"language":"english","review":"This game is absolutely beautiful.

Combat turned from fun to an empty, churny and uninspired chore between story crumbs. It felt like the team lost track of \"fun\" 70% or so into the game. As such, the promise the game made with its fantastic first hours turned out to be a huge lie towards the end. The many [i]many[/i] faults with the nimble-as-a-refridgerator controls were at first totally forgivable, but when everything but the visuals crumbled and came tumbling down around it, the painful dance with those blaring faults were pretty much all that was left. The payoff the game convinced me it could deliver was just reduced to a dirty rag tossed to the side.\n\nPlaying on hard can be a real challenge towards the end, but I find that most of my deaths through the game came from getting stuck in basic geometry, the character not running, or simply not jumping to the various hook-spots when he was supposed to. Bioshock Infinite is also a perfect reminder of why enemies using hit-scan weapons in shooters just aren't [i]fun[/i].\n\nI will try to beat it as I'm most probably just one small hill from the end, just to get it over with, and certainly not because I find it entertaining anymore. I'm actually even rather uninterested by the story at this point, as all the characters decided to just muddle up their believability with just stupid and inconsistent behavior.\n\nIt honestly feels like the original team of the game were not, at all, the same people who made the latter hours of it. Weird. Disappointing.\n\n[i]I really wanted to recommend this. I was looking forward to finishing it so I could look up the DLC. I had it in my list of favorites. But I can't recommend it anymore.

You could kill most enemies in the same two or three ways. A lot of shooting, not really very much strategy at all. But it was definitely enjoyable.\n\nAnd again, the way that wrapped the story up was great, epic.

Знаете, я хотел написать небольшую рецензию по поводу прохождения BioShock Infinite, но впечатлений настолько много, что они не укладываются у меня в короткую заметку. Даже не знаю с чего начать...\n\nПонравилась? Yes, of course, my prophet!.. В последнее время особо ничем не удивить - штампуют шутер за шутером, а кроме стрельбы и стрельбы, а также стрельбы там ничего больше нет. Хм.. И тут вы скажете: \"Но ведь и тут надо стрелять, стрелять и стрелять!?\"... Да, - вы будете правы, но до того времени, пока не пройдете игру. Это больше похоже на произведение искусства и ни на что больше. Я могу сравнить это с картиной на выставке. Когда вы каждый новый раз осматриваете её, и начинаете обнаруживать мелкие детали, которые художник мастерски скрыл от зрителя. Именно так игра предстает перед нами. При первом прохождении зритель захватывает только основные детали - мы не смотрим на мелочи, которые на самом деле играют удивительно важную роль. И вот завязка - \"Как? Почему? Может быть я упустил какую-то деталь или переменную в сюжете?\" - и уверяю вас, новое прохождение покажет уже совсем другую картину - картину, на которой вы можете обнаружите совершенно новые детали.\n\nИгровая и сюжетная составляющие, находятся в некоем \"золотом сечении\". Не затянули, ни сократили. Я могу провести аналогию с фильмами \"Начало\" и \"Остров проклятых\". Смешайте эти две составляющие, добавьте \"соли\" по вкусу, и получите примерный аналог сюжета игры. Загадки любят все?.. Я не буду вдаваться в глубь сюжетной линии, но именно благодаря ей появилась прекрасная девушка-компаньон Элизабет, которая знает мир только со стороны добра и не знает, что он может быть другим. \"Ой, Буккер, смотри - золото!, - Если это золото, то я король Англии\".\n\nМожно отдельно отметить графическую составляющую и дизайн уровней. Приятно осознавать, что среди нас еще остались такие талантливые художники и дизайнеры. Город - игрушка. Наверно, если бы мне сказали выбери любое место, где ты бы хотел оказаться в живую - я бы на втором месте выбрал Колумбию. А о первом месте я не скажу. :) Иногда даже не хочется стрелять и проливать кровь в таком месте - жаль, что разработчики не предусмотрели \"тихое\" прохождение. Хотя, это бы не уложилось в данный сюжет, да и вообще в концепцию серии.\n\nBioShok Infinite поднимает планку \"умных\" игр до нового уровня. Это уже не \"тупые\" скрипты, а полное погружение игрока в судьбу персонажа. Это некий обряд очищения, пройдя который, вы взгляните на шутеры по-новому.\n\nИграть?.. Несомненно. Даже если вы не любитель современного искусства.
