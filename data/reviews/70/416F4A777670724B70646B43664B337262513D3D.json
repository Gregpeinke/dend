Игровой процесс не разделён на миссии или этапы, поэтому действие заключается в непрерывном передвижении по целостным локациям, лишь технически разделённым на карты (хотя в середине игры протагониста оглушают солдаты HECU, и он приходит в себя уже в другой локации).

Game process isn't divided into missions or stages therefore action consists in continuous movement on the complete locations which are only technically divided into cards (though in the middle of a game of the protagonist soldiers of HECU deafen, and he recovers already in other location). All cards are linear and, as a rule, assume the only possible way for passing.

After finishing the game, I have to say, this is one of best first person shooters I've ever played. \nEverything it does, is great; gameplay, level design, atmosphere, story, platforming and on. The first hour was boring for me, but I instantly fell in love with the clever level design of having to utilize vents and your trusty crowbar. From there on, it was a beautiful tale of Gordon Freeman and his tale of escapade from Black Mesa. \nThis game did not need amazing CG cutscenes or an intricate storytelling narrative or overutilized/overly complex elements of the AAA games we get nowadays. All Half Life gave you was a tram to sit in that escorts you to work and as a very polite lady introduces you the science facility of Black Mesa, the safety guidelines of the workplace and a crowbar.\nThe thing that I find impressive the most is how this game was able to set itself apart, take a more slow, strategic and tactical approach to the FPS genre compared to Arena shooters at the time. With that said I can say, I have never played a game like this. \nThe atmosphere is dripping with story, asking the character: \"What happened here?\". From the moment I pressed an elevator button and that action alone had consequences, I was hooked. There are gray areas, different characters have their own agendas, and by the end you might be asking yourself: \"So..who was in the wrong?\"\nThis is a must buy game.","timestamp_created":1483156330,"timestamp_updated":1483156330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28854260","author":{"steamid":"76561198183741915","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1154,"last_played":1655112624},"language":"english","review":"One of the best fps games ever made or maybe it is the best.

Half-Life est un tournant dans l'histoire du jeu vidéo, et s'il est déjà vieux, son scénario et ses graphismes sont de réelles innovations pour son époque, il est donc bien plus qu'un doom-like basique. Après tout, c'est le premier succès d'une longue série dans l'histoire de Valve.\n\nConcernant le scénario, il est vrai que l'idée générale peut sembler ordinaire (invasion de créatures venues d'un monde parallèle). Cependant, l'aventure présente quelques rebondissements intéressants. De plus, on en rate une bonne partie si on reste dans la peau de Gordon Freeman. Les extensions du jeu Opposing Force et Blue Shift (voire Decay), et surtout les informations complémentaires disponibles sur internet, permettent d'en savoir un peu plus sur l'incident de Black Mesa (qui reste assez flou pour le joueur). Si vous aimé Half-Life 2 (ou 3 s'il est sorti à l'heure où vous lisez, car il sortira, j'en suis persuadé, avant l'extinction de l'humanité), c'est votre devoir de fan d'approfondir et de jouer à l'original ! De même pour les joueurs de Portal, tout cela se déroule dans le même univers. Cependant, sachez que ce n'est absolument pas la même ambiance qui règne à Aperture et à Black Mesa.\n\nEn effet, ce jeu n'est pas vraiment humoristique (enfin on peut toujours le prendre à la légère et s'amuser à massacrer de pauvres innocents, mais ce n'est pas une conduite honnête). Il est plutôt glauque et oppressant, et en cela surpasse largement HL2. Gordon reste dans l'enceinte de Black Mesa, centre de recherche en grande partie souterrain, cherche à s'en échapper malgré ses dimensions pharamineuses, ce qui donne une impression d'enfermement. Le joueur se sent également très seul, les alliés qu'il a sont rares, faibles et malheureusement stupides. Le silence est parfois brisé par la téléportation fracassante d'un ennemi dans votre dos. Il y a quand même quelques musiques, entre autres pour rythmer les scènes d'action importantes.\n\nAu niveau de l'expérience de jeu, dans les grandes lignes, c'est un FPS avec des armes variées et équilibrées allant du pied-de-biche au lance-roquettes à guidage laser ; il y a également une barre de vie et une barre d'énergie pour l'armure (tenant le rôle de bouclier). C'est donc un gameplay similaire à celui de Counter-Strike (à l'origine un des nombreux mods de Half-Life). Le jeu n'est pas trop difficile (il y a bien quelques passages un peu chauds, notamment sur les plate-formes, mais on peut toujours y aller à coup de sauvegarde, non ?). Il est d'ailleurs possible de changer de niveau de difficulté en cours de route (par contre désactivez vite l'aide à la visée si vous jouez en mode facile, à la souris en tout cas, c'est peut-être utile pour les manettes ?). Il ne s'agit pas toujours d'action, il y a pas mal d'énigmes. Le tout est accompagné de séquences de jeu assez originales que vous découvrirez vous-même.\n\nQuant aux graphismes, ils datent mais ne sont pas désagréables. Ils participent peut-être même à l'ambiance malsaine du jeu. Si vraiment vous êtes allergiques aux vieux graphismes, tout n'est pas perdu, car un remake du jeu fait par des fans, Black Mesa, est déjà disponible. À l'heure actuelle, il est en accès anticipé et donc incomplet, il manque les derniers chapitres. Sinon, il reste Half-Life: Source, avec les améliorations (IA et physique) du moteur éponyme, mais les graphismes ne sont pas terribles non plus.\n\nFinalement : achetez Half-Life, c'est le meilleur de la série. Ne vous privez pas d'acheter le reste pour autant.","timestamp_created":1483147938,"timestamp_updated":1483147938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.6888846755027771","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28847775","author":{"steamid":"76561198328181114","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":2183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1995,"last_played":1614105279},"language":"brazilian","review":"Vida

Davvero WOW. Ne ho sempre sentito parlare e basta ma non me ne sono mai interessato più di tanto. Non sono mai stato un amante del genere FPS. Poi mi è capitato tra le offerte e ho deciso di dargli un'opportunità. D'altronde stava a poco meno di due euro, un paio di caffé. Lasciatevelo dire, per essere un gioco dell'ormai lontano 1998 mi ha preso anche più del dovuto. Questo genere di giochi sono la prova provata che della grafica non te ne fai un c@xxo se c'è un ottimo gameplay dietro. E perché no, anche una bella e interessante storia (poi vabè, a me piace particolarmente il genere quindi sono di parte). E vorrei dire una cosa a chi afferma che è invecchiato male: NO.

I pleasantly mowed down waves of infantry in Call of Duty before trying this game, so this review entirely lacks the nastalgia you might be reading in other reviews. I tried this on the notion that Half-Life was one of the innovators to the FPS genre. So, I waited for the bundle to go on sale and I bought the Half-Life Complete pack, cheaper to buy all the games than just one on the average day (thanks Valve). \n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1] 5/10\nHave not aged well. But that is to be expected being released in 1998. And by no means is graphic fidelity a crucial defintion of a game's success.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] 9/10\nSurprisingly, I enjoyed the elements Valve introduced in Half-Life. I think after almost 2 decades, Half-Life still plays well and is comfortable to even the newer FPS players on PC like myself. There are some minor annoyances like the sliding movement, but you quickly adapt. \n\n[h1] Story [/h1] 6/10\nI think this element is something Half-Life lacks, Gordon Freeman is the silent hero, we don't really learn much from this game. But like most franchises, the first release is merely an introduction. I think if you look at this game more as the prequel to the story introduced in Half-Life 2, then it can be a much more enjoyable experience. \n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nOverall, I feel this game still holds up to gameplay standards. And gameplay alone is why I would truly recommend this game. It is a pleasant game to play. If you're looking for a challenge and haven't played Half-Life, give this a go. There's no quest markers, no one to hold your hand, and some points you feel the entire game has turned against you. But it's all in good fun. It's especially cheap during sales, and should run on even the most modest PCs.","timestamp_created":1483075032,"timestamp_updated":1483075032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510628461837768555","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28815151","author":{"steamid":"76561198070906084","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":638,"last_played":1456543316},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life is quite an interesting game indeed.
