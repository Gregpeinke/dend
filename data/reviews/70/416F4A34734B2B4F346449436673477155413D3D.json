Half-Life was the game that push the boundaries of first person shooter games. It even helped Valve get to where it is today which paved away for other games Valve is known for. Half-Life takes at the Black Mesa Research Facility(a combination of Area 51 & the Los Alamos National Lab)  in the middle of the desert of New Mexico. As the  game begins there's no FMVs, cutscenes, or introduction sequence. You immidiately start the game in the role of Gordon Freeman, a Theoretical Physict who works for Black Mesa. When Gordon participates in an experiment with a group of other scientists, something went wrong and the entire research lab explodes. Upon waking up, Gordon realizes that the Black Mesa facility is in ruins where most of the staff is dead and the experiment gone wrong had some how created a gateway from another demonsion where various aliens and other horrific creatures straight out of every man's horror is running amok in the facility. Gordon must use his intellect, brawn, and the help of the last surviving scientists and security guards in order to escape from Black Mesa before he gets mutilated by the demonsional aliens. The great thing about this game is that there are multiple ways to kill the enemies with the wide selection of weapons you obtain around the lab facility. There are unlimited saves so in case you mess up you can either reload the last save or auto save of the game file. Those are just a few of the many pros of the game. Now for the cons which are minor: the ladders can be you worst enemy some times due to getting on or off is tricky, the scientists and guards who provide aid sometimes don't keep up or move at all, while you occasionally encounter a glitch that immobilze you from moving and you either have to reload you last save or quit the game and start it up again just to get out of the glitch. With those issues aside, this is an extremely good game to play. While todays gamers might find the graphics to be very dated, the complex plot and the length of the game play by passes its age. Half-Life would spawn various spin-offs and sequals as well is inspire later first person shooter games that used this game as a basis for the genre. Overrall this is a great piece of video game history here with a story that combines elements from Doom, Ridley Scott's Alien, John Carpenter's The Thing, & X-Files into one package will please any gamer or first person shooter fan.","timestamp_created":1455665435,"timestamp_updated":1455665435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21261301","author":{"steamid":"76561198280340433","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":7696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2133,"last_played":1518003733},"language":"turkish","review":"","timestamp_created":1455658204,"timestamp_updated":1455658204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21260644","author":{"steamid":"76561198006530463","num_games_owned":348,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1649,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1649,"last_played":1455655227},"language":"english","review":"This game aged very well and was fun to pick up and play again.

The graphics are not better than Half-Life 2, but the weapons are the best. The hive hand and tao cannon are the most fun and satisfying to use. The story is dark and I am fond of it for portraying you as a small cog in a larger machine through which you slowly climb the ranks until the entire military is hounding you, as oppose to Half-Life 2 where you are regarded as the new messiah. You have much more free reign in Half-Life than Half-Life 2 as you have the ability to shoot anything/one who look at you funny. The puzzels are challenging and require skill, but are never flow breaking. It is extremely replayable because the action is never boring. The difficulty curve is fair yet firm and never becomes too steep. The enemies are never too hard to defeat but are interesting and better than the Half-Life 2 villains. The colour scheme and art design are fantastic and make up for the outdated graphics.\n\nThere are afew annoyances, all the scientists are clones and the game does become slightly easy after the Hive Hand is introduced and Black Mesa seens to have 13,000 generators, but these are the small moles on the beautiful bearded face of this classic game. \n\nThis game is amazing and everyone should purchase it to show VALVe we want Half-Life 3.","timestamp_created":1455482743,"timestamp_updated":1455482743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21214763","author":{"steamid":"76561198278212341","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1240,"last_played":1455478292},"language":"english","review":" Some may disagree, but this game is just marvelous.","timestamp_created":1455478485,"timestamp_updated":1455478485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21214707","author":{"steamid":"76561198125153794","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1478982141},"language":"french","review":"Gaben, I love this game, It is like my second family.","timestamp_created":1455478328,"timestamp_updated":1455478328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21214327","author":{"steamid":"76561198066569410","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":352,"last_played":1489432001},"language":"german","review":"Best Game I ever Played is the Half Life Trilogy from Opposing Force,BlueShift,BlackMesa,Half Life,   to -Half life episode 2 \n\nand these are the BEst games i ever played i liked the game sooo much that i  played it again and again 11/10\n\n\nA long story As gordan Freeman and i really enjoyed that time","timestamp_created":1455477423,"timestamp_updated":1455477423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21204152","author":{"steamid":"76561197989243222","num_games_owned":2024,"num_reviews":253,"playtime_forever":1070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1012,"last_played":1647674020},"language":"hungarian","review":"Gordon Freeman-ünk elkésett a melóból, ezért rá hárul a feladat, hogy a teszt kamrában ténykedjen az új kísérletben. Mint utóbb kiderült, jobban járt volna ha be se megy a melóba, hiszen a teszt során elszabadul a pokol. Egy másik dimenzióban levő lény egy portált hoz létre kedvenc Föld nevű bolygónkkal, és elárasztja mindenféle hangos, büdös, és felettébb agresszív lénnyel. A melóhelyen rajta kívűl csak impotens biztonsági őrök, és 70 fölötti tudósok vannak, így Freeman barátunkra marad a feladat, hogy kiírtsa az önkényuralomra törő élien bandát.\n\nA játék 1998-ban jelent meg, és többségében ürlényhentelés lesz a terítéken. Azonban amivel kitűnt a játék a többi közül, az a viszonylag hihető környezet, a technológia, valamint a cseles platformer részek.\n\nNézzük csak az enemiket és fegyvereket: vegyesen fogunk találkozni képzett katonákkal, és más dimenziók lényeivel. A katonák néha okosan mozognak, néha pedig bután fognak állni a placc közepén. Ami viszont mindig közös lesz bennük, hogy mindig csapatban mozognak, és marhasok hpjuk van. Ezt azzal akarták kompenzálni a valve-nél, hogy ráadásul pontosan lőnek, és gránátokat is dobálnak. A többség utálja őket emiatt, és mindig is rátett a játék nehézségi fokozatára a katonaság. MIt mondjak, most végigtoltam hardon, és egy egészséges kihívás volt a játék.\nAz élienek lassúak és kevésbé koordináltak embertársaikhoz képest. Hátrányuk viszont, hogy bárhova bespawnolhatnak, így vigyázzunk a hátsónkra (főleg folyosókon).\n\nMaguk a pályák hihetőek, és mindenki így képzel el egy titkos kutatóközpontot, ahol öreg tudósok kísérleteznek kristályokon és tesztelgetik az elkapott űrlényeket. Talán ami meglepő, az a központ mérete. Kilómétereken át megyünk a játékban, és még mindig a lambda részlegen vagyunk.\nMásik meghatározó rész a xen, avagy a másik dimenzió. Itt nem töltünk el annyi időt, viszont egy maradandó élmény lesz, hiszen egy számunkra ismeretlen világba csöppenünk. Minden lebeg, minden meg akar harapni vagy rázni, és ez tovább fokozódik amikor megtaláljuk a katonagyártó bázisukat. Tetszett, hogy láttuk néha elhullott társainkat. Az elhullott társ régebben (pl Doom-ban) azt jelentette hogy erős ellenállásba fogunk ütközni, itt azonban mint ammo állomásként szerepeltek.\n\nA fent említett technológia egyébként a Quake 2 motorjára épül, azonban itt könnyebb mindent módosítani. Ilyen például a csontvázszerkezet, ahol elég a fejet kicserélni, hogy egy másik tudóst kapjunk. Ez egy a mai napig aktív mod scene-t teremtett. Ahogy láthatjátok nem régiben jelent meg steamen a sven coop is, mellyel egyébként végig lehet tolni a gémet haverokkal coopban.\n\nA játék azonban küszködik a klasszikus régi játék szindrómákkal: egyes platformok megölnek, levegőben random sebződsz, és a mesterséges intelligencia...nos ez szimplán csak szörnyű. Perceken át nyomogatni az E betűt hogy ugyan méltóztasson követni a biztonsgi őr és nyissa ki a tetves ajtót. Az AI egyébként az utóbbi évek patchelésének hatására sem javult, még megkockáztatom, hogy a won verzióban jobb volt.\n\nAmi viszont jó hír, hogy a steames verzió jól fut modern rendszereken, SŐT kapott egy deafult_fov és fps_override parancsokat, így akármekkora fovval kitolhatjuk temérdek képkockaszámmal. Végeredményben egy jó játékról van szó, aminek el kell nézni sok mindent korából kifolyólag.\nÉrtékelés: 8/10 trancsírozott óriás heregolyó, ami egy négy lábú szörnyről lóg.","timestamp_created":1455450834,"timestamp_updated":1455450834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.719376683235168457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21201094","author":{"steamid":"76561198257743239","num_games_owned":319,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":91,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1480129389},"language":"schinese","review":"从小时候到现在一直听闻到的神作。兴冲冲下载下来后玩了十分钟后就卸载了⋯⋯因为晕的不行。画面和细节在当时的眼光看来的确是神作吧，可惜眼睛被其他的游戏惯坏了令我欣赏不能。不过据说有一个非官方的重制版叫Black mesa是么，看来我还是用体验一下这部神作吧。9/10","timestamp_created":1455441024,"timestamp_updated":1465699737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581610560417175293","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21200248","author":{"steamid":"76561198204992848","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":481,"last_played":1658336215},"language":"russian","review":"Даже самая первая игра от Valve corporation удалась на славу. графика для 98-х отличная. сюжет продуманный.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nплюсы:\n1.Сюжет.\n2.Набор оружия.\n3.Враги.\n4.Качество.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nминусы:\n1.Некоторые неогичные ситуации.\n2.отсутствие возможности просмотреть модель и изменить текстуру.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nОценка : 8/10\n","timestamp_created":1455437705,"timestamp_updated":1455437705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517937242984771729","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21199851","author":{"steamid":"76561198073251594","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":60,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60,"last_played":1447444805},"language":"schinese","review":"Where is 3? 3? 3? 3? 3? 3?","timestamp_created":1455436165,"timestamp_updated":1455436165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21197469","author":{"steamid":"76561198261672041","num_games_owned":331,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1578156827},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bom recomendo muito, Half-Life é um jogo de aliens zumbies e ... muito bom","timestamp_created":1455425492,"timestamp_updated":1455425492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21196577","author":{"steamid":"76561198053474979","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":516,"last_played":1357113600},"language":"english","review":"This game might have been great when it came out, back in the days, but the thing can't keep up.

I know right! But hey, I have never been one to really be on top of anything lol :-P\nAnyway, the question is, is it any good? Now this is a bit of a redundant question as the whole of the world is fairly clear on this point. But I have just played it without nostalgia goggles, so maybe my opinion can be slightly less biased than some.\nFirst off, the plot. Simply put, amazing. It is told - or rather not \"told\", but \"revealed\" - in a wonderfully immersive and instructive way, guiding you to self-discovery and your own interpretations of everything. There is a lot of wry humour and thoughts and considerable depth to the whole concept.\nSecond off, the characters. There is only one, and he is not even you. Gordon Freeman, the player character, is almost entirely devoid of depth - but that is not a bad thing. It is one of the game's strengths, as it allows a huge amount of player imagination to be used, and he is a perfect everyman in this sense. The one character I am talking about is a mysterious figure you see at various times...I leave anyone who has not played the game the mystery of this figure.\nThird, the enemies. A diverse array of challenging enemies, with designs that may now be called standard, and even then were not the most original, but nonetheless they work and are used in one of the most effective ways I have seen even up to the present.\nFourth, the weapons. A variety of weapons, although not the most exciting array ever. Most of them feel plinky and weak, and the worst is the shotgun which seems to have b****r-all pellet spread, meaning the main use for a shotgun is rendered near-impossible to carry out. The exceptions are the ghostbuster gun (or Gluon as it is actually called), the Magnum Revolver, and the crossbow.\nFifth, the level design. Pretty good on the whole. There is a reasonable amount of variety overall, but a lot of it will be in dull corridors. That is the point, however, so it is not fair to criticise. There is a hideous over-reliance on single-routes to solve levels, and a dreadful over-utilisation on platforming elements which do not work comfortably within the dated engine and first-person perspect.\nThis leads on to the sixth aspect, gameplay. This is where the game is a mixed bag of fruit. It may have been wonderful for its day, but that is not the point. A game can be good at one point and become bad over time if the gameplay does not hold up - it is not something that is forgivable in the same way dated graphics are. Ladders are a joke, with your character either stuck inseperably to them or refusing to grab them when needed. Jumping and platforming, as mentioned before, is used far too much and is, honestly, hideous. A modern FPS with feet shown on your character, may be more tolerable. The shooting is functional, although as mentioned the weapons are not that satisfying or varied. The crosshair is also coloured and sized to be far too small and hard to decipher on the screen in the middle of the chaos. There is the suggestion of being able to be more stealthy, and this works well enough for a shooter of its generation, especially when stealth is unnecessary and who needs it lol?\nFinally, atmosphere. This is where the game really comes in to its own. It is creepy when it needs to be, and it is dark, and deep, and rich. It can be scary, and sometimes you cannot help but jump. It is tense and action-packed, unrelenting, and surprisingly beautiful despite the dated graphics.\nI will not even mention the graphics, as I maintain someone that judges a game on its graphics is not a real gamer at all, and such opinions deserve no time of day, as long as the graphics are functional (i.e., if they constantly crash or flicker so as to give a migraine that is obviously bad, but merely being blocky and pixellated or something is not important).\nOverall, just buy this game. I give it a solid 8.5/10, even by today's standards.\nEnjoy!","timestamp_created":1455385057,"timestamp_updated":1455385057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21184055","author":{"steamid":"76561198168574459","num_games_owned":205,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":5021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1780,"last_played":1602437939},"language":"russian","review":"лучшая игра в своём жанре","timestamp_created":1455383712,"timestamp_updated":1455383712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21182859","author":{"steamid":"76561198168463573","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":473,"last_played":1455379913},"language":"english","review":"I give this game a 8.5/10 overall. \n\n-The \"story\" is great even there is lack of information.

[b]9/10[/b][/h1]\n\n[h1][b]Summary[/b][/h1] \nHalf-life is a story-rich shooter with some simple puzzle elements that struggles with the Goldsource engine and some other glitches here and there.\n\n[h1][b]Detailed review[/b][/h1]\nSo I just finished Half-life and figured: \"Why not make a review of it?\". I can't say other than it's a classic. What a game indeed!\n\nDispise being an alltime masterpiece, it's not safe from glitches and mistakes. This game runs with the old but gold (no pun intended) Goldsource engine, which has its limitations (like crude-to-use ladders). Throughout the game you're sure to find some glitches here and there. You might get stuck on walls or levers. Also, sometimes the submachine gun MP5 won't reload or might reload but won't show to you (though it reloads, your HUD view won't update your bullets). Those are some of the glitches you may run into.\n\n\"GOTTA GO FAST\". I think that's Freeman's motto. His speed is way too fast and, because of that, often you might fall off platforms.\n\nThis game is hard. Most people will agree. Enemies take bullets like if they are nothing and they lock onto you like some freaking aimbot! They never miss a shot! And if your HEV meter is gone, you're pretty much gone too because they can drain your life faster than you can say: \"what the...!\". It's trial and error at its best!\n\nOne other thing: this game requires English knowledge as intermediate or above. People who can't handle English properly might struggle. If you don't pay attention, often you might find yourself wondering what to do next. (Just a fair warning!)\n\nThough there're all those issues, Half-life has that special charm that makes you want to keep going. You may have to try the same area a lot of times until you become a master on it, but you keep trying because you are in love with the story and wants to know what comes next. The plot is amazing.\n\nThe overall scenario presentation is alright. Some places are awesome and some are bland. Overall, it's OK.\n\nI can't make enough justice about this game. It's a must play for everyone who likes shooters and simple puzzle-solving elements. Story-rich at its finest. Though, be warned: it's not an easy game.\n\nOh, by the way, Freeman is a crowbar master!\n\n[h1]Edits[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Some formatting corrections.\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1455301506,"timestamp_updated":1455301688,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502138137817382813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21154671","author":{"steamid":"76561198090745574","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1521081665},"language":"english","review":"This game is one of the best besides Blue Shift and Opposing Force. 10/10","timestamp_created":1455293290,"timestamp_updated":1455293290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49965059757232666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21152525","author":{"steamid":"76561198263135738","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":865,"last_played":1547752215},"language":"turkish","review":"GabeN <3","timestamp_created":1455287627,"timestamp_updated":1455287627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21148272","author":{"steamid":"76561198047046425","num_games_owned":1220,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":613,"last_played":1455308021},"language":"schinese","review":"趁春节打折打包购入的，对半条命的剧情毫无了解，古老的画面以及超快的移动速度带来的操作不便还有镜头晃动地让我。。。我先去厕所吐一阵子。。。。","timestamp_created":1455273516,"timestamp_updated":1455273516,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21144355","author":{"steamid":"76561198135969461","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":619,"last_played":1511141643},"language":"english","review":"Best money I've ever spent on a game just to bhop in.","timestamp_created":1455255513,"timestamp_updated":1455255513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21143762","author":{"steamid":"76561198170202983","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":60,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1453067352},"language":"english","review":"Very fun","timestamp_created":1455252455,"timestamp_updated":1455252455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21143357","author":{"steamid":"76561198024326228","num_games_owned":321,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":48,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1551795952},"language":"english","review":"First time i play this many years ago on a demo each came in some magazine, i install it.
