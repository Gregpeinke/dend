This lasts for several chapters.\n\nThen give the return of antlions, but rather than keeping the prior canon of them knowing where you are via vibrations in HL2, here that doesn't apply, and the way you counter them is putting a car on their spawn points so it doesn't become a shitty L4D2.\n\nThe parts where your alone in the Citadel and the part where you're alone after escort final boss are easily the best parts.

So it makes sense that the first of two story additional items to Half-Life 2 are likewise incredible FPS games. Episode One doesn't add a lot to the narrative of a specific substance past setting up the occasions of Episode Two, yet the ongoing interaction setpieces and level plan are intriguing to the point of supporting the 3-4 hours of strong shooter interactivity that players of the past games will know pretty much everything about.\n\nEpisode One depends a ton on zombie setpieces, it seems like - a ton of the game's runtime is enjoyed managing zombies, regardless of whether in the city's underside (trusting that a lift will show up) or in a neglected clinic that isn't actually deserted. There's still a ton of Consolidate to battle, and every one of those battles feel incredible.\n\nAlyx is probably the most amazing aspect of the game as well - you make them follow along fundamentally constantly, and her quality is especially useful in establishing you in the game's story, and giving you somebody to definitely battle close by, rather than significant length with very little human contact. It hypothetically makes the game more straightforward having an unkillable person battling close by you, yet it's actually provoking to the point of staying fun.\n\nThere's something else to say, truly - assuming you do, for reasons unknown, currently own Half-Life 2 and not this, and you delighted in it - then, at that point, truly, this is an easy decision. It contains all the exemplary Half-Life 2 components - elegantly composed characters, physical science based battle, strong and fulfilling gunplay, and endurance frightfulness segments.

Not in the general sense of a difficult game, more so in a trap game sort of way. Look up a game called Trap Adventure 2. That is the epitome of this game. Every time you try to do something, there'll be a hopper or an exploding barrel with unavoidable damage. Unlike Half Life 2 where you could retreat, regroup, and rethink, Episode 1 requires nonstop save scumming. Not to mention how annoying it is to wait for the cut-scene triggers. Half the time Alyx will be standing there doing nothing until you stand in the correct spot (a spot that is never intuitive).\n\nI'm going to finish Episode 1, and I hope Episode 2 is better. But if you're just considering buying this game, ask yourself if you are a Half Life 2 fanatic. If not, don't, it's not worth the money. I only spent $1.50 on it and even I feel a bit ripped off. Every step of this game has felt more annoying than anything. Half Life 2 had such amazing flow, but this? This is you running through a maze getting exploded by a barrel and running it again to avoid said barrel, then getting shocked to death, running the maze again to avoid the first two traps only to be killed by ANOTHER barrel, all while enemies spawn endlessly from some distant window and zombies yell \"Allahu Akbar\" and pulling a grenade the moment before you kill them.","timestamp_created":1641606576,"timestamp_updated":1641606576,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107558618","author":{"steamid":"76561198220602688","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":216,"last_played":1641603414},"language":"english","review":"you could understand how this game fits into the story in a paragraph","timestamp_created":1641603469,"timestamp_updated":1641603469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107553868","author":{"steamid":"76561198814887728","num_games_owned":400,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":12856,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12856,"last_played":1607725617},"language":"german","review":"Great Game 11/10","timestamp_created":1641597805,"timestamp_updated":1641597805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107548178","author":{"steamid":"76561198876796634","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1642771159},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра.\nНе плохой сюжет да и для игры 2004 года графика отличная да и сейчас не плохо смотрится.","timestamp_created":1641591825,"timestamp_updated":1641591825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107547842","author":{"steamid":"76561197981809948","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1642025775},"language":"brazilian","review":"TOP","timestamp_created":1641591505,"timestamp_updated":1641591505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107529535","author":{"steamid":"76561198979615749","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":286,"last_played":1641573489},"language":"russian","review":"Почему по этой части нету спидрана?","timestamp_created":1641573539,"timestamp_updated":1641573539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107527613","author":{"steamid":"76561199227844066","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1651789169},"language":"russian","review":"класс","timestamp_created":1641571599,"timestamp_updated":1641571599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"107527378","author":{"steamid":"76561199070693783","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1641569791},"language":"russian","review":"хорошая игра. хотя игрой не назовешь, это скорее dlc ко второму халф лайфу, причем довольно интересное и классное. ачивка \"пройти игру, выстрелив всего один раз\" это что-то с чем-то. и тем не менее, тут есть все необходимое, чтобы это сделать, и я это сделал в первом же прохождении. в остальном -
