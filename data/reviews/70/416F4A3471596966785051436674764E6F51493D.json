The ammo and health pickups aren't scarce, but they certainly aren't plentiful which makes the constant search for said ammo and health feel less like a chore. The enemy designs are amazing, each one makes noises and looks completely different from one another making it easy to pick out which enemies your fighting. but...  but this is not enough to make up for huge flaws. Firstly, several enemies are just down right mean to the player. Not in their difficulty, but in their placement. I thought most enemies were fine, those invisible guys are such an un-fun enemy. They have the health of a military soldier, they are invisible, they are very quick, and they fire fast guns that deal massive damage. most areas of this game were forgettable at worst, but the fucking minefield bullshit was some complete dogshit. the mines trigger-boxes™ were larger than they should have been and there is no way to find where they are without wasting 50 bullets on shooting the ground. The mines do not have a different coloring, they do not make noise when you get near them, they just explode. You end up wasting your, as I stated earlier, valuable ammo or just have to trial and error it with saving and loading. But the biggest problem by a million miles is how fucking glitch prone this game is. I get it, its old and i'm about to play Black Mesa so hopefully i'll have a better time there. Anyway I cant explain how many fucking game breaking glitches I got during my playtime. I don't want to spoil anything here so if you want to know the ones I remember or have a convo, we can do it in the comments. Anyway I feel bad about the rating but its how I feel.5/10, just disappointing given its god status.","timestamp_created":1600373263,"timestamp_updated":1600373708,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76135823","author":{"steamid":"76561198152742087","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1883,"last_played":1600465170},"language":"english","review":"This

Ofrece un acercamiento a la narrariva en tiempo real que luego heredaría su sucesor, Half-Life 2, que logra muy bien establecernos en el contexto de su universo (aunque sea algo simplista).Su gameplay varía entre cagarse a tiros con alienígenas o con militares, e interactuar con el mundo que rodea al Gordon Hombre Libre, ya sea resolviendo algún que otro puente roto o puzzle o utilizando a la inteligencia artificial a nuestro favor. Y hablando un poco sobre la misma, voy a ser sincero, la I.A. envejeció mal. Mínimo algún que otro parche hubiera bastado, pero los NPCs se siguen bugeando.También el juego peca de poder sufrir disonancias ludonarrativas, y aclaro lo de PODER sufrirlas porque es el jugador quien decide si realizarlas o no, por ejemplo, matando a científicos porque si, aunque no encaje con lo que haría Gordon. El juego debería penalizar esa conducta a fin de mantener la integridad narrativa. Es un caso similar al de GTA IV, pero ahí es mucho peor.Aún asi, eso no quita que el juego me siga pareciendo muy importante para la historia de los videojuegos, y que marcó un antes y un después en la forma de creación de los mismos y comó narrar sus historias.

Firstly the graphics aren't to hot and the bullets feel kind of weird. Also I heard that valve won a prize for making the smallest aiming reticle possible. And while I'm sure some of this sounds bad if your willing to look past these issues you got a great game. The story is captivating except for around the middle were it feels like your kind of just going down a never ending tunnel of tasks. But the first 6 and the last 4 chapters are awesome because there able to tell so much story without any crazy cutscenes. And the selection of weapons are out standing for the time considering each gun has there pros and cons. And there are multiple ways of going after and enemy and you kind of pick your own play style. The world is massive and lively the story (for the most part) is stellar the shooting and graphics are kind of meh but it's all worth it.
