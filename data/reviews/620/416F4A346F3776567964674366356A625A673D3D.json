It's usually only $1 in the steam sales and offers at least 10 hours of single player with the main campaign and double that for co-op. With the community created maps this game can offer almost endless puzzles too. \n\nWhat makes portal really special is the single player story mode. A continuation of the last portal game, it offers amazing new mechanics and environments, and most importantly a great story that keeps you playing. The writing both in the dialogue and written posters is hilarious and makes the game so much better than just the puzzles. The game still looks great 10 years later with really impressive and distinct environments. The music is great and used very well- I'd recommend everyone to download the soundtrack after playing because a lot of the tracks are extended on it and are really good.\n\nEvery couple years I feel the need to come back and play the game and every time I'm reminded how great it all is. I've played on Xbox and another Steam account, so my hours seem low, but trust me I've spent dozens and dozens on this one. Looking back on all the games I've played, Portal 2 sticks out as probably my favorite.
