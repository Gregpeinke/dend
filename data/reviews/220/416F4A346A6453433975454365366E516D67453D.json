Это обзор на вторую часть игры Half-Life. В отличии от первой игры вторая получилась намного успешнее. Лично мне первая часть не очень понравилась, но вторая это совсем другое дело. Ну не будем томить и перейдём к обзору. Разберём игру на плюсы и минусы.\nПлюсы\n1. Сюжет. В отличии от первой части здесь он хотябы есть. Тут не придётся тупо бегать по корпусам чёрной мезы. Но чем я был огорчён, так это тем, что сюжет никак не связан с первой частью. Так, что можете смело забыть про HL1\n2. Арсенал оружия. Оружия много, собственно как и в первой части. Особенно порадовали жуки.\n3. Физика. Загадки с физикой и сама грави-пушка очень порадовали.\n4. Озвучка. Полная русская озвучка. Может она где-то кривая, но кто не захочет поиграть в шедевральную игру на своём родном языке.\n5. Геймплей. Геймплей представляет собой стрельбу на больших локациях с разнообразием на загадки.\n(графику не учитываю потому, что она не важна)\nМинусы.\n1. Тупые NPC. Они просто отсталые дауны которые только мешают. Благо они только в конце и их чуть-чуть.\n2. Концовка. Концовка ничего не обьясняет, но намекает на продолжение. Так, что если хотите полного понимания приготовьетесь купить два эпизода.\nПлюсов 5, минусов 2.\nИтог: Игру к покупке рекомендую. Сюжет хоть его и не много, но он интересен. Грави-пушка топ. Пёсель самый лучший. Игра вам понравится, это я гарантирую. Берите и не задумывайтесь.\nНу, а если этот обзор был вам полезен, то ставьте лайки и коментируйте если, что.","timestamp_created":1520140993,"timestamp_updated":1520140993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53947371244430542","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40550874","author":{"steamid":"76561198136168509","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1571763544},"language":"turkish","review":"1","timestamp_created":1520129999,"timestamp_updated":1520129999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40549322","author":{"steamid":"76561198073659465","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":977,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":693,"last_played":1647562199},"language":"russian","review":"Спустя десять лет наконец прошел.\nОказывается тогда я ее тоже почти прошел, залез в Цитадель и нужно было сесть в кокон для транспортировки рабов, но тогда что-то не всосал и выбросил.\nМолодой -

 小时候玩的是盗版，现在入正版了。入了正版之后也没有多少时间去玩，直到某一天，我已经厌倦了那些所谓的“大作”。 \n    无意间我打开了半条命2，太震撼了，说实话从现在看来半条命2并不优秀，很普通的射击手感，剧情还不错，游戏界面一般般，给人一种这只是个用起源引擎做的一款“小游戏”(steam上有一些好玩的多人游戏是起源引擎做的，所以开始界面都很相似）\n这画质放在现在来看也是非常不错的的，特别是水。而我最喜欢半条命2的一点是它没有cg动画，要知道现在的游戏都是过一段时间就放段cg动画给你讲诉剧情是什么，而半条命2是怎么样的呢，我在听npc讲剧情的时候是可以随意走动的，很自然的。特别是开始时的教程，跟半条命1完全不一样，游戏开始的时候我们的弗里曼逃亡的时候代入感太强了。在游玩中我不仅感受到了当地社会的黑暗还感受到了只有弗里曼才能拯救17号城市，弗里曼是英雄是救世主！而我就是戈登弗里曼，没错我能拯救17号城市，他们需要我的帮助！玩了这么多的游戏，只有半条命是最让我觉得我是主角的游戏了(又是一个8会说话的）。 \n  中文配音非常不错\n  半条命2为什么优秀\n 在04年你居然可以在游戏中钻通风管道，可以在游戏中看到如此真实的水面，在游戏中看到特别真实的物理引擎，还能体会到很不错的剧情\n 现在回到2019，优秀的fps难道就没有吗？\n不！而且还有很多，我觉得我们已经不需要半条命3了\n现在优秀的fps比半条命2更好，有着更好的画质，更好的射击手感 剧情和新玩法\n不是半条命2不好，而是越来越多的“半条命2\"出现了\n“他们”就是玩家们所谓的“半条命3”","timestamp_created":1520089277,"timestamp_updated":1554143433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514521777629852295","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40536449","author":{"steamid":"76561198207544444","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1520080818},"language":"turkish","review":"<3","timestamp_created":1520088008,"timestamp_updated":1520088008,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40534683","author":{"steamid":"76561198345931233","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1622247226},"language":"latam","review":"Muy
