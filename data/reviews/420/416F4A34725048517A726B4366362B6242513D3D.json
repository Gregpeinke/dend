As such, you might be hoping that it's really, really good as a result.\n\nWell, THANK GOODNESS. It's actually worth the play. The worst part of Half-Life 2: Episode Two is when you have to play Episode One to bridge to it from HL2. Episode Two isn't perfect, but there's plenty of fun, and more than enough tension to go around.\n\nIt starts off with a good sudden WHAM moment, and then loses appeal for awhile as you crawl through endless caverns brimming with Antlions. Because after Episode 1, what players really craved was MORE Antlions. It gets better near the end of the caverns, when you find yourself being chased screaming from tunnel to tunnel by the Antlion Guardian. It's the beginning of a series of tense moments that this installment delivers so very, very well.\n\nOver the course of the game, you'll do a fair share of driving, have a large-scale shootout from an abandoned inn, and blow up something around a dozen Striders (which can be a highlight or a detriment, depending on how you are at that section). There are some great sequences, some great plot, and you get the Antlions out of the way early on so you have the rest of the game open for fun! All of this in an episodic installment that's longer than a lot of full-price modern shooters.","timestamp_created":1369650664,"timestamp_updated":1394004049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532163739204406738","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2863479","author":{"steamid":"76561198013751960","num_games_owned":483,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":509,"last_played":1369119600},"language":"russian","review":"Просто супер, но вот концовка...
