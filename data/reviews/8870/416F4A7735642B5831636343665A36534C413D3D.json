The game has a beutiful enviorment with a very immersive setting of the early 20th century, only its in the sky. Obviously since this game is in the early 20th century, there is a lot of racial prejudice and mistreatment of those in the lower class. Elizabeth definitely gave off the personality of a young girl who was kept away from the world and is completly unaware of the darkness that looms around it. The game ultiamately gets a 10/10 for introduction, but as for the rest of the game. Well that is another story.\n\nAnd now for the negative. Why does this game only allow you to have two weapons to be held at a time? I like how with the plasmids (I know the game doesn't them that but still thats what they are) can be switched between 2 of them with the push of single  button, rather than cycling through all your plasmids just to get the one you need than back to your favorite. But why was this not fully applied to weapons? Why the two weapon only restriction? \n\nNot only did the two weapon limit irratate me, but I found myself only using the carbine and sniper rifle. The main reason why was because the enviorment was mostly open area rather than close cramp hallways and rooms in the first two bioshock games. Add on to the fact they are very accurate and easy to get headshots with, I ended up using just these two weapons. It furstrated me even further knowing the fact that these are the most effective weapons, yet enemies almost never had ammo for them. But that was mostly no big deal, because Elizabeth the human pack mule had ammo ready for me when I needed it.\n\nWether you like this game or not, you cannot deny that Elizabeth was being more of a pack mule rather than somebody we needed to rescue and escort out of the city. She literally supports you in every area, low on ammo? Elizebeths got you covered. Almost dead? Elizebeths has plenty of healthkits to spare (not like she is any danger :P).  As the game went on I started to care less and less about her since she really isn't in any danger (Like seriously they don't even try to take her or something like the little sisters in bioshock 2), in the end I viewed her as a packmule, but she somehow still managed to reatain that confused and unsure personality which kept me interested in her, that is until the song bird died.\n\nRemember when I said the enviorment was beutiful? It is but most likely like me you will ignore it while killing waves of enemies. Most of the time you will be shooting enemies with guns or ones that sucide charge you. And sometimes you face enemies that use rockets or enemies with raven or fire power. Now of coarse I was more interested in fighting the handymen, these guys were supposed to replace big daddies, big shame you only fight like 3-4 of them and they felt like bullet sponges that jump at you. And as for the song bird, guess what? YOU DON'T FIGHT HIM! Why? I will never know\n\nLastly the ending. Let me summurize it in four words, \"WHAT IS GOING ON\"? The ending left me more confused and dissapointed then assasins creed 3's ending. How is booker and comstock one and the same? How was he conned out of his own daughter? Since when did Elizabeth become so knowledgeable about everything, did that paper that future Elizabeth hand you do something to her? In the burial at sea DLC you play as Elizabeth, sooooo aparently despite completly removing her father from existence she somehow still exists? How? So many questions and none getting answered.\n\nThe game could have been a lot better and hopefully the devs will avoid turning any future bioshock games into Call of duty two weapon shooting gallery.\n\n6/10\n\nP.s I like how you can fully upgrade all of your weapons, well at least the two you will use :P","timestamp_created":1407604389,"timestamp_updated":1408210437,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11616990","author":{"steamid":"76561198016400191","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":760,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":711,"last_played":1408872864},"language":"russian","review":"Великоленый сюжет, великолепная работа дезайнеров, полностью погрузился в игру","timestamp_created":1407603134,"timestamp_updated":1407603134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11616066","author":{"steamid":"76561198044600395","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1408,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1408,"last_played":1404753718},"language":"english","review":"While very good, \"Infinite\" is not an epic or 'Platinum' game.

It is a fantastic experience that propels the player through the narrative with a very convincing agent .. \"a companion\". It is a feast to your eyes in art design and a fantastic experience to be enjoyed on your big screen TV.\n\nThe graphics in this game are great. They aren't technologically akin to something that uses the frostbite engine, but definitely pretty enough. The art is the true sight to behold. The first time the player witnesses columbia, the city in the clouds, it is a wonder to behold. The attention to detail is impressive and shows the true passion of the developers. They have definitely upped their game above what they achieved in the other bioshock games. Sound design is also fantastic. The guns feel powerful and the vigors give a true sense of accomplishment with the right level of impact.\n\nThe greatest achievement in this game however is the companion: Elizabeth. She is a wonderful companion in battle. Unlike other games where players are forced to protect their companions, Elizabeth actually can take care of herself. Although, a closer examination reveals that the game's AI do not actively persue elizabeth and are more interested in hunting the player down. The biggest advantage of having Elizabeth as a companion is that she provides useful resources in the heat of battle. Even outside engagements, she can find hidden objects and point them out to the player. Very useful when you are looking for \"lockpicks\".\n\nHowever, not enough can be said about the game's story. While a plot twist was definitely seen coming, the true reveal of the word \"INFINITE\" only becomes apparent at the very end. This is the true purpose to play the game. The ending in this game is a thought provoking experience that few have ever matched. It gives a sense of closure and satisfaction. However, the post credits scene was very reminiscent of \"Inception\".\n\nIn summary, this game is a great shooter experience for anyone who enjoys first person shooters, but it beckons anyone who is actually interested in story-telling in games. In a time when sequels have become the norm, this is the first game that has truly managed to connect everything in a truly convincing cohesive universe which will \"blow your mind\".\n\ngraphics: 8/10\nsound: 9.2/10\ngameplay: 9/10\nreplayabilityl: 6/10\n\nMUST BUY.

For example in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim(great game) moving my character had lag. I didn't have any of this in BioShock Infinite. The weapons were all unique and different, but the real fun is in the salts. I don't know of many games that allow you to shoot vicious crows out of your hands to devour your enemies. A somewhat disappointing aspect to the gameplay is the inability to go back to previous places, although it would have probably felt out of place to go backwards. More minor disappointments include the removal of ammo types, and the inability to carry more than two guns at once, however, one could easily argue that these changes are necessary in this particular game. Like previous BioShock titles, I had a lot of fun searching for hidden items that either contribute to helping my character or provide elaborate details on the plot and the city. Overall, the whole gameplay experience was very pleasing.\n\nStory: 10/10\nThis game tells a complex, immersive, deep, and meaningful tale about politics, racism, and religion; family, companionship, and abuse; and perhaps most importantly, choices, consequences, and redemption. It contains some of the most real, lifelike characters I have ever seen in a work of fiction, and when the game was over, I didn't know what to do with myself (well, that's not true; I simply started the game again). The fact that you get a first-person perspective on this story makes it all the more awe-inspiring. \n\nGraphics: 10/10\nBioShock Infinite has some of the best graphics I have seen to date. With that being said, it's not just the quality of the graphics that makes this game so visually appealing. The whole immersive environment is full of bright colors with dark undertones. Even though this game takes place in a completely different environment than the original BioShock, I can definitely tell that it is part of the same series. The developers really went above and beyond when connecting the game's setting to the actual graphics. For example, a city in the sky would see much more clouds than a city down to Earth, right? Well when certain events that call for suspense appear in gameplay, it might be accompanied by an ominous fog. At other times, the sun might be out, and it's as bright as a western. You can tell that genuine artists worked on this game. \n\nSound: 10/10\nWhile there are so many aspects that go into the sound of a video game, perhaps the most noticeable was the voice acting. These actors poured their hearts out into their roles. Without getting into detail and spoiling it for everyone, there are parts in the game where I can tell the voice actor/actress is actually crying while recording his/her voice. There is something about the way these actors tackle their role that makes their characters seem so hauntingly real. A less noticeable aspect (but just as important) is the music. The soundtrack for this game sounds like a professional movie soundtrack. The music is a perfect accompaniment to the characters and events that it compliments. Seriously, I don't know how this game manages to do so well in EVERY ASPECT. Just as a side note, the Songbird sounds awesome.\n\nPlay Time/Replayability: 9/10\nIt took me about 16 hours to beat this game on my first run through, which some say is too short. However, adding more play time to the game would dilute the game as a whole. If someone wants to sit down and play hours upon hours of video games, there are games like Halo and Call of Duty. BioShock Infinite has a bit more class. With that being said, it does have a great deal of replayability such as 1999 mode for the hardcore gamer looking for a challenge. Overall, I didn't mind that the game was a bit shorter than average, because I was so satisfied with what I got. \n\nArtistic Direction: 10/10\nThis is where the game REALLY shines the brightest. Everything about this game contributes to its status as a work of art and literature. All throughout the game there are characters, posters, or even structures, artfully placed to show the dark and sometimes racist intentions of the people of Columbia, trying to create a utopia. BioShock Infinite picks its themes and sticks to them. Perhaps the most memorable aspect of this game is the recurring hymn, \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\". This song has a subtle presence at important moments all throughout, whether it is sung, hummed, or even fit into the game's music. This hymn perfectly relates to the plot and characters of BioShock Infinite. Without spoiling anything, it deals with breaking the repetition of events, fixing mistakes, and thus finding redemption. \n\nFinal Comments:\nThis is the best game I have played in a LONG time. This game shows everyone else in the video game industry the right way to make a sequel. The bottom line (literally) is that a great deal of thought and care went into making this breathtaking masterpiece, and it shows.","timestamp_created":1407343942,"timestamp_updated":1537806395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11576832","author":{"steamid":"76561198099866563","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1094,"last_played":1407344402},"language":"english","review":"What if somewhere over space and time, there exist another version of you ? different , yet the same.. all which is a subject to relativeness of \"constant and variables\" .

Проходится, можно сказать, на одном дыхании. Хоть и есть немногочисленные мелкие недостатки, но они быстро забываются, так как преимуществ в этой игре намного больше.\nКак по мне, лучшее достоинство этой игры - атмосфера, которая также была на высоте и в предыдущих частях серии. Об атмосфере этой игры можно рассуждать долго. Лично я очень долго проходил BioShock Infinite, потому что большую часть времени просто ходил по городу, так как он проработан до мелких деталей, которые невозможно оставить без внимания.\nПри первых минутах игры сразу обращаешь внимание на то, что в Колумбии всё сделано в стиле викторианской эпохи с элементами стимпанка. Абсолютно всё заточено под эту эпоху: начиная с архитектуры зданий, одежды людей, их поведения и используемого оружия, заканчивая музыкой, едой и разными мелкими бытовыми предметами.\nТакже педы не ходят всё время только по своему прописанному маршруту, как в других играх. Они постоянно о чём-то разговаривают, сидят, развлекаются или занимаются своими делами, как обычные прохожие.\nИ саундтрек создатели подобрали на славу. Он прекрасно дополняет атмосферу того времени.\nДумаю, все согласятся, что ещё одним большим плюсом этой игры является девушка Элизабет, которая сопровождает нас до конца. Немало людей работали над её созданием, и стоит заметить, она проработана не хуже, чем весь город. Про внешность много слов говорить не нужно: она понравится почти каждому геймеру, поигравшему в Infinite. Что касается характера Элизабет: над его созданием работали психологи, и поработали очень неплохо. Видно, как Элизабет меняется в течение игры: из домашней девочки, видевшей всё через розовые очки, и знавшей обо всём только через книги, она превращается в серьёзного человека, познавшего реальный мир со всей его грязью.\nВсё в совокупности даёт очень хорошее впечатление об игре. Всем её рекомендую.","timestamp_created":1407335984,"timestamp_updated":1407336112,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506394445896148682","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11575202","author":{"steamid":"76561198113614370","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1532,"last_played":1462941806},"language":"english","review":"If you're a fan of the Bioshock universe then this is an absolute must for you.
