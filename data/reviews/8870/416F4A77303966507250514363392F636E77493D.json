和战地3这样的成熟的fps，生化奇兵对fps的设计却仍然十分的生硬初级。当然即便是在2013年前者仍是妥妥的头部制作公司，所以平心而论，当年生化奇兵：无限交了一份美术与世界观令人惊艳，游戏系统差强人意的答卷。而放在2020的时间点上，在无论是fps还是各种时空类作品都泛滥的时代，这部作品能带给我惊喜的就只有那如烟火般一闪而过的天空乌托邦。","timestamp_created":1599414698,"timestamp_updated":1599414698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498480260372161865","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75553151","author":{"steamid":"76561199025664405","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1339,"last_played":1601478471},"language":"spanish","review":"Este

By the end of the story you get a feel for who Booker is and what he's like especially towards Elizabeth. \nThe gameplay is very solid and fast paced which was really great and allowed for some tense fights throughout the game.\nThe game runs seamlessly on my system and is very smooth and i feel could run well even on some older hardware.\nGreat pickup game for the price I'd definately recommend it to anyone looking for some fun and love the Bioshock series.","timestamp_created":1599391080,"timestamp_updated":1599391080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.39667820930480957","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75534634","author":{"steamid":"76561198040047887","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":622,"last_played":1599081273},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is hugely popular, so I wanted to try it myself. I had played the first Bioshock quite a long time ago, and I liked it a lot. However, I have to say Bioshock Infinite just didn't do the trick for me, although that might be down to a question of taste.\n\n[b]World[/b]\nWhile there are a lot of different things in the world of Bioshock Infinite, I find they do not always go very well together. The best example of this are the powers you can use in battle. There doesn't seem to be any theme binding them together, or to the world they belong to, and they just seem to be a bunch of powers that someone thought would be cool to have. Also, why is the protagonist the only one using them, when they seem to be available everywhere? That doesn't make sense.\nThe setting is basically a satire of religious extremism, capitalism, and also revolutions. It didn't do much for me, but that's entirely a question of taste. \n\n[b]Story[/b]\nThat's probably Bioshock Infinite's strong suit. I found it interesting and well written (the voice acting is very good, too). And without spoiling anything, I liked the ending quite a lot. \nHowever, the story is also a bit \"all over the place\" most of the time, with crazy supernatural things happening all the time, so you have to be willing to go with the flow for it to work.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThis is basically a FPS with some special powers. Those powers are imo unremarkable, as they all  seem to have mostly the same end result (incapacitating the targets for some time). Apart from that, it's really just a classic FPS with an annoying limit on carrying 2 weapons, with none of the special horror atmosphere that the first Bioshock is known for. \nThe one thing I really liked about the fights is your companion Elizabeth, who is far from being a useless \"escort mission\" NPC, and will often throw you ammunitions and other things just in the nick of time. I thought that was a cool feature, and it works well with the story since Elizabeth is centre to it.\n\nAll in all, I would only recommend this game to someone who is interested mostly in the story, and has a liking for the game's setting.","timestamp_created":1599386789,"timestamp_updated":1599386789,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524714827537536621","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75534477","author":{"steamid":"76561198841387906","num_games_owned":1929,"num_reviews":218,"playtime_forever":2451,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1147,"last_played":1616606736},"language":"english","review":"After The Ending Your Mind Gonna Blow\nBring us the Girl and Wipe Away the Debt\n\nThis Bioshock Took Risk And Went Out of Rapture and Made ♥♥♥♥ing Good Universe ( Again )\nElizabeth is Best Sidekick Ever In Games\nthat game is masterpiece","timestamp_created":1599386558,"timestamp_updated":1599386558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.442180216312408447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75534037","author":{"steamid":"76561198047455459","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3433,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3380,"last_played":1599477313},"language":"english","review":"Definitely an amazing game just very short and much more linear than its predecessors.

They simply where not up to the task of realizing what they set out to do. For one do not feel obligated to play this game if you have played the last two, it does not relate in any meaningful way to rapture or any of it’s characters, and carries over only some superficial elements. Other than being an overall ok FPS with some semblance of story and a unique setting it has little to offer.\n\nI’ll say as much as I can without spoilers first.\n\nPros:\n- Elizabeth is a well done NPC, which is good considering she sticks around for most of the game. Her personality is not over done, and she isn’t a chore to keep alive, but an asset.\n-The setting is really interesting on the surface, really beautiful at times.\n-a regenerating shield is more fun than managing med kits like in the first game.\n-backtracking does not tend to incur ridiculous amounts of enemies re-spawning \n-there have been other small tweaks to game play that make make it a little more pleasant \n-the main character is a “little” better and more defined, thought it comes at a cost\n-The beginning of the game does a decent job of introducing you to Colombia and giving an idea of the place it is.\n-skylines and steampunky vibes where nice\n\nCons:\n-limiting to 2 guns at a time feels a bit restrictive, and the upgrade system is a bit less interesting/rewarding \n-Salts, the replacement for plasmids are pretty underwhelming.\n-Salts are also never really explained, and are virtually never used by any enemies\n-Enemies on the whole are quite boring and with a couple exceptions, don’t really change through the game.\n-Vaguely speaking, the story was a mess that borrows to heavily from bioshock 2 in all the wrong ways\n-the game lacked any puzzle elements and had less opportunity for strategic play\n-most of the antagonists are less interesting than the ones from prior games\n-The game tried to tackle far to many concepts at once and ultimately stumbled over itself in doing so, failing to do even one of them with any level of depth or impact.\n-much of the lore is tucked in unvoiced text within literal slideshows\n-The horror aspect of the previous games is also forfeit for most of the game.\n-Elizabeth seems unrealisticly sociable for a total shut in \n-The race angle feels forced and undeveloped, and didn’t really impact the plot\n\nBut to really understand where the game fell short I must go into heavy spoilers here:\n\n\tImagine trying to put quantum mechanics, parallel universes, time travel, multiple versions of the same character, false memories, a mentally ill main character, and a reality altering side character all into one story. Truly it would take an absolute master of writing to integrate any more than 2 of these concepts competently into a story. So it is not a surprise to me they failed to do so.\n\n\tFor most of the story you are left utterly in the dark to the extent of Elizabeth’s powers, and the reversal of death serves to remove any weight from your own actions, and the actions of others. The game simply refuses to address any sort of paradox or logical consistency, and any questions that are asked and hand waved with “quantum mechanics” and “it just is”. Some might say being unable to understand is the point, but that comes across as lazy to me. One could write an essay picking apart every inconsistency you will face, but it would be a waste of space here.\n\n\tYour decisions only have superficial impact, which is not an issue in itself, but was a regression made likely because alternate endings would expose the poor foundation the whole plot was built on. They just throw enough twists and call backs (which they do well) to make it seem as if there is a grand underpinning (which they do poorly). \n\n\tIt’s really hard to call it anything less than a mess, they could have had a very good story sticking with just a few of the elements they wanted to tackle. time spent explaining quantum mumbo jumbo could have developed the VOX and class division, or time spent the almost secondary story of the VOX could have gone to driving home the impact of going through tears on Booker.\n\n\tI would personally recommend Prey over this game to anyone. It has it’s own, similar issues but Surpasses in almost almost every way.","timestamp_created":1599381028,"timestamp_updated":1599381028,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587799668312072754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75528984","author":{"steamid":"76561198132173474","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1138,"last_played":1599377992},"language":"schinese","review":"难受","timestamp_created":1599378442,"timestamp_updated":1599378442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75528007","author":{"steamid":"76561198115669942","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":448,"last_played":1599375211},"language":"spanish","review":"Obra

El jugador asume la identidad de Booker DeWitt, un ex agente de la Agencia Nacional de Detectives Pinkerton que fue despedido de la misma por un comportamiento inaceptable. Es contratado por unos personajes misteriosos, dándole a conocer la ubicación de Columbia, una ciudad suspendida en el aire en la cual se le da la tarea de encontrar a una mujer llamada Elizabeth. Al llegar a Columbia, Booker se entera de que tras la fachada de distopía en realidad es una ciudad racista, xenófoba y extremadamente patriota a niveles religiosos controlada por el Padre Comstock.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nBioShock Infinite es un FPS con diversos elementos de juego de rol, aunque si debo mencionar que la mecánica de Shooter es mucho mayor en este título que en los pasados, olvidando un poco el tema de la estrategia y siendo mucho más vertiginoso. Para balancear esto, en esta ocasión solo podremos llevar dos armas a la vez y se le da más énfasis al uso de “Vigorizadores” que vienen a sustituir a los “Plásmidos” de la entrega pasada. Estas son pociones que nos darán habilidades especiales como utilizar fuego, manejar una parvada de cuervos o poder lanzar rayos a los enemigos, entre otros. Nada ejemplifica mejor este sistema de combate vertiginoso que el uso de Skylines que es un sistema de rieles al más puro estilo Ratchet & Clank en las cuales puedes colgarte y te da una mayor libertad durante las balaceras y la facilidad de cambiar de posición para emplear una nueva estrategia durante el combate.\nUna queja a los Vigorizadores es que a diferencia de los Plásmidos que se usaban para completar un aspecto narrativo en  la trama de los primeros juegos, en esa ocasión están ahí porque si no fuera de esta forma el juego no podría llamarse BioShock. La desconexión a esto es tanto que los enemigos normales como la policía y los ciudadanos de Columbia ni los usan ni nada. Solamente los enemigos especiales, ósea los Handyman que vienen siendo los Big Daddys en esta ocasión y una especie de George Washington Mecanizado utilizan dichos Vigorizadores. \nElizabeth es de lejos lo mejor de este juego. El equipo de desarrollo logro hacer que una acompañante controlada por la IA no se sintiera como una carga sino como algo viva. Elizabeth se siente genuinamente como una compañera y no como “la damisela en apuros” ya que ella no se queda de brazos cruzados mientras tú haces todo el trabajo y es que durante el combate y el gameplay en general te estará brindando apoyo. Durante tu partida ella te otorgara munición, vida y sales, sin mencionar que te dará pistas sobre varios secretos en el mapa además de que si le das el número adecuado de ganzúas te abrirá ciertas puertas en las cuales podrás encontrar “Voxafonos” que son grabaciones de voz que nos cuenta más del Lore del juego y “Kinescopios” los cuales reproducen una película muda y narran más de la historia del lugar. A estos dos se le suma las distintas vestimentas aleatorias que podemos usar y que nos brindan beneficios varios como una onda de choque al aterrizar de un Skyline o incendiar a los enemigos cuando los golpeas. Todo esto gracias a Eliabeth (como no amarla). Ya en combate es donde nuestra querida acompañante muestra todo su potencial y es que podemos usar sus poderes como una especie de “control de zona” al crear agujeros en la realidad e invocar distintos artilugios que nos darán ventaja durante el combate como una barricada que nos protege de las balas, charcos de agua para conducir electricidad, torretas e incluso tu propio George Washington Mecanizado. \n\n[h1] Aspecto Técnico, Gráfico y Sonoro [/h1]\nA diferencia del primer BioShock donde nos adentrábamos en una ciudad submarina llena de oscuridad y un ambiente algo gótico, en esta ocasión nos topamos con un ambiente más abierto coloreado por un cielo color vainilla y rojizo que incita al jugador a querer explorar todo el lugar. La estética retro de estirpe Americana te da la sensación de visitar un lugar que existe en la vida real y eso sumado al Soundtrack es una verdadera gozada. El sonido ambiente te da la sensación de que Columbia esta viva. Las primeras horas de juego donde puedes turistear la ciudad a tu gusto y visitar cada puesto, tienda y la feria la verdad si te llega a dar la sensación de que estas celebrando el 4 de Julio.\nEn el apartado técnico el juego corre de maravilla y durante mi partida no tuve ningún bug o error. Mencionar que el juego me corrió con FPS estables en todo momento y con la configuración gráfica a tope.\n\n[h1] Calificación y Valor de Compra [/h1]\nBioShock Infinite sucede antes de los acontecimientos del primer BioShock y no esta confirmado si sucede en el mismo universo, por ende el juego es accesible a todo público. BioShock es sinónimo de calidad, de narrativa bien construida y de Gameplay pulido. El juego como todo no se salva de pequeños detalles pero son eso, pequeños. La experiencia completa es tan satisfactoria que vas a rejugar este juego incontables veces y llevarla en tu memoria para siempre. Califico a BioShock Infinite con un 9.3/10 EXTREMADAMENTE RECOMENDABLE.","timestamp_created":1599246892,"timestamp_updated":1599246892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.739592850208282471","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75440591","author":{"steamid":"76561199020630320","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":509,"last_played":1599243254},"language":"turkish","review":"oyun sıkıcıydı tek yaptığım şey etrafta adam kesmek felandı hikayesi bir şey anlatıyor mu belli değil beğenmedim","timestamp_created":1599243377,"timestamp_updated":1619469030,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75440476","author":{"steamid":"76561198109846961","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":956,"last_played":1600626041},"language":"brazilian","review":"good game ever","timestamp_created":1599243282,"timestamp_updated":1599243282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75434256","author":{"steamid":"76561198360381074","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":425,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":425,"last_played":1599235700},"language":"schinese","review":"Are you afraid of god？\ni'm afraid of you\n人生若只如初见，何事秋风悲画扇。","timestamp_created":1599235799,"timestamp_updated":1599282661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75429216","author":{"steamid":"76561198303585897","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1056,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":261,"last_played":1599667070},"language":"schinese","review":"qq","timestamp_created":1599229992,"timestamp_updated":1599229992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75429035","author":{"steamid":"76561198994832838","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":913,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":913,"last_played":1599229173},"language":"schinese","review":"如此美妙的剧情，上等佳作。","timestamp_created":1599229785,"timestamp_updated":1599229785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75428083","author":{"steamid":"76561198969575164","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":678,"last_played":1636907815},"language":"schinese","review":"  先送上一句卧槽吧，这才是游戏.\n  因为对游戏并没有特别的了解，所以打到结局的时候我还是懵的，我看着一个个伊丽莎白把我摁在水里，然后屏幕沉静下去的时候，我的心却久久未曾平静——就像是血液突然间停滞流动一样，我的思维还带着惯性往前思考着，然后被停滞的血红细胞往后一拽，以至于包含思绪的头皮都发麻了。\n  我终于明白大家一致评价的第九艺术的高峰是从何而来了，这样的剧情，这样的画面融合度可以说无与伦比。尽管我是一路平推过去的，几乎没有太多的与npc进行对话，对于前期的剧情并没有太多了解，但是当最后一幕就这样突兀的出现在我眼前的时候，我想我是绝对爱着这样一个游戏的，是爱着这样的伊丽莎白的。","timestamp_created":1599228617,"timestamp_updated":1599228617,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75425267","author":{"steamid":"76561199000487741","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2933,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2933,"last_played":1576666623},"language":"schinese","review":"我还记得我在玩巫师三血与酒的时候，有人问我巫师3和生化奇兵无限哪个是第九艺术的代表，我直接告诉他是后者。","timestamp_created":1599225118,"timestamp_updated":1599225118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw09fPrPQCc9/cnwI="}
