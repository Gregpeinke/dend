Короче, 10  из 10. Цепляет под конец игры. Забавная концовка. Очень даже. На последней трудности игралось простовато. Буду пробовать 1999 мод. \n\nСоветую всем пройти игру хоть один раз.\n\nА теперь серьёзно. Я читал все рецензии прежде, чем запустить игру. Говорили, что игра сравнима с книгой, которую можно листать/читать бесконечно. Друзья, сюжет и вправду хорош, но возводить игру на небеса мне не шибко охота. Да, отличное кино. Да, неплохая пострелушка. Это сложно объяснить, но почему то желания листать эту \"книгу\" не охота. Почему? Я не знаю, что сказать. Я немного зол за однообразность геймплея, но доволен за подачу сюжета. Я зол за некоторые баги, но доволен за великолепное окружение и проработку локаций. И тут я разрываюсь на две части: ругать или любить игру? Я присяду, пожалуй, посередине. И всё-таки она хватает, но и раздражает не меньше.\n\n\nP.S. Кстати, концовка не такая уж и сложная.

I could not for the life of me put this one down and I even lost my job after I didn't show up for a week because I was hooked (totally kidding but I did drop every other game I've been playing for this one). I completed Infinite's main game in just over 22 hours and even though that is a little short considering the MSRP, it is still worth the price. To be honest, in no way did I like the first 2 but everything about Infinite just absorbs you (like a Downy paper towel, the quicker picker upper). On a serious note, yes, this does touch on the sensative subject of racisim but you must play through it to fully understand why they did it. \n\nThis one is 'Highly recommended!!!'\n\n*The DLCs are a major disappointment in everyway. First you have brilliantly done main game, then they charge you more money for 3 additional peices of content. First, you get a wave shooter mode, which was actually kinda fun but it's just waves of enemies. Next you have Episode 1 - this was a prequel DLC and done the same shooter style as 1 and 2. As I previously stated, I really am not a fan of 1 or 2. Regardless, I still thought this was mildly okay, though it was only 3 hours long. The last DLC is Episode 2 - which is all stealth mission. They throw in some horror elements as well, and they are done okay, but it get old after a while. I like that the developers were try to do something different with the game play but this missed the mark as the epidsode feels like it drags on more than it needs to... kind of like filler to make up for episode 1. \n\nShame, that this had to feel like I'm supersizing my meal at McDonalds. (BTW - anyone eat there anymore?)

Sense of place! Immersion! Colors! Yadda yadda. Yes it is very good, and you probably heard some of that before.\n\nSomething i dislike though are the combat mechanics. Using the vigors ('spells' which grant you the ability to, for example, stun enemies, set up traps, turn enemies into allies, etc.) in combination with FPS-typical gunplay (shotguns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers and so on) to deal with enemies is fine, but my experience is (playing with a mouse and keyboard on hard difficulty), that the combat just isn't balanced enough. I dislike that the game rewards a rather defensive approach (In favor of 'realism'? Notice how I put that word in quotes. As in being ironic.). Gunplay suffers from underusage of certain guns which are not leveled due to resource shortage (in favor of 'choices'..).\n\n\nYou can't really dare to go out into an open space, guns blazing and shooting lightning (or crows!) from your fingertips, because the AI hits instantly no matter what, i guess it's the fault, or rather, due to the success of games like Call Of Duty that this is the current state of FPS-combat mechanics, which i find to be boring and stale. You can't, or better won't, make use of all the cool stuff at your disposal, if it is more rewarding / safe to sit crouched into a corner, burried behind some box and wait until enemies come to you one by one.. \n\nThere is barely any flow in combat situations (at least on hard difficulty)! You are sitting somewhere! Sitting! What is this, a sitting simulator?\n\nNot my idea of exciting combat. You can turn down the difficulty to normal or easy to make more use of the crazy stuff, but that isn't challenging either. On hard difficulty it becomes stale and tedious. If you try to tear up the place, you get instant-hit-punishment to the face. It feels unfair, and with the options given, there isn't an optimal solution to fix that.\n\nI don't get why the combat, with the exception of crazy lightning-shooting from your hands, has to be so rooted in reality. I mean, the world of Bioshock is not exactly like our world, sure it is similar and that serves as a reference point, but I would like to see some more experimentation in combat mechanics and not just a copy of the WW2- / Modern Military-shooter formula over and over. Although it does not look like it, it is still just that. That plus crazy finger-magic.\nIn case you plan on playing with a controller or are just there to see the sights and enjoy the ride, my advice to you would be to do yourself a favor and play on easy or normal difficulty.\n\nAlso, choices. I like choices. Some choices. Choices that matter. Not some boring gun-leveling- / 'what ability / hat / pantie-color (not in the game.) / whatever do i spend my money on now?'-choices. Give me cool guns which are balanced for a specific point in the game, which already hit as hard as they should, when they should. And don't give me the choice between a gun which i will never pick again, because i did not level it, and a gun which i am more likely to use because i already spent a few bucks on it. That's not a choice that matters, that's not fun, that's bullshit. And i won't replay the game, because i want to see what it would be like if i leveled that gun over the other.. How impactful.. Less of that stuff would have been better, keep it simple.\n\nAll that said, i enjoy games like Quake (QW, Q3, QL), where a +forward style in combination with dodging skills is rewarded, and if you like your Call Of Duty (or similar) you can ignore my rant. Although this game has some other, and, in my opinion unfortunate but lesser flaws, common to action-game-genre (a dissonance between the player's actions and the narrative), I really, really like the game and would recommend it anyway for all the aforementioned positive reasons, though i would have liked the combat to not bore me to tears (or enrage me on hard difficulty when i get punished for my impatience). So, if I had a wish granted for the next Bio- or Whatever-shock game, gameplay-wise, it would be for less instant hit weapons / less meaningless choices / faster gameplay flow.","timestamp_created":1389155904,"timestamp_updated":1389164134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8614839","author":{"steamid":"76561198017340462","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1004,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":599,"last_played":1389106612},"language":"koreana","review":"명작인듯 바이오쇼크 시리즈","timestamp_created":1389155682,"timestamp_updated":1389155682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8614802","author":{"steamid":"76561198026754527","num_games_owned":390,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":815,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":562,"last_played":1568680210},"language":"english","review":"AN AMAZING GAME, JUST BUY IT!","timestamp_created":1389155349,"timestamp_updated":1389155349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8614759","author":{"steamid":"76561198049733085","num_games_owned":649,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":512,"last_played":1399430323},"language":"english","review":"BioShock: Infinite is simply a beautifully designed and developed game.

The graphics are stunning even on the lowest settings, albeit the game requires a lot of power to play. The voice acting and interactions between the two main characters is also amazing. Gunplay is also improved from Bioshock 2. \nHowever, where there are great improvements there are also places where Infinite falls short. The story itself is interesting, but comes to an ending that seems rushed and is unsatisfying and probably leaves more questions than answers. Bioshock 1 and 2's endings weren't very clear cut either, but they weren't as focused upon as the ending here. Also, the game reduces the complexity of plasmids and guns. Bioshock 2 improved upon this from Bioshock 1 by leaps and bounds, only to see it fall short in Infinite. Instead of plasmids, ADAM and EVE, you have vigors and salts. But the vigors are not the interesting biology experiments we saw in Rapture, but are just copy and pastes from previous games that don't really play a role in the game's story. Who invented these vigors? What role do they play in Columbia's society? These questions go unanswered, and these questions are needed to draw relations to Rapture and Columbia.  How in the world did something in a city above the sky in the 1910's appear underwater in the 50's? Is ADAM and EVE related to these vigors and salts? We don't know, we're just supposed to go with it. For a game focused so much on the story, so many important elements from the  previous games are left out, copy and pasted with no explanation of how they got there, or badly implemented. \nInfinite doesn't feel like a Bioshock game. If you didn't *MINOR SPOILER* return to Rapture, this game could pass as a game from another series. The whole concept of collecting ADAM to buy new and interesting plasmids is gone. Defending little sisters as they harvest ADAM from dead bodies is gone. Battling Big Daddies and Big Sisters is gone as well. Is this a Bioshock game? And Elizabeth is just a trick. She doesn't do anything until her programming randomly decides you need ammo, money, health, or salts. She claims to search for items, but that's just a lie. I used to think she just opens up one of her tears and finds an item, but the storyline later states such things to be impossible. On a sidenote, the best enemy, The Boys of Silence, only appear for like five minutes. Why? WHY!\nLots of innovations from Bioshock 1 to Bioshock 2 is gone. You can no longer use weapons and vigors at the same time, switching amongst the vigors to make combos is just silly and often times you'll just ignore the vigors. I went the entire game focused on using the gun, because vigors use a lot of salt and do little damage unless you combine them, which is a tedious process. Also, you're only allowed to carry two guns at a time, but don't worry. Run out of ammo and Elizabeth will magically give you more. It just makes no sense. \nFinally, the atmosphere of Rapture is gone. The legend of Rapture, Andrew and Jack Ryan and the Splicers that inhabit it was what made Bioshock so awesome. A dank city that is falling apart, with silent plaster splicers stalking you in the shadows, man, that was what made BioShock Bioshock. Columbia is bright, and the atmosphere is changed. There's only about three times I felt any anxiety, and only one time I was honestly frightened. It's just silly jumpscares. \nRanting aside, Bioshock is an alright game, but not worth the $60 pricetag it was one sold at. If possible, try to nag it for $10 or less. The story is a good 7-10 hours, and you may wish to replay once or twice. \nFinal verdict 7/10","timestamp_created":1389131328,"timestamp_updated":1389199312,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8611401","author":{"steamid":"76561198044825482","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":497,"last_played":1477903357},"language":"italian","review":"Grande atmosfera, trama e sceneggiatura.
