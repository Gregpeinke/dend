It's actually a pretty fun game if you can get some people to play, but that's just it, there are plenty of servers but absolutely no players! I enjoy the mechanics of jumping from platform to platform and throwing discs, but there's nobody else to play with, therefore, no competition. It's another deathmatch type game that would be a lot of fun if people still played, however, they don't. It's only because there are no players that I strongly advise you to refrain from purchasing this game unless you plan on playing it on several occasions with a bunch of friends. Definitely not worth the money, the games time has passed.\n-Kyle James","timestamp_created":1491154055,"timestamp_updated":1512957653,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581049799919128418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30871892","author":{"steamid":"76561198156445680","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":91,"last_played":1535621255},"language":"french","review":"Best Game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥","timestamp_created":1491038630,"timestamp_updated":1491038630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30867703","author":{"steamid":"76561198281891803","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":72,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1509824020},"language":"english","review":"way too cheap for my taste this game.\n\n\n11/10 Would Meme again.","timestamp_created":1491020996,"timestamp_updated":1491021097,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30858938","author":{"steamid":"76561198047763390","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":37,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1514675793},"language":"english","review":"I used to play this game every day, for several hours straight.

A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose.[73] The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere.[74] The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes.[75] True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.[76] Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia,[77][78][79][80][81] biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland,[82] remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[33][34]\n\nDuring the Neoproterozoic, 750 to 580 Mya, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed \"Snowball Earth\", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.[83] Following the Cambrian explosion, 535 Mya, there have been five major mass extinctions.[84] The most recent such event was 66 Mya, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as mammals, which then resembled shrews. Over the past 66 Ma, mammalian life has diversified, and several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as Orrorin tugenensis gained the ability to stand upright.[85] This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which allowed the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues today.[86]\n\nPredicted future\nMain article: Future of Earth\nSee also: Global catastrophic risk\nEarth's long-term future is closely tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 Ga, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 Ga by 40%.[87] The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic CO2 cycle, reducing its concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 500–900 Ma.[88] The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, and animal life will become extinct.[89] After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared[90] and the mean global temperature will reach 70 °C[89] (158 °F). From that point, the Earth is expected to be habitable for another 500 Ma,[88] possibly up to 2.3 Ga if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere.[91] Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[92]\n\nThe Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 Ga. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150,000,000 km), which is about 250 times its present radius.[87][93] Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).[87] A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to tidal effects and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[93]\n\nPhysical characteristics\nShape\n\nShape of planet Earth. Shown are distances between surface relief and the geocentre. The South American Andes summits are visible as elevated areas. Data from the Earth2014[94] global relief model.\nMain article: Figure of the Earth\nThe shape of Earth is approximately oblate spheroidal. Due to rotation, the Earth is flattened along the geographic axis and bulging around the equator.[95] The diameter of the Earth at the equator is 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter.[96] Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth's center of mass is the summit of the equatorial Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador.[97][98][99][100] The average diameter of the reference spheroid is 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi). Local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: The maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the Mariana Trench (10,911 metres (35,797 ft) below local sea level), whereas Mount Everest (8,848 metres (29,029 ft) above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%.[n 15]\n\nChemical composition\nSee also: Abundance of elements on Earth\nChemical composition of the crust[102]\nCompound\tFormula\tComposition\nContinental\tOceanic\nsilica\tSiO2\t60.2%\t48.6%\nalumina\tAl2O3\t15.2%\t16.5%\nlime\tCaO\t5.5%\t12.3%\nmagnesia\tMgO\t3.1%\t6.8%\niron(II) oxide\tFeO\t3.8%\t6.2%\nsodium oxide\tNa2O\t3.0%\t2.6%\npotassium oxide\tK2O\t2.8%\t0.4%\niron(III) oxide\tFe2O3\t2.5%\t2.3%\nwater\tH2O\t1.4%\t1.1%\ncarbon dioxide\tCO2\t1.2%\t1.4%\ntitanium dioxide\tTiO2\t0.7%\t1.4%\nphosphorus pentoxide\tP2O5\t0.2%\t0.3%\nTotal\t99.6%\t99.9%\nEarth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 Yg). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[103]\n\nThe most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.[102][103][104]\n\nInternal structure\nMain article: Structure of the Earth\nEarth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity. The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 km (kilometers) under the oceans to 30–50 km for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed.","timestamp_created":1487115907,"timestamp_updated":1487115907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.6345062255859375","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29925623","author":{"steamid":"76561198342531223","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1530377289},"language":"russian","review":"плюсы: +\nминусы: 0\nкак мы видим минусов нет хорошая игра","timestamp_created":1487094939,"timestamp_updated":1487094939,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601449251174926758","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29867008","author":{"steamid":"76561197960590057","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":15,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1491116919},"language":"russian","review":"Старенько, но круто","timestamp_created":1486886260,"timestamp_updated":1486886260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29840611","author":{"steamid":"76561197966885982","num_games_owned":1086,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1389393570},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games on Steam!","timestamp_created":1486795485,"timestamp_updated":1486795485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516354978084564209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29809934","author":{"steamid":"76561198050673410","num_games_owned":2365,"num_reviews":154,"playtime_forever":13,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1486673296},"language":"russian","review":"Футуристическое говно где надо прыгать и в которую играют максимум 4 чела :)","timestamp_created":1486673367,"timestamp_updated":1486673367,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477941185235977173","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29789492","author":{"steamid":"76561198077480743","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":8,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1485546664},"language":"russian","review":"Играл в рикошет еще в школе, тогда только зарождалась эпоха компьютерных клубов.

Ровно через 7 дней выходит Counter-Strike и рвет всем ебальники от крутизны, в отличие от рикошета.\n\nЧто касается игрового процесса, так это все равно что играть в Slither.io. Вам надо полагаться на удачу, и все что происходит зависит от вас лишь на 10%. Все остальные 90% - дело случая.\n\nЭто обыкновенный дезмэтч, но в отличие от всех остальных здесь у вас есть лишь одно оружие - диски, по видимому от циркулярных пил которые ГГ метает скорее всего вундервафле-подобными руками.\n\nКарты также в своем уникальном стиле и чем-то напоминают некоторые части Зена из того же самого Half-Life: это платформы с расположенными на них других джамп-платформ, благодаря которым все люди в игре хаотично прыгают туда сюда, из-за чего попасть хоть в кого-нибудь затруднительно, учитывая что дисками вы можете стрелять только горизонтально.\n\nКстати с разорджека в Unreal можно стрелять не только горизонтально, но и во все стороны по XYZ и рикошетить вылетающие диски будут идеально. И почему нельзя было сделать такое же в рикошете? потому что дело проходит в космосе? Дак смените дизайн! Я серьезно! Все карты в рикошете - платформы с джамппадами расположенные в открытом космосе, сделайте хоть что-то оригинальное!\n\nЕще раз вернусь к игрокам. Попасть хоть в кого-то затруднительно - диск летит только по горизонтали, все игроки хаотично прыгают из стороны в сторону да еще и стреляя при этом. Что мы получаем - сотресенный повсюду воздух дисками, и прыгающие туда-сюда бомжи совершающие киллы лишь рандом шотами. Сука, я играю на сервере где всего 3 человека помимо меня, и я все равно с трудом попадаю в цель, а теперь представьте что каждая карта расчитана на 10 человек. Ну что, обосрались?!\n\nГрафика - единственная хорошая сторона рикошета. Зайдя в игру - это единственно что вам понравится.\n\nЧто касается звукового сопровождения - так все звуки нагло спизженны из Unreal да еще и звучат они менее качественно\n\nДа эта игра просто жопа!  Вы думаете я не знаю что такое стрейф, или падение или прыжок в присяди? ДА ТУТ ВООБЩЕ НЕЛЬЗЯ ПРИСЕДАТЬ ИЛИ ПРЫГАТЬ, из-за чего часто падаешь в пропасти, да и кто интересно додумался удалять возможность прыжка и присяди?\n\nЗдесь вы будете сталкиваться с противниками и просто умирать падая в пропасть. Нормально ли это? Я тоже думаю что это дебилизм, неужели нельзя было отключить коллизию у игроков?\n\nБонусы которые вы здесь встретите совершенно бесполезные. По названию они кажутся весьма полезными для стрельбы дисками, однако эти самые бонусы никак не помогут вам кого-то убить. Почему бы не добавить, к примеру, частичную самонаводку или ТУ ЖЕ САМУЮ СТРЕЛЬБУ ВО ВСЕ СТОРОНЫ??? Эта игра просто куча дрища размазанного по клетке моего попугая!\n\nИ так, тут есть ебанутые диски летящие лишь по горизонтали, много суеты в которой хрен сосредоточишься на игре, прыжка и приседания нет и в помине, однообразные скучные и выблеванные карты, скучный и уже всем надоевший геймплей, бонусы никак не влияющие на игровой процесс и господство рандомшотов - КАК МОЖНО БЫЛО ТАК ЗАСРАТЬ ИГРУ ДА ЕЩЕ И ПРОДАВАТЬ ЕЕ ЗА 129 РУБЛЕЙ?\n\nДА ЭТА ИГРА НЕ ЗАСЛУЖИВАЕТ ДАЖЕ СУЩЕСТВОВАНИЕ НА КАКОМ-НИБУДЬ ЯНДЕКС.ДИСКЕ В ВИДЕ АРХИВЧИКА! ЭТА ИГРА ГРЕБАНОЕ ГОВНО!\n\nИтог: Этой игре нет места в стиме и нет права называться игрой - тупая херня! Такие игры созданны чтобы заставлять вас думать что вы нуб. Что вы не можете элементарно попасть во врага, выполнить стрейф или правильно использовать бонусы.
