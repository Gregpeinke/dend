While I've played the PlayStation port as well as The Orange Box on the Xbox 360 when Hollywood Video still existed. It took me 10 hours to beat Half Life on normal now that I own Half-Life and Half-Life 2 with all the DLC packs finally. \n\nWhile granted I have watched quite a lot of videos about the lore, mechanics, speed-running and everything else to do with both Half-Life titles, that was because of how badly I wanted to experience one of the best game series ever created. I would 100% say that I used tricks and whatnot that I remembered while getting to explore and have fun with the famous momentum kink in the game engine.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game lives up to the hype surrounding the series; The amount of puzzle solving I was doing mid-firefight was insanely fun considering one misplaced step while throwing a grenade, satchel charge and firing a rocket from the rocket launcher can completely kill your run and cause quick F7.\n\n10/10 - Half-Life lives up to the word around the net as well as feeling somewhat refreshing compared to FPS titles currently being played. I honestly would call Half-Life somewhat of a precursor to the \"Looter-Shooter\" genre; At times I felt like I had to back off and sit in a corner to evaluate my ammo and how many enemies I could shoot to pass through an area instead of clearing the area. At one point I even recall long jumping through an entire section with (I don't know the enemy type) armored aliens that have flamethrowers. Basically I enjoyed this title because it was fresh and new to me while also providing me a whole new way to experience not only an FPS game, but also having it blended with puzzles and platforming as well as micromanaging your ammunition and any guards or scientists you're escorting since they love to just stop following you.","timestamp_created":1656488889,"timestamp_updated":1656488889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117842849","author":{"steamid":"76561198879497887","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1216,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1216,"last_played":1658478267},"language":"english","review":"when will full life be released?","timestamp_created":1656485296,"timestamp_updated":1658630067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117842024","author":{"steamid":"76561198308073523","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1656471071},"language":"koreana","review":"1세대 아이폰 쓰는 기분이었다","timestamp_created":1656483866,"timestamp_updated":1656489340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117841384","author":{"steamid":"76561199135557075","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1657041865},"language":"turkish","review":"Çok eğlenceli bı oyun vakit geçirmek için harika","timestamp_created":1656482767,"timestamp_updated":1656482767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117841142","author":{"steamid":"76561199209829739","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":123,"playtime_forever":879,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67,"last_played":1656716425},"language":"english","review":"first got this on the playstation 2, brings back so many memories, such a classic game.","timestamp_created":1656482346,"timestamp_updated":1656482346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117841079","author":{"steamid":"76561199052641966","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":442,"last_played":1656938322},"language":"english","review":"10/10 freeman no voice","timestamp_created":1656482259,"timestamp_updated":1656482259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117841012","author":{"steamid":"76561198857024498","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1636777391},"language":"english","review":"can't play because headcrabs scare me..","timestamp_created":1656482154,"timestamp_updated":1656482154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117841007","author":{"steamid":"76561198807865468","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1483,"last_played":1657150727},"language":"latam","review":"Un clásico instantáneo y el que re-definió el género FPS.
