There are a few servers in Team Fortress Classic that run minigame servers, and while this sounds good on paper, games like Garry's Mod or even Minecraft, have way more stable, fun, and less toxic servers. Another problem this game faces is its age. Because this game came out in 1999, there aren't many people still playing the game. Because of this, you may have a high ping connecting to most servers, as they are most likely in a different region than your own.

Well, this one, Team Fortress Classic, is other of those. This isn't actually the first Team Fortress game, as the original was released for Quake. The original idea was to turn Quake into a team-based game giving different characters a class with different guns and characteristics, allowing fora team-based play. Half Life, being hardly based on Quake's engine, obviously received great versions of classic quake mods, and TFC is one of them. At first, if you have played HL Deathmatch, this game will somewhat feel like Half Life with classes, and it kinda is, but, it adds something totally new to the HL experience, which is team roles. If you are playing a scout, a pyro, or a demoman, you are an agile attacker, and your work is to run and gun (or grenade, or flame). If you are playing as a Medic, while you do have some damage-dealing weapons (such as the awesome nailgun) your main role is that of a, well, medic. You distribute medkits to your allies so that they can recover health (no, you don't have a healing gun like in TF2). Even as a medic, you can still be an effective assassin type character. But the real assassin character is the Spy. He can disguise as an enemy unit and use a knife or gun to bamboozle them. Another type of support/assassin character is the engineer, who can build turrets who annoy and kill your enemies. And then, there are the more specialized damage dealers. The soldier is your standard Quake-style character: he has a rocket launcher, he expldoes people with rockets, and he can rocket jump for extra mobility. The  Sniper is, well, a sniper. In maps such as 2-fort (probably the most popular map), there are very good camping spots for a sniper to deliver precise killing blows. And, obviously, there is my favorite, the Heavy Weapons Guy, or HWGUY as he is called ingame (in TF2 he's called the \"Heavy\"). He has a minigun and a lot of HP, and his job is to act both as sort of a tanker, and as a big damage dealer: if you get in the range of his gun, you're probablly dead. \n\nSo many different classes with their distinct gameplay is what made TFC a classic between classics. Not even Team Fortress 2 manages to be quite as statisfyingly fun as this game for me, for a very simple reason: it feels like Quake in the parts where it needs to feel like quake, such as in the very high skill ceiling, focus on mobility and fast reflexes, yet it also feels very different from quake where it needs to be different: teamwork and different roles to play. Many games such as, obvioulsy, TF2 and Blizzard's new hit, Overwatch, have learned a lot from Team Fortress Classic who will truly always be, the daddy of this whole genre (with QWTF being the grandpa). \n\nALSO IT'S FUCKING CHEAP, BUY IT.","timestamp_created":1498513727,"timestamp_updated":1498513727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580152690410614014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32819863","author":{"steamid":"76561198252025086","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":97,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72,"last_played":1587780562},"language":"russian","review":"Полностью балансный team fortress 2 без шапок и скинов.","timestamp_created":1498492293,"timestamp_updated":1498492293,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508301496505737305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32809617","author":{"steamid":"76561198361828377","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":494,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1596785299},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра,а игроков нет,как так можно вообще(","timestamp_created":1498473766,"timestamp_updated":1498473766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495953768491744995","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32801591","author":{"steamid":"76561198279215849","num_games_owned":314,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1535055462},"language":"english","review":"Good throwback to the good ole' days of chaotic multiplayer fps games, still a surprising amount of players still play this game and 2 or 3 decently full servers can be found, I would recommend this game especially to TF2 fans.","timestamp_created":1498455330,"timestamp_updated":1498455330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561220705509185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32794472","author":{"steamid":"76561198318699649","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":104,"last_played":1602519267},"language":"spanish","review":"que lindo juego de la old school tantos recuerdos","timestamp_created":1498437646,"timestamp_updated":1498437646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.628901660442352295","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32779681","author":{"steamid":"76561198370138662","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1503532326},"language":"english","review":"Talk about a throw-back.  While not quite the Grand-Dadddy of team based shooters, it is a recreation of the Grand-Daddy of team based shooters.  To think that this reincarnation of the game is almost two decades old is amazing.\n\nThis game comes from an age of abstract level design, lag, and ridiculously fast paced action.  With different maps being designed for different team based games.  But, possibly the most popular of all time was Team Capture The Flag, and most likely on the map 2Fort (or if you were a Quake gamer, 2Fort5).\n\nYounger gamers may have a little trouble adapting to the old-school style of online battle...Strafe Shooting and Rocket Jumping, all while piles of Gibs expload all around you. But the fact that almost 20 years later this game is still actively played online gives testament to the amount of fun to be had while playing.  If you want to know what the average gamer spent his entire summer, and every night, playing back in 1999...until he passed out from exhaustion, this is it (or possibly the original Team Fortress).\n\nFor the Older Gamers who wonder whether this is still worth downloading.  As of 25 June, 2017, there were about 6 dozen servers available, with about a dozen of them heavily populated.  I played nonstop in a packed server for 4 hours in one sitting before my old age got the best of me.  If you are looking to play a game you grew up with and loved, this is still a valid option.","timestamp_created":1498409552,"timestamp_updated":1498409552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.694252908229827881","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32778856","author":{"steamid":"76561198199696034","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":13,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1498339137},"language":"english","review":"Maybe

Each character class possesses unique weapons, items, and abilities, as teams compete online in a variety of game play modes\n\nTo me, Team Fortress Classic was unfairly dumped in a bin called “a team-based multiplayer shooter like Counter-Strike only messy and guff.” As I say, I know that’s an unfair comparison, but I stand by thinking the game messy. I never ever joined a Team Fortress Classic server and had a pleasant experience. It was always chaotic; it was always full of conc-jumping wunderkids; I always seemed to pick a class that felt useless; its maps always seemed to result in stalemates around single, narrow chokepoints. I never had fun. Or, well, that’s not true. There was one thing I liked about the game: feign death. The ability to at any point press a button and pretend to be a corpse. Most players would be wise to the trick and would shoot you as you lay prone on the ground, but occasionally you’d experience the wonderful thrill of watching a player walk by you unknowingly. I think I only managed to use that scenario to my advantage a few times, but it was worth it each time. A preview of what the Spy brought as a matter of course to Team Fortress 2. Before you take to the comments to lambast me: I can appreciate that Team Fortress Classic had a lot going for it. I think maybe if I’d been in a clan then I’d have liked it. Sing its praises in the comments if you feel like it. Team Fortress Classic is awesome. There are many different game types you can play on it. You can play a game with two teams where you have to capture the flag. You can play a game where you have to hunt a important person, or you can be one of the people protecting him. There are also games where both teams consist of only snipers. You do need to have the Internet to play the game, but if you are reading this review, then you already have the Internet. This game is worth playing because once you start playing, you can pick it up really easy. If you like team-play and shooting games this is for you. For being an older game TFC (Team Fortress Classic) has very nice graphics. The levels look really good and have been put together very nicely. The teams are easily distinguishable due to their obvious red and blue colors. The guns all look god and most are based of real weaponry, they are tru to form. TFC has everything Counter-Strike(CS) has but even more. The mission of the game is to attack or defend a fort (depending on which team you are). If you are on the attack team you must do your best to invade the fort with your flag. This is no easy task though as the defending team gets high powered weaponry to defend their fort with. Using your skill you need to infiltrate the base through secret passageways or just blasting in the front door guns blazing. The movement is extremely fast, but not out of control, which make the game much more fun and easier t move around without getting blown to pieces. This is purely a multiplayer game so there is a ton of replay value. Just keep playing rounds to improve your skill or play on the different team for some variety, or even try a different type of soldier to be! There is plenty of possibilities.\n","timestamp_created":1496866025,"timestamp_updated":1496866025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":30,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.698044359683990479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32195238","author":{"steamid":"76561198198765459","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":874,"last_played":1502259626},"language":"english","review":"99% Of TF2 players don't even know this old school game.... :( Amen...","timestamp_created":1496654351,"timestamp_updated":1496654351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":138,"votes_funny":34,"weighted_vote_score":"0.745815753936767578","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32189519","author":{"steamid":"76561198351410322","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":460,"last_played":1602218948},"language":"spanish","review":"buen juego aunque tiene una comunidad baja al menos es entretenido y tiene algo que el tf2 no tiene \n\"GRANADASSSSSSSSSS\"","timestamp_created":1496629067,"timestamp_updated":1496629067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.667625844478607178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32167269","author":{"steamid":"76561198169227525","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":90342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":89,"playtime_at_review":44828,"last_played":1660413708},"language":"english","review":"hhhhhhhhhhhh good game","timestamp_created":1496548593,"timestamp_updated":1546060955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653974354267120361","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32150932","author":{"steamid":"76561198178486107","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":387,"last_played":1496857182},"language":"brazilian","review":"Melhor do que o TF2","timestamp_created":1496491500,"timestamp_updated":1496491500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467320263385772705","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32118562","author":{"steamid":"76561198337247138","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1503585194},"language":"english","review":"Team Fortress Classic is a very great game and gave birth to a great franchise.
