is it. \n\nby just adding scripted events and some sort of writing to the linear first person corridor shooter, valve managed to make at least 2 2/3 excellent, timeless video games in this style.\n\nhalf-life, nearly 20 years on holds its own. \nvisually it's not even the best of its time, with tim sweeny's unreal engine already ahead (although probably not as smooth on a machine of that era, but i'm not from that time so correct me if i'm wrong) and whatever the hell 3d realms was tryna do with prey in 1997, that stuff looked nuts.\n\nunreal was a different sort of first person shooter and in a league of its own, taking a very different approach to level design and far more subtle approach to scripted sequences and storytelling. prey didn't come out until 2006, after human head picked up development from 3d realms. half-life could have had less polygons and lower res textues and STILL play as good. valve crafted an experience to soak in, you're just a scientist trying to do your own dang job! \n\nblack mesa is a beautiful place, not a happy one, not a welcoming one. gordon is constantly on the run, he was late to work after all (maybe if that train was faster). but you have to learn the hard way what your employer's true intentions are. thankfully, there's a lot of running to do, jumping as well, black mesa isn't very safe either.\n\nvalve's use of scripted sequences and environmental storytelling is just as strong here is at continued to be until everyone got too addicted to multiplayer games, some things in the world you might already be familiar with, others you will at some point have to be familiar with to survive in the black mesa facility.\n\nthe game runs well on a modified quake 2 engine (shouts out john carmack), and got at least 60fps on a GeForce 2.\nand still works well on a modern system (the framerate cap is there for a reason, elevators and trains do not work well past that limit)\n\nthe game sounds good too, using primitve but characteristic dsp and sample playback, the reverb in the air vents to this day is one of my favorite reverbs.\n\nthe gameplay is at it's core quake with jumping puzzles and scary bits instead of keycards and trent reznor's breathing. between all of the shooting and jumping action there are bit where the world is shown to you. you can take a step back and see the facility, hear from and save the employees (or just blow em to bits too if you want). there's plenty of alien as well military opposition because someone messed up big time. all of the weapons are satisfying, the monsters are all unique and there's even primitive but completely functional ai.\n\n\nblack mesa is a place i will be visiting again soon.\nyou should visit black mesa too.\n\nvalve's crowning achievement\ni still wonder who is responsible for this mess\n\n(also avaliable for sony's playstation 2 and a complete build for the dreamcast version is

It has well made cutscenes where the player assumes complete control, and the voicing to go with it matches well. This immersion is a major moot for the game. The combination of combat and puzzle solving is a great duo. There were hard parts though where I didn't know where to go or fighting was a bit too cheap. Some enemies are easy, some are tougher, and there are boss type characters that challenge players. Still with some difficult parts, Half-Life is a game of shining merit. The weapons are well designed, along with the maps. Contrast between Black Mesa and Xen great, with the clash between normal science, military, and alien themes.
