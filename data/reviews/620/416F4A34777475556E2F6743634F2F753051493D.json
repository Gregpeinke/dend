my favorite game of all time, and probably my favorite piece of entertainment as a whole. The gameplay and controls have been perfected to a tee, the visuals are still amazing, the story is a perfect continuation of Portal, and the humor is spot-on. Portal was always more about the comedy than the puzzles, and Portal 2 delivers that same hilarious experience in spades. Every single line of dialogue in this game is perfectly written, planned, and delivered. The multiplayer co-op is especially funny with GLaDOS commenting on the two players' inherit inability to actually cooperate.\n\nTL;DR: But this game. Right now. ESPECIALLY if it's on sale.

As a result Portal 2 looks older to me.\n\nHaving said that Portal 2 is still a superior game. It's longer, more dynamic, more engaging and can boast about its co-op mode. I feel like I've co-oped this title and absolutely almost completely don't remember doing so.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, possibly because you're way younger than I, Portal 2 is even more shooting doors at walls, placing blocks on buttons and figuring out how to get from one end of a chamber to another. It tells a story about company oppression and ruthless experiments but all of that is basically filler that poses as an excuse to have you move room to room.\n\nMy brain tells me that Portal was some sort of tack-on after Half-Life experiment that people loved. Portal 2 was then a whole game Valve released to recognize they were onto something. Then there was Half-Life 2. Then Valve basically gave up making games in favor of raking in billions of dollars by virtually selling games all over the planet. You'd think there would be room for both making games and selling games and - outside of Alyx which I think it's called and haven't played - that would basically be a no. Half-Life 3? Probably eventually, but likely not from Valve.\n\nSo yeah, if you haven't tried it but like the concept and want a piece of pre-Steam gaming history give Portal 2 a whirl. Still, also try Portal. Both are worth the investment practically for the closing credits alone. Let the attraction to the puzzle solving door gun mechanism gauge for you how much you should spend here.","timestamp_created":1616017049,"timestamp_updated":1621475501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526749014854431152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88609052","author":{"steamid":"76561199013158336","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":230,"last_played":1620535760},"language":"english","review":"it's gud","timestamp_created":1616015594,"timestamp_updated":1616015594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88608951","author":{"steamid":"76561199086169912","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1572,"last_played":1630962693},"language":"english","review":"It's portal 2.
