Portal intrigued me the most; it was unlike anything I had ever seen before; a puzzle-based first-person shooter featuring a gun that makes interconnected portals. I remember fully wanting to get the game on my Xbox 360 around the time of the Perpetual Testing Initiative's release, unaware that the console versions didn't have it. I was disappointed at first, but that disappointment quickly dissipated after playing through the campaign for the first time.\n\n(SPOILERS INBOUND)\n\nThe main campaign begins with Chel, the protagonist from the original Portal game, being woken up by Wheatley, a personality core that is frankly a little dim-whited. After breaking open a \"docking station\" wall, you find yourself hopping through some of the old test chambers from the first game. You eventually have access to the single-Portal gun, and begin going around the facility, eventually arriving at GLaDOS's chamber, where she is still dead. Eventually, Wheatley accidentally wakes her up and sends you through some new test chambers, obtain the Dual-Portal Gun and come accross new puzzle elements, like lazers, special redirection cubes, light bridges and meet up with some old \"friends\" like the companion cube and Turrets. Eventually you and Wheatley escape the chambers and shut down GLaDOS's Turrets and Neurotoxin. You are sent to GLaDOS's chamber and perform a core transfer with her and Wheatley.\n\nWheatley is now in control of the facility, quickly turning on you. He sticks GLaDOS in a potato-battery and hurtles you down through Aperture's old testing facilities from the 60s to the 80s. You encounter a new mechanic while down here: gels as well as reuniting with GLaDOS. You also learn some very interesting lore while down here, referring to Cave Johnson, the former CEO of Aperture Science and to GLaDOS's possible ties with him. After rising up the facility, you arrive at the current Aperture Science, where Wheatley has utterly ruined everything, constantly hearing explosions go off in the distance. You and GLaDOS eventually reach Wheatley's chamber and defeat him, sending him into space. GLaDOS is now in control of the facility and lets you go.\n\nThat was a brief summary of the campaign.\n\nThe CO-OP mode takes place after the main story, involving two robots; Atlas and P-Body, solving test chambers as a pair. You can either play with a friend locally, online or with a random stranger (good luck finding one in 2019). The tests require utmost communication and teamwork to solve, with an additional set of levels opening up after completing the main levels. The gestures are there to make actually doing the tests a little more fun, and the ping tool is pretty good at pointing out something to your partner. Very well engineered test chambers as well.\n\nA couple of years later, I bought the game on Steam and gave the Perpetual Testing Initiative a shot. It's my favorite part of the game. It's a level editor, allowing you to make custom test chambers (both for single-player and CO-OP). My main issue here is the small amount of assets to play around with (though BEEMOD fixes this issue immensely). The tools are simple and powerful; letting you make just about any level you want.\n\nIn short, I love Portal 2. The levels are much bigger and more genius (in my opinion), and the visual/sound design is much better than the original game, which kind of felt like Half-Life in terms of look and feel. This game feels distinct enough from every other VALVe-made game for it to stand out in a good way.\n\nIs Portal 2 one of the best video game sequels of all time? I would say; taking every aspect of the original game and vastly improving on it. For only 10-12 bucks, this game is a steal, and 15-18 for both the original and the sequel? You don't need me to tell you that that is a good deal. If you haven't played the game before, do yourself a favor and PLAY IT. It is too good to pass up on.","timestamp_created":1559755524,"timestamp_updated":1559756416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51065506","author":{"steamid":"76561198835948859","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":703,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":558,"last_played":1637067657},"language":"turkish","review":"hayatımda oynadığım en iyi oyun","timestamp_created":1559753101,"timestamp_updated":1559753101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51065222","author":{"steamid":"76561198828249944","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2587,"last_played":1647366670},"language":"russian","review":"Игра становиться очень интересной тогда, когда ты начинаешь проходить её с другом или в камерах сообщества.
