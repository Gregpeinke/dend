I'll be honest, there's not a lot I really liked about this game, especially since I felt I kept using only two or three Vigors max the whole game, and not even those were very fun. Basic upgrades for weapons doesn't make them feel that great for the money you spend on them, and there's so many weapons and many limitations on ammo, so I had to frequently use another gun that I didn't have any upgrades in. At least the graphics are better, no crashes, and all audio is perfect in this game's engine. Those things kept me playing but the last hour of the game (which doesn't have ANY shooting or choices) kept droning on and made me want to quit without finishing the story. After the deed was done, I'd say my life was better off without playing the last two thirds of this game. Why do I recommend it? It goes on sale frequently and if you're going to buy one Bioshock game for $5 just get the Collection for $12! Though I'm not really a time travel sorta guy I can see many liking the complexity of this game's story. Just don't buy it for the gameplay, it's not as good as the other two.","timestamp_created":1610205685,"timestamp_updated":1610205685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84365052","author":{"steamid":"76561198276070858","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1379,"last_played":1590201217},"language":"schinese","review":"吊","timestamp_created":1610205575,"timestamp_updated":1610205575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84364014","author":{"steamid":"76561198256582948","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":685,"last_played":1613278274},"language":"english","review":"lit!","timestamp_created":1610204493,"timestamp_updated":1610204493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84359705","author":{"steamid":"76561197991058433","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":631,"last_played":1620242060},"language":"russian","review":"Прекрасная игра!

Yanınızda bir karakterle atıldığınız maceraları anlatan oyun türleri piyasada bol bol var evet ama bioshock bu oyunda karakterler arasındaki ilişkiyi çok iyi kurmuş ve anlatmış fakat özellikle benim gibi bilinmezliğin büyüsüne kapılabilen biriyseniz (örneğin; evrende uzaylı yaşamının var olup olmadığı düşüncesi, hayatta yaptığımız seçimlerin hayatlarımızı nasıl etkilediği-veya onun yerine şunu seçseydim acaba nasıl olurdu-düşüncesi, basit düşününce hayatın sonsuz ihtimalinin olması vb. şeyler) bu oyun sizi büyüleyecektir. Öncelikle şunu da söylemek istiyorum, bu oyunu oynarken cidden yukarıda anlattıklarımın tadına varmak için İngilizce bilmeniz gerekiyor fakat bu çok kompleks bir İngilizce değil, zamanında İngilizce seviyem orta seviye sayılabilecekken oynamıştım ve oyunu anlayarak oynamıştım. Neyse, elimden geldiğince spoiler vermemeye çalışacağım. Bu oyunun hikayesi aslında çok büyük bir multiverse hikayesi. Burda biraz spoiler vermiş gibi oldum ama cidden oyunu oynamadan o hikayenin ne kadar iyi olduğunu anlayamazsınız. Karakterler arasındaki ilişkiyi çok iyi anlattığını söylemiştim ve şimdi de karakterleri önemsemenizi sağladığını söyleyeceğim. Karakterlerin duyduğu mutluluk, hüzün, acı sizin içinize işliyor. Onlara bir şey olduğunda siz de endişeleniyorsunuz. Hele bir bölüm var ki... Eğer oyunu alacaksanız burial at sea DLC paketini de almanızı şiddetle tavsiye ederim. Bu oyun ilk iki bioshock evreni ile farklı yerde geçiyor, farklı şeyler anlatıyor fakat burial at sea DLC paketi ile bioshock evrenindeki her şeyin birbiri ile bağlantılı olduğunu göreceksiniz. Burada öznel bir yorum olarak şunu katmak istiyorum, bu oyunun hikayesini ve burial at sea DLC paketinin hikayesini kim yazdıysa tebrik etmek lazım çünkü şuana kadar görmediğim bir şekilde birbiri ile bağlantılı, benzerini görsem de anlatış tarzı ve olaylar ile vay be dedirten bir multiverse hikayesi var. Ayrıca bir uyarıda bulunayım, burial at sea DLC paketini oynadıktan sonra ağlayabilirsiniz. Büyük bir ihtimalle ağlamazsınız ama aşırı duygusal bir insansanız ağlayabilirsiniz. Ben öyle bir insan değilim ama sonunda zar zor yutkunuyordum. Oynanış tarafında ise columbia çok güzel bir şehir, ilk gördüğünüzde cidden bir ütopyada olduğunuzu hissettiriyor fakat oyunda ilerledikçe bu güzel şehrin ardında çok karanlık bir hikaye yattığını gitgide keşfediyorsunuz ve oyun bunu da çok iyi veriyor. Bir fps oyunu olarak ise gayet normal bir oynanışa sahip. Fakat bu oynanış bazı insanlara hantal gibi gelebilir çünkü benim ilk oynayışımda bana da öyle gelmişti fakat bir noktadan sonra alışıyorsunuz ki zaten oyunun hikayesine bir kez kapıldığınızda oynanış hantalmış falan filan umrunuzda olmuyor. Silah çeşitliliği bir fps oyununa göre az gibi, her çeşit silah türünden bir adet var ve bunların da Variantları var. Silahlar dışında da vigorlar var. Toplamda 8 çeşit vigor var ve hepsi birbirinden farklı özelliklere sahip. Karakter gelişimi yanında bu vigorları geliştirerek çok güçlü olabilirsiniz. Ayrıca bazı vigorları birlikte kullanarak kombolar da yaratabiliyorsunuz böylelikle çok eğlenceli şeyler ortaya çıkarabilirsiniz. Karakterinizin can barını, zırh barını ve oyun içinde vigor kullanmak için olan salt barını arttırabilirsiniz. Ayrıca oyunda üzerinize giydiğiniz kıyafetler size farklı özellikler kazandırıyor. Bunlar bazen güç artışı, bazen hız, bazen de belli bir öldürüş şekli kullandığınızda size salt vermek gibi şeyler olabiliyor. Bu konuda oyunda çok ama çok fazla çeşitte kıyafet özelliği ile kendi oynanış tarzınıza uygun bir şekilde karakterinizi geliştirebilirsiniz. Kişisel olarak ben oyunu oynarken kendi oynanış tarzıma göre bir kombin oluşturabildim ve böylelikle daha da güçlü oldum. Ayrıca önünüze çıkan bu kıyafetlerin hepsi çöp falan da değil, cidden aralarında kalacağınız kıyafet özellikleri olabilir ki şahsen oyunu oynarken bulduğum kıyafeti kullansam mı yoksa böyle devam mı etsem diye 1-2 dakika olmasa da 20-30 saniye düşündüğüm olmuştu. Oyunla ilgili söyleyebileceğim tek eksik yanı oyun ilk duyurulduğunda gösterdikleri fragmanlarda bulunan şeylerin, oyunda bunlar bunlar olacak dedikleri bazı şeylerin olmaması ki bu oyun sırf dediklerini yapabilmeleri için yanılmıyorsam 3 kez ertelenmişti sonunda ise firmanın baskıları yüzünden oyun böyle çıkış yapmak zorunda kaldı. Zaten şu haliyle bile oyundığım en güzel oyunlardan biri ve kim bilir belkide istedikleri kadar zaman verilseydi piyasayı sallayan bir oyun olarak da çıkış yapabilirdi. Sonuç olarak bioshock infinite bir şaheser, gerek oyunun hikayesinden tutun, gerek karakterlerden tutun gerek de dizayn bakımdan tutun bu oyun mükemmel bir oyun. Şuanda sınava çalışmıyor olsaydım büyük bir ihtimalle oyunu 3. Kez oynuyor olurdum. Kesinlikle oynadığım oyunlar arasında top 3'e koyacağım bir oyun ve herkese böyle bir hikayeyi, böyle karakterleri deneyimlemelerini tavsiye ediyorum. Son olarak da cidden, paranıza kıyın ve bu oyunu alırken yanında burial at sea DLC paketini de alın. Böylelikle ana oyunun kendisi kadar güzellikte bir hikaye ve bioshock infinite'in ilk iki bioshock oyunu ile nasıl bağlantılı olduğunu göreceksiniz. Her ne kadar önceden söylemiş olsam da bu oyun bir şaheser ve paranızın her kuruşuna değeceğinden emin olabilirsiniz.\n[Bu incilemeden birkaç gün sonra öğrendim ki oyunun senaryo yazarı Ken Levine abimiz imiş (galiba).

At first the graphics seemed a little rough even for its age, but eventually I got used to it and came to respect the overall aesthetic. While I never fell in love with the steampunk look -- which clashes with my engineering sensibilities -- I did make peace with it. Wandering around a lighter-than-air structure, it was hard not to constantly notice the choice of the densest building materials imaginable. But maybe that was the point and the desired effect. At least there was a hint of magical \"science\" to wave away such aerospace engineering profligacy.\n\nThis game is in no way \"open world\" but while it was somewhat one-dimensional it felt decent with enough expansive vistas and interesting side alcoves to smooth over the ordained track. My term for such games has traditionally been \"on a rail\", as in you're following a track that you can not deviate from. This game had a fresh mechanic that literally placed the protagonist \"on a rail\" that ran around the sky of various maps. At first I thought, uh oh, this will be weird and confusing -- and it was -- but eventually I came to respect it as a nice way to utilize more of the 3d volume that the game engine was prepared to calculate anyway. It lent a novel kind of roller coaster effect and I think it largely worked.\n\nI think the main reason I played through and even enjoyed doing so was that the story did hold my interest. It felt like it was a combination of the religious nuttery of Far Cry 5 (which I'd just completed) and the complex time travelling mechanics of the movie Tenet (which I watched while in the middle of the game). Since I had just played a couple of Far Cry games, I was probably more easily able to overlook one of the criticisms I saw that, upon reflection, rang quite true: the game was violent in a strange way that detracted from the story. Instead of killing 50 people per hour like one does in Far Cry, here you kill maybe 20. But the story is so intricate and rich that I can see how interrupting it every so often to gratuitously kill a dozen similar looking cartoonish henchmen is more than a little weird and inconsistent. Still, that's video gaming for you. I could imagine a broader appeal if this problem could be ameliorated. On the other hand, it could be said that broad appeal is already present because of gratuitous violence in games. Hard to say. Certainly some violence was appropriate to the story.\n\nI thought that the combat mechanics were fine. I was a bit surprised at how good I was - because I'm not usually especially good at aiming guns quickly and shooting people accurately. If the game was not helping me out, it definitely felt that way. I was able to play most of the game relying only on the pistol. The \"vapor\" (magic spell) mechanics were kind of at odds with the story and in total too complex to fully master in one play through. I was especially impressed with the follower AI and how she collaborated effectively, rather than create a liability, during battles.\n\nThe voice acting was superb.\n\nI probably don't need to play it again, but it's a good game with some innovative mechanics and a rich sci-fi story that made me happy to have checked it out.","timestamp_created":1610128299,"timestamp_updated":1610128299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84302231","author":{"steamid":"76561199112058312","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":606,"last_played":1610090332},"language":"russian","review":"дуже крутая игра!","timestamp_created":1610126477,"timestamp_updated":1610126477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84301536","author":{"steamid":"76561199018850604","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":769,"last_played":1612186441},"language":"schinese","review":"刚刚生化奇兵无限通关，一开始是看到“第九艺术”的评价买来玩的，玩了一代然后迫不及待的开始了无限，玩完后确实感觉是个非常好的游戏，给我最大的好感是每帧都是画的游戏画面和伊丽莎白的互动，剧情确实烧脑，需要再回味。这确实不能叫游戏了，因为它的目的似乎不是单纯让你玩让你爽，它在传达一些东西。","timestamp_created":1610125700,"timestamp_updated":1610125700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84301230","author":{"steamid":"76561198980148899","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1140,"last_played":1609957123},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic 3rd game in the bioshock franchise.

I liked the build-up of learning Booker's history via the museum, Comstock, Lady Comstock's history, the city's history, the Luteces (which I thought was an extremely clever concept to put them together to then have an omniscient, yet curious view of reality which you're slowly brought to understand, the way the \"real world\" was brought into theirs in bits and pieces, along with Rapture's contributions, and Elizabeth's history and evolution. \n\nAll of these felt new and mysterious, giving you something to think about and slowly piece together. There were so many original concepts and twists that I wasn't able to predict just about anything, which is also refreshing. Too many movies today foreshadow everything and if you've seen any trailers, it's simple to figure out the ending very shortly into the story. Infinite's trailer was different than the actual game, yes. But it did give us a flavor of the world we'd be in. All that was accurate. That sort of trailer is the type that I feel is most effective; show you the most elementary feel for the premise and no plot giveaways. \n\nThe ending is the most controversial, if not just disliked by the majority. Again, I liked it. Using Rapture's imagery to depict the concept of infinite universes was terrific; suddenly juxtaposing the familiar and iconic with the new concepts introduced in Infinite was wonderful. I felt it was reminiscent of Back to the Future II. Sending a familiar character into a familiar surrounding to illustrate both the dangers and the possibilities of the new example of paradoxes was very effective.  \n\nOn the point of convoluted paradoxes: no two movies, TV shows, books, etc.. ever use the exact same rules for travel between dimensions or times. Sometimes a single story will violate its own rules. My point is that the Booker / Comstock baptism concept was a very original take on the subject. Elizabeth attempting to change the future in all possible universes is an extremely powerful concept; she has become so powerful that she is actually able to attempt this. She is also so determined to avoid her reality that she is willing to erase herself, all her selves, in the process. That concept begets so many questions on the nature of reality, infinity, time alteration, multiple dimensions, and as with the first Bioshock, the question of free will itself. \n\nI know of no other game that can delve into all of these concepts as deeply and intertwined as depicted here.\nMany people take issue with the ability for Elizabeth to accomplish her goal. \n\nThe simple answer is that we don't know. We know that she believes she must try, and that Booker Prime somewhat understands the necessity. We see a few of her alternate selves eliminate one Booker. From a visual point of view, trying to display an infinite number of Elizabeths drowning an infinite number of Bookers could be done, perhaps in the multi-lighthouse environment, but the scene wouldn't be nearly as intimate or be capable of conveying the emotions felt by the characters. \n\nElizabeth has become something that we don't fully understand. She seems to understand and control her place in the multi-verse, and visualize the series of events necessary to bring about every reality. She has effectively become a god. The infinite number of Elizabeths have all become gods that all understand that they must no longer exist. How does one possibly depict this visually in less than a minute, within the restrictions that the game engine presents? As a small group working together, one Booker at a time, perhaps as a punishment for all of Booker's deeds, a penance on herself for wiping so many people out of possible existence? When her multiple selves disappear, fading out of existence, does she leave one existence and move on to another to continue her endless task of Booker-cide (the act of killing Booker), becoming a murderer for all of eternity? \n\nWe really can't answer these questions fully because we don't understand the nature of their universe fully. How can one discover a mistake or impossibility when dealing with the ineffable nature of time, reality, and infinity? What list of rules are we to check our list of incongruities against? I believe that most of the 'plot holes' in the story fall under this umbrella. \n\nHowever one point mentioned about abilities gained from having body parts split between realities seemed to have a fairly simple explanation: Booker has obviously left a great amount of his physical self in his original world in the form of blood, skin cells, hair, etc... yet he has no \"magical\" powers as a result. Elizabeth and the Luteces do, why not Booker? I believe it is due to the amount of time spent in the alternate reality. Booker has spent the least amount of time in a different dimension, while Elizabeth has grown up divided among worlds. When the Robert Lutece arrives in the alternate universe, he is foggy, not himself, unable to concentrate, etc..  Eventually he finally regains his mental faculties, suggesting that the time spent in an alternate world does have an effect on the person physically. During the game, Booker is still having memory issues, similar to the effects Robert Lutece experienced at first, also potentially explaining the difference in abilities.\n\nAt the very end, do we see one lone Booker, spared by Elizabeth, somehow allowed to raise his daughter in peace?\n\nFinally, In an industry that the consumers are constantly clamoring for original works, I feel that when one is presented, it should be celebrated for what it is, not berated for what it could have been.\n\nThat's all, thanks for reading. 9/10.","timestamp_created":1610115893,"timestamp_updated":1610115893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84292220","author":{"steamid":"76561198349893107","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":513,"last_played":1610115565},"language":"koreana","review":"명작","timestamp_created":1610115592,"timestamp_updated":1610115592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84292140","author":{"steamid":"76561198843500733","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":552,"last_played":1632763222},"language":"schinese","review":"后期简直太神了，玩得我目瞪口呆","timestamp_created":1610115505,"timestamp_updated":1610115505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"84289760","author":{"steamid":"76561197981747125","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":764,"last_played":1515248220},"language":"italian","review":"I voti vanno da 1 a 10, dove più il voto è alto più è positivo e sono dati a gioco completato.
