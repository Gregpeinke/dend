Que increíble juego la verdad no parece que hayan pasado 22 años desde que salió. Este juego es la prueba de que un clásico bien desarrollado y con gran diseño de niveles perdura por siempre. Tiene fallas como cualquier otro juegode la época o incluso hoy en día; como un sistema de salto un poco incómodo de utilizar, el personaje suele atascarse en ciertos lugares por alguna razón y un sistema de autoguardado que podría ser complementado con una selección de niveles para jugarlos después o en mi caso no tener munición para seguir avanzando, esta última puede llevar a situaciones muy frustrantes en dificultad difícil y no recomendaría confiar en ese autoguardado. Sin embargo, de alguna manera se compensa con guardado manual en cualquier punto. Como conclusión si tienen una cuenta de Steam no existe una razón por la que no tengan este juego.

That said, I think the point of Steam reviews is more about if the game is worth playing on its own merits, and imo this one hasn't really held up super well. There's some things that are still great in modern day, like the atmosphere and sound design (although the actual sound quality is about what'd you expect from the game's era). However, to be honest, I don't think those just looking for a game to have fun in and don't really care about history and 'playing the first Half-Life' and such will get much out of this.\n\nThis game has some serious flaws, some of which I've heard even the most die-hard fans acknowledge, and others that apparently are a hot take from me for whatever reason. I think most people agree that the last two chapters are pretty lackluster in terms of level design, as well as some other bits throughout. In general, this game has a lot of 'where the hell am I supposed to go' moments, which can be pretty frustrating, though I can forgive that since to be completely honest I am the sort of person who gets easily lost in both games and real life. (In other words your mileage may vary)\n\nI think the gunplay is this game is generally pretty crappy by modern standards. And I don't mean crappy as in just mediocre, like in Half-Life 2, I mean actually annoyingly bad. My most hated weapon in particular is the MP5 (or the M4 if you're using the HD pack [which don't by the way because it sucks]). Every bullet seems to go left or right and anywhere but what you're aiming at, and not like in Counter Strike or other games where it's an actual pattern you can control. It's just basically unusable, which sucks since you kinda have to use it unless you want to have a very hard time getting through certain sections. Only a few of the weapons have any power to them, due to floaty, dated looking animations. \n\nThe AI is generally pretty good, a bit too good aim-wise in my opinion. You can get pixel-sniped in this game pretty easily, which is especially annoying during some of surface sections. Other than this though you will definitely feel like you're fighting formidable foes throughout the game. Soldiers especially have very complicated scripting in certain areas that make them behave more like real-life soldiers. They will flank, lob grenades, and get to cover to gain the upper-hand. The AI is overall is challenging, but mostly fair.\n\nAs many will say and I will agree with is that this game is world-class in storytelling and atmosphere. It starts very slow, setting up the world and events that play, before thrusting you into survival-scavenge mode. I don't have many criticisms here, except that a more robust 'level' (or chapter) select probably would have been helpful, like was done in the sequel. The game generally keeps you immersed very well, with an optional but fairly helpful tutorial level. \n\nThis is a minor nitpick, but I'm generally not a big fan of games have a quicksave feature over more optimal checkpoints, as personally it takes me out of the world because I'm worrying about whether I should save now or wait or whatever. Also, the voice acting, while very funny and something I love to quote to friends, is kinda bad. It's not really the voice actors as much as it's the writing; again though it's pretty funny and honestly one of the parts of the game I cherish. \n\nIn summary, while the game definitely is very important and has very real high points, I don't think someone who doesn't already have an alternative motivation to get through the game is likely to enjoy it nearly as much as people like to say. If you've never played a Half-Life game, to be honest I would recommend skipping this one and its expansions, and just start at Half-Life 2. The sequel is a much better all-around game, and retcons a lot of stuff anyways so it doesn't matter that much to be out of the loop. If you're into older games and somehow haven't played this however, you may be into it.

The game is well-structured and paces itself so that the story unfolds at around the same pace that the mechanics do.  It all flows pretty naturally, beginning with Gordon Freeman as a humble scientist and following him as he adapts to a bizarre situation and becomes something much bigger than he was before, and this whole time the level design organically teaches you the game's basic mechanics and encourages you to use them to get better at the game at your own pace, so you never feel like you're being left behind but it also never feels like you're having your hand held either.  The story is rarely if ever intrusive, meaning that you can enjoy the depth of Half-Life's story at your leisure if you please or you can just treat it like a fun shooter and ignore the story entirely.  It's up to you.\n\nThe gameplay isn't without its quirks.  There's a lot more platforming than one would expect, a product of the age in which Half-Life was developed.  If you're not accustomed to platforming in first-person it may take some getting used to.  Crouch-jumping also doesn't feel quite as smooth as it is in more modern games, but with practice you'll get the hang of it.  There were only one or two moments where the platforming felt intrusive and out-of-place and they were generally short enough to be forgiven.\n\nSome friends I've spoken to take umbrage with the inventory system in Half-Life, preferring the more conventional weapon-swapping system in which you use the scroll wheel to cycle through weapons, whereas here the scroll wheel cycles through a menu that you have to pick a weapon from.  At first this seems like a bizarre choice even for the time, but on reflection I actually quite like this system, because it adds an extra second of panic when you're trying to swap weapons in combat and that works really well with the story.  Gordon Freeman is not a trained soldier, he's a scientist who happens to have a suit of power armor on; he's not trained to deal with the stress of combat and that's reflected in that extra second of clunkiness you'll get when you switch weapons.  Sure it's not the smoothest design, but Gordon isn't a smooth fighter, at least not until the events of Half-Life 2 when he's got more combat experience under his belt.\n\nIf you absolutely must play this game unspoiled then you can stop reading here assured that I thoroughly recommend Half-Life as a classic shooter with an excellent narrative focus and solid gameplay that still holds up today.  Give it a download, play it through, hunt for some secrets, download some mods, play the Deathmatch mode, have fun.  It's well-worth the ten bucks Valve is charging for it these days and it's certainly worthy of your time.\n\n\n\nSo spoiler time then: I hate this game.  I'm serious, I fucking hate this game.  Specifically I hate the last few levels, after Gordon teleports to Xen.  If you have friends that played Half-Life you've probably heard them say that the Xen levels are terrible and they really are.  I was having a ton of fun shooting zombies, sneaking around military personnel and alien invaders, and letting the levels challenge me to figure out the best solutions myself in real time.  Then Xen happened, and the entire dynamic of the game changed.  Lower gravity, heavier emphasis on platforming, more numerous and increasingly annoying enemies, really difficult to find ammo, confusing level design, and a constant sense that you have no idea what the game wants from you.\n\nTo be clear, I think I would have liked Xen if the game had done a better job of setting it up, but as it stands it comes right out of nowhere and leaves me utterly gobsmacked at how fundamentally opposed to the core design of Half-Life it really is.  I think I know what they were going for: Xen is supposed to be the point where Gordon steps into an utterly unknown world and has to survive on his wits and intuition, but instead what it feels like is my asshole friends stopped Highlander right towards the climax and put Highlander 2 in instead.  And then punched me in the gut.\n\nI was so utterly repulsed by Xen and so frustrated with how bullshit the enemies and level design were at this point in the game that I actually stopped playing.  I will never finish Half-Life.  Why should I?  The game's ending is plastered all over YouTube and the sequel has been out since 2007.  I know what happens, and I know that there's a better game in my library waiting for me to play it.  Why would I waste my time with this crap?\n\nDespite all of my revulsion for the penultimate chapters of the game, however, my recommendation stands, because at its core Half-Life is still a five out of five classic shooter with a well-deserved reputation as an innovator in the market which the industry continues to use as a design template to this day.  It just so happens that right towards the end its five star score to drops down to a two star.  I know that's harsh but I'm trying to give an honest review based on my experience with the game.  Maybe you won't find the Xen levels as offensive as I did and that's fine with me; do enjoy them at your leisure, but you've been warned.","timestamp_created":1595110434,"timestamp_updated":1595110434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72914137","author":{"steamid":"76561198965357903","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":11860,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1314,"last_played":1658392182},"language":"russian","review":"крутая игра! графика хорошоя + гейм плей хорошый\n","timestamp_created":1595104600,"timestamp_updated":1595104600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72911725","author":{"steamid":"76561198248006916","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3827,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":434,"last_played":1642883841},"language":"english","review":"just.....play it.\n\n\njust do it","timestamp_created":1595101057,"timestamp_updated":1595101057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72911518","author":{"steamid":"76561198987879807","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1656680563},"language":"english","review":"Best game I ever played. The story is good and gameplay is good too. I like the online deathmatch too. The gun's are fun to use and some weapons deal lots of damage but don't have lots of ammo for it. The only melee weapon is the iconic crowbar and you get in the second chapter. The pistol is your second weapon you get after the crowbar from a dead security guard. I don't want to talk about every gun in the game but I'm sure there are lots of videos or guides for weapons. \n\n\"You need to play it\" 10/10 -[insert a name here]","timestamp_created":1595100719,"timestamp_updated":1595100719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72911098","author":{"steamid":"76561198992882590","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":945,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":363,"last_played":1595280560},"language":"english","review":"Gud","timestamp_created":1595100120,"timestamp_updated":1595100120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72908479","author":{"steamid":"76561199021404975","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3258,"last_played":1606746724},"language":"english","review":"Good\n","timestamp_created":1595096374,"timestamp_updated":1595096374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72907667","author":{"steamid":"76561198219514175","num_games_owned":510,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":464,"last_played":1594784541},"language":"english","review":"gaming. un clásico","timestamp_created":1595095272,"timestamp_updated":1595095272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72906667","author":{"steamid":"76561198998606066","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1836,"last_played":1642126384},"language":"english","review":"Vintage from my university days","timestamp_created":1595093788,"timestamp_updated":1595093788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72906176","author":{"steamid":"76561199031935025","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1254,"last_played":1653503784},"language":"english","review":"While not as widely recognized as it's sequel, it is still an extremely solid game.
