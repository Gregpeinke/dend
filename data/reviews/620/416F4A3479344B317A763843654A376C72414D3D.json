back to this game for the first time in years and playing through the single player story, I remember why I love this series so much.\n\n[SPOILERS]  (But honestly this game is old enough for me to not feel too bad about it)\n\nIt's the perfect natural continuation of the original Portal story.  It feels genuinely entertaining through and through.  From the get-go I feel as though I'm actually making progress towards an actual goal.  I know where I am, I know who I am, and I have an ally.  After turning GLaDOS back on I don't feel the same lost hopelessness that I did in the first game.  I actually feel as though I'm fighting back at every turn.  And GLaDOS doesn't feel as disconnected as she does in the first game.  She went from the occasional sarcastic quip in Portal to a lively and vengeful persona.\n\nAfter the core swap I truly get a sense of the shear scale of the Aperture Science facility.  This game is the perfect example of giving me lore and world building within a game without drawing me away from the action or story of the game.  J. K. Simmons was absolutely the right choice for voicing Cave Johnson.\n\nAfter finding and rescuing potato GLaDOS from the bird I feel as though she's become my only true companion at this point.  The slow realization that GLaDOS is the immortalized mind of Caroline, forced into a machine and forever trapped as a homicidal AI, makes me start to feel a strange connection to her.  It's as if the realization that GLaDOS is also a victim of what was obviously an unhealthy and probably abusive relationship suddenly humanized my mortal enemy for me and made me actually feel for her.  As I slowly make my way through the old facility and back into the new, I actually grow rather attached to her.\n\nOnce back in the newer Aperture facility we meet Wheatley again to find he's gone completely mad.  His attempts at test chambers are so fitting of him.  As Wheatley is trying to kill GLaDOS and myself I feel like GLaDOS is actually my ally in this.  As we work our way to his lair I love being there as she formulates her plan.  Arriving in his lair I love his analysis of the final boss fight of the last game.  It does such a good job of tying the two games together once again.\n\nThe corrupted cores are absolutely hilarious as well.  My favorite of them is, of course, space core.\n\nEven knowing how the last moment of the boss fight plays out, I feel as though I'm actually participating in an interactive movie.  The last moment as Wheatley and I are dangling through the portal literally on the surface of the bloody moon, I feel like it's the most engaging cut scene of any game I've ever played.  That split second after GLaDOS knocks Wheatley off into the vast empty expanse of space, I remember my first play through thinking I've just been betrayed and was about to die in space, just before I turn to see that GLaDOS has grabbed ahold of me and is pulling me back in.\n\nThe goodbye scene between GLaDOS and Chell is such a fitting end to their relationship.  The turret choir is such a beautiful send off.\n\nFinally, that last shot of GLaDOS returning my companion cube always melts my heart.  I don't know why, but I got emotionally attached to the companion cube in the first Portal, and destroying it was one of the most heartbreaking moments of any game I've ever played.  Let that sink in.  Having to burn a cube with a pink heart painted on it was one of the most heartbreaking moments of any game I've ever played.  And as such, the return of that cube was one of, if not the most satisfying end to a video game I have ever experienced.  And that's just the single player story.\n\nI can never decide if I want another iteration of this game series or not.  This is such a perfect moment to end on.  Granted, I would love to see Chell using a portal gun in the post Half-Life 2 world, outside the Aperture Science facility.  Maybe, if Valve ever learns to count to three.","timestamp_created":1647647156,"timestamp_updated":1647647156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112439303","author":{"steamid":"76561199228320580","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1647646784},"language":"english","review":"There is no way anybody can dislike this game.
