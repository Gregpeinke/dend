E mais raros ainda aqueles que eu completei. O obstáculo sempre foi o fator dificuldade. Apesar de ser considerado inteligente pelos meus pares, eu diria que meu intelecto está mais propenso a armazenar e digerir dados do que resolver problemas práticos. Nunca joguei xadrez. Nunca fui um mestre no jogo de damas. Enigmas com palitos de fósforos e outros similares em revistas sempre me deixaram frustrados. E frustração não é o nome do jogo. Os poucos títulos que me cativaram apresentavam uma rápida curva de aprendizado ascendente e se tornavam impossíveis para mim depois de três ou quatro fases.\n\nEm Portal, a Valve acertou na medida exata para me prender em poucos minutos e continuar me desafiando progressivamente até a batalha final. É um título que, ao mesmo tempo em que não segura sua mão para cumprir os desafios também é habilmente construído para que você possa intuir as saídas, mesmo quando tudo parece impossível. Ao contrário de estressantes sequências de plataforma ou puzzle em títulos fora do gênero, aqui seu sucesso NÃO depende de reflexos de relâmpago ou saltos precisos (na maioria dos casos, pelo menos). Você pode analisar o ambiente, experimentar, inventar soluções, no seu ritmo, seja em duas horas e meia, seja em quatro, seja em seis.\n\nO conceito do jogo é simples. Não há inventário. Não há estatísticas na tela, pontos de vida, munição. Uma única e excepcional arma faz parte do seu arsenal, um instrumento capaz de abrir portais de entrada e saída. É impossível de se explicar sem usar muitas palavras, mas, tantos anos após seu lançamento, imagino que todo mundo já conheça pelo menos a idéia. Entretanto, se você não jogou, nada do que foi escrito ou visto irá prepará-lo para a sensação que dá entrar por um destes portais. Um lado do seu cérebro irá assimilar o evento e o outro lado irá se apegar à velha forma de ver o mundo e se recusará a visualizar as possibilidades. Você chegará na metade do jogo e ainda se flagrará dizendo: \"eu não acredito que estou fazendo isso!\". O verdadeiro desafio do jogo não vem de GLaDOS ou das salas milimetricamente arquitetadas. Virá de sua própria resistência a compreender o que pode ser feito. E, quando você se libertar das amarras do que é \"normal\", você estará dominando o jogo.\n\nA Valve poderia perfeitamente soltar o jogador em uma sucessão de desafios a serem vencidos usando a Portal Gun e ainda assim ter um título de sucesso. A jogabilidade vicia. Mas, ainda assim, como quase tudo vindo da desenvolvedora, era necessário algo mais. E esse algo mais chama-se Narrativa. Com N maiúsculo, por favor, esses são os caras que colocaram uma introdução sem tiros em um jogo de tiro, doze anos atrás.\n\nPortal, em muitos aspectos, me lembrou a obscura franquia de filmes de terror O Cubo, mais especificamente o primeiro e o terceiro filme. O ambiente estéril e impessoal, mortífero e sem sentido seguido por uma estranha e insolúvel conspiração, cujos bastidores não são tão organizados ou assépticos quanto a fachada. Nesse cenário desolador, a protagonista sem voz ou nome é constantemente instigada, traída e atormentada por uma inteligência artificial sádica, manipuladora e, ao mesmo tempo, frágil e digna de pena.\n\nA história não nos é contada diretamente de forma alguma e aparece lentamente, seja através da fala de GLaDOS, a única voz presente em todo o jogo, seja através de mensagens desconexas grafitadas fora dos limites controlados pela máquina. Através destes pedaços de informação, o jogador vai montando um quebra-cabeça ainda mais complexo do que os desafios físicos impostos pelo ambiente. Trata-se de uma história feita de mentiras, de loucura, de horror e que, de alguma forma, está relacionada ao hermético universo de Half-Life. Esta colcha de retalhos possui mais lacunas do que bordados, mas nestes vazios reside o grande enigma de Portal.\n\nUma outra empresa qualquer poderia se dar por satisfeita ao criar um jogo desafiador e com uma narrativa intrigante. Não a Valve. Entrando como a cereja deste bolo, está GLaDOS, o mais perturbador, sarcástico, detestável, adorável, insano, mentiroso e sádico vilão contemporâneo desde o Coringa.\n\nGLaDOS é rainha do espetáculo, roubando todas as cenas em que se manifesta. A protagonista, que entra muda e sai calada, aqui é apenas uma mão virtual para segurar a arma para o jogador enquanto este se diverte e, ao mesmo tempo, tenta sobreviver à antagonista. Com uma voz feminina agradável, ela é capaz de dizer as maiores barbaridades sem perder a linha em quase nenhum instante. E, quando fica claro ao jogador que há algo muito errado com a máquina, os sorrisos vão se transformando em uma mistura de riso amarelo com riso nervoso. Parabéns ao time da Valve e seu texto exuberante, repleto de fina ironia. E parabéns à dubladora (e cantora) Ellen McLain, que emprestou sentimento e doçura nos momentos certos, e incerteza e loucura nos momentos de arrepiar a espinha. Eu ria enquanto pensava: \"Meu Deus, esta coisa maldita está tentado me matar!\".\n\nAo final do jogo, entram os créditos e a música \"Still Alive\", cantada pela mesma Ellen McLain personificando uma invencível GLaDOS e prometendo novos horrores. Em nome da ciência. A canção funciona em dois sentidos, atuando como catarse após longas horas de confronto graças ao seu ritmo pop e colante enquanto a letra (e a voz da máquina) assusta em contraste e confirma que o pesadelo não terá fim.\n\nNão se deixe enganar pelo meme que diz que \"The cake is a lie\". Existe bolo. E ele é delicioso e molhado.\n\nOriginalmente publicado em: http://blog.retinadesgastada.com.br/2011/01/cake-is-not-lie.html\n","timestamp_created":1386339360,"timestamp_updated":1386339360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.733590304851531982","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7938004","author":{"steamid":"76561198085843885","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1397315230},"language":"english","review":"this game is pretty good. it is very short though. only buy this game when its on sale.","timestamp_created":1386334110,"timestamp_updated":1386334110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496240615844726563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7936960","author":{"steamid":"76561198071105130","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1650127226},"language":"english","review":"Fucking awesome game.","timestamp_created":1386325711,"timestamp_updated":1386325711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7936804","author":{"steamid":"76561198050602478","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":759,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":564,"last_played":1400277336},"language":"english","review":"Awesome Game!
