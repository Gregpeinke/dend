Ô loco meu! Esse aí é fera! E como é uma continuação, ficou parecendo promoção da Subway, você ganha tudo em dobro! Mais piadas, mais ação, mais aventura e muito, mas muito mais recheio... quer dizer, desafios. Um jogo eletrizante com desafios marotos que não se via desde o almanacão de férias da Turma da Mônica. Recomendado para quem adora palavras cruzadas ou ludo real com aquela pitada de vertigem do kamikaze dos parques de diversões de bairro.","timestamp_created":1430888498,"timestamp_updated":1430888498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15706458","author":{"steamid":"76561198093272049","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":13686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10728,"last_played":1616284290},"language":"english","review":"This Is my favorite game of all time!

Её мало. 14 часов одиночной кампании и «коопа» пролетают мгновенно, словно летний сон. Рука так и тянется к «New Game», чтобы пройти игру снова, наслаждаясь умными головоломками и острыми, как лезвие бритвы, репликами героев. Portal 2 — игра на один раз Valve выпустила образцовый сиквел, к которому почти не придраться. Локации масштабнее и разнообразнее, графика — техничнее, повествование — глубже. Основа основ — по-прежнему пушка, создающая два взаимосвязанных портала, правда, механика стала гораздо сложнее. Раньше мы просто дырявили поверхности, дабы миновать зону обстрела или притащить ящик в нужную точку. Теперь в уравнение добавлена целая охапка параметров. Лазерные лучи и кубические линзы, их преломляющие. Световые мостики для перемещения по воздуху или, если поставить их «ребром», защиты от охранных турелей. Пластина, подбрасывающая объекты. Гравитационные тоннели, которые подхватывают и медленно уносят все, что в них попадает. Три типа гелевой краски: синяя усиливает прыжок, оранжевая здорово ускоряет разбег, белая делает любую плоскость пригодной для открытия портала. Изменений — куча, только Valve не спешит вываливать их разом. Из главы в главу дизайнеры потихоньку переписывают правила, приучая мыслить новыми категориями. Уровни рассчитаны идеально: в меру хитрые, чтобы бросить вызов и растормошить серые клеточки, но без уклона в садизм. В худшем случае вы потратите 15-20 минут на поиски решения, стукнете кулаком о стол и почувствуете себя дураком — ибо ответ лежал перед глазами. В лучшем — порадуетесь, как быстро вы разгрызли еще один кусочек гранита. Portal 2 вообще благосклонна — для каждого многоходового пазла предусмотрены невидимые «чекпойнты»; если допустите фатальную ошибку в миллиметре от победы, вам не придется повторять все с нуля. Игроки выступают в роли двух симпатяг-роботов, Атласа и Пи-Боди, созданных GLaDOS. Ее едкие подколки и здесь часто будут вызывать смешки и ухмылки, но больше комизма кроется в самом прохождении, точнее, в неудачах по ходу процесса. Не раз и не два ваш партнер рухнет в пропасть или будет раздавлен прессом по вашей неосторожности (или наоборот). Последствия, к счастью, не фатальны — робот попросту собирается заново в начале уровня. Сами решения головоломок, как правило, довольно прозрачны — больше сложности заключается в координации действий игроков. В любом случае, это очень веселое и уникальное в своем роде развлечение.","timestamp_created":1430820446,"timestamp_updated":1430820446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15696776","author":{"steamid":"76561198176971858","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1503677220},"language":"turkish","review":"Dikkat İnsan beynine zararlı bir oyundur Beyniniz yanabilir !! :))","timestamp_created":1430820424,"timestamp_updated":1430820424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15696751","author":{"steamid":"76561198009759801","num_games_owned":1164,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":868,"last_played":1420633227},"language":"english","review":"Hours and hours of fun!

Portal 2 is an amazing game. It's an excellent puzzle game, and at some points a great platformer. Unlike Portal's Short, Linear story and level design, Portal 2's story is massive, with tons of twists and turns a long the way, and it's levels are the same thing. For example, there's a character, Wheatley, who is your best friend until something happens (Not gonna spoil it, play it for yourself). Comparatively, Portal 1 is around, on average, 2 to 5 hours. While Portal 2's story is around 8-10 hours. There's also co-op mode, which is about 9-12 hours. So overall, Portal 2 is much, much better than Portal. My rating for Portal 2, is a 8.5/10.

I played through the first installment and absolutely loved it.  It was short, sweet, and reasonably challenging while having a great core mechanic and awesome sense of humor.  Now, Portal 2 has built on it and has added more of the fun from Portal.  The sense of humor is not as sardonic and dark as the first one but still pretty funny.  The game itself is a bit dull at points but the physics engine is beyond amazing and the scenery is really crisp and engaging especially on my HD monitor.  The game doesn't add too much new to the core mechanics which is a good thing because they have no need for a change.  The story drags a bit but overall the few criticisms I have for it are far outweighed by the fact that it is still one of the few games I will play over and over again, once I beat it.  Above all, play the first one before you even touch the second, the story will make much more sense and you will find better humor and tighter gameplay there.  But again, I highly recommend Portal 2, it just has the unfortunate position of being the sequel to what has to be my favorite game of all time so, I still score it 94/100.","timestamp_created":1430607831,"timestamp_updated":1430607831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15661096","author":{"steamid":"76561198145025313","num_games_owned":227,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":1529,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1595036554},"language":"english","review":"Someone give a dev a cookie.","timestamp_created":1430607618,"timestamp_updated":1430607618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15660206","author":{"steamid":"76561198078105954","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":1857,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1484,"last_played":1529878370},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 is fam","timestamp_created":1430603008,"timestamp_updated":1430603008,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgLGli80CfsreOw=="}
