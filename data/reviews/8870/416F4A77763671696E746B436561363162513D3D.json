Je speelt als Booker DeWitt, een privédetective die op een missie gaat om een meid genaamd Elizabeth uit Columbia (een vliegende stad, dit keer niet op de bodem van de oceaan) te bevrijden. Uiteraard gaat dit niet zoals verwacht en blijkt er veel meer aan de hand te zijn. Om niet te veel te spoilen zal ik het er op houden dat het verhaal goed geschreven is en na afronding nog enige tijd in je hoofd rond zal spoken. Ook zijn de omgevingen zeer gedetailleerd en goed uitgewerkt, en is het een geweldige ervaring om door de stad Columbia rond te lopen. Zelfs 3 jaar na uitkomst is het een van de mooiste games die ik ooit heb gezien. \n\nHet spel is echter zeker niet perfect. De combat schiet over het algemeen te kort met een waardeloos wapensysteem en  hersenloze vijanden die nauwelijks tactieken toepassen, dus verwacht geen vloeiende scenes à la Battlefield of Call of Duty. Verder duurt het ongeveer 12-16 uur om dit spel uit te spelen. Het verhaal is vrij lineair en heeft nagenoeg geen keuzemomenten, waardoor er weinig reden is om het nog een tweede keer te spelen. Naar mijn mening is daarom de huidige prijs van €30 voor dit spel te veel, en zou ik dus aanraden om het tijdens een sale te kopen (op moment van schrijven is het in de aanbieding voor €15, wat een goede prijs is). Daarnaast is de DLC voor dit spel vrij matig tot slecht en zou ik niet aanraden om dit erbij te kopen.","timestamp_created":1482796073,"timestamp_updated":1482796073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28690959","author":{"steamid":"76561198125279870","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1199,"last_played":1483144153},"language":"english","review":"This is the only game I own that warrants a second play.

I love the whole series but this one takes the cake out of all of them! every game has its faults and infinite is no different, but overall very enjoyable experience. if you liked the previous games you'll like this one and if you hated the pervious games you'd probably still like this one, its a very different experience from the others.\n\nI do have to say it was a little too linear compared to the previous ones, there's very little room to explore or wander from the path or story. some games are like that, I suppose. had there been more off the path secrets or lore it would have enhanced the experience a bit more.","timestamp_created":1482781033,"timestamp_updated":1482781033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28683563","author":{"steamid":"76561198063456514","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":2524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2200,"last_played":1577872092},"language":"english","review":"is gud","timestamp_created":1482780452,"timestamp_updated":1482780452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28683317","author":{"steamid":"76561198169216526","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":906,"last_played":1492438672},"language":"english","review":"Definitively recommend this game, and Bioshock 1 (not a big fan of the 2nd one). But to start with Infinite it's not really necessary to have played this franchise before. I played Infinite first then took a liking to it and played the first one, who ultimately are connected later in the DLCs of Infinite (which are VERY story rich, like the final season to your favorite show it is important you play Buried at Sea).\nIf you're looking for a game in which you can submerge, this is one of those games. The vintage (and veeeery subtle cyber/metal/ish) decor is dense and the storyline is delicately woven, of course knowing the ending makes you sit in front of your screen for thirty minutes after blowing your brain; a REAL, shock. Plus, it has a light-hearted philosophical side that meddles with the science. \n\nI love love love this franchise and this precise game which I've replayed numerous times and never regretted buying it!","timestamp_created":1482780017,"timestamp_updated":1482780017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28682985","author":{"steamid":"76561198011777480","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":755,"last_played":1489837634},"language":"french","review":"C'est bien mais bon, pas vraiment la merveille vendue par les critiques et certains joueurs.","timestamp_created":1482779350,"timestamp_updated":1482779350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv6qintkCea61bQ=="}
