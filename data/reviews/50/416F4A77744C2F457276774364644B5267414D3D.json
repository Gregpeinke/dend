半条命系列中最棒的DLC [/h1]\n1998年发售的《半条命1》相信是许多玩家的启蒙之作和童年回忆，这款20多年前的游戏即使现在玩起来也依然很有趣：扮演一名科学家逃离危险重重的黑山基地并直捣异形老巢，这段奇妙而刺激的旅途真是令人难忘，而更加令人难忘的莫过于那一个个被猎奇的异形吓得肾虚的童年阴影。《半条命1》凭借开创性的演出方式和游戏性影响了FPS乃至整个游戏界的发展，玩家们乐此不疲地一遍遍通关，并欲求不满地大声哭诉要求V社带来更多这样的游戏。而一年后的1999年，他们的愿望就实现了。\n《针锋相对》是《半条命1》的第一个DLC，发售于1999年，制作组并不是V社，而是《无主之地》系列的开发商Gearbox。本作可以说是出道即巅峰，《针锋相对》至今都被公认为最棒的一部DLC。如同标题，在本作中我们扮演的就是《半条命1》中的敌对势力：一名叫阿德里安·谢泼德的陆战队员，22岁，是下士。虽然在同一个时间和地点，但在本作中我们将会以不同的视角来见证黑山事件。\n本作的训练关可以说是比原版的《半条命》有趣得多，你站在宿舍里听教官挨个训话，瞬间就让人想起《全金属外壳》中的名场面。然后你在训练场中不断学习各种基础操作和游戏机制，比如操作电台、爬绳子等，在你训练时教官会一直在你身边大吼大叫。而且很多训练场地都是在开阔的室外，所以相比于《半条命1》的训练关，这个军营让人感觉更加生机勃勃。\n进入游戏后，主角乘坐的运输机遇袭后坠毁。当你醒来后你发现自己位于黑山基地的一个医务室内，你并未收到杀死戈登·弗里曼和其他科学家的命令，而当你和总部取得联系后他们也只是让你赶快撤离，所以你扮演的并非真正意义上的反派。你还会看见科学家们也在救助其他受伤的陆战队员，因为他们也不知道你其实是来灭口的，当然如果你愿意的话也可以像个疯子一样整死路上遇到的所有人，反正《半条命1》的一大乐趣就是如此。\n本作中的武器基本不变，新武器包括一把沙鹰，算是取代了《半条命1》中的左轮手枪的位置，但由于你获得它的时间比较早，而且子弹补给也非常多，特别是还有激光瞄准，个人认为比左轮手枪好很多；传送枪，一发就能把异形送回老家，可以看作是半条命版的BFG；M249轻机枪，伤害非常夸张，但弹药比较稀少，而且容量只有50发。除此之外你还会获得不少外星武器，比如电蚁枪，类似于蜂巢枪，弹药无限但有冷却时间，而且伤害和精度都很不错，所以它不仅是弹药耗尽后的替代品（水中慎用）；藤壶，相信很多玩家都比较熟悉，但本作中你可以把它拿在手上，它实际上更像是一种道具，功能类似于绳钩枪；孢子虫，最有趣的一把武器，普通敌人被打中直接爆成血块，而换弹动作是给它喂孢子，让它看起来更像是一只宠物。总之在流程中不停地获得新武器可以让玩家保持一种新鲜感，也给了玩家继续玩下去的动力，而这些新的武器也是为了对付新的敌人。\n在《针锋相对》中，人类敌人被换成了黑衣特工（包括原版中的黑衣女刺客），毕竟如果缺少人类敌人总会让人感觉少了些什么。很多人第一次玩《半条命》就感觉女刺客和HECU是一伙的（虽然V社可能压根没有想让他们一起登场），但从《针锋相对》中来看明显不是——他们其实是政府派来的特工，目的是消灭一切生命体并以小型核弹摧毁黑山基地。除了黑衣人以外，《针锋相对》中还有一个新的外星势力——X族，他们并不来自Xen，只是趁Xen与地球的传送门开启时来到了黑山，虽然他们的行为和攻击模式没有变化，但这些新型外星生物的登场还是让人耳目一新。\n在流程方面，NPC队友也是本作最大的亮点之一。在游戏中你经常会遇到很多落单的陆战队员，医疗兵可以帮你和其他队友加血，工程兵则可以帮你开门。不过在一些高强度战斗中，他们也能发挥不小的作用，遗憾的是他们不仅死得快，而且其略显弱智的AI也足够能把你气出内伤：你经常跑着跑着回头一看发现他们没影了，甚至在交火中会主动冲到你的枪前。不过他们跟着你的那段时间确实能让流程少一些孤独感，而且这些队友的配音也比较优秀，显得比黑山的科学家和保安们更具有个性，让你见到他们时倍感亲切。\n总而言之，《针锋相对》在游戏流程大体上没有改变，但它在原版的关卡设计上取其精华，用更加有趣的方式将优秀的内容展现给玩家。游戏中有很多关卡都给你一种既视感，比如那个巨大蠕虫的BOSS战，与原版的触手几乎相差无几，只不过格局更小、节奏更快。还有一些Xen的跳台关卡，不过仅仅占了很小一部分，而且很快就结束了。整个游戏就像是一个更加紧凑的《半条命1》体验，从捡起扳手到干掉最终BOSS，这四五个小时的流程中几乎没有任何拖泥带水和枯燥乏味的部分，这就是为什么《针锋相对》被认为是《半条命》系列中最棒的DLC，它不仅完美复刻了《半条命1》的成功，并加入了新的内容拓展世界观。但可惜的是这部DLC的剧情貌似一直没有被采纳，也就是说它的地位几乎相当于一部官方授权的同人，这也让很多粉丝感到失望，毕竟游戏结尾留下了一个伏笔，暗示谢泼德成为了一个关键人物，大家都想知道他之后的故事，不过可惜的是《针锋相对》的续作估计再也等不到了。","timestamp_created":1635001727,"timestamp_updated":1635001727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.652748167514801025","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101459926","author":{"steamid":"76561198079211433","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":330,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":330,"last_played":1634938142},"language":"brazilian","review":"Tão

tedioso de jugar. Pasárselo se siente como un trabajo.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]La exploración es buena. Muchos niveles tienen varias salas interconectadas entre sí. Si pones atención, puedes encontrar lugares con objetos para recoger.\n\n[*]Los sonidos de los enemigos que se oyen a por el mapa funcionan genial para añadir tensión.\n\n[*]Hay armas nuevas respecto al juego original.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Contras:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]El manejo del personaje es malísimo. Se mueve demasiado rápido para los espacios tan cerrados en los que tiene lugar la acción. No puedes apuntar bien mientras te mueves en espacios tan pequeños y a distancias tan cortas. Pero si no te mueves rápido, te acribillan. Y el personaje también se desliza al frenar. A eso añade que hay sitios en los que tienes que saltar de altura en altura. Y, si te caes, pierdes un buen pedazo de vida.\n\n[*]Los combates con enemigos son muy tediosos. Se mueven muy rápido, y te acribillan muy fácilmente. Sobretodo, cuando aparecen en tu cara nada más abres una puerta. Aunque no te maten, te quitan más vida de lo que te puedes permitir a largo plazo, para enfrentar los siguientes encuentros. Así que tienes que recargar y repetir casi siempre.\n\n[*]Los soldados vienen corriendo hasta tu cara y te disparan en la cara mientras te echan granadas.\n\n[*]El jefe final es malísimo. Tras pasarte el juego matando alienígenas a base de pegar tiros con distintas armas, al jefe final tienes matarlo disparándole en dos puntos puntos del cuerpo diferentes, con un par de armas especiales que hay colocadas en dos sitios distintos de la sala. Cuando le disparas en los dos sitios, abre un punto débil al que tienes que seguir disparando para matarle. Tras unos segundos, esconde el punto débil, y a repetir. Toda la pelea final consiste en repetir ese proceso varias veces seguidas. Entre iteraciones, hace emerger a un único soldado alienígena normal y corriente de los que has matado a decenas. Por una parte, se agradece que sea fácil. Porque, a esas alturas del juego, sólo tienes ganas de terminarlo cuanto antes y olvidarte ya de él. Pero es que, además de fácil, es soso. No se siente como pelear contra un jefe. Se siente como pasarte 10 minutos dando vueltas por una sala para tocar el mismo par de botones muchas veces. Lo único que se siente como una pelea es matar al enemigo que emerge entre iteraciones. Y eso, al mismo tiempo, se siente como simple relleno. Muy cutre todo.\n\n[*]Para pasar una parte tienes que activar una visión nocturna de la que no te hablan en ningún lado.\n\n[*]Con algunas armas, la mirilla se te fija automáticamente sobre los enemigos al pasarla cerca de ellos. Hace que apuntar a veces sea difícil.\n\n[*]La mirilla de algunas armas a veces ni se ve. Especialmente con la visión nocturna. Tanto la mirilla como el filtro de visión nocturna son de color verde. Cuesta apuntar.\n\n[*]Errores:\n[list]\n[*]Algunas puertas funcionan mal. Aunque se puedan abrir, no siempre se abren al darle al botón. Te tienes que acercar y alejar para que se abran. A veces, tienes que hacer eso en varias ocasiones, porque tampoco funciona siempre. En ocasiones, esto pasa mientras hay enemigos que te disparan al otro lado de la puerta, para mejorar las cosas.\n\n[*]El juego está a doblado a castellano a medias. Algunos personajes hablan en ingles. Otros en castellano. Otros dicen algunas frases en un idioma, y otras frases en el otro.\n\n[*]En un nivel, se me empezaron a corromper las partidas guardadas a partir de cierto punto. Al cargar y repetir esa parte, dejó de pasar. Pero podría haber perdido todo el progreso.\n\n[*]No consigo jugar directamente al juego en Steam. Me dice que lo está ejecutando, pero no arranca. He tenido que instalar el [i]Hal-Life[/i] original, abrirlo, y cambiar de juego desde su menú principal.\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1634922472,"timestamp_updated":1634986929,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101423557","author":{"steamid":"76561199159643833","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":156,"last_played":1632757476},"language":"russian","review":"Крутая игрушка!

Shephard plays exactly like Gordon in terms of gameplay, so Half-Life players will be able to get into Opposing Force with relative ease. The story focuses on the military perspective during the events of Half-Life and even references events from the main game. It's a nice change of pace compared to playing as Gordon again, but Shephard's campaign isn't quite as epic of a journey as Freeman's was in Half-Life.\n\n[b]Opposing Force- Expanding upon the original[/b]\nOpposing Force introduces new weapons, enemies, and locations to the game, which all serve as great additions to this expansion. There's also some returning guns, aliens, and areas that players may recognize if they've played Half-Life.\nScientists and security guards will assist Shephard in more minor roles but they won't be following him around the various maps. Instead, military soldiers will help Shephard in firefights and they are much better suited for combat than the security guards. Shephard's military allies are great, but don't expect them to last long against aliens on their own.\n     As this is an expansion, Opposing Force is a shorter experience than the main game, taking around 5 hours to complete on average. Considering that its about half the length and released only a year after Half-Life, this little expansion does a great job at giving a fun experience akin to Half-Life.\n\n[b]Rating: A full-force game that I'm not opposed to[/b]\nI give this game an 8/10. Opposing Force is a great expansion that expands upon Half-Life with its own additions, and while I ultimately enjoyed Gordon's route more, this expansion does a great job at offering enough new content to make it one worth buying.","timestamp_created":1634726522,"timestamp_updated":1634904284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101329569","author":{"steamid":"76561198874850960","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1405,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":685,"last_played":1639859717},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1634710359,"timestamp_updated":1634710359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101327267","author":{"steamid":"76561198066935531","num_games_owned":202,"num_reviews":172,"playtime_forever":1189,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1189,"last_played":1505279033},"language":"english","review":"I enjoyed this more than the original Half-Life","timestamp_created":1634704735,"timestamp_updated":1634704735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101323088","author":{"steamid":"76561198045155461","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":117,"last_played":1450711940},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1634695786,"timestamp_updated":1634695786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101313603","author":{"steamid":"76561198035580869","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":391,"last_played":1634589262},"language":"english","review":"This one is also perfectly cromulent. It embiggens the Half-Life experience by adding a new campaign that runs parallel to the   events of the OG game. That is to say, about three quarters of it in terms of the length of it. You play as an anonymous marine sent into the Black Mesa research centre to neutralise the place after our good friend Morgan Freeman kinda caused aliens to invade the place. While in the main game the marines were trying to kill the shit out of Freeman, you never meet him in this. But you do contend a whole host of aliens (including new ones) and annoying-ass Black Ops agents who run around faster than Sonic.\n\nThere's new weapons too. Too many perhaps, and you find them thicc and fast. Before getting to grips with one I was picking up another. These include alien weapons, like the Spore Launcher, which is essentially a living fish thing that fires spores, and you reload it by feeding it's mouth with these spores you pick up. Rad. And the Barnacle Grapple, which is a weaponized version of one of those fuckers hanging from the ceiling that pull you up in the original game. Anyway, you can use it to grapple onto organic objects, and reach far and high places. The Displacer Cannon is the weirdest, firing a ball that teleports enemies to the world of Xen. And it's alternate use transports yourself to Xen. I found the game too short to really make full use of all these, though. There's a sniper rifle to replace the crossbow, but it arrives quite late. You occasionally run into fellow marines, and you can get them to follow you and help out in combat. Well, attempt to help. They're usually about as useful as nipples on an arse, dying very soon and not killing any enemies in the process.\n\nAt the end of the day though, I'd totally recommend it if you enjoyed the original game. This is a great example of an add-on done right. A relatively beefy standalone experience in itself. Long before the days of all this arsehole micro-transaction bollocks.\n\n9/10","timestamp_created":1634679222,"timestamp_updated":1634679222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101292712","author":{"steamid":"76561199165115859","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":518,"last_played":1634647182},"language":"russian","review":"Данное дополнение позволяет посмотреть на историю со стороны вояки Шепарда.Сначала я думал,что длс тупо проходное,но как я ошибался...Мы порой видим моменты идентичны с hl1,но с другой стороны,про новый контент так-же не забыли.Новые пришельцы,локации оружие.Концовка тоже завораживает,однозначно рекомендую к прохождению!","timestamp_created":1634647635,"timestamp_updated":1634647635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101267178","author":{"steamid":"76561198148362973","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":485,"last_played":1635345128},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life: Opposing Force - лучший аддон к Half-Life\nСоветую!","timestamp_created":1634591992,"timestamp_updated":1634591992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101253261","author":{"steamid":"76561199178234797","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":383,"last_played":1652468073},"language":"english","review":"sus","timestamp_created":1634571407,"timestamp_updated":1634571407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101235030","author":{"steamid":"76561198874447011","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":380,"last_played":1628476199},"language":"spanish","review":"La mejor expancion de Half-Life por mucho, seria hermoso ver a Shephard en un futuro de nuevo","timestamp_created":1634535208,"timestamp_updated":1634535208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101233210","author":{"steamid":"76561198141688633","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":276,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":276,"last_played":1585628846},"language":"english","review":"Expansion Pack > DLC","timestamp_created":1634530869,"timestamp_updated":1634530869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101231447","author":{"steamid":"76561199150706257","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":274,"last_played":1629803350},"language":"english","review":"Easily the better of the two half-life expansions, refining and building upon what was already so great in half-life itself.

Game is supposed to be fps but its traumatizing, you hear it right. Playing this game should be considered self harm at least for me it was. I had really bad times with those scary fish in half life one but it was amazing game so i enjoyed the rest where they werent. But this expansion is something else. Gearbox messed up they turned tactical shooter into horror. Okay so do you remember those Xen monsters? They were pretty cool but then Gearbox came and said. \"We throw original monsters away and introduce new terrifying ones that will run against you or throw stuff but mainly run against you to make you scared\" Yup they introduced race X what is really bad concept to throw bunch of nobodies in established lore. But those monsters will scare you for your life, iam not making this up, game is unplayable because they are often placing them behind edges to jumpscare you, but the sewers are big no go they just said: \"You know what? Lets make infinite spawner of them and you have to run against them to make them stop spawning\" Its the worst experience in my life i had to had 2 months break to be available to make it. Boss fight is trash they made something that looks like those tentacle flower from blast pit but has nothing in common with them and you just have to shoot its eye. Please if you are a girl or person that scares easily dont play this game for god sake, you will thank me later.","timestamp_created":1634141526,"timestamp_updated":1634141526,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.432253360748291016","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100994739","author":{"steamid":"76561198304478318","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":35,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1660443452},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buena expansión mucho mejor qué el zzzzz de blue shift\n\nShephard tiene qué volver si o si en un futuro a la saga.\nPROSPEKT no existe","timestamp_created":1634138697,"timestamp_updated":1634138697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100974627","author":{"steamid":"76561198054762942","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":577,"last_played":1634103623},"language":"english","review":"Fun and well paced.
