This as a Bioshock game was just not a Bioshock game. It's not the setting I had a problem with. It was absolutely gorgeous. Moving around freely is a fun concept, but it still felt linear, and it had you revisit the same area more than once. I just kind of got tired of seeing the same scenes over and over again. The story was just not Bioshock level.\n\n[h1] Bout to ramble for a long time, so just skip to overall if you're not interested [/h1]\n\nBioshock had excellent world building. The setting was explained and fully flushed out, the enemies had explanation as to why they were the way they were, and the atmosphere of the first two were great, though the second one wasn't as atmospheric as the first imo. \n\nThis game was just \"eh\" as a Bioshock. I've seen people state that this is a masterpiece in story telling, which, to each their own, but in all honesty, it was very lacking in character development. It definitely had problems with pacing, and it would introduce a character, [spoiler] like Mr. Chen, [/spoiler] and then have them serve no purpose in the plot. [spoiler] They just immediately kill him off right after you meet him, and you develop no relationship with him. He just dies, then he dies again. You two never actually meet in game. Then there's the other lady who's trying to start a revolution on Columbia. I was interested when I met her because I thought she'd be interesting, and her and Booker would have some form of interesting dynamic. You just meet her once, do the time multiverse traveling thing, and then she just dies. How am I supposed to care about a person who I've barely had a conversation with.? [/spoiler] \n\nThen there's the issues of the main characters. I was pretty interested in Booker as a character when the game started. I wanted to know what his debt was, why he was traveling to Columbia, what's driving him so far, but as the game progressed, I just despised him for being so boring and basic. His personality is \"PEW PEW I've gotta get the girl and pay off 'the debt' *ominous ominous angst*\". He's just your basic [i] badass [/i] protagonist. He's basically just some anime man who's saving [i] the damsel in distress [/i]. I was honestly more interested in the sibling duo who built Columbia. What were their ambitions? What did they want Columbia to be? Is this what they imagined it to be? Instead, we get dramatic backstory and angst and Booker is just [i] such a Chad [/i].\n\nNow, I've ragged on Booker, but now I have to talk about Elizabeth. She's the basic damsel, but she has some #girlboss elements. I hate her with a burning passion. I don't know if I hate Booker more or Elizabeth more, but they're both a great duo. She's just basically exposition. She doesn't really have much personality. I thought she was pretty neat when I first met her. She could pick locks, she got to explore the world she was shut off from the first time, and she was actually pretty useful in the game. But for some reason, half way in the game, after having no discussion with Booker about why he's saved her at all, she's shocked he lied about his intentions. \n\nShe accepted the fact that this random man just decided to save her from her prison, but she's shocked he had ulterior motives. By this point in the game, I don't care about either of them. Oh, and she's also just kind of dumb. She's explains \"I can't just make rifts anywhere. There's gotta be a rift nearby to open,\" which is fine if they didn't just contradict themselves near the very end of the game. [spoiler] \"OH WAIT I REMEMBER I COULD MAKE RIFTS TO ANYWHERE I WANTED BUT THEN THE TOWER SIPHONED MY POWERS AND I COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORRREEE!!!\" [/spoiler] She could have waited till they both got out of Columbia safely and then somewhere along the way split, but naaahhhhhhhhhhh, this established smart character is suddenly dumb now.\n\n [spoiler] \"I'VE KNOCKED OUT THE PROTECTION AND NOW WE ARE AMBUSHED!\" How did the revolution even get a blimp to ambush them with anyways? Without alerting the guards? While being stuck in the slums? While also being in need of weapons, because that's why the lady asked you to get guns to trade for the blimp. Stealth? Did they somehow get a blimp without alerting the guards? Booker just murders everyone with guns, but everyone is on the lookout for him. Wouldn't Columbia be on full alert? There's a homicidal man who has killed hundreds at this point. Did they just have a blimp in storage? Where did they put it? Do they have a hideout? I wish the Vox were developed more. A lot of the people in the story really need development. [/spoiler]\n\nThe main bad guy's turn! He's also, surprise, boring. You hardly interact or hear from him most of the game. I wish they did develop him; it's a missed opportunity. Normally, cult leaders are very charming and manipulative. You don't see any points where he charms or manipulates the people or situation. It also doesn't show him exploiting the people other than \"haha they die for me.\" It shows a societal structure based on poverty and pure racism, but it doesn't show how he benefits from that. It just establishes the mentality of those in Columbia. He's just incredibly uninteresting. It doesn't show how he takes advantage of vulnerable people. The people hardly show their beliefs in the things he's been teaching them because you hardly see what he's been teaching them. WHY THE SKY CULT? WHY THESE BELIEFS? What kind of PERSON is he? \n\nAndrew Ryan was a hypocrite. He was a narcissist. He was good at charming people. He was a monstrous capitalist. The man left children he promised would be in good care in awful condition. The man took advantage of people he worked with. He was interesting in every sense of the word, and you didn't have to meet him in person to get to know him. You learned about him from the people he affected. \n\nThe cult daddy? He's there. Then you kill him, not before he leaves some more *mysterious dramatic backstory* about the two. I don't think anyone would be surprised about you killing the bad guy. Did I maybe miss a bunch of the voice tapes? I'd like to think not, because I almost have every tape. [spoiler] His backstory was mildly interesting. If we could have gotten clearer understanding of how Booker became this just because he got baptized, that'd be great. If Booker had any character or personality, that'd be great. The Bioshock 1 and 2 protags didn't have any or much character at all, so eh I guess. I would rather a blank board than this, in all honesty. Just preference, though. [/spoiler]\n\nThe DLC:\nI'm not crazy about it. It just doesn't have the Rapture feel, despite being set in Rapture. Maybe it's too soon for me to make that judgement. So far, I'm not too crazy about it. I'm not sure how I feel about full grown Elizabeth. She's neat, but it feels like she has even less character than the main game. Eh.\n\nThe enemies:\nBland. They don't explain them much, but it kind of makes sense. They're cult lads and lassies. I wish they explained the technology they had, and the weird cyborg men. They do kind of explain the technology. Rifts to the future can be opened, so maybe they just stole and plagiarized from those. Just wish the developments in science were at least mentioned.\n\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\n\nThe game was still a fun experience. It's definitely a well done shooter game, and if you pretend it's not a Bioshock game, then it's just average. It's not bad, but I wouldn't call it phenomenal. It had a lot to live up to, and it didn't really meet that expectation. There was just a lot that felt off in execution. If you're an anime fan, I can see you enjoying this. I just think they tried to do too much with the story that it couldn't all fit.","timestamp_created":1630391779,"timestamp_updated":1630391779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98547209","author":{"steamid":"76561199000143007","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":91,"last_played":1631166633},"language":"latam","review":"Cuiden a Elizabeth a cualquier costo chic@s <3","timestamp_created":1630389672,"timestamp_updated":1630457350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98544413","author":{"steamid":"76561198871972355","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1659,"last_played":1630382403},"language":"russian","review":"Я считаю, что эта игра шедевр, ну или же близка к нему\nПлюсы: отличнейший визуал (по началу даже не верится, что это шутер); сочетание красивого мира и жестокости (крови тут будет много); необычный и запутанный сюжет; геймплэй с добавлением различных способностей (в игре они называются энергетики, их всего 8); Элизабет (наша спутница в игре, то вокруг чего крутится сюжет); куча экшена, динамики и эффектов; в игре можно встретить сайтквесты по пути; сюжет рассказывают через \"голософон\", что то типо рации, так что в игре будет мало моментов молчание, к тому же у вас есть спутница.\nМинусы: большинство энергетиков вы не будете использовать при прохождении основной игры (по факту у вас будет 3 любимых); сюжет может показаться затянутым и просто надоест в середине игры (в середине сюжет таков: сходи туда, поговори с тем, потом туда, сделай то, и если в начале это было интересно, в середине для меня было скучно); нелогичность в истории (иногда игра противоречит самой себе); высокая сложность может показаться дизболансной.\nИгра получилась очень даже годной, насыщенной, а конец вас удивит, если бы эта игра была фильмом, то получился бы отличный голливудский боевик с кучей экшена и эффектов.

It doesn't trust you to be able to read a map so they removed it, you won't need it though because it doesn't trust you\nenough to explore so instead of expanding the level design they ironed out any branching paths except when the game decides to have some random hallway or room to the side\nfor you to go, found the audio log? good boy now back to the objective! \n\nspeaking of audio logs, the idea was a neat way of combining traditional narrative and environmental storytelling. The problem is they never dared to improve upon it\nso you still have the same old problem of picking up an audiolog moving an inch and some scripted sequence of dialogue happening over the audio log playing forcing you\nto stay still while it plays which destroys any sense of momentum or saving them for latter which defeats any possibly of environmental storytelling. Audio logs should be\nscarce and located where they can provide some meaningful context to the scene's aftermath you are observing.\n\nvigors do not have a logical explanation for existing like in previous entries but they all work exactly the same and it's kinda funny having the game explaining you how to set up a trap\nfor the 16th time.\n\nElizabeth's rifts are small advantages you can bring forth for arenas like ammo caches, vantage points, health packs,etc. you can only choose one but most of them are worthless compared \nto turrets and weapons\n\nlate game is where the game picks up in pace and starts being almost fun. More open arenas, more rails, more enemies.  The story finally gets going until it throws some convoluted mumbo jumbo that is both\nvery simplistic and very im14andthisisverydeep causing it to fall flat on its face although in an elegant manner.\n\n[b] Heavy spoilers warning! [/b]\n\n[spoiler] I do find the ending's message to be absolutely despicable as the protagonist seems to be an allegory for white people as whole (DeWitt means the white in dutch) and the guilt they should feel for the atrocities of colonization \"Broken-knee\". Guilt that can not be washed away, nor by baptism (turning into Comstock) nor by forgiveness. The only way forward is a literal witch hunt throughout the multiverse in search for every possible version of DeWitt even the versions that have yet not sinned and as so elegantly put by the main characters \"smother him in the crib\". [/spoiler] wow! such amazing writing levine /s\n\nport-wise bioshock games always had garbage ports and although this is doesn't seem to have the instability of previous games is still shoddy at best. \nthe game's artstyle is nothing short of amazing with great vistas and locales. Although graphically they kept this tendency of unreal 3 engine-powered games of cranking bloom so high everything becomes a blurry mess, making some enemies more than 10m away from you kind of hard to spot.\nsensitivity has the problem of having 10 discrete values and the first one being to low while the second being way to high and the rest outright unplayable.\n\ni can't really recommend bioshock infinite unless you really wanna experience it firsthand and the dlcs tie the saga together (will update review when i play them.) \nbut do yourself a favor and do not play it on hard, it only buffs enemies stats and make the game's design flaws stand out even more so.\n\nEdit.\nBurial at Sea review:\n Really slow early on with scripted walking segments ,small and linear rooms and ammo starvation. But midway through it opens up  the levels a little bit reminding you what was so good about bioshock in the first place.\nCombined with infinite's additions like rails and mechanized patriots. Which feel out of place in rapture but then again, you go from rapture before the fall to a broken down\nsection that exists further below. \nThanks to the magic of plot convenience to give back that broken down and oppressive atmosphere the first 2 games had. \nWhich they nailed.\n \nThe second part is more stealth heavy since elizabeth can't stand as many hits as booker and it is for the better since you are more concerned about navigation of the level than padded out combat arenas. \n\nThe weapon wheel is back and the enviromental applications of plasmids don't feel out of place thanks to how tightly packed the levels are instead of having a huge open arena with a small random puddle of oil sitting in the middle.\n\n The story is as nonsensical as it was on infinite's ending although is interesting to see what happens around you specially on the second part of the dlc, and how it connects both settings although i can't say im happy with the result. Levine meddled with something he shouldn't have and muddied the narrative into such a convoluted mess that there is no savaging it now.\n I think there is no way the saga could go forward in the same setting, putting rapture to rest and moving to something completely new is the only way forward.\n\nIn the end Bioshock is like that forest in Arcadia.\n\"On the surface, I once bought a forest. The Parasites claimed that the land belonged to God, and demanded that I establish a public park there. Why? \nSo the rabble could stand slack-jawed under the canopy and pretend that it was paradise earned. \nWhen Congress moved to nationalize my forest, I burnt it to the ground. God did not plant the seeds of this Arcadia; I did.\"","timestamp_created":1630253263,"timestamp_updated":1639676978,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.647031664848327637","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98446977","author":{"steamid":"76561199021199684","num_games_owned":173,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":793,"last_played":1630242835},"language":"turkish","review":"Asıl oyun ve DLC sonlarında beyin a m cı k l a n ması yaşatan oyun. \n\nBioShock 1 ve 2'de bulunan o boğucu hava ve monoton oynanış gitmiş yerine mükemmel grafikler, harika bi renk paleti ve bi o kadar güzel bir hikaye gelmiş.

The gameplay here is fine, but gets old really fast while the story is a monumental step down from the previous ones. Bioshock Infinite has the deph of a puddle and knows no subtlety, or moderation. Without spoiling it, I can only say that the events in this story start as black and white conflict vaguely resembling the first games, and by the end it goes completely off the rails in the most pretentious way I've ever seen in a game. Personally? I was starting to skip entire sections just to get it over with, I couldn't take any more of this meaningless nonsense.
