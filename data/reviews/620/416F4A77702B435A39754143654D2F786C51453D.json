The moment I started I couldn't stop, thankfully not on a workday I played for 9 hours straight. The campaign was so immersive as the main character unravels the lore of the facility. The lore is a fascinating and enjoyable one to play through and truly hilarious at times with all the shenanigans that's going on. \n\nI hadn't had any experience whilst playing where I felt lost or stuck, if just put in more time and examination everything sorts itself out and progess can continue. All puzzles aren't too complex and shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to complete (on the more dificult ones). \n\nThe environment is insanely immersive with massive amounts of detail of the smallest degree placed in the most obscure places but keep in mind not everything is part of the decor, some may be clues to either complete the puzzle you're in or more info to add onto the lore. Even though your character is unable to speak you are kept involved with the dialogue exchanged with the third party member within the game, whether it be the casual insult or storyboard information/ instructions.\n\nThis game is compatible with both consol controllers and mouse w/ keyboard. Though playing with a controller is fun; it's much more efficient to use mouse w/ keybaord as some puzzles involve quick movements in order to complete them.\n\nI'm not much of a singleplayer kind of gamer but this is one of those rare occasions where a game absorbs you and this is one of the best I've experienced. Multiplayer is a plus. 10/10 fantastic polished game.

While Portal 2 certainly has a beginning and you could jump straight into it and be entertained, I highly recommend starting with it's predecessor, Portal. I could give you a number of logical reasons for this: you'll be better used to the unique gameplay and be more engaged in story, characters and world, just for starters. But the main reason I recommend doing it this way is for the feeling of having your mind blown by just what a monumental leap forward Portal 2 is in every single aspect of what makes a game special.\n\nSo just how special is Portal 2? Well, I've been gaming for nearly 20 years. I've not played as many of the classics as I'd have liked to, but I've been through more of my fair share of the games you'll find in all those 'Top 10/50/100 Games Of All Time / Games To Play Before You Die' articles, videos and so on. Over this long period of time I've experienced a variety of platforms and genres and gone from A to Z (or in my case, Advance Wars to Zelda!) Portal 2 is up there with the very, very best. It feels as though if Pixar made a video game, this would be the result. You could make the case that it isn't as free or expansive a world to play in as Grand Theft Auto 5, The Witcher 3 or Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, but within it's linear world it sure feels as good as playing any of those.\n\nSo let's talk about the world of Portal 2: Aperture Science. The first incarnation of this place (Portal) was intriguing, with all it's clean and modern test chambers, walkways, observation rooms and the vents, ducts, pipes and graffiti behind them. Portal 2 takes this place and builds upon it so dramatically and enormously that it might take your breath away. Within it's opening scene you are given a glimpse at the size of the Aperture operation, right before the game catapults you into more familiar territory but with the twist of old age. As the story develops, it's possible to feel like Alice in Wonderland, amazed at how deep the rabbit hole goes.\n\nThe game matches this expansion by expanding the story and characters right along with it. From the start you're given a companion in the form of Wheatley, a small white spherical robot with a single blue eye who can only travel along a rail attached to the ceiling. Wheatley is voiced brilliantly by Stephen Merchant and comes across as an eccentric, harmless and amusing counterpart. This is a deliberate development by Valve to contrast Wheatley with that of the game's other main character - the returning GLaDOS, Aperture Science's opposing, all-powerful super intelligence with passive-aggressive tendencies and more than a bone to pick with Chell (Ellen McLain's performance walks this fine line with ease). Not only does the game develop these two characters so well, it even gives them a twist halfway through the story and then sprinkles another memorable character on top via the amusing voice of Cave Johnston (J. K. Simmons), founder of Aperture Science. The work of the performers, writers and animators in all of this is some of the best you'll see in video gaming.\n\nSo now we've got this world, the story and it's characters... but there's still so much more! In terms of gameplay and mechanics and exploration, once again these aspects of Portal are brought over and then just blown up with spectacular style. The game throws in lasers, redirection cubes, light bridges, launch pads, light funnels and three types of gelatinous liquids. Combinations of all these result in some truly mind-bending puzzles, but the solution is never far away and always rewarding. I think the play-testing of Portal 2 before release must have been very extensive because the balance of problem-to-solution and challenge-to-reward feels near perfect. Just before the game's final set-piece, you're given another problem to solve: a red button which causes a section of pipe to twist 180 degrees and release a series of small bombs. Behind you is a pipe, flowing with white portal conducting gel which you need. There's no other way out. It's not difficult to work out what to do, but what's important to note here is that the game's designers aren't just throwing a puzzle at you just for the sake of it: there's a reason for this. Later when you're in the heat of the final confrontation, you'll see the very same pipe with it's flowing white contents. As Lara Croft would say: \"A-ha!\" This example is not an isolated case either - it's the whole friggin' game, and it's been designed with the care of a master craftsman. Daedalus himself would be proud of this Labyrinth.\n\nThis covers most of what makes the game special but there's a few other things worth noting. Firstly, the music and sound enhances the experience without overwhelming it. Just like other classic games, another layer of percussion is added to the existing music depending on what the player is doing - and the game also knows when to fade the music off and on entirely. Secondly, it's still a great looking game and although elements of the Source engine look outdated it's amazing how well it's held up considering it was launched in 2004 (albeit with updates over the years!) The age of the engine holds one big advantage too: it will probably run maxed out on any modern PC at high resolutions.\n\nCan I criticize the game in any way? Well, only just, and it's really nitpiciking. Apart from the Source engine showing it's age a little, The Aperture Science facility tries hard to ground itself in the real world - the problem there is that it's really inconcievable that such a place could exist! You might say 'it's only a game/fantasy world!' but the game itself tries to convince you you're in an old salt mine along with $70,000,000 worth of moon rocks which Cave Johnson can't afford, amongst other things. There were moments of the game I was just a little broken out of its world by this, thinking, \"Nah!\" or \"No way!\" or \"Really?\" To be fair, if the game were too real it wouldn't be the fantastical place it needs to be, maybe I should be thinking more along the lines of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. It's also possible that other players may find themselves stuck, staring at far-off places with no idea how to get there.\n\nThat said, I still can't help but feel Portal 2 is a five-star classic masterpiece and an experience not to be missed. This game itself is a big reason why there are gamers on the Internet desperate for scraps of information on the possible existence of Half-Life 3, because Portal 2 is a shining example of just what Valve can do. I'm not too sure where it sits among all the greatest games of all time... but it's up there, somewhere at the very top.
