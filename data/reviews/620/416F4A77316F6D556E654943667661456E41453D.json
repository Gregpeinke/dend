Videospiele die für euch so toll waren das ihr auf eine Fortsetzung hofft. Dann präsentiere ich euch den \"Epic Hoffungszerstörer-Simulator\". Dieses Spiel zeigt euch wie gut Valve Spiele machen kann aber dennoch immer ein Cliffhänger am Ende setzt, somit Leute auf eine Fortsetzung fragen, die sie nie bekommen. Natürlich hat dies auch seine Vorteile, da Ihr beispielsweise eurem kleinen nervigen Bruder dieses Spiel zeigen könnt und er dann auch eine 3 sehen will. Wenn er dies tut, sagt einfach Ihr würdet mit Valve arbeiten und Ihr würdet nur eine Fortsetzung machen, wenn er schön brav ist und aufhört zu nerven. Doch innerlich in eurem Herzen wollt Ihr doch auch eine 3. Ihr könnt euch beruhigen, denn ich habe vor mit Valve auf die \"1mal1 Universität für Studenten und Spieleentwickler (Die keine Fortsetzungen machen)\" zu gehen und dort nach fünf Jahre erfolgreich bis 3 zu zählen. \n\n\n\nMomentmal!

It's pretty simple and straight forward but keeps me coming back when bored of other, newer games. Graphics are pretty respectable for it's age but it doesn't take a monster PC to play so I'm able to play co-op with friends who only have basic laptops. I've played through the story several times and still love the snarky commentary while going through the puzzles. I've got nearly 50 hours in this game (at the time of writing this but it will definitely keep going up) and about 8 hours in the first portal. Honestly, I would probably have more hours in the first one but playing through the entire thing doesn't take as long and doesn't have the same co-op features that this one has.\n\nI would strongly recommend buying this game for anyone who enjoys a strong single player game with fun and challenging co-op levels. \n\nAlso, while I haven't spent much time on the custom maps, the time I have played around with them has been very positive so far.","timestamp_created":1521613953,"timestamp_updated":1521613953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40951324","author":{"steamid":"76561198811101135","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":10088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1808,"last_played":1590112639},"language":"english","review":"Very recommended.

Literally the best game I've ever played. Like movie quality in everything you see. Buy it now if you want to make good use of 20 hours. Don't wait for a sale (although it's on sale often and if you don't buy it on sale you're a fool) \n\nA++ Voice acting. I cannot overstate how much I love Stephen Merchant and Ellen Mclain and JK Simmons in these rolls. Holy crap, there's 3 voice actors but dear God do they act their hearts out. Out of context I'd sweat that some soundbites were from a highbudget movie, it's that good. You can't find voice acting like this in just any AAA game, this is true passion. \n\nA++ Dialogue. Every sentence uttered from these characters is fun and beautiful. The writers can be genuinly hilarious with lines that I quote years after beating the game. There's also some heart wrenching moments that don't make you cry, but you really feel something more for these characters that were fairly 2 dimensional in the first game. \n\nA++ Character. Please soo Dialogue and voice acting. Characters are great movie quality character that you can empathize with, despise, and love all at the same time. \n\nA++ Puzzles. It is a puzzle game afterall. But holy crap does it not feel like one. Yes it's not a \"natural progression\" each task is fairly broken up and fairly straight forward. But it's not impossible tasks you have to run to the computer for walkthroughs everytime. Nor is it super easy that you can do it blind folded. It's the right level of \"oh geeze how the hell do I do this\" and \"AHA THAT'S HOW I DO THIS\". Not to mention that the mechanics from the first game are greatly expanded on without becoming complicated. And yes, you can make two portals over eachother and fall forever. \n\nA+ That moment. Yeah that moment, in that part of the game that everyone remembers. No spoilers but you'll see it when you get there. Still shook.\n\nA+ Overall story is one of the best most satifying experiences I've had in a game. From start to fininsh it's a wild rollercoaster that you can really predict. You get backstories and plot twists, the whole kit and kaboodle. I don't wan to spoil anything but you do learn a lot about things from the first game you didn't even know you wanted to know. And the very last thing you do with a portal gun is something you'd never think you'd do until you get to do it, and then not only does it make sense, but it's insanely gratifying.\n\nA Sound Track. Amazing sound track. Again, like it was stripped from a movie. \n\nB Graphics. Yeah it's not spectacular, but there's enough to keep it visually interesting. The facility doesn't feel like a cramped space anymore, but now like an actual facility. Not bad but nothing you'll write home about. \n\nB- Game Length. For what it's worth game length is should probably be a B+, but I just love every aspect of this game so much it feels shorter than it really is\n\nC+ Continuity. Continuity is actually great from the first game. But you don't have to play the first game to get all the continuity which is why this score is lower. There's no need to play Portal to understand Portal 2 but it does help. Continuity is also a bit lower because there's a few questions that are answered in the comic that's set between Portal and Portal 2 and this is a digital download so if you're buying from Steam you likely won't even know about it. \n\nC+ Replayability. Normally replay ability for puzzle games would be F+ maybe a D. The replayability is held up by the dialogue and voice acting and you just want to experience the plot again. But when you do replay the puzzles kind of get in the way of what you really want to see (read: Cave Johnson [JK SImmons] yelling at things) \n\nEXTRA CREDIT:\n+Amazing fanbase. Small but very nice and talented.\n+Great Merch\n+It introduced me to the amazing personality of Stephen Merchant\n+On sale often \n-Merch is expensive\n-NO FUCKING SEQUEL (and odds are there never will be one)\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1521578770,"timestamp_updated":1521578770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40945426","author":{"steamid":"76561198363596791","num_games_owned":242,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1112,"last_played":1549117307},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores games que joguei!!!","timestamp_created":1521578157,"timestamp_updated":1521578157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540816307067871094","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40944558","author":{"steamid":"76561198410534782","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":354,"last_played":1561674265},"language":"russian","review":"Отлиная игра в жанре головоломок,затянула!\nФича: сделать один портал вверху и один внизу","timestamp_created":1521574920,"timestamp_updated":1521574920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40944110","author":{"steamid":"76561198087272396","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":445,"last_played":1590510008},"language":"english","review":"Great co-op game.
