DUH.\n\nAudience:\n☐ Good for when you're first entering the gaming market!\n🗹 Good for the average person.\n🗹 Good for someone who plays a lot of games for fun.\n🗹 Good for professionals and hardcore players.\nPretty easy to grasp. The game teaches its mechanics in a clever way, and although the puzzles are tough at times it is fairly accessible to most audiences.\n\nGraphics:\n☐ The graphics made the game impossible to play, it was just so annoying.\n☐ It's not bad, but not good either. It has no character to it. It's plain.\n☐ Not the best in the world, but it was somewhat pleasant to look at.\n🗹 Very pretty. Not perfect, but really helped immerse me into the game.\n☐ Absolutely beautiful, almost like a work of renaissance art.\nIt looks good. I just have minor problems with it. [spoiler] Some parts of the game, like the enrichment center after GLaDOS fixes it are pretty boring to look at, though it makes sense. A lot of parts of the game look gorgeous, like GLaDOS' chamber and old Aperture.[/spoiler]\n\nMusic:\n☐ Jarring, aggravating, not even in a good way.\n☐ The music was okay, but it just had no character.\n☐ Fits the themes well enough. That's about it though. \n🗹 Very nice to listen to, and could probably stand alone as its own thing.\n☐ Absolutely amazing. \nThe music changes according to different parts of the puzzles being activated, which is so clever and amazing, like [spoiler]when using the Excursion funnels, the beam sensors, and the gels.[/spoiler] The music is pretty good, especially later on[spoiler] like in old Aperture[/spoiler], and to top it all off the credits songs are amazing. Really nice!\n\nSound Design:\n☐ Jesus christ, it sounds like a dialup modem on acid.\n☐ It's okay, but really needs some improvements.\n☐ A few odd sounds here and there, but mostly fine.\n☐ Good at making it feel real, but it needs some more character to make it stand out.\n🗹 Absolutely amazing and iconic.\nThe sounds are iconic. Everything from the portals to the cubes have their own sounds, and it all is unique and clever. Very nice.\n\nMechanics:\n☐ Feels absolutely alien to play, and impossible to get used to.\n☐ Some things just don't make sense, but it's okay.\n☐ Fairly easy to grasp.\n☐ Takes a bit to learn, but definitely worth it.\n🗹 Feels snappy, and makes sense.\nThe way the game teaches you the mechanics is great, the game feels like one long tutorial, but in a good way. It slowly teaches everything to you in a way that makes sense without vomiting it at you all at once.\n\nControls:\n☐ Controlling this game is a nightmare.\n☐ Hard to learn, and a bit weird, but not awful.\n☐ They work well enough.\n☐ Sometimes it's tricky, but mostly good.\n🗹 Feels snappy and to the point.\nControls are basic and simple. It makes sense.\n\nDifficulty:\n☐ A toddler could beat it.\n☐ Pretty average.\n🗹 Takes some thought.\n☐ Hope you have the dexterity of a brain surgeon.\n☐ This makes me want to destroy my computer it's so hard.\nThe puzzles are a bit tricky near the end, but it's not too bad. [spoiler]Fuck Wheatley's lab and everything it stands for. It's fucking aggravating. Also the ending of old Aperture is aggravating too. Maybe I'm just dumb, but those levels sucked. [/spoiler]Besides that, the puzzles were fun.\n\nStory:\n☐ What the fuck even happened?\n☐ Disappointing, but at least it was somewhat cool.\n☐ The story made sense, and was good enough.\n🗹 Pretty nice, would read it if it were a novel.\n☐ Absolutely amazing. Really makes you think.\nIt's not truly groundbreaking, but it's nice. The dialogue is witty and funny, the story makes some sense even if it is a bit wacky, and it's overall a nice experience.\n\nBugs:\n☐ This game is one big bug.\n☐ Some bugs can be really aggravating.\n☐ It has bugs, but either they are hilariously good or they rarely show up.\n🗹 Only encountered a few, they weren't too bad.\n☐ Didn't encounter any bugs.\nI personally didn't encounter any bugs besides one [spoiler]where if you crouch a certain way in an Excursion funnel, you can float through the air like a fucking wizard[/spoiler], but I've heard that bugs do exist for this. They don't seem too game breaking though.\n\nRecommended price:\n☐ Keep your credit cards and paypals far away from this thing.\n☐ If you buy it, you better get a refund. Just saying.\n☐ Wait for it to be on sale first.\n🗹 Buy it full price! The devs deserve it!\n☐ The game is already free.\nVery good. Seriously recommend it. Give it a shot.\n","timestamp_created":1558385134,"timestamp_updated":1558385134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50741035","author":{"steamid":"76561198214198283","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":226,"last_played":1575824253},"language":"brazilian","review":"--Para quem esse jogo foi desenvolvido?\n( ) Espermatozóides\n( ) Crianças\n( ) Tudo e todos\n(X) Adolescentes\n(X) Adultos\n( ) Pessoas com o pé na cova \n\n--Texturas, Gráficos, Lindeza?\n( ) Parece com os gráficos dos jogos do Atari\n( ) 220 x 120p\n( ) Meia boca, tem piores\n(X) Dentro da média atual\n( ) Quase um The Witcher 3\n( ) Melhor que os gráficos da vida real \n( ) Isso veio de outra dimensão\n\n--Falhas\n( ) O jogo em si é uma falha\n( ) Bug pra todo lado, tipo tiro em favela no Rio\n( ) Muitas falhas, mas dá pra jogar\n(X) Bugs que são legais e não atrapalham\n( ) Sem falhas , que eu vi\n( ) Esse jogo saiu perfeito do forno\n\n--É difícil?\n( ) Basta assistir o jogo\n( ) Zera com uma guitarra\n( ) Pega logo as manha, mas sempre normal\n(X) Bem desafiador, as vezes difícil\n( ) Parece Dark Souls\n( ) Equiparável a Dark Souls\n( ) É necessário morrer (de verdade) pra zerar\n\n--Tem uma história?\n( ) Não, um Minecraft da vida\n( ) Tem história só pra não dizer que não tem\n(X) Dá pra gostar da história, se esforçando(Meio clichê , mais como é o vol 0 , dá para aceitar) \n( ) Consegue te arrancar uma lágrima ou duas\n( ) Nivel The Last Of Us\n( ) Dava pra fazer um livro \n( ) Deveria constar no curriculo do Ensino médio\n\n--Audio, músicas\n( ) Nivel do Funk Brasilero\n( ) Jogue mutado\n(X) Dá pra escutar\n( ) Os caras capricharam no áudio\n( ) Baixe a playlist pra escutar no ônibus\n( ) Toque o tema no seu casamento (recomendo)\n\n--Trambolho necessário pra rodar\n( ) Nokia 1995\n( ) Windows 98 sem placa de video\n(X) Um PC decente.\n( ) Um PC já considerado gamer\n( ) Invista no minimo 4k em hardware\n( ) SLI de 1080ti\n( ) Esqueça, a tecnologia atual não dá conta","timestamp_created":1558380319,"timestamp_updated":1558380319,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50739705","author":{"steamid":"76561198920092192","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":527,"last_played":1624472652},"language":"czech","review":"zábavná i logická hra. nejvíc funny je, když hrajete s někým","timestamp_created":1558374431,"timestamp_updated":1558374431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50737774","author":{"steamid":"76561197960373660","num_games_owned":2091,"num_reviews":4137,"playtime_forever":57,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":57,"last_played":1558428364},"language":"english","review":"󠀡","timestamp_created":1558365608,"timestamp_updated":1558365608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.439028292894363403","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50737216","author":{"steamid":"76561198851464779","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3060,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":555,"last_played":1648798780},"language":"russian","review":"Прикольная игра, головоломки, шутки ГлаДос, и т.д\n5/5 одобряю","timestamp_created":1558362969,"timestamp_updated":1558362969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629629611968994141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50735863","author":{"steamid":"76561198300617772","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":922,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":515,"last_played":1624657792},"language":"russian","review":"Где мой тортик?","timestamp_created":1558357057,"timestamp_updated":1558357057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50735503","author":{"steamid":"76561198165189523","num_games_owned":347,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":2286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1427,"last_played":1646615016},"language":"english","review":"It's more Portal.
