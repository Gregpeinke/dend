The central mechanic of traversing via portals is still novel, still genius. However, where the first game felt perfunctory in its storytelling and world building, the sequel goes to great lengths at making this more entertaining and rich. Stephen Merchant and J.K. Simmons lend their considerable voice talents, and along with some brilliant set pieces set to an equally brilliant score by Mike Morasky (you will begin to believe in Techno-Bach), the game is full of life where the first game felt thin and minimalist. Some prefer the purity of the original; I happen to like this \"blockbusterized\" expansion more. \n\nThough the increased production values are the most immediate improvement, the new toys on hand also bring with them fresh challenges that really stretch the possibilities of puzzle solving, but never to the point where things become too demanding (this of course will vary with your own spatial awareness and kinesthetic? skills in imagining 3D space). \n\nThe '2' in Portal 2 also hints at a fully developed co-op mode, which is among some of the best. The solo campaign would've been worth the price of admission alone, but a fully realized series of challenges tailored for two is really just having your cake *and* eating it too, ahem. There's also Steam Workshop support, so replay value really becomes a moot factor, because it is potentially infinite. \n\nI really, really like this game, if it wasn't obvious already.","timestamp_created":1381467027,"timestamp_updated":1572456380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7354375","author":{"steamid":"76561198089347853","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3023,"last_played":1451630872},"language":"english","review":"The cake is a lie to the power of 2.","timestamp_created":1381431430,"timestamp_updated":1381431430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7354315","author":{"steamid":"76561198001572388","num_games_owned":643,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":966,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":541,"last_played":1533070632},"language":"english","review":"First game was kinda all about puzzles and not that much of a story.
