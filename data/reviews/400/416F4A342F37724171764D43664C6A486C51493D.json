The experience is unique yet still very exciting. The main concept of the game is you progress through test chambers with your portal gun that allows you to create portals that will take you or an object from one place to another. As you go through test chambers there may be a new mechanic or idea introduced such as turrets or the companion cube. While the game may be short, the replay value is high making the game worthwhile to keep playing. To sum it up, I give the game a 10/10 for its awesome story and game mechanics (and cake).

Vou fazer essas análise em dois tópicos: jogabilidade e história.\n\nJogabilidade: Portal tem uma jogabilidade muito leve, o que ajuda isso é a engine que o game utiliza, a Source, que tem uma física um pouco mais irreal, você tem algumas vantagens durante o gameplay, entre elas, não tomar dano de queda devido a um aparelho amortecedor implantado em suas pernas. A parte principal do jogo, os portais, são muito bem utilizados, desde você esperar um tempo certo para abrir e fechar um portal em um local específico para ascender um pistão, até você passar por um portal duas vezes para ganhar velocidade e dar um salto maior, embora seja um jogo que te coloca em diversas situações, eles não dura mais que 5 horas durante a gameplay comum, caso você queira jogar mais alguns desafios, algumas das câmaras foram refeitas de um modo mais difícil, e em cada uma delas há 3 desafios, de completar em menor tempo possível, de completar com menos portais e de completar com menos passos possíveis. \n\nHistória com spoilers: O jogo se passa dentro do laboratório de testes de Aperture Science, você acorda em uma cama e um portal se abre em sua frente com a explicação de uma voz feminina robótica sobre o que irá acontecer nas seguintes horas, você testará a nova invenção da Aperture Science, a Portalgun, e como recompensa você ganhará um bolo no final, ao passar das 19 fases de teste você vai entendendo um pouco mais sobre a estrutura e o que é aquela voz que te auxilia, ao final do teste 19, a plataforma em que você está em cima se encaminha para uma fornalha com o símbolo de bolo, você consegue escapar de virar o próprio bolo e segue instruções inscritas na parede que parece ter sido feita por outra pessoa que também escapou da fornalha, mas o jogo não explica quem é essa pessoa, ao passar por alguns locais infestados de torretas (robôs militares que você encontra durante o jogo), você chega na sala principal onde está a tal voz feminina, era um robô com uma I.A. que controla toda a instalação, você destrói ela e um rombo se abre no céu da instalação, você é jogado pra fora e desmaia, acontece uma cutscene que você é puxado novamente para dentro por alguém ou alguma coisa, e jogo termina, por fim, durante as legendas, a I.A. que nós \"destruímos\" que se chama G.L.A.D.O.S., canta uma música que se chama \"Still Alive\", ou seja Ainda viva. \n\nEu tentei completar todos os desafios e fazer todas as conquistas, se você fizer tudo que o jogo tem a oferecer ele dará cerca de 20 horas, é um jogo muito bom com uma história muito melhor do que parece, porém acho que o preço de R$20,69 é muito alto para um jogo lançado em 2007, felizmente geralmente ele fica em promoção de 70% a 80% de desconto, ótima aquisição para se ter na biblioteca.","timestamp_created":1594936456,"timestamp_updated":1594938677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72809118","author":{"steamid":"76561198158720391","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":482,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1645811857},"language":"english","review":"Really enjoyed it.

Half-Life 2 который вышел 2004 так же составляет из себя не большую часть головоломок, как и в Portal. Только в портале мы используем портальную пушку, а не грави-пушку. Но, Portal специально разрабатывали как головоломку-платформер, так что без мозгов проходить будет сложно. Portal качественный и проработанный, у valve явно был навык к разработке Portal'а только игра по продолжительности не тянет...\n\nФизика\nФизика в играх от valve отличная! А сплошной головоломке это необходимо. Представьте если у вас кубик проходил сквозь текстуры, это бы очень бесило. В общем это просто шедевр!\n\nторт - это ложь.\n1. Я просыпаюсь в комнате, потому что меня разбудил GLaDOS.\n2. GLaDOS намеренно отправляет меня к испытанием, на опыты.\n3. После нескольких испытаний, оказывается что GLaDOS хочет меня убить!

The gameplay is fluid and fun, the writing and dialouge is enjoyable, and it's overall a great experience. My only complaint is that it is not worth it's $10 price tag. For how short the campaign is and how little there is to do after the fact, it should be $5 at most. If you're wanting to get this game, wait until it goes on sale. Overall, a good game worth playing.","timestamp_created":1594867835,"timestamp_updated":1618117655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72763797","author":{"steamid":"76561199042684970","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":213,"last_played":1656026683},"language":"english","review":"Really fun but challenging","timestamp_created":1594866013,"timestamp_updated":1594866013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72763607","author":{"steamid":"76561198328158767","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":165,"last_played":1594094936},"language":"english","review":"Great and quick game","timestamp_created":1594865658,"timestamp_updated":1594865658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72762993","author":{"steamid":"76561198312168207","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":416,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":364,"last_played":1626500071},"language":"english","review":"It's really cool.
