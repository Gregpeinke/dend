장점은 전에 대부분의 인기 있었던 슈터들의 폭8 장면은 땅이 흔들리거나 폭8이 한 번 일어나고는 그냥 끝나는 것에 불과하였습니다 하지만 하프라이프는 이 두번째 챕터에서 장비가 폭8하는 모습은 ㄹㅇ 그 당시 진정한 예술은 폭8이라는 것을 제대로 가르쳐 준 게임인 것 같습니다 또 불빛 효과, 당신 주위에 있는 환경들이 조화를 연구실 답게 잘 이루어내었습니다 마지막으로 엔진도 그 당시에 인기가 있었던 퀘이크 엔진을 본따 수정을 거친 다음에 골드소스 엔진으로 만든 것인데 생각보다 ㅈㄴ 기가막히게 잘 만들었습니다 siN 같은 경우에는 퀘이크 2 엔진을 이용하여 만든 것인데 확실히 퀘이크 2의 느낌이 나는 움직임 요소가 강했는데 하프라이프는 제가 이 사실을 알고 나서 ㄹㅇ 적절하게 잘 이용한 게임인 것 같습니다.\n\n단점은 아ㅏ ㅅㅂ 일단 NPC가 말을 정말 듣지를 앉고 따라오라고 했더니 ㅅㅂ 땅에 끼어있습니다 당시 또 유명한 퀘이크 2 엔진을 이용한 패작 다이카타나가 있죠 그 게임도 ㅅㅂ NPC가 정말 기가 맥히게 ㅈ같습니다 아마도 엔진이 ㅈ같은 것 같지만 그래도 일단 ㅈ같습니다 또 xeennn 젠을 아시겠죠 이 부분도 상당히 좋지 않습니다 엘리베이터가 올라가는데 원으로 돌면서 올라갑니다 뭐 괜찮은 아이디어죠 그쵸 ㅅㅂ 근데 왜 내 화면은 같이 돌아갈까요 윗층에 층간 소음 때문에 올라갔는데 상대의 공격 때문에 밀쳐져서 엘리베이터에서 떨여져서 낙뎀 오지게 먹습니다 ㅅㅂ 마지막으로 만약 당신이 초심이라면 어려움 난이도로 는 플레이 하지 마십시요 군인들의 에임과 수류탄들이 정말 ㄹㅇ 개 아픕니다\n\n멀미하시는 분들은 명령어 창(~)에 이거 입력하세요\ndefault_fov <숫자>\n기본으로는 default_fov 90 으로 되어 있는데 ㄹㅇ 못해 먹습니다. 가능하면 100에서 120으로 하시는 편이 좋습니다\n예시: default_fov 120\n이게 당신 시야각 높이는 건데 예 좋습니다 높을 수록 빠른 느낌들어서 좋습니다\n\n그리고 또 ㅈ같은 텍스쳐 필터링 끄는 방법은\n하프라이프 로컬 파일 가셔서 valve 파일 찾아서 들가신 담에 밑에 내리시다가 config.cfg로 되어있는 파일 여셔서 또 내리시면\ngl_texturemode \"GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR\" 또는 gl_texturemode \"GL_LINEAR\" 되어 있는 명령어를 \ngl_texturemode \"GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST\"로 바꿔주세요 그리고 참고로 당신이 게임 안에서 설정 하나라도 건드리시면 텍스쳐 필터링이 다시 켜져서 이 명령어를 되도록이면 설정 다 건드리신 다음에 해주시고 config.cfg 속성에서 읽기 전용하시면 됩니다\n\n출쳐 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2021533739\n\n추가적인 건 프레임이 100으로 고정이 되어있는데 별 지장은 주지 않지만 더 부드러운 걸 원하시는 분들은 명령어 창(~)에 fps_override 1 치시고\nfps_max 999 치시면 됩니다. 원하는 프레임으로 고정 시키고 싶으시면 999에다가 원하시는 숫자 적으시면 됩니다 참고로 fps_override 의 역할은 프레임 100 이상해주는 역할이예요\n프레임 60 고정 fps_max 60\n\n무기가 ㄹㅇ 복잡하게 변경하게 되어있는데 이거 빼고 원하시는 지정된 키로 무기를 꺼내고 싶은 분들은 명령어 창(~)에 일단은\nhud_fastswitch 1 입력하고 그 다음에\nbind <원하시는 키> <무기 이름>\n예시: bind q weapon_rpg\n무기 이름들은\nweapon_crowbar 이게 빠루 전사 근접무기\nweapon_9mmhandgun 이게 글록 아님 딱총 권총\nweapon_357 이게 ㅈㄴ 쌘 리볼버\nweapon_9mmAR 이게 mp5 아님 smg 만약 hd 텍스쳐면 m4 닮은 거임\nweapon_shotgun 이게 스파스 처럼 생긴 두발 나갈 수 있는 샷건\nweapon_crossbow 이게 석궁 외계인 상어 잡을 수 있는 무기\nweapon_rpg 이게 ㅈㄴ 큰 로켓 발사기\nweapon_gauss 이게 그 방사능 에너지 탄약 쓰는 2발씩 쓰고 우클릭으로 차지 가능한 거\nweapon_egon 이게 무슨 ㅈㄴ 긴 회전하는 빔 쏘는

문을 열다가 끔살당하거나 텍스쳐가 깨지거나 NPC가 움직이질 않습니다 ㅅㅂ 그리고 ㄹㅇ 여기서 더 웃기거는 데이 오브 디피트: 소스(Day Of Defeat: Source), 카운터 스트라이크 소스(Counter Strike: Source) 이 게임들은 텍스쳐나 모델이 좋아졌는데 하프라이프 소스(Half-Life: Source), 하프라이프 데스매치 소스(Half-Life Deathmatch: Source) 이 게임들은 ㅅㅂ 거의 똑같습니다 그리고 게다가 고어 이펙트가 벽에 남았을 때 고어는 소스면서 텍스쳐는 골드소스 그리고 움직임은 어쩔 수 없이 더 미끄러워졌고 아니 괜히 옛날 그대로를 위해서 일부러 놔둔거야 아니면 ㅅㅂ 귀찮아서 그런거야 아무리 업그레이드 되고 향상 됬는데 ㅅㅂ 똑같은 가격은 ㅇㅂ지 게다가 크로팀도 지들이 만든 시리어스 샘 HD판(Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter)을/를 08년때부터 내기 시작했는데 소스 엔진이 뭐가 그렇게 대단하다고 ㅅㅂ 물론 그 당시는 엄청났죠 니들이 이드 소프트웨어 자리 뺏은 마냥 04년 때부터 리메이크하고 ㅈㄹ이야 역사상 가장 빨리 리메이크한 게임 회사인 것 같아요 아무튼 멀미할 것 같아서 하프라이프 소스(Half-Life: Source) 찾으신 분들 블랙 메사로 돌아가십시요 만약 98년도 하프라이프(Half-Life)나 블랙 메사(Black Mesa)를 접하고 오신 분들도 돌아가십시요 게임 플레이 자체가 말이 안됩니다 가족 공유라서 해봤는데 주인께서도 안하신 걸보고 왜 비추인지는 프리맨 박사님께서 언젠가는 다 이해해주실거라 믿어요\n물론 제 평가의 대부분은 억까에 불과하지만 하지 마세요\n\n마지막 소감으로 xeennn젠은 블랙 메사에서 플레이 하는 것이 ㄹㅇ ㅈㄴ 더 갓띵 ㅇㅈ이고 mod db 수상에 스팀 수상도 받고 심지어 벨브 개ㅅㄲ들도 ㅇㅈ한 리메이크니 이 게임 멀미나서 못하시겠다는 분들은 이거 당장 환불하시고 블랙 메사 하십시오 그게 게임플레이가 ㄹㅇ 현대적으로 정말 잘 소화한 리메이크입니다 그리고 ㅅㅂ 이게임 소스 코드
