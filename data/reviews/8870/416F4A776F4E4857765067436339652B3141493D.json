Incluso ya estaba aburrido de hacer siempre lo mismo. He pasado de Minecraft a Halo, de Halo a CSGO y de CSGO a juegos como Men Of War. Nada que ver con esta tremenda joyita. Compré este juego en oferta mas que nada para \"tener algo que hacer\". Y ohhhh, vaya que me ha dado mucha tarea para entender esta obra de arte. Aun no he comprado los DLC pero ganas no me faltan. La historia es simplemente increíble con giros argumentales intensos (aunque con un con otro que otro hueco, pero no arruinan la experiencia).\n\n[b] A continuación daré mi opinión con SPOILERS [/b]\n\nAl principio, Elizabeth (La chica que tenemos que rescatar en el principio del juego) no me agradaba completamente, era muy infantil y torpe, aunque bueno, que podemos esperar de la típica princesa encerrada en la torre custodiada por un dragón. Solo que esta vez, no es una torre... Es un ángel de oro volador, y no hay ningún dragón, es un pájaro robótico mortal. La jugabilidad es simplemente increíble, y la optimización del juego es sorprendente. No tengo una PC de la NASA (GTX 1660 SUPER, 16 GB DE RAM, RYZEN 5 2600) y soy capaz de correr el juego a más de 165 hz (la taza de refresco de mi monitor)\n\nComo va pasando la historia, poco a poco nos vamos dando cuenta que el protagonista, no solo es un hombre que busca pagar su deuda. Tiene sentimientos encontrados con Elizabeth, y no me confundan, no son sentimientos románticos, mas bien son sentimientos de padre a hija (lo cual nos da cierta perspectiva al final). Si les soy sinceros, yo no entendí el final por mi mismo. Tuve que ver un video donde lo explican mas a fondo y de ahí es donde tomé tanto cariño al juego. Terminé prácticamente enamorado por Elizabeth (no tradicionalmente, no soy un puto virgo jaja), tanto que incluso estoy pensando ordenar una figura de ella para poner en mi setup. La complejidad de este personaje me maravilló, simplemente fantástico. Pasaría este juego una y otra vez. De hecho, dejaré la reseña aqui para ir a jugarlo denuevo en lo que consigo los DLC.\n\n[b] JUEGALO [/b]","timestamp_created":1617156487,"timestamp_updated":1617158567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557471275329589844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89404749","author":{"steamid":"76561198442810322","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":1226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1617602906},"language":"english","review":"Good companion with great backstory and character, environment and gameplay aged really well, mind-breaking plot regarding alternate universes and plot twists, it's all in one package of a game.

Ridiculous.”[/h1]\n[u]Premise[/u]: Seemingly completely unrelated to Rapture, Infinite takes place in a city called Columbia in 1912. A city suspended in a quantum superposition. You'll play as Booker DeWitt, a man whom was once a Pinkerton. He is sent to Columbia by the Lutece Twins to recover a debt — and thus our adventure begins.\n\n[h1][u]Mechanics[/u] and tin soldiers.[/h1]\nBioshock Infinite is the most linear of all the Bioshock games, it's a relatively strait-forward FPS. Though, I'd venture to say there are [i]less[/i] horror elements than either of its predecessors. There are few tangential jaunts you can explore such as the Vox Populi code book ciphers. But these are generally found along the way.\n\nInfinite certainly could boast about its superior gunplay to the other games. The gunplay is vastly improved.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441137258\nInfinite uses “Vigors” instead of “Plasmids” They're essentially the same [i]superpowers[/i] using “salts” instead of “eve” to be powered. Though, lore-wise they're simply consumed through drinking them, no injections needed. Many of them are unique such as Undertow — a vigor that can grab and pull enemies closer to you while others are much more strait-forward like Devil's Kiss. Basically a grenade. However, most of the vigors can also be held and activated as traps beyond their more active ability. I particularly enjoyed “Return to Sender” which behaves as magnetic shield to catch bullets that you're able to throw back. Something analogous to Athena's shield in Pre-Sequel or the Vortex Shield in Titanfall.\n\nElizabeth is usually around as well. She'll toss you ammo, health or coins that she finds as you travel. She'll do this in combat as well, though she won't fight herself.\n\n[b]Mechanical differences between Infinite and the other Bioshock games.[/b][list]\n[*] Booker cannot hold more than two weapons at a time. So you can't be your own arsenal anymore.\n\n[*] There is no hacking. However, you are able to manipulate machines with the Possession vigor or by pulling a turret or automaton through a tear.\n\n[*] There are no more tonics. Instead you'll find gear. Standard affair sorts of hats, pants and shirts. But these will have different attributes and you'll be able to equip 4 at a time.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441172452\n\n[*] Weapon upgrades are purchased from vending machines rather than the one time use “Power to the People” machines.\n\n[*] Instead of ADAM and EVE, Booker has a shield in addition to his health bar and salts. These can be upgraded by finding “infusions”.\n\n[*] You're able to melee execute enemies with low health.[/list]\n\n[h1]”... Because he doesn't row. — He doesn't row? — No, he [i]doesn't[/i] row. — Ah, I see what you mean.”[/h1]\nThe game features a semi-convoluted story line, being heavily involved with time travel and/or dimensional flipping. Seeing that this type of thing is only theoretically even possible, we have to take the game's set of rules as to how it operates. Which can be frustrating.\n\nYou will either look under here, or you will have looked under here (unless you don't want spoilers): [spoiler]The game does not feature any additional endings. There are only a few instances that have actual repercussions. While not entirely significant to the overall story, they provide a kind of subjective diegetic [i]prominence[/i]. For instance, when selecting the medallion for Elizabeth — this moment can provide an altered meaning determined by the player — the bird, symbolizing freedom and peace [of mind], is probably something you'd choose on a first playthrough, while the cage makes more sense on the second.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Burial At Sea — only mechanical spoilers for the DLC here.[/h1]\nI believe the DLC is necessary to feel truly satisfied with the story told in Bioshock Infinite. [b]Part 1[/b] of Burial at Sea has a some unique plasmids (yes, plasmids) but are largely the same as the main game stay for needing to scavenge a bit more as ammo and salts are slightly more rare.\n\n[b]Part 2[/b] of Burial at Sea features another unique plasmid. This DLC is stealth-driven and the plasmid allows you to see through walls as well as make you invisible. Both parts of the DLC have upgrades available that are strewn about in the environment that will alter the plasmids. This DLC seems especially inspired by Thief: The Dark Project given the studio behind it.\n\n[b]Clash in the Clouds[/b] is a wave-based arena mode similar to something like Killing Floor. You'll earn money, buy upgrades and prepare for battle in between waves. It's quite enjoyable, though there is no real story involved with it.\n\n[h1]Anecdotes:[/h1]\nIn addition to being the [ostensible] finale to Bioshock, one of my favorite series, this game specifically holds a special place in my memory. As it was one of three games I played while in tech school for the Air Force. (The others were “I am Alive” and \"Binary Domain\".) I walked to the on-base library to download it as that was one of the only places with free wi-fi — took me three separate trips.\n\n[h1]The Gist:[/h1]\nWhile I find Rapture to be vastly more interesting as a location — Infinite tells a great story that makes sense in its own right even removed from Rapture. Columbia, while nice looking, is... kind of boring. It's got much better gunplay — though, I do find many of the vigors less interesting overall than the plasmids — largely being derivative versions from the other games.\n\nI don't think you actually need to have played the other Bioshock games to understand this one, but you'll get a lot more out of it.\n\n[quote]If you've read this far, consider following my curation  — [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/28295405/]Station Argus[/url][/quote]\n\nBioshock 1 review [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceCouncil/recommended/409710]here[/url].\nBioshock 2 review [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceCouncil/recommended/409720/]here[/url].\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441218647","timestamp_created":1617149914,"timestamp_updated":1623554894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":39,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.748215734958648682","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89401001","author":{"steamid":"76561198817873258","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1000,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":439,"last_played":1617687269},"language":"spanish","review":"Epicardo","timestamp_created":1617149516,"timestamp_updated":1617149516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89400246","author":{"steamid":"76561198191096031","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":684,"last_played":1617148212},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1617148267,"timestamp_updated":1617148267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89398831","author":{"steamid":"76561198075408677","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":945,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":750,"last_played":1618617301},"language":"english","review":"Good fps","timestamp_created":1617145727,"timestamp_updated":1617145727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89396793","author":{"steamid":"76561198187220485","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":4094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2898,"last_played":1650611050},"language":"english","review":"the bioshock do be infinite","timestamp_created":1617142338,"timestamp_updated":1617142338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89395229","author":{"steamid":"76561198810312770","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":558,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1634278705},"language":"spanish","review":"Sinceramente no le tenía mucha fe a esta entrega, luego de haber terminado BioShock 2 hace mucho tiempo me quedo con un sabor amargo comparado con el primero pero Infinite..\nRealmente si contara mi opinión que tengo respecto a Infinite terminaría por Spoilear toda la historia y eso es algo que no me gusta, pero por donde íbamos\n¿Lo recomiendo?

My final thoughts after this part.\n ** Well after about 13  hours in and still looking for motivation to finish the game. I'm finding it hard to see that this game gets such outstanding reviews. I gotta say its a very poor follow up to Bioshock 2. I really miss the  weapon wheel. Carrying 2 weapons is kinda boring and its probably the thing I would demand be changed if I was the one making decisions designing this game. Its very linear there are areas to explore off to the sides but they aren't always needed.  I'm feeling no sense of accompishment and its just not all that fun. I have just finished a huge fight with like 30 enemies in several waves. I felt no tension because I knew I was easily going to win and I always found healing and salts. I had plenty of ammo and at the end of the fight I was full health,  full vigor and still had lots of ammo.  I guess I should play on hardest but anyway I hope this helps  ** \n\nSo most boring ending I can think of. Felt unsatisfied. All I really wanted in the last 13 hours after I wrote my first review was for the game to be over. Still felt no joy just really wanted it over so i can delete the game and never come back.  Not so with Bioshock 2 which I did twice already on Xbox but I just can't find any redeeming fun with Bioshock Infinte all in all I just hated every moment.","timestamp_created":1617070984,"timestamp_updated":1621225412,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5738869309425354","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89346284","author":{"steamid":"76561198969582908","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1818,"last_played":1657418063},"language":"spanish","review":"Obra maestra.
