The level layouts are extremely annoying to deal with since there isn't a waypoint telling you where to go. Often at times I found myself walking down a dead-end hallway finding nothing but a half-life symbol and some ammo. Furthermore, there are little switches and levers located in the most bizarre areas that require some parkour to reach. My issue with level layouts continues since pretty much all of the shootouts I had with the NPCs in my 2 hour bout occurred with my enemies always having the high ground; you always have to look up to shoot. Looking up may not sound too annoying when read in plain text, but what I’m talking about here is like standing down in the sewer shooting up at the open manhole while enemies drop explosive barrels down at you (which does happen btw). \n\nOverall, the game is a cakewalk with good graphic, great physics, and a seemingly interesting story, but it’s the level design, lack of player direction, and unnecessary jumping on pipes to get to a hidden level that makes me want to give a thumb down to the game. \n","timestamp_created":1467175014,"timestamp_updated":1467175014,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.375067532062530518","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23913991","author":{"steamid":"76561198174821697","num_games_owned":413,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259,"last_played":1468406395},"language":"schinese","review":"辣鸡游戏，毁我青春，脏我钱财，通宵达旦，身疲力尽。","timestamp_created":1467172708,"timestamp_updated":1467172708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23911588","author":{"steamid":"76561198017836829","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":624,"last_played":1657768775},"language":"english","review":"Waiting HL3.","timestamp_created":1467164565,"timestamp_updated":1467164565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23911440","author":{"steamid":"76561198120271211","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1469272427},"language":"turkish","review":"BU OYUNU BULANINDA ÇIKARANINDA FİKRİ AKLINA GETİRENİNDE 7 SÜLELESİNİ 7 CEDDİNİ SELAMLIYIM 2 GÜNE PARANOYAK OLDUM AMK KAPIDAN CRAP ATLAR FELAN DİYE","timestamp_created":1467164100,"timestamp_updated":1467164100,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.406184971332550049","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23910252","author":{"steamid":"76561198108267614","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1232,"last_played":1479939841},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores jogos que já joguei.","timestamp_created":1467160515,"timestamp_updated":1467160515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23909442","author":{"steamid":"76561198004155705","num_games_owned":890,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":2615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2410,"last_played":1480320822},"language":"spanish","review":"Es lo mas!

Очень сильно переоценена. В чем же проблемы?\n\n[h1]Минусы:[/h1]\n\n[u]- Уровни.[/u]\nАбсолютно все локации, за исключением нескольких, в игре скучные и не представляют ничего красивого или завораживающего. Просто серые дома или скучные леса. Если локация большая - на ней нечем заняться, она скучная и не заполненная. Если локация небольшая - там обезательно будет темно, ибо это дом, и на вс будут валится враги.\n\n[u]- Сюжет.[/u]\nПродолжение истории в стиле \"инопланетяне победили и захватили землю\" было предсказуемо, и с начала игры вы понимаете концовку. Каких-то крутых сюжетных поворотов, сценарных трюков, прикольных второстепенных сюжетов тут нет. Клапаны просто добавили G-Man'а, который весь из себя \"загадочный\", и игроки уже 20 лет строят теории, которые БЛЯТЬ ВООБЩЕ НЕ НА ЧЕМ НЕ ОСНОВАННЫ.\nВон возьмите любого героя любой игры, и я настрочу вам 100 страниц теорий.\n\n[u]- Геймплей.[/u]\nИнтересный геймплей начинается когда вам дают грави-пушку. И то, интересно становится только на час от силы. \nУровни с транспортом - отдельная тема. Ты гоняешь на лодке over9000 часов периодически убивая по 2 врага на 1 километр, а в конце тебе дают \"сложнейшую\" головоломку.\nЭкшена в игре нету, зрелищности тоже. Стрельба из оружия не ощущается, взрывы фуфло. В момент выхода игры была целая куча хороших шутеров, из которых Клапаны могл хотябы взрывы взять.\nМир захватили ЧУДОВИЩНО сильные инопланетяне, которые разгромили людские войска за 7 часов? КЛАПАНЫ БЛЯТЬ! Вы могли показать технологии по-чудовищнее чем ебанные ТРЕНОЖНИКИ, или как их там, страйдеры, которые может взорвать любой дядя Петя, работающий в шиномонтажке за углом.\n\nЯ мог бы затронуть графику, которая уж очень мультяшная (я понимаю, особенность движка), но делать этого не буду, потому-что она неплохая, хоть и убивают любую атмосферу.\n\n[h1]Вывод:[/h1]\n\nБлин можете говорить что я ньюфаг, или просто тупой даунич, и не понимаю ГЕНИАЛЬНОСТИ, но игра не стоит звания \"лучшая игра на PC всех времен...\" и даже претендовать на нее не может. Соглашусь про первую часть, которая возможно и была точком в новый жанр, в которую может и сейчас реально играть (в ремейк естественно), но вторая часть это... ПОЛНЕЙШАЯ, И НАИУЖАСНЕЙШАЯ... БЕЗ-ДАР-НОСТЬ!\n\n(Я там сверху пробомблся, но в конце скажу - игра конечно, не полное говно, не ебучий кал и т.д. Она НОРМАЛЬНАЯ, но не более, просто нормальная, не хорошая, не отличная, а просто средненькая, а обзор все равно будет отрицательным, т.к. игру сильно переоценивают.)","timestamp_created":1467047346,"timestamp_updated":1549968540,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.406109362840652466","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23866701","author":{"steamid":"76561198313442135","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46,"last_played":1586612752},"language":"portuguese","review":"Great Game 10/10","timestamp_created":1467046173,"timestamp_updated":1586605356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23865995","author":{"steamid":"76561198201525835","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":2268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":486,"last_played":1602458353},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego de FPS de ciencia ficción, con ciertos aspectos de puzzles, y con un mundo amplio para explorar y encontrar armamento o salud si lo necesitas.

Secuela de una de las obras más influyentes de la industria del videojuego, perfeccionando todos los aspectos de su antecesor.

Si tu no te empeñas en descubrirla no te vas a enterar de gran cosa. Mucho dicen de Dark Souls, que es de los primeros juegos que cuentan su historia mediante el escenario, pues este título ya lo hizo allá por 2004.\n\nUna obra que da igual si te gustan los shooters o no, da igual casi si te gustan los videojuegos o no. Se disfruta con solo verlo. Recomendado a cualquier tipo de jugador que se precie, es un clásico imprescindible.","timestamp_created":1467035005,"timestamp_updated":1585581795,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23861394","author":{"steamid":"76561198214422849","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":333,"last_played":1547127455},"language":"polish","review":"YUEA","timestamp_created":1467033931,"timestamp_updated":1647784239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23861332","author":{"steamid":"76561198174455513","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":366,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1478614519},"language":"schinese","review":"晕起来不晓得比镜之边缘高几个华莱士，不说了，我先去吐一会","timestamp_created":1467033770,"timestamp_updated":1467033770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":19,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608235955238342285","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23860653","author":{"steamid":"76561198158300493","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1568467181},"language":"english","review":"I ate alien ass.","timestamp_created":1467032129,"timestamp_updated":1467032129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533647358417510986","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23859823","author":{"steamid":"76561198306297609","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":370,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":240,"last_played":1469953559},"language":"koreana","review":"Used to Play this game on my Playstation 2.
