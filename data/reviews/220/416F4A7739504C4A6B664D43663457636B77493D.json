2 très bon jeux\n\n un gameplay assez dynamique, des mécaniques funs comme le genre de floor is lava avec les fourmis-lion mais mon préfère reste le gravity gun qui est vraiment très marrant quand on s'en sert comme arme,. un bon scénario même si malheureusement ceux n'ayant aucune connaissance du 1 risque de se retrouver perdue et des graphismes par ouf (mais je pense que c'est parce-que le jeu est vieux) sinon les musiques d'actions sont vraiment bien, j'ai étais satisfait du level design qui est très varié et du bestiaire qui offre beaucoup d'ennemie, il n'y a pas mal d'armes pour s'amuser bien quelle sois assez classique(pistolet, fusil a pompe, mitraillette, pieds de biche, etc.)\n\nPOINT FORT:\ngameplay rapide\nBon scénario\nLevel design varié\nBestiaires fournis\nMusique bien\nPas

to be consider one of the best I've ever experience. The cast of character is very memorable, each one feel like a real person due to the amazing voice actor, animation and story being told throughout the game.  There will be some minor inconveniences like the aux power which consume when you use the flash light, sprinting, being under water and it consumes quickly when you use multiple ones. But is it not that game breaking and you can still enjoy the game even with the aux power mechanic and the terrible driving control on the boat and the buggy.

It goes on for longer than it should.\n\nIf you have read my review of Half-Life 1, you know that I played this during the free month where you could play the entire Half-Life franchise for free until Half-Life Alyx launched. So I was in a hurry to finish all 4 games in one month's time, so I resorted to a walkthrough throughout HL-1 and I couldn't come to terms with myself on whether I should follow another walkthrough for Half-Life 2 as well, or just wing it and try to beat the game at my pace.\n\nIf you feel that my review is invalid because I used a guide, I understand that, but I'll still keep my rating.\n\nBecause I had a limited time for finishing the game, I wanted to finish as many achievements as possible on my first run itself, but I had to decide if I could maintain that on the episodes as well.\n\nBut after playing with an achievement walkthrough for 3 chapters, I found out that you can load a chapter at any time after you have completed it, so I didn't have to worry about missing out achievements. At this point, I just stopped focusing on the lambda caches and just tried to do the main objectives of the games properly.\n\nBut it still felt like the story just stretched out for no reason and I was constantly left feeling lonely while Alyx and the other characters were doing who knows what.\n\nAnother thing I was constantly frustrated about where the antlions. They kept respawning, they kept making that god-awful hissing noise and they just wouldn't leave my side... I wished to burn all of them. This part was like Chapters 9-13 from HL-1 (just terrible)\n\nThe best part of the game was no doubt the Citadel. That was not only the best, but the only memorable 3 chapters from the entire game.\n\nEpisodes 1 and 2 are much better and shorter versions of this game, where I didn't need to look at a walkthrough even once. I played this game in it's entirety while it was free for that limited time, but I have now purchased HL, HL2, E1 and E2 during the summer 2020 sale.","timestamp_created":1594033834,"timestamp_updated":1594033834,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481214612722396851","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72153660","author":{"steamid":"76561199030704721","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1099,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":672,"last_played":1647505114},"language":"english","review":"Gamer","timestamp_created":1594031624,"timestamp_updated":1594031624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72152609","author":{"steamid":"76561198097950532","num_games_owned":1269,"num_reviews":245,"playtime_forever":1218,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":502,"last_played":1595101550},"language":"english","review":"Crowbar is op","timestamp_created":1594030186,"timestamp_updated":1594030186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72152502","author":{"steamid":"76561198316342033","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":786,"last_played":1594031326},"language":"english","review":"SPOLIERS...\n\n\n\nThis game is amazing. It looks great, sounds great, plays great, and feels great. Valve really outdid themselves here. The graphics are amazing, especially facial expressions. Valve did a good job of creating the environments in this game, from run-down City 17 to dark,creepy Ravenholm. Weapons are standard for a FPS (pistol, smg, shotgun, AR, etc.) with a few exceptions. The gravity gun is a wondrous way to show off the games new physics engine, especially during the citadel levels where all you have is an upgraded gravity gun, and the crossbow... The story is deeply intriguing, and will keep you going from the first speech of the g-man through Ravenholm to the epic destruction of the citadel.
