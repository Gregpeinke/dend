Saw one of many (at that days) gameplays and walkthroughs on YouTube and after watching first 5 minutes I watched next video, and next, and next… After 2 hours I was sure: I'm definitely gonna buy this game. I haven't had good enough PC that time, but first thing I did after getting new computer was installing Steam and… meh, buying L4D2, what I regret. 3 weeks later I bought L4D1 and I couldn't believe that game could be so much messed up after just 12 months. The only bug I encountered in L4D1 is that Zoey's animation gets stuck in weird position after loading shotgun (but it's fine when it was empty or only one shell was loaded), and only if playing by Zoey. In L4D2 the most, huh, „critical” bug I got was having all Survivors invulnerable for a few minutes after I somehow managed to shove Jockey off my head (big shame I didn't record it then).\nBesides this, L4D2 feels like it's just not polished – dumb Survivors animations, even more overpowered weapons, cartoonish feeling, annoying behaviour of Special Infected… L4D1 is free of this flaws – and that's why it's my favourite. Heh, in L4D1 I have only my own weapons sound mod in constant use, while L4D2 has about 1 GB of mods thrown on it and I still can't get as much fun from it I get from L4D1. Big shame Valve practically dumped it in favor of money they get out of L4D2.\n\nPart II: 18 November 2016\nIt appears after all these years I've been playing this magnificent game I'm one of the very few that still enjoy playing just a normal, casual game with bunch of known people in classic vanilla coop. Despite having pretty much only one friend still being around here and sharing my preferences, I am unable to forget about this game, even when I'm not playing it. It just had so big impact on my real life I just can't. Left 4 Dead gave me everything: great moments with good players and even better people, chance to meet really good people not only in game or as a voice in my speakers, but also in real life. It learned me how to treat people so they will be straight with you and honest, but also how to „read” them. How to love and how to hate. Gave me the only one opportunity to meet someone I cannot forget despite I've been trying and wishing to. It gave me depression and suicide thoughts. At one time in my life L4D was the only thing that was keeping me away from madness. I've seen in this game so many different stories and heard so many things about people I could easily write a small book about it. In my case Left 4 Dead was like a soap opera, except that I was one of actors in it. It really changed my life and me as myself. I guess I went too deep into this game and I've never noticed when it was too late. Maybe I'm too sensitive. But still, after all these almost 3000 hours I am a different person than I was before. The bad thing about that is that I'm worse, even though I know myself better than ever before. This may look like a joke, but I'm really f♥cking serious here. Left 4 Dead created and then destroyed me. And here I am now: alone, forgotten, having problems with almost every aspect of my life except my health – a bad thing never dies.\nAnd I guess that's why there are still people playing this game.\n\nPart III: 6 April 2018\nI miss the old times, I really do. Not only those when this game was giving me so much enjoyment and this good feeling that time spent playing L4D was not wasted, but even those when it was the only thing that kept me sane. Especially now, when I have less free time to spare and I'd be even more happy to play with someone trusted. I don't know why I made this review my personal diary, but I guess I just need to express my feelings once in a while in a place where probably nobody will read this anyway. And even so, probably nobody would care. Seems like I've really been… Left 4 Dead.\nAnd I still can't forget about her.\n\nPart IV: 7 January 2019\nI still sometimes think about her, but I think I'm finally free. I don't really feel like it, but at least I really want to, and this is a big step. Deleted every possible trace of her existence in my life, but well, she will probably be in my mind for good anyway, and my heart will never be like before. Still, hopefully this is a start for a better future.\nBut this game will stay with me no matter what happened in the past.","timestamp_created":1391893971,"timestamp_updated":1546890108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559551894664764404","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9012528","author":{"steamid":"76561198064986464","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":51339,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":50358,"last_played":1393888005},"language":"english","review":"yes game\n left4","timestamp_created":1391825070,"timestamp_updated":1391825070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57442086935043335","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9002436","author":{"steamid":"76561198118037298","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":3552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":785,"last_played":1449921989},"language":"english","review":"The best game i ever played l4d is a must buy better then the 2nd l4d.

Ótimo jogo para jogar com um grupo de amigos, tanto para fazer a campanha principal quanto jogar o modo versus online. Um dos pontos positivos do game é seus cenários, totalmente escuros dando uma maior imersão no mundo cheio de zumbis. O game conta com varias campanhas, e cada uma delas se passa em lugares diferentes das outras. Mesmo já tendo o seu sucessor lançado, eu recomendo Left 4 Dead. Vale muito a pena por seus personagens que na minha opinião são bem mais carismáticos do que os do segundo game. Jogabilidade bem simples, trilha sonora pouco aparece pois o jogo trabalha mais com os sons do ambiente e dos infectados que podem aparecer.

Gesunde Menschen kaum noch zu finden.\nZoey die Studentin, Bill der alte Kriegs Veteran, Francis der Rocker und Louis der Quoten Schwarze die sich \neinen Weg aus der Zombie verseuchten Stadt bahnen wollen, bilden ein lustiges Team.\nTeamwork ist bei Left 4 Dead im Vordergrund, denn alleine kommst du nicht weit. Die Standard Zombie Wellen sorgen immer wieder für Aktion nach den kurzen Ruhe Phasen. Special Infected Zombies bieten die extra Schwierigkeit. Hat ein Special Infected wie z.B. der Smoker oder der Hunter dich in seinen Klauen brauchst du die Hilfe deiner Team Mitglieder. Der Tank der 1-2 mal pro Level zufällig auftauchen kann ist die größte Hürde. Anders als in Left 4 Dead 2 kennt der Tank hier keine Gnade. Hat er erstmal ein Opfer gewählt lässt er hier nicht locker bis entweder er oder sein Feind das zeitliche segnet.\nVerschiedene Waffen und Granaten bringen Spaß und Abwechslung in die großen Gemetzel. Allerdings wird Munition zufällig in den Leveln generiert was auch für ein leeres Maschinengewehr sorgen kann. Das Düstere Setting ist sehr Stimmungsvoll und auch wenn man das Spiel schnell durch hat, der online Modus bringt immer wieder frischen Wind in die Sache.\nMan weiß ja nie ob man gute Team Mitglieder hat oder Egoisten die dich den Zombies zum fressen ausliefern.\n\nGrafik: 7/10\nSteuerung: 10/10\nSetting und Design: 9/10\nSound: 8/10\nSpaß / Wiederspielwert: over 9000","timestamp_created":1390685864,"timestamp_updated":1390685864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46948358416557312","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8845404","author":{"steamid":"76561198095689914","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":566,"last_played":1418986725},"language":"english","review":"Best steam game played yet !!!!","timestamp_created":1390675704,"timestamp_updated":1390675704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8845281","author":{"steamid":"76561197968309820","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1650,"last_played":1391707586},"language":"english","review":"funz 4 u n da famile","timestamp_created":1390675140,"timestamp_updated":1390675140,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49773755669593811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8841081","author":{"steamid":"76561198069186721","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":173,"last_played":1486311380},"language":"english","review":"simply the best","timestamp_created":1390653105,"timestamp_updated":1390653105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8840698","author":{"steamid":"76561198075877222","num_games_owned":739,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":294,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":267,"last_played":1393609848},"language":"russian","review":"Шедевр, говорить про эту игру нет смысла, игра бесподобна и всякие там киллинг флоры, просто сосут.","timestamp_created":1390650791,"timestamp_updated":1390650791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8839402","author":{"steamid":"76561197997402039","num_games_owned":739,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":156,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":78,"last_played":1596357973},"language":"english","review":"Bd db bd>>? o.0","timestamp_created":1390642181,"timestamp_updated":1390642181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497054487466812134","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8836333","author":{"steamid":"76561198111302386","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":17874,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2791,"last_played":1487724760},"language":"english","review":"I can really feel myselft into a zombie movie fighting hordes and more hordes of zombies, it's just a great game, with excellent graphics and multiplayer too.","timestamp_created":1390614537,"timestamp_updated":1390614537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8836136","author":{"steamid":"76561198013411508","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2545,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1353,"last_played":1462090155},"language":"english","review":"Its good","timestamp_created":1390613195,"timestamp_updated":1390613195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480158746242523193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8824407","author":{"steamid":"76561198003050200","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1394307734},"language":"english","review":"(Based on L4D2)\n\nI've played A LOT of zombie games, but Left4Dead just beaten them all.

The game is a zombie apocalypse game where you play as one of four survivors trying to get themselves to safety. These survivors are Bill, Zoey, Francis and Louis. They're trying to get themselves to safety as their story began two weeks after the infection. They themselves are immune to this virus while thousands of people already become hungry undead.\n\nThe gameplay is almost similar to any Valve game, you can play up to 4 players with friends or people from the internet and play together. The zombies in this game are also unique, you won't just meet regular zombies, there are special infected that has many special abilities which can get you some troubles. Hunters for example, likes to leap and then pinned the survivors by surprise. The most fearsome infected could be the tank or the witch, they are the worst. Witch can take you down with only single attack despite her pity appearance. Weapons are quite good here, there are pump-action shotgun, dual pistols, submachine gun, assault rifle or hunting rifle. If you're overwhelmed, simply toss a pipe bomb and that thing will attract zombies from you and then blow them up.\n\nGraphics of Left 4 Dead is quite decent and impressive. The Source Engine has again prove its worthiness. Explosion effects, gore and blood effects, the sounds and the environment are all impressive, including the amazing ragdoll effects which makes the environment more chaotic. And still, the game runs pretty stable and smooth.\n\nOverall, Left 4 Dead is a good game to play with friends.

You want lots of zombies to kill but you also need some quiet times to let you know that everyone's dead and this is the end of days.  The Half-Life 2 engine combined with the A.I. known as the director really lets that experience come to a group of freinds.  A note on the multiplayer; I would recommend doing one single player chapter before joining a server just so you know what you're doing.  While it is a co-operative game you can't always expect your teammates to be understanding of new players.  The feeling of overcoming the horde and surviving all the special infected the game could throw at you and you team is just so rewarding.

They're gonna need more zombies! \n\nGrab a pistol or two, and a shotgun or automatic weapon. Kill zombies. That's it. Pick up some health or ammo along the way as you make it from safehouse to safehouse to, hopefully, rescue. There's next to no plot, and if you play on \"easy\" and don't care for achievements, people can drop in and have a fun romp without any prior knowledge of the game or thought of strategy. Can be played in a variety of co-op modes with 1-4 players (the remaining characters will be led by AI), or Versus modes with 2 teams of 4. The survivors while distinct characters in dress and recorded lines all have the same skillset, while the zombies (who are the opposing team in Versus) are specialists.\n\nPros: Good voice acting; great number of recorded lines. Fun brainless (haha, brains) shooter. Levels tend to be linear, gear limited, and operation straight forward. Go-to game for playing with people who don't play much, or who you don't have many games in common with (as it's often cheap, and there isn't much to learn, you can just get going -- you may wish to get L4D2 instead though). Can in theory be played alone (to survey the \"lay of the land\" before playing online) -- the AI is competent enough for that.\n\nCons: If you're in the above situation, fine. Otherwise, the game can feel a bit basic (especially compared to other zombie-related titles). Many achievements are extremely hard to gain in single player as the AI players will mess it up by not being in on your private plan, or just generally being too slow. Being swarmed by hordes can get a bit old, especially by fast zombies (says Zoey in the game, \"I'm calling zombie bullshit on that!\") that are in fact so fast that they can overtake you and block your path -- as if it weren't enough that them hitting you while you're running away from them also stops you.\n\nMuch as I enjoyed the game in its day, I've moved on to more recent titles, except in the \"drop-in game to play with people who can't or won't put in a lot of time to gain expertise first\" case. Before writing this review, I've revisited the game after a very long pause to gain some achievements I wanted, and after a few days I feel seriously L4D'd out. I might leave L4D2 on disk in case of an impromptu casual romp with some friends, but don't expect to come back otherwise. Greener pastures.\n\nRecommendation: Review your use case carefully; don't buy for single player experience or story. Compare carefully against Left 4 Dead 2. Wait for sale, or pick it up on the rare days when it's free.","timestamp_created":1389839446,"timestamp_updated":1389839446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534883737564086914","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8713961","author":{"steamid":"76561198113441911","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":5976,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":520,"last_played":1514448255},"language":"english","review":"Good Game but they should of added more campaigns and more modes but the rest was fine.","timestamp_created":1389775536,"timestamp_updated":1389775536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534502148628234863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8711513","author":{"steamid":"76561197968328452","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":7348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7348,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"One of my favS!

However, this version is the best!  Read to the end to find out why.\n\nNight of The Living Dead meets 28 Days Later...  what more could you ask for?\n\nEverything you've heard about Left 4 Dead is true.  It's a great game, and while there's enough action and excitement to enjoy the single player campaign, this is mostly about the instant and gratifying co-op multiplayer that you can get out of it.  Playing with friends is a blast, but playing with complete strangers can also be a barrel of laughs.  Yes your co-op partners can make the gameplay more difficult for you, but to this day there is no end to the amount players that are still playing this timeless classic of an Zombie / Action / First Person Shooter. \n\nSome things to know:\n\n* Left 4 Dead has a fun campaign which can be played alone but is most entertaining when it is played with others.\n* The story is bare-bones, and each campaign ends with a rather short bookend, but each chapter is it's own action adventure.\n* While the story might be light depth and content, the game is presented in a very B-Movie Hollywood schlock fashion that should appeal greatly to classic and modern Zombie movie fans, but also first person action fans as well.\n* Every time you play Left 4 Dead things may play out entirely differently than last time, this is especially true and adds almost endless replay value when playing with numerous different people including randomly encountered gamers.\n** Left 4 Dead is regularly modded by the player community and provides endless hours of entertainment including all new ways to play the game.  This is why the Console verison cannot really hold a candle compared to the Steam version of the game.\n\nI could go on and on about the game, but I think that Left 4 Dead has been reviewed by enough people that it isn't necessary.  I just figured I'd give my two cents and perhaps encourage anyone who still hasn't had a chance to enjoy this excellent action zombie horror game.  Here's the most helpful tip I can give you:  If you're a Zombie movie fan but don't own Left 4 Dead on PC, or World War Z on Blue Ray or DVD, then buy L4D and forget all about World War Z (and go read the book instead, cuz the movie sucked!)","timestamp_created":1389677583,"timestamp_updated":1389677583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579234957695007324","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8697425","author":{"steamid":"76561198047445766","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":437,"last_played":1650661776},"language":"english","review":"nice game","timestamp_created":1389650005,"timestamp_updated":1389650005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wInmxsMCceWWIQ=="}
