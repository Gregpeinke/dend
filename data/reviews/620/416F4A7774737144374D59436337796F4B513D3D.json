You will spend a while just finishing single-player. But if you want to play even more, grab a friend and a testing chamber built by other people, or maybe yourself. People can make amazing tests; sometimes it's just fun to wander around the market and see other people's creations. Anyway, Portal 2 has infinite hours of gameplay and has a very funny, great storyline.

Bien que très court, ce jeu de réflexion à la première personne avait séduit les joueurs par son gameplay accrocheur mais surtout grâce à son ambiance particulière et par l'humour pince-sans-rire de GLaDOS, l'intelligence artificielle mégalomane. Valve nous revient quatre ans plus tard avec une suite aux petits oignons.\n\nPortal 2 reprend donc les bases posées par son aîné. Ayant pour seule \"arme\" le désormais célèbre Portal Gun, le joueur va devoir venir à bout d'une séries de salles de tests. Malgré plusieurs ajouts renouvelant le gameplay (les flux, les gels...), le fond reste assez inchangé et se révèle toujours aussi intelligent. C'est avant-tout par la forme que ce deuxième opus se démarque de son prédécesseur. Si Portal laissait seulement entrevoir au joueur un univers intéressant, Portal 2 nous offre quant à lui une aventure inoubliable au cœur d'Aperture, pleine d'humour et surtout plus longue et plus variée. Les monologues des différents protagonistes, le scénario et la mise en scène ont été extrêmement soignés, et certains passages sont des véritables leçons de level design. Seule ombre au tableau, les temps de chargement trop fréquents que l'on doit au moteur Source vieillissant. Mais on pardonne ce petit défaut bien vite tant le reste de l’œuvre incarne la perfection. Une expérience vidéoludique incomparable, à savourer seul ou à deux dans l'excellent mode coop.\n\nC'est donc sans hésitation que je me joins à l'euphorie collective en criant moi aussi au génie. Et je pense sans exagérer qu'on tient là un des meilleurs jeux vidéo de tous les temps, dont l'univers et en phase de devenir culte (s'il ne l'était déjà grâce au premier opus). Comment ne pas tomber sous le charme des tourelles, du robot Wheatley et de Cave Johnson ? Sans oublier GLaDOS qui sera bien évidemment à nouveau de la partie. Un jeu à mettre entre toutes les mains.","timestamp_created":1403874787,"timestamp_updated":1403874787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10869317","author":{"steamid":"76561198025556369","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":720,"last_played":1628093239},"language":"turkish","review":"Fazla söze gerek yok.

Portal 2, then, can be considered the realization of Portal as a full-fledged game, giving Aperture Science and its inhabitants more characterization and exploration (Wheatley is awesome!), as well as introducing an array of new gameplay mechanics, including [spoiler]refracting laser beams[/spoiler], [spoiler]hard light[/spoiler], [spoiler]gels[/spoiler], and [spoiler]tractor beams[/spoiler].\n\nIn this specific sense, Portal 2 is more of what the original Portal promised and delivered on. If that interests you, I would say that you can probably stop reading this now, and that that alone probably merits a purchase; the game is relatively cheap now, especially during the myriad sales that show up. Co-op (which is a separate mode, not a retreading of single player) also exists this time around, and makes for some interesting puzzles with a friend (though probably not quite as hard as single player, if challenge is what you seek).\n\nStill, while it is Portal at heart, I will note one particular regression. While there are definitely many nicely designed levels, there are also quite a few poorly designed ones. Specifically, there are many puzzles where the challenge comes from nothing other than finding the obscure, hidden portal-supporting surface, from which the solution tends to fall into place immediately afterwards. This gets particularly annoying during the [spoiler]original Aperture Science[/spoiler] testing chambers, where these kinds of puzzles crop up [i]between[/i] testing chambers and effectively waste unnecessary time.\n\nAnd, like many puzzle games, Portal 2 doesn't really have much replay value; sure, you can attempt speedruns or other challenges, but those are universal and not particularly applicable to Portal 2. While DLC and user-created content theoretically helps get around this, I haven't really seen much interest in those (and I haven't tried them myself), and you should probably interpret the high critical score as \"Portal 2 was executed very well\" rather than \"Portal 2 will always be remembered as a landmark video game\".\n\nIn short, Portal 2 is more Portal goodness, and that is almost certainly a very good thing. But there can always be too much of a good thing (well, except money).","timestamp_created":1403844498,"timestamp_updated":1403844498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10858273","author":{"steamid":"76561198064373241","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":788,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":788,"last_played":1387858714},"language":"english","review":"How can you not love this game?

Player need to solve different puzzles in chambers, by using a special gun and interacting with various game elements. Compared with Portal1, Portal2's world is bigger, story thicker, and the character development more surprising. The jokes and sarcasms from two robots, GLaDOS and Wheatley, make this interesting game even more funny (:'(though sometimes those sarcasms are too brutal). Besides, what surprised me is that the single-player mode is only the game's first half, and the multi-players mode provides players a even more interesting and challenging experience. Also, surpporting Steam Workshop greatly increases Portal2's re-playability.\n\nBut the advantages above are still insufficient to make Portal2 a masterpeice. As a puzzle game, what disdinguishs Portal2 from others is its ABILITY TO COMBINE. Firstly, there is a common drawback among other puzzle games: fragmented story. It is very hard to write a continuous story when puzzles' types are the same, for the repetition greatly weakens the reality. To solve it, most puzzle game choose to write a fragmented but poetic story(ie. Braid, the Bridge, etc.). Therefore, players need to create the whole story by themselves from bits and pieces. I think this method is every wise, but that how Portal solves it is phenomenal. Portal2 not only has a continuous story, but also connects every puzzle logically. For example, when \"I\" was handling with those discarded old chambers on the bottom of the facility, players will realize that the \"puzzles\" has been extended out of chambers. \"I\" need to solve puzzles not only to beat chambers, but also to reach the next chamber. Thus, Portal2 perfectly combines the puzzles with story, and reality with repetition. Secondly, Portal2 combines an element of action with puzzles. During the game, player will experience escape, exploration and even a Boss battle! Although its topic is puzzles-solving, players can still enjoy an exciting adventure. Thus, due to its continunous story and action element, actually I prefer classifying Portal2 as a action-adventure game to a puzzle game.\n\nFinally, I want to say somehing about game elements. My favorite one is white Conversion Gel, which allows surfaces to accept portals. The reason is that it hides the solution to puzzles, and creates countless probabilities. In most case, solutions are so sensible that players can understand them immediately (if you find small white areas exist somewhere strange and isolated, you definitely will find them useful). But the white gel makes it impossible. Therefore, this stuff converts \"to use existed conditions\" to \"to create conditions\". Besides, it gives us a big hint of how to defeat Wheatley. Do you remember how white gel was invented? LOL\n\nIn conclusion, Portal2 is a unmatchable game which will be remembered forever. It is concise, it is intriguing, it is classic.","timestamp_created":1403807371,"timestamp_updated":1403807371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10841433","author":{"steamid":"76561198102757452","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":927,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":737,"last_played":1404399107},"language":"russian","review":"Советую, офигенная игра!","timestamp_created":1403806431,"timestamp_updated":1403806431,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10841366","author":{"steamid":"76561198062080117","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1430503020},"language":"hungarian","review":"Jó kis játék, a legnagyobb baja, hogy rövid(ebb mint kellene) :)","timestamp_created":1403806334,"timestamp_updated":1403806334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10841363","author":{"steamid":"76561197969744880","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":830,"last_played":1543009844},"language":"brazilian","review":"incredible! never ending game","timestamp_created":1403806330,"timestamp_updated":1543010053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10839532","author":{"steamid":"76561198067936624","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1177,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1175,"last_played":1380406284},"language":"english","review":"This game perfect for people who enjoy solving puzzles.","timestamp_created":1403803388,"timestamp_updated":1403803388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10839389","author":{"steamid":"76561198062428232","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":130,"last_played":1405670329},"language":"english","review":"I love portal.

Sie sind ebenfalls die Entwickler von Steam, also nicht sehr unbekannt. Im Spiel Portal 2 schlüpft man (im Singleplayer) in die Rolle von Chell. Die nach dem 100 jährigen Schlaf wieder aufwacht und versucht mit Reatly , einem Hilfdroiden aus Aperture Science zu fliehen, doch stattdessen erweckt er Glados (K.I aus Portal 1) und nutzt sie für sich und übernimmt die gesamte Anlage.Anders als in Portal 1 sieht man in Portal 2 sehr viele Gegenden ausserhalb von den Testkammern. Ebenfalls wurde die Physikengine in Portal 2 nochmal überarbeitet , um noch mehr Raum für die verschiedensden Rätsel zu geben. Die Singleplayer-Kampagne hat eine Spielzeit von 10 Spielstunden.\nIm Koop dürft ihr zu zweit mit Robotern die Testkammern unsicher machen. Im Koop gibt es insgesamt 40 Level, wobei der Koop Modus nicht so viel Umfang, wie der Singleplayer hat. Nun zur Musik. Die Musik in Portal 2 ist meistens nicht besonders abwechslungsreich, dafür aber immer stimmig. Meistens hört man Cyborg-artige Musik, die mir sehr gut gefallen hat und mit den Hintergrundgeräuschen, wie dem Wind oder dem Einstürzen von Objekten sehr gut hamoniert.Vorallem im Singleplayer.\nDie veraltete Source-Engine ist nicht mehr auf dem neusten Stand, wenn man darüber hinweg sieht gibt es aber nichts negatives , was mich gestört hat.
