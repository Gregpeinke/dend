Купував разом із приятелем і ні разу не пожалів. Ця головоломка цілком виправдала мої очікування, як зі сторони самостійної гри, так і зі сторони кооперативу.\n\nМеханіка гри проста та знайома багатьом. За допомогою порталів, допоміжних механізмів і логічного мислення проходити рівні. Якщо говорити про одиночну частину гри, то вона не є такою складною, як перший Portal, хоч на цей раз розробники додали кілька нових елементів, які зовсім змінили попередній стиль гри (різного виду гелі, променеві мости, антигравітаційні воронки).\n\nСюжетна складова розповідає нам про події в лабораторії Aperture через кілька сотень років, після того як Челл вимкнула ГЛеДОС.\n[i]«А, це ти... Давно не бачилися... Як справи? Я була так зайнята, поки була мертва. Ну... після того, як ти вбила мене.»[/i]\nА також про маленького модуля, який забажав влади над всім комплексом Aperture.\n[i]«Я висловлююсь не надто виразно? Я зневажаю тебе. Я ненавиджу тебе. Пихата, самовдоволена, жінка-монстр в потворному комбінезоні. Тебе і твою подружку-картоплину. Якби не ви, цей комплекс був би чудовий!»[/i]\nКрім того, у кооперативній частині стаємо свідками перших випробувань тестових кімнат за допомогою роботів. Обидві частини дуже цікаві, захоплюючі, із чудовою атмосферою і звичайно разом із чудовими монологами ГЛеДОС або Вітлі, які переповнені кумедними фразами.\n\nМоя оцінка 10/10, бо це дійсно шедевр і я з радістю рекомендую її усім!\n\nПо закінченню всіх завдань, ви можете знайти в майстерні цікаву карту та за бажанням зробити нову власноруч.
