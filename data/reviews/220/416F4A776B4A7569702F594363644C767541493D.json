Absolutna klasyka, gra przez wielu uważana za najlepszą grę jaka kiedykolwiek powstała. Grę przeszedłem 4 razy, z czego ostatni raz, był właśnie pierwszym na Steam. Zajęło mi to ok. 17 godz.\n\n+ Intrygująca, świetnie poprowadzona fabuła, kontynuująca wydarzenia z pierwszej części i ogromnie rozszerzająca uniwersum.\n+ W swoich czasach piękna, bardzo realistyczna grafika, która nawet po dziś dzień nieźle wygląda. Świetne animacje postaci, mimika twarzy, realistyczne refleksy wody, wyraźne, ostre tekstury.\n+ Gravity gun, fizyka i wszelkie zagadki z nią związane. Fizyka ogólnie robi wrażenie nawet dzisiaj.\n+ Świetna, klimatyczna ścieżka dźwiękowa, utwory muzyczne świetnie pasują do tego co się akurat dzieje na ekranie. Kiedy za pierwszym razem grałem to zdawało mi się, że w ogóle ich nie ma xd.\n+ Sporo różnorodnych broni, z których każda się przydaje\n+ Świetne poziomy w bardzo różnorodnych klimatach: pływanie łodką, miasto pełne zombie, partyzancka walka z małym oddziałem na ulicach miasta... każdy poziom to coś nowego. Nie ma miejsca na nudę.\n+ Ogólnie świetny klimat\n- Minusów oczywiście brak","timestamp_created":1607773587,"timestamp_updated":1614525536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.64769136905670166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82169851","author":{"steamid":"76561198016275788","num_games_owned":279,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2004,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1083,"last_played":1638328893},"language":"english","review":"it's an experience more than game","timestamp_created":1607773519,"timestamp_updated":1607773519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82168753","author":{"steamid":"76561199046067131","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":397,"last_played":1616500344},"language":"russian","review":"Игра в целом интересная и русский язык топ озвучка\n","timestamp_created":1607772603,"timestamp_updated":1607772603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82166213","author":{"steamid":"76561199026448211","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":392,"last_played":1607768305},"language":"russian","review":"игра крутая всем советую","timestamp_created":1607770426,"timestamp_updated":1607770426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82162815","author":{"steamid":"76561198799653157","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":612,"last_played":1619978418},"language":"czech","review":"best story game ever :D","timestamp_created":1607767436,"timestamp_updated":1607767436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82162275","author":{"steamid":"76561198962769834","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":608,"last_played":1654380152},"language":"english","review":"Hands down, best game of the 21st century.

Jogabilidade excelente, história excelente, gráficos muito bonitos, que deixam muitos jogos atuais no chão... Enfim, pacote completo. Agora eu entendo o porquê de tanta hype nesse jogo, e posso afirmar: ESSE FOI O MELHOR JOGO QUE EU JÁ JOGUEI NA MINHA VIDA. Se eu pudesse, voltava no tempo, só pra esquecer e poder jogar de novo.

Compre sabendo que é um jogo de 2004 com gráficos de 2014/15. Se sua maquina for no mínimo um duo core você já consegue apreciar o jogo em uma boa qualidade gráfica. Já jogou Halo? Se sua resposta for sim então eu sinto lhe informar que esse jogo é melhor. Half Life 2 está colocando o Halo Infinito (jogo do macaco) no bolço. Use fones de ouvido, é uma dica muito útil acho que para qualquer jogo no estilo fps.
