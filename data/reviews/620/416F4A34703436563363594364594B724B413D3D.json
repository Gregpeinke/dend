Este jogo não só faz jus a seu antecessor como trouxe diversas novidades, entre elas, a MARAVILHOSA \"Campanha Cooperativa\". Além disso, conseguiu dar uma continuação genial à história iniciada no primeiro jogo. Obrigatório para aqueles que jogaram o primeiro! A história tem um ótimo desenrolar, totalmente coerente, apresentando personagens novos e trazendo de volta os antigos.\nA jogabilidade é ótima, fazendo com que você queira jogar cada vez mais, caso você seja paciente para resolver os enigmas. A mecânica é a continuação do primeiro, puzzles, com botões, portais, turrets, porém com novos elementos.\nOs gráficos são ótimos, rodam em computadores leves como o meu que apesar de ser i7, não possui placa de vídeo dedicada.\nE por fim... Um bom editor de fases incluso no jogo,  além de permitir criar novos desafios, possui uma vasta workshop onde você pode compartilhá-los com seus amigos e vice-versa.\n\nResumindo: O jogo está mais do que recomendado, porém devo advertir que apesar de possuir uma boa dose de ação, esse é mais o tipo de jogo onde você tem que parar para pensar antes de cada movimento. Então... Se você é do tipo \"atire primeiro e pense depois\" e viciado por ação, pode achar meio entediante. Porém se estiver com uma mente mais aberta, poderá ter uma ótima experiência!\n\nPs.: Muitos tem o costume de achar que este é só um jogo simples, porém muito bem elaborado. MAS se você for curioso como eu e quiser explorar mais um pouco, poderá ser surpreender!","timestamp_created":1403330686,"timestamp_updated":1480042750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10597580","author":{"steamid":"76561198079988740","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":520,"last_played":1507493035},"language":"russian","review":"Супер!","timestamp_created":1403328237,"timestamp_updated":1403328237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10597504","author":{"steamid":"76561198067170449","num_games_owned":1632,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":130,"last_played":1405886037},"language":"english","review":"I don't care who you are, what type of gamer you are, what kind of games you like.\n\nThis game is one of the greatest ever made.\n\nWriting, gameplay, story, graphics, challenge, all perfect.
