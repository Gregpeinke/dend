my full review on this game, make sure to read my portal 1 review! I absolutely loved this game, the gameplay is awesome.. the puzzles are nice and the post-apocalyptic feel of it all gets me excited even more than it did in portal one.. It is so many years later, you can really see how much time has worn out the facility. You can almost feel it! The small details really got me going, damaged levels that are fixed up just so you can complete the 'tests'. In the beginning up in the higher levels, all the plants and the occasional bird chirping through the broken roof... and more hiding spots- made by you know who! The grandness of some of the area's, and the auto recordings etc that let you know what happened there.. (also, try listening to the prerecorded messages entirely if you have not yet done that, they are not only informative but also very funny at times!) Anyway, if you played portal 1 but not portal 2? Stop reading this and go play it, No seriously! play it.. you can play through it in a day, and you will be so sorry it is over.. If you haven't played portal 1 and are still reading this, Go play portal one! Love the hell out of it, and than go play 2 and be sad when its over.... And pray with me for a portal-3 how ever unlikely that seems.\n\n\n\n- Spoiler alert!-\n\n\n\nI really liked how GlaDos is SO much more cynical and real than in the first edition, and i really got a good laugh out of Miss Potato head! xD","timestamp_created":1390312974,"timestamp_updated":1390312974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8795842","author":{"steamid":"76561198099416045","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1406124178},"language":"russian","review":"Крутая игра","timestamp_created":1390310611,"timestamp_updated":1390310611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8795483","author":{"steamid":"76561198108214334","num_games_owned":622,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":15293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2065,"last_played":1529941347},"language":"english","review":"I am notoriously difficult to impress. Most games, even the absolute best ones, I merely pick at for a few hours here and there until they're done, and it's extremely rare that I actually go back and play something a second time. Portal 2 however?\n\nWheatley and GLaDOS have moments of real hilarity in their dialogue and the story is a good one. The puzzles are fun and interesting and the inclusion of new elements that Portal didn't have, the orange and blue gels make for some really interesting tests. I played it all the way through in one go. Then I did the co-op puzzles with a friend. A few community made tests later, I was back in for a second playthrough...\n\nIt leaves you wanting more. \n\nI highly recommend this game, and I'm also seriously hoping for a Portal 3.

И мой интерес меня не подвел. Подобных игр я на тот момент не встречал, хоть и сюжет не совсем был понятен и цели прохождения уровней, к концу сюжета Portal вся суть была донесена, но все же остались вопросы и возникло большое желание поиграть в Portal 2. Приобрел его на распродаже со скидкой 75% не задумываясь и не жалею, так как игра принесла только одно удовольствие. Был полностью раскрыт сюжет головоломки не напрягали, достойная прорисовка уровней, история создания лаборатории была раскрыта по ходу прохождения, харизматичные герои которых невольно цитируешь после прохождения. В общем есть игры на 1 раз, а есть игры, которые переиграть так и тянет, так вот Portal 2, одна из тех игр, которые переигрываешь несколько раз. Кооператив Portal 2 также принес много удовольствия. Даже играя с незнакомым человеком и даже если вы говорите на разных языках, игра не становится менее интереснее, а на оборот, так как в ход вступает не голосовая связь, а связь жестами.
