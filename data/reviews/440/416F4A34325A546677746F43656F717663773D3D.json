The game offers 9 characters who all play completely differently but the game remains balanced in casual matches. Except not really, since these days, the game is unfortunately full of sniper bots that can one shot you literally anytime they want.\nAlthough the characters aren't all necessarily balanced when in 1v1 combat, the gameplay is more about your positioning and your role, for example Medic is gonna be more useful powering up tank characters rather than doing damage himself. \nThe game's visual style is unique and colorful, contrasting interestingly with its occasional brutality. The characters' designs and expressions are all well animated and give characters some personality.\nSounddesign is exceptional here, each weapon sounds great and all the characters have at least some amount of voice acting, which is always well made and sounds very over the top, which fits this game well and the music is pretty good too.\nThanks to community's work with all the new game modes and maps, new content comes out pretty much all the time, so the game never stops offering its players new experiences.\nSince it's free and it's from Valve, it's full of lootboxes that you can only open with keys you have to pay real money for. Fortunately, the rewards are either just skins, taunts and other visual changes, or equipment which always has both advantages and disadvantages, so usually, you won't have a clear advantage over other players so the game doesn't become pay2win. You also get the chests for achievements, meaning you get at least something for playing the game well and overcoming various, specific challenges. \nTeam Fortress 2 is a terrific game, well balanced, endlessly replayable and still has a huge playerbase and is a must-play for any and all MP FPS fans.","timestamp_created":1491070778,"timestamp_updated":1656268385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30868758","author":{"steamid":"76561198279368733","num_games_owned":322,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":308197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":591,"playtime_at_review":266735,"last_played":1660514691},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um clássico que com certeza você deveria ter na sua biblioteca Steam.\nO jogo em em sua essência é ótimo, muito divertido para jogar sozinho ou com amigos.\n\n[h1]✔️ Pontos Positivos:[/h1]\n\n• Diversos [b]mapas[/b] e [b]modos[/b] de jogo.\n• Ótimo [b]balanceamento[/b] considerando o número de equipamentos disponíveis (100+) para cada mercenário.\n• [b]HATS![/b]\n\n[h1]⛔ Pontos Negativos:[/h1]\n\n• Contas [b]F2P[/b] (free-to-play) [u]não possuem acesso ao chat por texto ou VoIP[/u].\nEsta restrição também se aplica a lista de comandos para as falas dos personagens durante o jogo. \nCaso você precise avisar ao seu time que há Spies por perto (X+2) ou chamar por um Medic para lhe curar (E), será necessário comprar algo dentro da loja do jogo (Loja Mann Co.).\n• [b]Cheaters[/b] vem dominando os servidores (principalmente em partidas casuais).\n• Sem [b]Updates[/b] significativos (armas, mapas ou novos eventos) há anos.\n\nO Team Fortress 2 é bom, a Valve o corrompe.","timestamp_created":1491025847,"timestamp_updated":1641964745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30785122","author":{"steamid":"76561198261849239","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":382932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":2351,"playtime_at_review":367409,"last_played":1660552130},"language":"english","review":"As much I loved this game, I've start wanting to backdown from the game.

Let's take a look at the final version of their take on the burgeoning FPS genre.\n\nWell, it's no Half Life 3 but Team Fortress 2 promises that Valve level of quality that they somehow have developed. Have we mentioned how much we'd just prefer this to be Half Life 3?\n\n\nYou already know what to expect from Team Fortress 2 after the last game in the series, and Valve doesn't offer any surprises. There's some new stuff, some irratiting bugs have been ironed out, and a new storyline bolted on to make everything look welcoming for newcomers.\n\nSet in a wartorn part of the world, the game hands you the task of shooting all the terrorists before they shoot you. Some of them are tougher than others. Some need to be shot in the head or the leg before they die. Over the course of the game you will have the choice of over 12 weapons and your character has a great beard.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Fortress 2 tries to seperate itself from the pack with interesting features. Team Fortress 2 was designed mainly as an online experience and it's pretty easy to set up and play. The game automatically logs in to the required server and all you need to do is find some other like minded players to join in the fun with. Enemy AI is strong, but come on, who plays solo these days? Multiplayer is a breeze to get going, and playing against another human is always a far sight more challenging than your PC could ever be.\n\n\nSome people may bemon the lack of co-op play, but this reviewer believes it would have caused ludonarrative dissonance.\n\n\nFrom the moment the impressively lit intro scenes start you know you're in for something special, and the actual game doesn't disappoint at all.\nAdditionally, there is no faulting the environments on display. It's a testament to the graphical prowress of that hot new graphics card you bought for an exhorbitant amount when its in the hands of the experienced team at Valve.\n\nThe 3D world of Team Fortress 2 comes to life in a cartoony way, which is nice if you're a fan of the genre.The visuals represent the objects they represent well.\n\nPerformance is best on a Nvidia system, and you'll need at least a 5500 card to be able to run the game at the now-standard 768 by 594 resolution with full AA and trilinear mimap interpolation. It's another feather in the PC gaming's cap. Valve have done an impressive job of carrying over what made the console versions so great, not to mention adding a feast of new features and effects designed to make your mouth water and your mouse hand twitch with excitement. Not just anyone can indulge in this kaleidoscopic menagerie of dino blasting, though - this party is for owners of the latest cards only.\nGame of the Year contender? Maybe!\n\n\n\nOverall Score: 10 / 10\nReview by Snoopy, Professional @$$ eater","timestamp_created":1488326079,"timestamp_updated":1514790823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30250632","author":{"steamid":"76561198272086867","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":966,"last_played":1476541040},"language":"english","review":"The game got an update that everyone was excited for but it ended up ruining the game and now its dead.
