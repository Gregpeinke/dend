It flows seamlessly from chapter to chapter and is not once broken up (aside from short loading times).  The narrative and gameplay is always in the control of the player and the two are completely interwoven.\n-  The AI is still great and in some ways is better than that of HL2.\n-  This version is better than Half-Life: Source which has a lot of bugs and glitches.  This is the superior version; plays exactly how it did in 1998.\n-  This is the first game to introduce that distinct atmosphere you’ll find in most games set in the Half-Life universe.  It’s cold and metallic, industrial and gloomy, but in a good way.  No other game company that I know of nails this feel quite like Valve can: think the halls of Black Mesa in Half-Life, the area behind the test chambers in Portal, and Nova Prospect in Half-Life 2.\n-  And of course the gameplay: the best you’ll find in any shooter.  You start simple with a crowbar and pistol and progress to machine guns, shotguns, crossbows, rocket launchers, laser guns and more.  The complexity and fun keep ramping up all the way to the end.\n-  But should you get this or the Black Mesa remake?  Despite its age Half-Life is so much more polished.  There are several minor drawbacks and glitches in BM that make it come close but just miss the mark of being a worthy remake of Half-Life.  It also lacks that certain feel and atmosphere that I spoke of earlier.  Besides, this version is cheaper.  Unless the dated graphics bother you, get this version.","timestamp_created":1529934504,"timestamp_updated":1627313563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43034812","author":{"steamid":"76561198268896994","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1650227132},"language":"russian","review":"Часто горела жопа, но игра все равно классная","timestamp_created":1529930557,"timestamp_updated":1651522745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43033529","author":{"steamid":"76561198400948399","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1527890602},"language":"english","review":"its out dated but when it first came out it was great","timestamp_created":1529927503,"timestamp_updated":1529927503,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.350007742643356323","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43030321","author":{"steamid":"76561198381483049","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":469,"last_played":1655748906},"language":"turkish","review":"Z","timestamp_created":1529918593,"timestamp_updated":1529918593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43018864","author":{"steamid":"76561198221876568","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":621,"last_played":1530812896},"language":"turkish","review":"Old but dİamond","timestamp_created":1529880390,"timestamp_updated":1529880390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43017465","author":{"steamid":"76561198276422029","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1622841214},"language":"turkish","review":"CİDDEN AVEL AVEL + - YÖNLERİYLE İNCELEYENLER VAR AQ .D ŞAKA MISINIZ OLM","timestamp_created":1529876199,"timestamp_updated":1604790959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43017373","author":{"steamid":"76561198171515470","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7312,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1989,"last_played":1626126616},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito legal o jogo, graficos excelentes (para aquela epoca) e assustador algumas horas recomendo ULTRA o jogo.

Well, for me, it has to be the visual world that captures the core of our imaginations. And with this little gem called Half-Life, it comes as no exception that this game continues to boggle the mind and leave gamers alike wondering. There is more heart, creativity and scientific ingenuity there is in this one title than there is in most series and is arguably Valve's greatest achievement. With over 50 game awards, it's a strong justification. Half-Life isn't just one of the greatest FPS' games of all time. Half-Life isn't literally one of the best purchases you can ever get on Steam. Half-Life is quite simply, one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nWhen compared to certain FPS' games in the past and todays time, which both heavily rely on long-winded cutscenes to present the main narrative of the game, Half-Life annihilates this often compulsed aspect, by detailing the plotlines that keeps the player still in control of the first-person viewpoint, leaving the cutscenes rolling while you still have full access to the gameplay and character controllability. For summarization, You will see through the eyes of Gordon Freeman at all times.\n\nThe game is a perpetual maze; leaving the player to work at tasks that involve being locked into battle and overall puzzle solving to advance through the many challenges that wait up ahead. Most of the time, the story illuminates the puzzles by the actions to proceed, such as maze scenarios and building boxes to use as staircases. Although Half-Life has short-lived loading screens from time to time after leaving a certain area for a new one, the game has no levels. But, to make up for this traditional concept, the game is split into a number of mind-boggling chapters filled with rich story and easy adaptability.\n\nTo start off with this game's story, you're none other than Gordon Freeman. A young man who holds a Ph.D in theoretical physics who starts his daily grind back at the Black Mesa Research Facility; a fictional complex that is stranded in a remote desert located in the suburbs of New Mexico. Arriving late for work yet again, you take the tram system around the Black Mesa Research Facility and at this point, objectives that his game has fulfilled such as breath-taking visuals and movie quality animation begins to blossom. The tram sequence at the beginning of the game can only be summed up in one word; Incredible. It's as if the things that come flying at you from every angle and position, almost reminiscent of watching an action-packed movie, along with the credits of the producer's names proudly fading in and out on the corner of the screen.\n\nAs you make your first step in the heavily secured facility, you're constantly reminded that you put on your Hazardous Environmental suit, or the H.E.V suit for short. While all things are hunky-dory, those things soon turn to the worst very soon. After a failed experiment, involving a collision between a rare intergalactic specimen from another dimension with an Anti-Mass Spectrometer, the Black Mesa facility falls in ruins, meaning you are one of the only key survivors of the infamous ''Black Mesa Incident''. And with this, alien life-forms from the dimension of ''Xen'' are pulled from their dimension into ours and are running amok the ruined facility, along with the Army that storm the place after the gone, haywired facility's emergency call has been echoed. This of course doesn't make things any easier and you soon find yourself battling both the aliens and the military.\n\nWhile there isn't exactly much to complain about, I would admit that guiding the chickened-out scientists and professors around the facility can be quite a pain now and again due to some seldom poor AI programming, as well as the alien life-form, Vortigaunt, from which you would have to wait and be patient for them to wreck down wooden doors in front of you, as you are not capable of doing that yourself. (You do start off with a crowbar, right?) As well as I'm probably not the only one who made the same mistake by killing them through a small opening, before they did in fact begin to tear down the doors. But then again, this is where the used scripted intermissions started to show, so that's an added bonus to the magnitude of the game.\n\nFor the long run, I've had fun and joy both reviewing this amazing game and playing this amazing game. If you haven't play Half-Life or even worse, not familiar with Half-Life, it's still a big compulsory recommendation from me.","timestamp_created":1529819437,"timestamp_updated":1529819437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42989938","author":{"steamid":"76561198081791096","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1494,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1116,"last_played":1631588666},"language":"english","review":"He shoot the aleinnm and it diesd.
