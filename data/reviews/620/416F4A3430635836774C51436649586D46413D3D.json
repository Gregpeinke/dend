Portal really hyped up the community with its portal mechanics (inspired by Narbacular Drop), sad to say it was really short, so the community demanded a sequel, which originates Portal 2.\n\nFirst gameplay through Portal 2, puzzles are really confusing, requiring you to think outside the box. Luckily, either GLaDOS, Wheatly or Cave are there to hint the players to go through the puzzles. There are lots of new mechanics too, especially the paint mechanics (inspired by Tag: The Power of Paint). The story is good and its comedy won't bore you. The game has a well made narration, showing the good and bad sides of each character.\n\nThe other thing that hyped it up was the Coop mode. Portals alone are confusing enough, now we have two sets of portals waiting to solve tons of other puzzles provided. This mode requires lots of cooperation and teamwork, and also a keen eye on possible solutions. Portal 2 also provided lots of utilities for coop plays, like gestures to express emotions, ping to show stuff, or even timers to sync in movement.\n\nOnce singleplayer and coop was done, nothing else is able to be done besides repeating the stories or doing challenges. Until, Valve released the workshop. Portal 2 was associated with the Steam Workshop, giving players a chance to create their own maps with ingame tools and playing endless amount of maps created by other players. This revived the Portal 2 hype, having players back on the game, creating maps and playing maps. Some maps are insanely hard, some maps are for casual players who love to stroll and play around.\n\n[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]\nPuzzle SP/Co-op FPS game, challenging your mind to think outside the box while refreshing you with comedy and silly stuff. In-game Co-op features are well made.
