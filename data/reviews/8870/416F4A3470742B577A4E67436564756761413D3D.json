The main characters build a strong and interesting story with Booker (the player) as a hired mercenary focused on paying off a debt with this one job. And Elizabeth, the assistant and rescuee, giving a charmingly believable feminitiy while displaying a strong and respectable character. \nThe story goes from general tensions to humanistic interactions. Dealing with everything from basic right and wrong to parallel universes and thermodynamics. Even after you finish the game, which has a fantastic twist, you'll want to look up all the little details that were odd at first but make a whole heck of a lot of sense later.\nWhile it doesn't rival the movie Primer when it comes to being the best time travel movie ever, it still is worth it solely to enjoy the philosophical conflicts presented throughout the game.
