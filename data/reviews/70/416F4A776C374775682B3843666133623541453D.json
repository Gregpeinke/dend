[/h1]\n\n하프 라이프는 1998년 우리가 지금 사용하고 있는 이 스팀 프로그램의 개발 회사인 밸브 코퍼레이션이 만든 최초의 게임이다. \n\n하버드 대학을 다니던 대학생 게이브 뉴얼은 학교를 중퇴하고 마이크로 소프트에 입사를 한다. 마이크로 소프트에서 운영체제를 개발하던 게이브 뉴얼은 북미에서 가장 많이 사용되는 소프트웨어는 윈도우가 아니라 ‘둠’이라는 게임인 걸 알게 되고 이때부터 게임에 큰 관심을 가지게 된다. 결국 게이브 뉴얼은 친구이자 마이크로 소프트의 임원이었던 마이크 해링턴과 퇴사를 하고 밸브 코퍼레이션을 창립하게 된다.\n\n당시 북미에서는 1인칭 슈팅 게임 즉 FPS 장르 게임이 대세를 이루고 있었다. 1인칭 시점으로 게이머가 모니터를 보면서 마치 현장에 직접 있는 듯한 몰입을 하게 만들고 마우스나 키보드를 누르자마자 총이나 무기가 즉각적으로 반응하게 만드는 장르의 특수함 때문에 식을 줄 모르는 인기를 달리고 있었다. \n\nFPS의 기틀을 잡은 울펜슈타인3D, 다양한 퍼즐과 착실한 레벨 디자인을 보여준 둠, 이후 듀크 뉴켐3D, 퀘이크2등 FPS 장르는 수 많은 기술적 진보를 이루는 작품들과 아류작들을 양상하며 혁신적인 발전을 하기 시작했다.\n\n하프 라이프는 이러한 FPS 장르의 발전을 답습하는 것은 기본이고 어두운 화면과 공포스러운 상황을 곁들이며 플레이어로 하여금 긴장감을 놓치지 않는 플레이를 선사한다. \n\n플레이어는 블랙메사 연구소에 고용된 고든 프리맨이라는 과학자를 조종하게 된다. 고든은 평소처럼 직접 실험에 나서게 되는데 “행정관”의 지시로 검증되지 않은 새로운 표본을 무리하게 실험하면서 아수라장이 펼쳐지게 된다. \n\n게임성은 현재 존재하는 FPS 장르의 게임성을 그대로 답습하고 있다. 마우스 커서로 조준점을 조작해서 적을 쏴 맞추고 좁은 환풍구를 앉아서 지나다니고 사다리를 타서 올라가고 물속을 들어가서 헤엄치고 장애물들을 밀거나 당겨서 일반적으로 올라갈 수 없는 곳을 올라가고 높이 점프할 수 있는 특수한 바닥을 밟아서 점프하는 등 지금은 당연하다고 여겨지는 조작들을 할 수 있다.\n\n하프라이프는 FPS 장르의 레벨 시스템을 정립한 것으로 유명하다. 극초반부는 게임의 배경과 이야기를 진행시키며 조작을 경험하게 하고. 초중반은 간단한 무기와 약한 적을 만나며 몰입도를 높혀나간다. 그리고 중후반부에서는 본격적인 서사가 펼쳐지고 강력한 적들을 마주하게 되는 구성이다. \n\n이러한 구성의 짜임새는 20년이 넘은 지금 플레이해도 어색하거나 촌스럽지 않을 정도로 정교하고 재미가 있다. 고전 게임들의 특징이자 단점 중에 하나가 친절하지 않다는 점이다. 진행해야하는 방향은 물론이고 퍼즐의 힌트도 제대로 알려주지 않는 경우가 많은데 하프라이프도 물론 이러한 부분들이 존재한다. \n\n그럼에도 불구하고 맵의 구조가 매우 직관적으로 잘 표현되어 있어서 길을 잃고 헤매는 경우가 거의 없고 퍼즐 또한 상식적인 부분으로 별다른 힌트 없이 해결이 가능한 것이 대부분이다. 물론 아쉬운 부분도 존재한다. 후반부의 맵인 젠의 구성은 많은 사람들이 지적할 정도로 굉장히 불편한데다가 어렵고 복잡하게 되어있다. \n\n게임 자체에 자막을 지원하지 않아 발매 초기에는 영문판으로만 즐길 수밖에 없었으나 스팀으로 발매하면서 한국어 음성 더빙이 추가되었다. 다만 이 더빙판의 문제점이 존재하는데 더빙하는 연기자들의 연기 톤이 상당히 이상하다는 점이다. 마치 국어책을 읽는 것 같은 연기를 보여주는데 이로 인해서 인터넷에서 많은 패러디들이 만들어졌다. 다만 연기력에 크게 신경을 쓰지 않는다면 게임을 진행하는데 큰 어려움은 의외로 없다. 앞서 썼다시피 게임 자체에 대사 자막을 지원하지 않기 때문에 다른 외국어를 할 수 없다면 결국 한국어 음성으로 즐길 수밖에 없다.\n\n20년이 지난 고전게임인데도 불구하고 하프라이프는 상당히 완성도가 높고 재미가 있는 게임이다. 게임 역사에 한 획을 게임이고 플레이 타임도 적절하니 아직 해보지 않은 분들에게 모두 추천하는 작품이다.","timestamp_created":1576633121,"timestamp_updated":1576633337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.719541072845458984","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60046450","author":{"steamid":"76561198126961149","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":406,"last_played":1575191647},"language":"turkish","review":"Sürekli olarak hızlı kayıt alma alışkanlığını kazanacağınız oyun.

The blend of environments and well-paced contextual storytelling displays a competency that stands out even two decades after the game's release. Despite its moments of frustration and inevitable signs of aging, Half-Life was commendably engaging and playing through offered insight into a source many developers have used as inspiration. Within this wealth of ideas, a personally highlighted theme was the way progression is satisfyingly conveyed through new weapon types, enemies, and environmental mechanics to ensure that each chapter is distinct and memorable.\n\nThe biggest shortcoming of Half-Life is no doubt the immediate and endless access to save states. The game can be quite difficult in places and auto-saves or scripted checkpoints are contrastingly rare. With how accessible quicksaves are, a cautious player will naturally find themselves capturing every available moment of safety. Repeatedly cutting back to try the same jump or more efficiently clear the same room doesn't sound like an intended or entertaining mechanic, yet progressing through Half-Life would suffer without this crutch.\n\nThe sale price is a no-brainer for anyone looking to further understand a historic game that's inspired so many other modern classics.","timestamp_created":1576626037,"timestamp_updated":1576626037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60041580","author":{"steamid":"76561198583161707","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":689,"last_played":1576978378},"language":"english","review":"yep

It's not any suprise to me, because the story was written by real sci-fi writer. Half life have amaizing dark and a little bit mysterious atmosphere, huge level diversity (from black mesa labs, to border world called ''Xen''). \n\nPersonally, I generally enjoyed second half of the game much more (since ''questionable ethics'' level), but the first few levels are also very good at building the game atmosphere and slowly showing us new opponents and possibilities to defeat them.  Many different weapons and enemies with their own strengts and weakness will force you to use your brain to choose unique strategy for each fight. \n\nThis is an old style game, so forget about getting many advices while playing it, sometimes you could stuck a llittle bit and have to think what to do next, because game have many small logic quests. To solve logic problems you must often attentivelly look around and explore the enviroment (for e.g. how this machines works, or what is the sequence of some alien behavior).\n\nGameplay is linear, but during your journey through black mesa base you can often resolve the same small problem by a few different ways (e.g. kill all aliens, or avoid fight and find the closest way to immidiatelly escape), which was very innovative at the times when Half Life was released. \n\nShooting mechanics is good. You have many weapons including classics like: shotgun, assault rifle, pistol, extremly strong magnum revolver, crossbow and of course iconic crowbar. You have also many explosive materials, some futuristic energetic weapons and even weapons made by aliens. Shooting is very fun, only throwing granades is a little bit dummy. \n\nIn the terms of movement I noticed that your character often slides, which could be sometimes irritating while precise jumping, but after a little practice you will control it suprisingly good. And of course you could try bunny hop which is extremly fun. \n\nGraphics is very good for the 1998, and acceptable now. Of course it does not match todays standards, but it made the standards at that time period and for few years later. \n\npros:\n- gameplay\n- good, classic shooter mechanic\n- the plot and the atmosphere\n- levels design and their diversity\n- many different weapons and enemies \n- unique experience which is the result of shooter and logic game mix\n- excellent second half of the game (since ''questionable ethics'' level)\n\nCons\n- for somebody graphics could be unacceptable, but it's fairly not that bad \n- at the beginning movement mechanic could be sometimes very frustraiting, especially while jumping \n- some moments could be very hard but hey, it's an old game and during that times games were not made for casuals\n\n9,5/10","timestamp_created":1576581388,"timestamp_updated":1576582697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60011751","author":{"steamid":"76561198167164979","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":894,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1639494886},"language":"english","review":"sgoty\n","timestamp_created":1576577901,"timestamp_updated":1576577901,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60003779","author":{"steamid":"76561198892580636","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2215,"last_played":1654794517},"language":"russian","review":"как говорится.

It holds up still in 2019 and I played it in anticipation of Half Life Alyx, the only other Valve game I completed was Portal at the time of writing this. The graphics are clearly old but I don't think it should prevent people from playing the game, there are workarounds if you really think it's an eyesore but for me personally I don't mind it. I questioned that before I would play this if it would've been a better choice to play Black Mesa first instead. Personally I'm glad I chose this, the gameplay is essentially what makes this still bearable and a fun game and its really why it gets the praise it deserves, there were no mind blowing mechanics or anything from start to finish but you have to keep in mind the age of this game and how there are projects being made with an infinite more amount of power and evolution in technology and advancement in game design. Even after finishing it I would play another sequel if the graphics were exactly the same as these ones just because its enjoyable. (I'm going to play the expansions and I look forward to it) \n\nBasically it's almost strange that this game is fun and I think it will be for you if you enjoy playing any kind of first person shooter. It's quite infuriating knowing the way Valve is and how they have been releasing their products recently (if any) and I hope that'll change for the future, overall I wouldn't say it's a \"must play\" simply because of the fact that its a classic but what I will say is that I feel like if an outsider is looking at this and wondering \"whats so special about it?\" in the simplest terms its just a fun time waster. (That's a compliment) It's worth a shot today and probably still will be even a decade from now.","timestamp_created":1576522493,"timestamp_updated":1576522493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59969895","author":{"steamid":"76561198828319721","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3769,"last_played":1641464000},"language":"turkish","review":"OYNAYIN PİÇ KURULARI","timestamp_created":1576519700,"timestamp_updated":1576519700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466101676225662231","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59969725","author":{"steamid":"76561198937519316","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":195,"last_played":1614597463},"language":"polish","review":"Bardzo fajne!!!","timestamp_created":1576519469,"timestamp_updated":1576519469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59968587","author":{"steamid":"76561198850436021","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":251,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1628973352},"language":"turkish","review":"Masterpiece","timestamp_created":1576517895,"timestamp_updated":1576517895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59968301","author":{"steamid":"76561198365831766","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":2037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2037,"last_played":1577395870},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bom em geral, mesmo sendo antigo ainda me diverto bastante com ele.
