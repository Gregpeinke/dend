play time of this game is far bigger than what it says here.

It gets kind of repetitive, because you know what to expect the more time you play. \"Wield this door\" \"Stalkers come from there, watch out\". But being the same game every time you play is not what defines this game. What defines this game is if you can defeat the Patriarch (the big boss), and also leveling perks so you can kill him with ease and go to a more advanced difficulty. The movement of the zombies is kind of predictable, but who cares, they're zombies they are supposed to be dumb.\n\nGraphics 7/10 - Not too bad, even in 2015 it is still enjoyable\nSound 7/10 - Grunts and bullets all the time, and heavy metal music on the background, not bad but could be better\nGameplay 7/10 - Very standard FPS\nPersonal Enjoyment 7/10 - I had a lot of fun playing this with friends.

It doesnt matter if you play Multiplayer or Singleplayer, its simply impossible to get bored. You fight your way through waves of Zeds as you get to face the different Zed Types and need to buy better gear in order to defeat them. From the way the Vanilla Maps are made to the easy-to-understand interface, from the good selection of weapons to the gore splattering all over the map as you kill Zeds, this is just a masterpiece of nonsense splatter shooters and its incredibly easy to just forget time why you mindlessly murder zeds all over again and again.\n\n[code]10/10[/code]\n\n[h1]The Zeds[/h1]\nNow what makes this game different from most Zombie games is the variety of Zeds, all needing to be defeated with tactics that you get used to over time. Lets start over with the basic clot. Don't let it near you or it will grab you and give stronger Zeds the chance to gore you fast... (see what I did here?). Then there's the gorefast. It has a blade and will charge at you if it gets in range. Its easy to kill, just aim for the head and 1-2 good shots will kill it. Then the bloat. The easiest way to kill this fat bastard is to shoot off his head over a safe distance, because if you let him get too close he will puke at you and his bile is... well... not really healthy for you. Also if you damage him too much at his main body, he will explode, making guts and bile splatter all over you and that is not healthy either. He is really easy to dispatch, but make sure you always check your health, otherwise you might get a problem over time. Next one is the crawler. Who is as annoying as his name sounds. Crawls around on the map, jumps at you, is not as easy to his as a clot, and will tear down your kevlar in no time. Crawlers only have a very low amount of hitpoints, so I suggest if you have time you dispatch them first. Lets look at the next candidate: the stalker. The problem about this bitch is that she is invisible until the very moment she attacks you. Until that point, you only see a silhouette wandering around, and a shadow on the ground (which is hard to spot on maps such as KF-Farm). The remaining zeds, well, just play the game and see how to deal with them. Over time you will learn to respect the Fleshpound. A good tactic to defeat this one is to shoot at him over distance and set him on fire, and then within 10 seconds break line of sight with him. Repeat until he is dead. This will prevent him from charging at you and eventually turning you into lasagna. Oh, and don't even try to Melee the Patriarch.\n\n[code]10/10[/code]\n\n[h1]The Maps[/h1]\nThe Vanilla maps are just great. Whether you want to fight out in the open (KF-Farm, KF-Departed and so on) or underground (KF-BioHazard, KF-Aperture) or mixed (KF-Offices). You will find a map you like, and for the unlikely case you don't, there is still the option to download maps from the (sometimes rather buggy) workshop.\n\n[code]9/10[/code]\n\n[h1]The Guns[/h1]\nThe guns are good. There is a whole variety of guns available, some are perfect to take out certain types of specimen, while others are just boom and everything is dead that was in its way (talking the L.A.W, the M32 Grenade Launcher, the AA-12, The \"Boomstick\" (double barrel shotgun), and so on). Only thing I dislike is that you need an external mutator to prevent DLC guns you didn't buy from displaying in the trader, which is actually really annoying.\n\n[code]8/10[/code]\n\n[h1]Others[/h1]\nThe Perk System is just great. Although it could be balanced more. Main problem about the perks is that they just randomly stop working from time to time (for me, they almost permanently don't work). So, the system is great, but they should fix it. (yes I know they are working on KF-2, but still, they cant just leave a main feature of their game unplayable for some users).\n[code]3/5[/code]\nThe Gore is also great. Ever wanted some really good blood splattering? This is the game you need! Shoot off a Zombies heat. Shoot the corpse into pieces. Watch the blood flood out of the neck when you shot off the head. See the blood that splattered all over the walls and floor behind the Zeds you just killed. It is just... awesome. Mindlessly awesome.\n[code]5/5[/code]\nThe HUD is easy to overview and works well, it doesn't have way too much detail, and also isn't held too simple.\n[code]5/5[/code]\n\n50/55, that is a really good rating. Definitely recommended. I also prefer this over KF-2, due to the annoying Sound bugs with KF-2 and the detail level that is simply too high and therefore makes the game lag. Also the guns in KF-2 are not as good as the KF-1 guns; they look weird, the welder and syringe look like toys, and they just don't work as well as the guns in KF-1. It takes less than one game in KF-1 to get used to a gun. Well, in KF-2 it takes way longer due to guns partially being completely inefficient against Zeds such as the (oversized) Fleshpound, and the ridiculously fat Bloat.\n\n[code]50/55 Points.
