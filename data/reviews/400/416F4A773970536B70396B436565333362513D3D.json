However, I could not have been more wrong, this game is the pinnacle of puzzle games, in fact it's with the greats of story games too. This isn't a game that's meant to blindly test your creativity or intelligence without meaning or fun, it's a game made to make you think and laugh, with a story that grinds the cogs in your mind. \n\nIf i was to input into this game and the devlopment, theres nothing i would of changed, the game itself is well, perfect. As gamers you can all agree no game deserves the title of perfect and sure for some this won't be, but if any game deserves it, it's this. It has substance, the story is meaningful and something to follow. It has humour, and not many games do anymore, and portal humour will always be the benchmark for any game of this type. \n\nMy friend said what made him buy the series is a review, Portal 1 was described as a \"box of 6 lovely cherries\" and Portal 2 was described as \"12 lovely cherries with sawdust on\". Portal 1 is a great game and will forever be the opening to a great series of possible books, movies and further games but it's very short. Portal 2, is just as lovely all you have to do is clean them, but theres more of them. For me? Portal 2 is my favourite and will always be one of my favourite games.

В самом прямом смысле этого слова. Я всегда играю на лёгком уровне сложности [spoiler] (за исключением Tomb Raider: Legend (в детстве проходила на всех уровнях сложности по нескольку раз), ну и 1-2 других игр) [/spoiler] , т.к. смотрю на игры как на вид отдыха, где не нужно до миллиметра оттачивать свои действия и сильно шевелить мозгами. По этой причине я избегала большую часть квестов и все головоломки. \nПро Portal слышала много хорошего, какая это шикарная игра, но всё равно я обходила её стороной, считая, что это не моё и удалю игру сразу после первой непройденной комнаты. Помнится, даже скачивала демо-версию, но тогда игра меня не впечатлила и я окончательно уверилась, что не стоит тратить на неё время, вместе с тем, я относилась к Portal с уважением. Не знаю, что побудило меня купить аж обе части. Вру, конечно знаю - скидка и мысль \"Ну надо же когда-нибудь в это поиграть, это же своего рода классика!\" \nИграть я начала без особого энтузиазма, поэтому решила попробовать отыгрыш Челл, может поинтереснее проходить станет. Вскоре я была приятно удивлена, представленные головоломки оказались совсем не трудными, для решения не нужно использовать мозг на всю катушку, чего я как раз таки и боялась, всё логично и ясно, процесс решения не требует больших умственных усилий и действительно приносит удовольствие. Уже тогда я поняла ошибочность своего первого мнения об игре. Забавляла и казалась странной GLaDOS. Комнаты проходились быстро и непринужденно, [spoiler] до некоторого момента, дальше начались подозрения. На последней комнате даже расстроилась, что игра такая короткая, но, думая как Челл: \"Ура, последнее испытание и я свободна!\" Так вот, предвкушая финал, я направлялась к выходу и... Шок. И понимание, что игра чеpтовски крута. [/spoiler] Дальнейшее прохождение наконец-то наполняется динамикой, я сто раз пожалела, что не прошла эту игру раньше. К финалу я подошла с широко открытыми от удивления глазами и внутренним состоянием \"УХ ТЫ!\" Собственно финал - обалденный. [spoiler] Песня - сначала рассмешила, потом безумно понравилась. И опять же, под конец песни - очередной шок. Само собой, подразумевает продолжение. [/spoiler]\nЭмоции от игры сразу после прохождения - сильное удивление и восхищение. Игра великолепна. Продолжительность, лично на мой взгляд, идеальна, ровно столько, сколько нужно, игра, конечно, не длинная, но и короткой я её не назову. Смело могу сказать, что это первая головоломка, которая мне полностью понравилась и которую я собираюсь проходить не единожды (в т.ч. из-за ачивок, да).
