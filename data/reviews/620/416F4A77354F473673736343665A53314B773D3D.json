Being the sequel to the GOTY Portal, I was expecting it to not be as good. But, upon starting and playing the game, I realized I was immensly wrong. The setting is immersive the moment you see it, and it still has the fun, portal-based puzzle style to it. With the addition of many more mechanics (gels, lightbridges, etc.) this game provides many hours of fun and thinking. The ever present GLaDOS is much more cold-hearted, but with the addition of Wheatly, Portal 2 still has the wit and charm of the first game. If you have played the first game, this is a MUST-HAVE. If you are new to the series, get it, and see how you like it. Adding together the awesome story, and a multiplayer option that makes both you and a friend of your choice either succeed or argue together, this game definitley worth more than the $20 it is being sold for. 10/10.","timestamp_created":1406507394,"timestamp_updated":1419962229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613223135471343994","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11442232","author":{"steamid":"76561198024057113","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":866,"last_played":1419253940},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo estraordinário!!!

Car le scénario était génial et cool, les graphique était magnifique et les personnages avec leurs voix étaient drôles ! [spoiler] Sinon, un moment du jeu, bah j'étais au chap 5 et j'ai réussi à appuis sur le bouton (c'est vraiment le jeu !) et après je me suis dit Fini . Déjà ? Et bah Nan les développeurs ont fait un coup de théâtre ! Et c'était ça pourquoi il était génial ! Dans les autres s'est juste quelques niveaux à la fin voilà tout le monde et content et bah là c'est différant car ils te font quelques chapitres et au cinquième bah ce n'est pas fini [/spoiler] mais bon je ne vais pas vos spoilers la suite non plus !

Je suis un monstre\" car un des robots (dont c'est mon chouchou) quand je l'ai bousculé, il a dit au début \"Ohhhh (avec un ton triste)\" et après avoir rangé son attaque bah il fit \"mais pourquoi ?\" et même que j'ai failli pleurer :'( ! Mais voilà après le jeu en coop (je n'ai pas tout terminé), il est très drôle et amusant avec un copain ! Car on pouvait réfléchir à deux et donner des indications (car si l'un d'eux n'a pas de micro ou qu'il a un Français et l'autre Anglais, c'est génial pour travail à deux avec des inconnus) mais sinon on ne rigole bien aussi qu'on peut faire la danse, rire, taper dans ses mains avec son copain... C'est génial !

Portal only had one problem. It was short, like really short 45-60 minutes short. But this is a review for Portal 2 not Portal. This game looks better, plays better, and sounds better than Portal 1. It's funnier, It's longer,(took me 15-20 Hours), and it's written better. Every single thing that could have been improved from the first one was times 10. I won't ruin anything in the story but it's awesome and full of references and easter eggs. Portal 2 is DEFINITELY the best game Valve has ever made, but it's even more than that. Portal 2 is THE BEST game I have ever played. Not Half-Life, Not GTA, Not The Last of Us. Portal 2 is and most likely will always be my personal favorite game of all time.

This is, in a nutshell, Portal 2.\n\nReleased 4 years after its predecessor Portal 2 offers the following new features:\n\n--- While the core mechanics return some new elements are present and needed for puzzle solving. My favourite was the gel machine. These machines release gel and the gel-filled surfaces can be used to accelerate the protagonist in order to reach a much higher ground. Also, surfaces can be made available for the use of portals with the gel.\n\n--- Again, we have an extremely funny, relatively long and story-based single-player campaign. We have new voice actors (such as Stephen Merchant who usually works with Ricky Gervais - those of you familiar with Gervais's comedies will probably grow to like Stephen immediately) and the usual dark sense of humour is present throughout the single-player adventure.\n\n--- Co-op campaign is now available and demands that the two of you closely work together. Some of the stages can be tough (in both campaigns) but they are still heaps of fun.\n\n--- Graphics have also been improved. As we are in the same facility but after the events of the first episode, many of the chambers have walls that show aging and / or deterioration. This immediately allows players to immerse themselves in the story and realise that many years have been passed since the previous adventure.\n\nThe game has numerous mods available and just recently a paint gun mode has been released. As the gel-mechanics was based on a game called Tag: The Power of Paint, it was only natural to see the gun incorporated into the world of Portal. In fact, the creators of that game were hired by Valve and worked on Portal 2.\n\nPortal 2 is an excellent sequel and is worth every penny spent on it! This is a highly recommended game along with its predecessor.","timestamp_created":1406230739,"timestamp_updated":1406230739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.678835749626159668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11393785","author":{"steamid":"76561198106609875","num_games_owned":629,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2794,"last_played":1618717803},"language":"english","review":"The Best thing you can have till Gabe can count to 3.","timestamp_created":1406229051,"timestamp_updated":1406229051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11392979","author":{"steamid":"76561198059353114","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2903,"last_played":1642049087},"language":"english","review":"wheatley broke bad","timestamp_created":1406225432,"timestamp_updated":1406225432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11392955","author":{"steamid":"76561198113635483","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":979,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":891,"last_played":1426258096},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un juego muy original donde ya no vale el disparar a lo loco, hay que usar el coco para ir pasando las diferentes dificultades que se nos ofrece, con unos personajes con personalidad con inteligencia artificial en un mundo en el que las maquinas nos dominan.

Indeed, the game's presentation is of the highest caliber, with excellent voice-overs, a deeper than it looks plot, a surprising attention to detail and a few interesting twists. But games are about more than presentation and the first Portal treated us to new and interesting game-mechanics that created a different experience. \n\nUnfortunately, this game is not the groundbreaking game its predecessor was. It attempts to be entertaining simply by reusing and slightly expanding the mechanics of the first game. A legitimate strategy I suppose, that would have worked perfectly well, if not for a \"small\" problem: the narrative of this game is much longer. Unfortunately, the various small additions are not enough to keep things interesting. Even worse, some of these additions, ie the new environments, do not integrate as seamlessly with the mechanics of the game and that may lead to some frustration. \n\nThat said, this is still a decent game and I recommend it. For the most part, it manages to succeed in offering an above-average gaming experience. Just take it in strides and don't expect another revolution, or you might be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1406172274,"timestamp_updated":1406177364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571768403053283691","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11384652","author":{"steamid":"76561198145645677","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":645,"last_played":1440126596},"language":"english","review":"I prefer Portal to Portal 2.

Sure, GLaDOS was a great villan, but thats about all she was. But in Portal 2, you get everything a great game of this genre should have: funny characters with great dialouge, challenging puzzles (not too challenging though), a decent physics engine, and an interesting story.  it was incredibly fun to watch all the characters morph into someone (or something) that you never would have geussed that they would turn into when you first started playing. Also, for a 3-4 year old game, the graphics are beautiful.  I havn't run into any major glitches either.  I havn't played any of the co-op campaign because I have no friends, so I have no opinion on it.  My only complaint would be that I would have liked to have seen a bit more backstory on Cave Johnson, but this is a very, VERY small complaint compared to how amazing this game is in general.\n9/10 would portal again\n","timestamp_created":1406151987,"timestamp_updated":1406151987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11381587","author":{"steamid":"76561198022453945","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":46,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46,"last_played":1337583600},"language":"french","review":"-","timestamp_created":1406149863,"timestamp_updated":1406149863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11381069","author":{"steamid":"76561198063540154","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1678,"last_played":1590705542},"language":"german","review":"Yo Nudles, wenn ihr bock habt auf die geilste Coop-Aktion mit kniffligen Rätseln, krassen Stunts, Dauer-Mindfucks und jede Menge trolling und rumgeschreie, dann holt euch mit einem Freund dieses Spiel.
