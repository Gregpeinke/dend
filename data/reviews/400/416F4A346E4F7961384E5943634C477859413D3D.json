So yesterday I got a £10 steam card and redeemed it, and I got 4 games with the money, including the game I've wanted all week: Portal. Now, I had never played a Portal game before, not even the DEMO, and I'm GLaD I got the game..ha ha, little joke there, so this is my review and my rating, first we'll do the pros, then the cons, then the rating and then the final rating, and I will consider the fact that Portal was made in 2007, so it wouldn't be as good as games today, well, lets start.\n\nPros:\nFun\nPuzzles\nMade by Valve\nCake Core\nGood Story\nNeat Characters\nCompanion Cube\nGood Voice Acting\nFun Gameplay\n\nCons:\nGLaDOS isn't a hard boss\nUnclear ending (As in, why would anyone take you back into Aperchure?\nSome puzzles aren't clear enough\nNot enough chambers.\nThere isn't the turret that says \"I'm different\" from Portal 2\nNo custom chambers. (As in you can't make your own chambers)\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nI love Portal, it's a great game, especially for the time it was made in (2007), and it isn't laggy, its pretty neat, if you haven't played Portal yet I HIGLY recommend it.","timestamp_created":1473008595,"timestamp_updated":1473008595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495347768068313599","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25347161","author":{"steamid":"76561198074355387","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":1255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1034,"last_played":1610590368},"language":"koreana","review":"\"Welcome to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center\"\n\n나의 스팀 계정 존재의 이유이자 원천","timestamp_created":1473000558,"timestamp_updated":1473000558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25346223","author":{"steamid":"76561198007773035","num_games_owned":234,"num_reviews":98,"playtime_forever":2123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2123,"last_played":1558800267},"language":"english","review":"Well, there's not that much to say about this game. it's just a great puzzle game and if u have not played this game, just remember: it's never too late to play one of greatest game back from 2007.","timestamp_created":1472997233,"timestamp_updated":1472997233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25340865","author":{"steamid":"76561198128856262","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":601,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":287,"last_played":1630123140},"language":"english","review":"Portal a game where you solve puzzles that are harder then the rubics club.\n\nThe game has female main character so (you can't say this game is sexist or so dog pee).\n\nYou have a portal gun which makes portals because the name is clearly not a good clue a better name would be (double chair gun).
