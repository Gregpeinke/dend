It adds so much to what made the first game a cult hit whilst still keeping the original feel of the first, which is very rare to see in sequels (well... not valves XD). It has great characters, acting and storyline that will keep you captivated till the very last test chamber. The ending will have you in awe and in stitches at the same time. The story itself was way unexpected to the scale it was especially since the first had very minor story but this one is jampacked with backstory meaty goodness, which is what I like a lot... if you do too... then Portal 2 is for you!","timestamp_created":1303223831,"timestamp_updated":1430176895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"402977","author":{"steamid":"76561197970383765","num_games_owned":289,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":247,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Awsomesauce!","timestamp_created":1303223514,"timestamp_updated":1303223514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1344437","author":{"steamid":"76561197991791803","num_games_owned":479,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1234,"last_played":1414449984},"language":"english","review":"One of Valve's best.

Great sequel, it's been a long time since a game's nemesis has caused me to fear for what's to come like GlaDOS does in Portal 2.  The plot and ending of the first game allow for a very real and large amount of tension and animosity at the beginning of this one that would otherwise be impossible, but the subtlety of the introduction allows you think for a short time that maybe things are going to be OK.  \n\nFive minutes in I was totally hooked, and I haven't even touched the co-op aspect yet.  Not necessary to play the first one first, but I would highly recommend it as it will set the mood in ways a synopsis or overview cannot.  Also as one of the key drawbacks of the original was the brevity of its single player campaign, it can be completed quicker than you would think, and that drawback is now a plus. \n\nI haven't finished the game, but I have no doubt this is the sequel fans of the original were hoping for, and that it will only get better as I go deeper into the story.","timestamp_created":1303192373,"timestamp_updated":1303192373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"268001","author":{"steamid":"76561197967159948","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1781,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":778,"last_played":1607315121},"language":"english","review":"So far, so good.

It's a worthy sequel to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/400]the original Portal[/url], which was a short but sweet puzzler with a simple yet innovative central mechanic. This time around it's less of a horror-mystery and more of an action-comedy. There's new mechanics, more puzzles, more areas of Aperture to explore and even more AIs to supply witty (or not-so-witty in the case of the chief new character) banter. That, and a doozy of an ending. It's absolutely worth playing, but I would recommend playing the first Portal beforehand if possible.\n\nA separate co-op campaign - best played with friends, since that's what it was meant for and you won't find strangers looking for a partner anymore - as well as a level maker with Workshop upload capability add to the game's replayability. It's interesting to note that there is a menu option for multiplayer item trading that was ultimately never implemented, which kind of tells you about where Valve would go as a developer. There is also a good 'making-of' [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/104600]Portal 2 e-book[/url] for sale in the Steam store that I'd recommend as well if you're interested about the game's history.","timestamp_created":1302731927,"timestamp_updated":1645700511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530588686466217041","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2211301","author":{"steamid":"76561198004091644","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":6092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5603,"last_played":1420434150},"language":"english","review":"KEEP CALM IT'S GONNA BE TOTALLY AWESOME","timestamp_created":1302725478,"timestamp_updated":1302725478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw56ifqK8Cdd63CA=="}
