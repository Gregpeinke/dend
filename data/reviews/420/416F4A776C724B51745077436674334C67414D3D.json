Half-Life 2: Episode Two скрывает в себе сразу 3 безумно сложные ачивки:\n1) Маленький космонавт - пронести через всю игру гнома и посадить его в ракету\n2) Выкопать личинок - уничтожить 333 личинки\n3) Страж порядка - не дать страйдерам уничтожить постройки в роще.\n\nЯ прошёл игру на 100% достижений с первого прохождения и это было невозможно. Никогда в других играх я не сталкивался с настолько трудным достижением, как \"Маленький космонавт\", посмотрев на эту ачивку становится ясно, почему игроки так сильно любят серию Half-Life. Начиная с оригинальной игры и заканчивая ep 2 количество безумных достижение увеличивается в геометрической прогрессии. В оригинале самой сложной ачивкой была \"Следопыт\", где нужно было найти 45 тайников разбросанных по всей игре, в ep 1 - \"Одна пуля\", пройти игру с единым выстрелом и в ep 2 - \"Маленький космонавт\". Valve словно глумится над игроками говоря \"А пусть пройдёт игру без огнестрельного оружия! Нет-нет! Пусть тащит через всю игру гнома!\" \n\nПройдя Half-Life 2: Episode Two на 100% я чувствую удовлетворяющее блаженство.

Questo è il dilemma che accompagna da molti anni tutti i fan della saga e gli appassionati di videogiochi. Nell'attesa ho voluto rigiocare i capitoli precedenti e quindi anche Episode Two. Una meravigliosa espansione, che introduce un paio di nuovi nemici e va a limare il comparto tecnico e l'IA. Ma quello che rende questa espansione degna di nota, è lo sviluppo della trama e le situazioni che ci troveremo ad affrontare strada facendo. Il mondo di gioco, alcune battaglie memorabili e diversi colpi di scena, sono sempre perfettamente cadenzati. In Episode Two infatti si raggiungono picchi di spettacolarità a più riprese e l'azione è sempre al massimo. Resta solo l'amaro in bocca per un finale assolutamente aperto e che, speriamo presto, possa avere seguito con un nuovo capitolo canonico della serie.","timestamp_created":1634486353,"timestamp_updated":1634486439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101199589","author":{"steamid":"76561199046715402","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1634478416},"language":"english","review":"pretty

I love the stylistic change from fun, but repeatable old town and gloomy canals of HL2:E1 to forests and roads, spaces with a lot of free air to breath yet saturated with dangerous enemies. Episode 2 in some way is very similar to the original HL2, but it brings so many new things to the table and they ultimately make it look like a stand alone, full-flegged Half Life title. The story is as always on point and it's such a shame that Valve decided not to continue the creation of Episode 3. With that being said, this game is basically what people love in HL2 and it's definetely worth playing til this day, despite of never coming solution. 𝟵/𝟭𝟬","timestamp_created":1634238695,"timestamp_updated":1634238695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101043425","author":{"steamid":"76561197991295470","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1000,"last_played":1636911922},"language":"english","review":"You shoot stuff.","timestamp_created":1634226806,"timestamp_updated":1634226806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101036637","author":{"steamid":"76561198990860074","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1634216385},"language":"english","review":"Noticably better than episode one","timestamp_created":1634216463,"timestamp_updated":1634216463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101029155","author":{"steamid":"76561198377514953","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":540,"last_played":1634031497},"language":"turkish","review":"mükemmel","timestamp_created":1634200439,"timestamp_updated":1634200439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101024767","author":{"steamid":"76561199037670413","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":717,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":601,"last_played":1646653491},"language":"english","review":"GOOOD","timestamp_created":1634188305,"timestamp_updated":1634188305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101022495","author":{"steamid":"76561199006646011","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":318,"last_played":1634181310},"language":"english","review":"):","timestamp_created":1634182675,"timestamp_updated":1634182675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"101008953","author":{"steamid":"76561198382821353","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":397,"last_played":1634156529},"language":"brazilian","review":"RECOMENDO JOGAR MAS QUERO O EP 3 PRA ONTEM PRECISO DE RESPOSTAR PRA OQ ACONTECEU","timestamp_created":1634156667,"timestamp_updated":1634156667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100989199","author":{"steamid":"76561198885098151","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1644078136},"language":"russian","review":"гейб","timestamp_created":1634132723,"timestamp_updated":1634132723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100975376","author":{"steamid":"76561198072542853","num_games_owned":269,"num_reviews":162,"playtime_forever":989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":989,"last_played":1634105623},"language":"english","review":"Although this game can be played on its own, the story continues after half life 2 DLC 1.
