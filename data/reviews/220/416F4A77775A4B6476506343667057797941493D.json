Anyone going to read this 17 years after the game's release?  Oh well, I'll say some things anyway.  It's worth a playthrough if you like Sci-Fi singleplayer FPS games, just don't expect too much, and don't look for an engaging story or challenge.\n\nIt was influential historically for its lack of cut scenes and its physics engine.  The physics engine is definitely the central novelty here, to the point that the game will either highly incentivize or completely restrict you to the use of a specific weapon at times in the game.\n\nUnfortunately I never felt immersed by the areas in Half-Life 2.  I played Black Mesa (remake of Half-Life 1) and I really felt a sense of place during it.  HL2 felt like I was merely moving down a long path that was mostly straight ahead.  Somehow Black Mesa felt like it had more verticality in its levels, there felt like a better variety to the feels of each area.  The vehicle sections in HL2 no doubt contributed to this corridor feel, although they were a bit fun if you don't get too frustrated with the controls.\n\nThe combat was okay.  I mostly felt like enemies were thrown into an area in small groups to have something to shoot once in awhile, but rarely felt like they were organic to the situation I was in.  The story is okay, nothing too mind-provoking or engaging.\n\nLast but not least I'm sure there are people who, since 2004, are still trying to get their AI companions to GET...OUT...OF...THE...WAY!","timestamp_created":1612760226,"timestamp_updated":1612811933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86183102","author":{"steamid":"76561199044753809","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":872,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":725,"last_played":1626252721},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень затягивает.","timestamp_created":1612760085,"timestamp_updated":1612760085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86182680","author":{"steamid":"76561198872129202","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1618818190},"language":"russian","review":"Ну это просто.\nПрикольно, страшно, весело и ламар","timestamp_created":1612759442,"timestamp_updated":1612759442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86179810","author":{"steamid":"76561198336611464","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":3517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3123,"last_played":1646162491},"language":"english","review":"This is if not my all-time favorite FPS game ever.
