Everyone at Black Mesa is an ass to you until something needs to be fixed. Or shot. And even then, most of the people are still asses.\n This expansion introduces several new character models, and continues increasing the difficulty slider even over Opposing Force. Also, this expansion features an easter egg from the PlayStation 2 release of Half Life called Decay, where you get to see some of the aftermath of the coop scientists actions.\nFor the majority of the game, you will be assisting Dr. Rosenberg with activating a teleportation system in the old run down area of Black Mesa. You will go to Xen and back. But this time around, the Xen sections aren't tedious.\nThe ending to this mod comes very fast, as it only took me 3 hours to complete, but this expansion is not filled with hours of tedious corridor crawling. You shoot bad humans and aliens quite a bit in the short campaign, but there are also some great puzzles followed with tense combat.\n\nControls, graphics, sound, and overall style of action doesn't differ from Opposing Force or Half Life. So all of the pros and cons from those 2 games carry over here.\n\nIf you want to see a young Dr. Rosenberg with his MANLY MAN voice, play this.\n\n8/10 because MEN MEN MEN MEN MANLY MEN do science things.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3KuS4uYTAUumUeb4Ksu6Yog6bwJQZhoh","timestamp_created":1571029051,"timestamp_updated":1571029567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55593546","author":{"steamid":"76561198371451810","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":35,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1571265928},"language":"english","review":"It's a piece of crap.

Really, nothing is added to the gameplay in the three years between the original game's release ([b]1998[/b]) and this mediocre journey through the day of Barney during the Black Mesa incident ([b]2001[/b]). The shooting is the same, the enemies are pretty much the same, but the story is lesser than the original due to lacking the same impact.
