On Steam. Which nobody will read. Fun!\n\nI've played the first few hours of the original Bioshock, and none of the second, so I'm no exactly a Bioshock buff (if I was, I would probably have bought the game an year ago). The original Bioshock is praised for being highly atmospheric, for having an awesome story and setting. The same applies to Bioshock: Infinite. Great and interesting setting, great and interesting story, and Elizabeth (your AI companion for the majority of the game) is incredible. Awesome character and companion, and the scripted banter between her and your character, Booker, is amazing. For this alone the game is worth buying.\n\nBioshock Infinite have two major flaws however.\n\n[b]1) Gunplay:[/b] This was the main issue in the original Bioshock for me, and it's the main issue in Bioshock: Infinite. It's not as bad as in Bioshock, but in an otherwise amazing game with a masterpiece world, the combat is JUST acceptable. Serviceable, is a good word for it. It only JUST does its job, and nothing more. That's an issue when that's what you're going to actually DO for 50% of the game, and the other half is spend exploring, looking for stuff (and lore) to help you when you go shooty shooty bang bang. Besides being generally clunky and very chaotic in a bad way, the combat has several small issues in it, but I won't go too much into detail about that here.\n\n[b]2)The Narrative vs the Gameplay:[/b] To say it bluntly, Bioshock: Infinite's gameplay doesn't make a lot of sense when you think about the narrative it's telling you. What you're told and what you do simply doesn't click together. This is because they've put the same gameplay from Rapture into Columbia. Rapture is a city in ruins, where killing and scavenging makes perfect sense, and the plasmids are a part of the narrative and world.\n\nIn Columbia however, this is not the case. This is a fully functioning city, where you going on a rampage through the city and scavenging in people's homes and digging hotdogs up from the trash to eat for minimal health gain makes little sense. Rapture was in a Civil War, while Columbia seems to have ammo-automats everywhere in the city for little reason. Vigors (Infinite's plasmids) also makes no sense in Columbia. You're given your first vigor at a market for free, and find them all around the city, yet besides for one boss and two types of enemies, vigors are not used at all by the citizens of Columbia. Why wouldn't the police have the same vigors as you? Why does nobody make YOU levitate? In fact, a lot of people even question if Bioshock: Infinite really needed to be a shooter at all. \n\nWith all that said though: while Bioshock: Infinite is let down by its gunplay and gameplay that have no business being in Columbia, Columbia is a fantastic place, and the story really is something special. An amazing experience, which makes this a great game.  \n\n","timestamp_created":1403809412,"timestamp_updated":1403809412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10843132","author":{"steamid":"76561198095191080","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":787,"last_played":1424052619},"language":"english","review":"Gud story\nGud gameplay\nGud characters\nGud atmosphere\nGud setting\nGud","timestamp_created":1403809075,"timestamp_updated":1403809075,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10842457","author":{"steamid":"76561198070917861","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":389,"last_played":1557698950},"language":"english","review":"ate rotten popcorn out of a trashcan. 10/10","timestamp_created":1403808050,"timestamp_updated":1403808050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10842069","author":{"steamid":"76561198016698600","num_games_owned":289,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1056,"last_played":1541087561},"language":"english","review":"There are actually no words to describe how incredible this game is.

Es werden immer nur kurze \"etappenziele\" gesetzt und erst am Ende macht alles überhaupt keinen Sinn mehr. Das heißt einiges schon aber es kommen einfach viele viiieeele Fragen auf die vorher gar nicht im Raum standen. Daher eine sehr, wirklich sehr gelungene Story, an der maximal an ein zwei Stellen über unstimmigkeiten gemeckert werden könnte. \n\nDas Gameplay weißt größere Unterschiede zum Vorgänger auf als gedacht. Plasmide wurden durch allerhand neue \"Kräfte\" ersetzt die teils ziemlich cool, lustig oder auch einfach verdammt sadistisch sind.\nDas Kampfsystem mit Waffen hat sich meiner Meinung nach sehr zum guten verbessert. Schrotflinten machen endlich ordentlich Schaden, anvisieren ist mit jeder Waffe möglich, allerdings kann die Waffe während eines skyline-trips geladen werden ... dritter Arm ?! ^^. \nEs gibt eine große Bandbreite an Waffen leider können neben dem Skyhook immer nur zwei Waffen geführt werden.\nAuch hat sich vieles im Bereich Versorgung geändert. Man bekommt zwar einen Schild dazu, allerdings kann man keinen Vorrat mehr führen. so muss man in fights immer nach medipacks oder \"salzen\" ausschau halten. Elisabeth hilft an dieser stelle und auch beim Munition sammeln zum glück immer fleißig mit.\n\nZum sonstigen Gameplay:\nich vermisse die möglichkeit selber zu hacken oder schlösser zu knacken ein Bisschen. Auch das man Waffen- und Kraftupdates aus einem Topf zahlen muss hat mich persönlich ein Bisschen gestört, weil es ja nicht open World ist und man nur eine Bestimmte Menge Geld finden kann. Somit hat bei mir immer etwas Armut geherrscht wenn es um Upgrades ging.\nAllerdings holt die Atmosphere und eigentlich das Gesamtpaket, Grafik, Animationen, Sound und Effekte eine ganze Menge heraus. Es hat mir wirklich eine Menge Spaß gemacht, durch die Gegend zu hopsen und zu linen, die Aussicht zu genießen und gegnern grobmotorisch den Kopf vom Rumpf zu trennen :D\nAlles in allem eine definitive Kaufempfehlung und wenn man schräge Endings mag ists definitiv ein muss.

The gameplay is superior over the other episodes and much better balanced. The story is nearly as good as the first one. It cares for the female player, got lotsa eye-candy and has the highest grade of replayability compared to the other parts. In my opinion, balancing story and gameplay, the best of all 3 [i]Bioshock[/i] games. If you liked the others, you will also like this one. At best, you played just BS1 and not the 2nd part beforehand (unless you wanna play all 3).\n\n[b]story[/b]\nThough BS2 had not a bad story, the [i]Would you kindly?[/i] moment was missing. Now, you got a repackaged BS2 story which takes care of that. It is somewhat unrelated to the other episodes and you could use it as a starter to the [i]Bioshock[/i] world, though due to graphics and gameplay, I advise against it.\nIt definitely tries to get the girls to the consoles as in a slightly female colour scheme, a female hero w/o mega t[noparse]it[/noparse]s nor skin tight leather... and to top that up, even a change of hair dressing is included! ;P \nThat said, there is enough blood, dirt and gore and [i]Bioshock[/i] manages once more to combine high morals with bloodiest violence and beautiful sceneries.\nA lot has been recycled from BS2, though: It feels a bit like the [i]Syren Alley[/i] level and its objective being a whole game combined with the [i]Eleanor[/i] meta story. In [i]Ryan's Amusements[/i] you had to get a Plasmid inside a propaganda amusement park for kids in order to continue a journey on a train. In [i]Soldier's Field[/i] the difference is only that Plasmids are called [i]Vigors[/i] and that you continue your journey in a Gondola. Besides an obstacle blocks your carriage and you have to get the Plasmid/Vigor inside a children's propaganda theme park. [i]Fink[/i] and his stage reminded me a bit of [i]The Great Alexander[/i] - There are many moments which feel like BS2.\n\n[b]gameplay[/b]\nUsed to be the biggest pain in the a[noparse]rs[/noparse]e on its predecessors, but the [i]Bioshock[/i] team seems to learn by trial and error. Each part gets better gameplay-wise and now, the mindless spawning and many shortcomings of BS1 and BS2 are gone.\nThe gameplay is much better balanced due to:\n\n* \"Killer\"-Plasmids are mostly gone in the main game (like [i]Winter Blast[/i] for example).\n* Plasmids are generally better balanced and thus less powerful than before.\n* [i]Adam[/i] is gone as character building source it is now \"all about money\". Since corpses contain money, the infinite spawning of enemies is gone in BS Infinite.\n* the marvellous [i]Green Arrow[/i] which gives you directions on demand!  No more \"Should I turn the quest arrow on or off?\" A+++\n* The research system is gone and nobody will miss it!\n* Sadly, the mini-games are gone, too. Elizabeth lockpicks the doors, safes and chests for you now.\n* Enemies and gear are revamped but the same: [i]Houdinis[/i], now called [i]Zealots[/i], are fewer but tougher. [i]Handymen[/i] are basically extra fiery [i]Brute Splicers[/i] and the [i]Rumbler[/i] returns in a downgraded version as [i]Beasts[/i]; there is even a [i] Mark Meltzer[/i] moment. [i]Insect Swarm[/i] is also far less powerful now and replaced by [i]Murder of Crows[/i] - which is a good thing, since [i]Insect Swarm[/i] and [i]Winter Blast[/i] was all you needed, even on the most difficult settings.\n* generally, the gameplay is more stream-lined, though there are more collectibles.\n* Negative: More [i]CoD[/i]-like in the sense of a less tactical approach and the shortage of resources.\n* Many tutorial elements in the game are too short or simply missing. [i]Vigor Combos[/i] for example, though there would have been enough chance for it on some fair stand. \n* The skyline could be better integrated into the gameplay, but as mentioned below, it seems to be technically the most critical part.\n\n[b]graphics, bugs & Co[/b]\nRan it on Win7 64bit with a Geforce GTX760 on highest settings w/o problems. Only major bugs I encountered was on the skyline, there I got stuck under certain circumstances. Also, the only minor bug I am aware of is as well connected to the skyline. It let's [i]Liz[/i] circle the skyline for hours, once I am already off - but it doesn't hinder progress and at some stage she is back.\nUnfair to compare graphics, since I played both old parts on XP, but lotsa eye-candy indeed. And as I found just far more \"picturesque\". \n\n[b]Burial at Sea[/b]\nHaven't played it as of yet....\n\n[b]Btw: Si tacuisses... ![/b]\nHm, a game that costs soo much money to produce and is so in love with detail, ridicules itself by misuse of professionell knowledge?\nThe first steps into [i]Columbia[/i] makes you believe you entered an alternate world of idiots: \n* [i]Gladium[/i] is like [i]clavem[/i] an [i]Accusative[/i] version of the words [i][b]gladius[/b],-i[/i] and [i][b]clavis[/b],-e[/i].\n* 2 [i]Lockpicks[/i] will never open a lock, but inserting a [i][b]tension wrench[/i] and a [i]lockpick[/i][/b] will. Besides but important: [b]Locks don't get damaged[/b] by picking (but picking can be detected forensicly).","timestamp_created":1403798682,"timestamp_updated":1404522548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60593181848526001","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10837310","author":{"steamid":"76561197995519573","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1159,"last_played":1409792909},"language":"english","review":"I felt like I was watching a movie as much as I was playing a video game.","timestamp_created":1403798667,"timestamp_updated":1403798667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10837212","author":{"steamid":"76561197972965708","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1401687747},"language":"tchinese","review":"故事內容敘述得很有趣，又有繁體中文，推薦","timestamp_created":1403798460,"timestamp_updated":1403798460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10837200","author":{"steamid":"76561197969464294","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":566,"last_played":1403797791},"language":"english","review":"Great game, good gunplay, excellent graphics, intriguing story although not convinced about the ending.","timestamp_created":1403798433,"timestamp_updated":1403798449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10836926","author":{"steamid":"76561198066438765","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":689,"last_played":1388583583},"language":"german","review":"Macht Spass","timestamp_created":1403797838,"timestamp_updated":1403797838,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10836794","author":{"steamid":"76561198101536628","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":706,"last_played":1446733776},"language":"russian","review":"Замечательная игра!

Но, когда ты начинает проходить Burial at sea, ты окончательно понимаешь, что Элизабет главные герой, а не Букер. \nЯ считаю, что концовка в Burial at sea лучше всего заканчивает игру. \nКак у меня появится большой телек, пройду этот шедевр еще раз\n10/10","timestamp_created":1403795298,"timestamp_updated":1403795331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10835338","author":{"steamid":"76561197987178865","num_games_owned":222,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1128,"last_played":1503277479},"language":"russian","review":"Прекраснейшая игра с прекраснейшим сюжетом с прекраснейшей Элизабет","timestamp_created":1403794513,"timestamp_updated":1403794513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10835151","author":{"steamid":"76561198005910387","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":600,"last_played":1388958259},"language":"german","review":"Mindgames <3","timestamp_created":1403794078,"timestamp_updated":1403794078,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10835114","author":{"steamid":"76561198058570241","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":361,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":361,"last_played":1403967244},"language":"english","review":"This incredible story and even better looking!","timestamp_created":1403794013,"timestamp_updated":1403794013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10834946","author":{"steamid":"76561198140621477","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1523684074},"language":"english","review":"What to say about Bioshck Infinte? Okay, well the first thing we see is an abandonded lighthouse and a kinda ominous and obviously shady deal. If this doesn't make it already stand out then i don't know what does. I went into this game thinking \"Oh great another boring shooter with no story\" but oh dear god I was wrong. You play through the game and soon start to reakise that something in Collumbia isn't quite right especially when it comes to the girl you've rescued- Elizabeth. An intense and twisted story that still has me blown away and each time I replay it I see more and more of the dots connect. The Protagonist (you) isn't a completly generic pile of code and actually has an interesting story that starts to take a turn for the worst. The vigors and great vareity of weapons keep the gameplay interesting, not to mention the different enimies that are thrown at you and seem to both challenge you and also set the tone of the city for you. A very dislikable antagonist with one hell of a backstory. The game is beautiful and with it set in 1912 and all it makes it seem like the stunning floating city of Columbia is un-phased by your intense havoc with bright colours that make the game seem comical in a strange way. The colour pallets can change within seconds from browns and golds to blacks and greys all of which perfectly complement the mood. Oh yeah and Elizabeth isn't completley uselss as she scavenges salts, coins and ammo to aid your in your battles or she can just you know tear a whole through space and time to just give you what you need (yep). So incase ypu couldn't tell by this HIGHLY positive review, I fiercly recommend this game; it was my game of the year last year and is perhaps my favourite game of all time-\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1403793641,"timestamp_updated":1403793641,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10834463","author":{"steamid":"76561198081419494","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":925,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":676,"last_played":1431626982},"language":"czech","review":"Predom sa ospravedlňujem nie som žiaden spisovateľ ani moja slovenčina nie je úžasná ale táto hra je natoľko úžasná že som sa rozhodol napísať recenziu.

Es stellen sich viele viele Fragen auf, die man bis zum schluss beantwortet bekommt. Einige Frage bleiben allerdings dennoch unbeantwortet. Diese Fragen lösen bei mir eine starke neugier aus, worauf man das Spiel am liebsten am Stück durchspielen will. In keinem anderem Shooter findet man so eine packende Story. Die Stadt Columbia, in der das alles geschieht, ist sehr faszinierend und wunderschön designed. Man möchte am liebsten die ganze Zeit dort bleiben. Ich war am ende sehr traurig, dass es schon zueende war :( Irgendwie vermisse ich es, ein Big Dady zu sein ;(\n\nAm besten sollte man das Spiel erst Spielen, sobald man die ersten beiden Teile gespielt hat. Es hat zwar keine wirkliche Story, die an Bioshock 2 anknüpft, doch es gab einige Ort an dennen ich mich sehr sentimental zurückerinnert gefühlt habe. (Spoiler)\n[spoiler] Mann ist am ende in Rapture, das vor Bioshock 1 spielt und es ist einfach nur wunderschön geswesen.... Kann sich bestimmt jeder vorstellen, der Bioshock 1&2 gespielt hat. [/spoiler]\n\n\nLeveldesign:\nDas Spiel bietet einem eine menge Freiheiten beim vorgehen, obwohl die die Gebiete doch etwas schlauchig wirklen. Ob man jetzt von der SkyLine einen Angriff von oben starten möchte, die Umgebung so verändert das Gegner sterben oder versucht alles zu kombinieren. \nWer versucht \"Durchzurushen\" wird schnell merken, dass es kein Sinn macht, da die Gegner schon auf dem Schwierigkeitsgrad Mittel jede menge Schaden austeilen können. Da ist man froh wenn mein eine so gut gestaltete Patnerin hat, die einen mit Munition versorgt, wenn es mal knapp mit allem wird. Etwas Geld organisiert, oder einem mit MediPacks bewirft sollte man kurz davor sein ins Gras zu beisen. Die Patnerin wird nie nervig und ich bin echt froh das ich die charmante und schlaue Elizabeth an meiner Seite habe. \nWenn man die Welt gut genug durchsucht findet man sehr viele Bonusräume die einem mit einem haufen Geld, Ausrüstung und einigen Dingen mehr beschenken. Für diese Räume muss man manchmal allerdings manchmal in voherige Levelabschnitte zurück.\n\nGrafik:\nDie Grafik des Spiels, ist wunderbar. Es gibt sehr viele gute Effekte wie Explosionen und co. Auch die guten Details lassen das Spiel sehr gut aussehen. Allerdings fällt manchmal auf, das die Texturen, selbst auf Ultra, nicht sehr Hoch aufgelöst sind.\nEs ist es ein Spiel für die Augen.\n\nMusik/Vertonung:\nDer deutsche Sprecher, der den Hauptcharakter gesprochen hat, hat eine einfach perfekte Stimme. Die klingt irgendwie fast wie aus einem Märchen. Auch die Sprecherin von Elizabeth hat einen super Job gemacht. Generell sind sehr viele gute Sprecher dabei. Die Musik ist sehr stimming und abwechlungsreich und fügt sich sehr gut in das Spiel ein.\n\n\nFazit: Für Personen die einen storybasierten Shooter haben wollen, ist dieses Spiel genau das richtige. \nSofort zugreifen! Auch die Leute die nicht so überzeugt sind, sollten es probieren. Es ist sein Geld in allen belangen wert.\n\nPS: Ich hoffe ich habe nicht vergessen ;)","timestamp_created":1403775893,"timestamp_updated":1403856680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491167813539505005","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10827484","author":{"steamid":"76561198090229301","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":552,"last_played":1466165368},"language":"russian","review":"Замечательная игра, но есть свои минусы.\n Плюсы: \nКрасивая графика на движке Unreal Engine\nЗапутанный сюжет (Как и во всех играх Левина)\nМного крови.

However, you MUST play Bioshock 1 (and preferably Bioshock 2 as well) before playing Burial At Sea 1 & 2 (see the last paragraph for more info about this).\n\nNow, as for Infinite: what a game. The game looks beautiful. When you see the city of Columbia for the first time, it is breathtaking. But the greatest strength of Infinite is its story. I'm a writer (fiction and nonfiction) and I loved the dialogue throughout the game. The voice acting is superb and the recordings (voxophones) that provide background are unique as well. There's a flawed protagonist (but one that's sympathetic at times) and a mission that becomes clearer (and more confusing) as you progress. Not to mention the AI for the other main character that follows you throughout most of the game is excellent. But the increasing depth of character as the game progresses is probably the greatest part of this game.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are great as well. Fighting with guns and vigors (special abilities) simultaneously is satisfying and fun. Flying along rails through the air using skyhooks never gets old. Enemy AI is nothing special but sheer numbers at the end provide a decent challenge. Also, once you beat the game, it unlocks 1999 mode for a real challenge. And don't even think you won't want to play through again. You will just to try and wrap your head around everything that happens.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that there's a tedious portion of the game between the middle and the end. It's a checklist of things you have to do and the respawning of enemies means fighting in locations more than once. By this point in the game, I was so interested in the story that I wanted it to progress faster.\n\nHere's the bottom line: If you don't really care about storylines in games, then you probably won't appreciate this game as much as others. If you love a good story, then you will love this game. The gameplay mechanics are great though. So if you catch it on sale then you should probably get it even if you don't care about the story.\n\nA last word about the Bioshock series. I actually played Infinite before Bioshock 1 or 2. This was a good choice because I'm not really a fan of scary games so I might not have played Bioshock without the need to see the whole story after playing Infinite. But it was also a bad choice because I didn't recognize a lot of stuff at the end of Infinite. Yet, this is easily fixed if you play through Infinite multiple times. But you really MUST play Bioshock 1 (at the very least) before playing Burial At Sea. The 2nd episode of Burial At Sea is fantastic but it will not make any sense whatsoever without the background of Bioshock (and the \"recap\" they provide in Burial At Sea is not an acceptable substitute). Seriously, if you're scared then make a friend play it and you just watch through your fingers. It's worth it.","timestamp_created":1403771658,"timestamp_updated":1403771658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10825830","author":{"steamid":"76561198084012266","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":546,"last_played":1587837193},"language":"english","review":"BEST GAME EVER!!!","timestamp_created":1403771362,"timestamp_updated":1403771362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10825757","author":{"steamid":"76561198094073954","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":357,"last_played":1406201638},"language":"russian","review":"+ Атмосфера...\n+ Сюжет...\n+ Аэротрассы\n\n- Жаль нету мультипэера . \nА так минусов нету )","timestamp_created":1403771080,"timestamp_updated":1403771080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560293138027191162","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10825427","author":{"steamid":"76561198019266453","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1440954417},"language":"russian","review":"Просто шедевр.","timestamp_created":1403770071,"timestamp_updated":1403770071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10825373","author":{"steamid":"76561198057456268","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1588,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1034,"last_played":1449589301},"language":"russian","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1403769892,"timestamp_updated":1403769892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496389895677566528","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwypXN68YCfemlKQ=="}
