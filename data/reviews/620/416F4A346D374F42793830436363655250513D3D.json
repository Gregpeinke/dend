This isnt an open world game, its not supost to be. It is a puzzle FPS, and a great one at that. I must say that by taking away all of the posibilitys of failure in the majority of levels and making only the right way avalible, it is tonnes easier in some areas, but then again there are frustratingly hard areas that at some points made me want to tear my hair out.
