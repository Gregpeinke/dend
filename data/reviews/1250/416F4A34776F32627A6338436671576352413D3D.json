With diverse enemies it requires the player to act differently according to each situation, which adds to the replayablity. Killing Floor also has a lively community of mods and map that will completely give you a new experience of the game. As much as I like the combat it's important to note that weapons don't feel as unique as they should. It ends up as though classes only offer a minor difference in play style. The only drastic class difference is the berserker which focuses on melee weapons and closs combat. \n\nKilling Floor is a game that is best served with company as you do rely on teamwork on the harder difficulties more but however the game still is quite fun alone. \n\nAnother grievance I have is the pointless DlC's, I wish they focused on leveling up to unlock characters or by doing special tasks like what they with SteamPunk Mr. Foster.

With 7 Perk Classes to choose from that can rank @ the highest level of 6; Field Medic, Support Specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, Firebug, & Demolition with their own playstyle of Weapons. There are plenty of Zeds to Kill that Ranges from Clots trying to eat your face, Gorefast(s) with a Machete like arm for slicing you up, Bloats who are Obese spcimens that Bile posion in your eyes that Blinds you & also burns your skin. Stalkers who are mearly invisible creatures that come from any corner, Scrake(s) who are very Tanky with a Chainsaw ready to swing at your every move. Husk(s) who have the perk of setting you & your suroundings on Fire & is almost Immune to Fire itself. Crawler(s) These buggy little guys will jump @ your face and also bite and naw you from the Ankles. These spider like creatures can be a pest & your worst Nightmare!

These guys are Highly Tanky with Drills for hands ready to rush @ you like a Quarter Back and Pound those Drills into your Flesh. There are also different Difficulty settings from Begginer to Hell on Earth also with waves ranging from 4 to 10. Depending on how many players are in a Server & what Difficulty is being played & how many Waves are set the more Zeds will appear and they will become Harder. With all that said. We come to the Boss after the Final Wave is complete. The Patriarch! The Patriarch is the final boss of Killing Floor; appearing in the final wave of each game. He is the most powerful and heavily armed specimen in the game, being equipped with a minigun, rocket launcher, a cloaking system and three single use of healing syringes. He is also the fastest runner in the game, easily outrunning all players and specimens, however he makes use of this after being injured either to run and heal or to retaliate against a specific player. There is also Zed Time in the game which @ random acts as Bullet Time during gameplay. There are also a lot of different Characters to Choose / Play from all distinguished to fit their own personality.

There are mods that give a 'campaign' but bare in mind - these are just waves on a map with progressive sections.\n\n The main game at it's core is basically - kill waves / earn money / buy more guns - Repeat.

Sure, give me blood and guts, but don't give me anything that will haunt my mind and make me sleep with one eye open. And I have to admit, Killing Floor delivered in every aspect I could fathom.\nFirst of all, while advertised as survival horror, whether or not it is actualy survival horror depends on the situation. Playing in easy mode as the Berserker or Support Specialist was just plain fun, whether vaporizing fifteen-strong hordes with a single clip or severing four heads at once with an impressively realistic katana. But the real horror comes into play when you select a difficulty that's far out of your depth. Your money falls short of the weapons you need, ammo seems to vanish with double speed, and you can sink three rounds into an enemy's head before it explodes. As you begin to feel weaker than you expected, you begin to fear the next wave that will only bring more enemies and more death. \nCo-op mode brings in a whole new level of play. You and three of your friends can willingly challenge yourselves with a higher difficulty and begin to rely on coordination and strategy rather than bullets. After all, each bullet only counts for so much when there are six specimens crowding your ally.\nNow that Killing Floor 2 is on the way, well, this review may be a bit late, but for those looking to save a bit of money should without a doubt pick this up at once. And I look forward to the sequel; I will be able to truly appreciate the innovation after playing this obsessively.\n10/10; would be maimed to death again.","timestamp_created":1441652964,"timestamp_updated":1441652964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17930284","author":{"steamid":"76561198080350892","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3742,"last_played":1523666642},"language":"english","review":"great but it wont open due to the update it says disk read error\n","timestamp_created":1441643349,"timestamp_updated":1441643349,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502272129058837891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17929263","author":{"steamid":"76561198085760953","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":4688,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2511,"last_played":1650792685},"language":"russian","review":"Игра охигеная бля","timestamp_created":1441639420,"timestamp_updated":1441639420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17926082","author":{"steamid":"76561198076926164","num_games_owned":196,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":6539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4532,"last_played":1540492538},"language":"english","review":"its greet...","timestamp_created":1441624168,"timestamp_updated":1441624168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17925314","author":{"steamid":"76561198163991380","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3,"playtime_at_review":4409,"last_played":1660536208},"language":"thai","review":"ผมได้ทำการเล่นเกมนี้เป็นเวลา 70กว่า ชม.ขอบอกได้เลยครับว่าเป็นเกมดีมากๆ ถึงภาพจะไม่สวยมากน่ะครับเเต่ความสนุกขอรับรองเลยว่าโคตรมัน\nคะเเนนที่ให้ 9.5/10","timestamp_created":1441619259,"timestamp_updated":1441885139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17924708","author":{"steamid":"76561198012407926","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":6521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6454,"last_played":1405014649},"language":"italian","review":"[i]Killing Floor[/i] offre indubbiamente tutto quello che un appassionato di sparatutto cooperativi possa desiderare… e anche di più.

I thought this game was amazingly fun for quite a while, I even tried to get some of my friends to play it, but the whole game got old pretty fast. As you can see, I have not played played this game for an extremely long time, but in just that time, I could already see quite a few problems with this game. First off is simply the quality, it feels old and pretty janky, granted it is from 2009, but then again Call of Duty World at War came out in 2008, and it's \"Nazi Zombies\" game mode is put together quite a bit better, and it's just a single game mode, whereas this is supposed to be a full game. I understand that Treyarch is a big name company, and possibly an unfair comparison to judge quality by, but if you're going to pay for a game, don't settle for one that provides only a mediocre experience. Secondly, the difficulty curve is insanely high. The easiest difficulty is honestly a joke, even solo, whereas every other difficulty is VASTLY harder. I don't just mean the last difficulties either, every difficulty except the easiest, basically requires a very skilled team to even play, not to mention how impossible it can get for a player that messes up early on. Part of the difficulty curve can probably be attributed to the fact that players are required to grind a huge amount before having any of the classes even be worth playing. My third and final reason is that it has taken the path of so many other games, in that it has become a shameless DLC dump. you literally have to buy nearly everything good in the game with real money, as well as many other useless cosmetic or character packs. Honestly if you want a good zombie survival game, every Call of Duty game that Treyarch has made since World at War is a much better deal than this game, not to mention that their zombie survival mode isn't even the whole game, yet it still does better.","timestamp_created":1441519037,"timestamp_updated":1441519037,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17905476","author":{"steamid":"76561198019359288","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2452,"last_played":1346137200},"language":"english","review":"Despite what the advertisements may say, this series is *not* survival horror.
