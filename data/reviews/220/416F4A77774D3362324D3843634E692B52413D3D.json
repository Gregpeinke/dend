This is actually the first game I owned and played on my steam account, I cannot speak highly enough of the whole Half-Life series.\n\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b] Half-Life 2 starts on a train arriving at City 17, you play as the protagonist “Gordon Freeman”, get used to that name, because everyone knows it and exclaims it when they see you. [i](Well, everyone but the “Combine” police force, when they first see you in the introduction level at City 17.)[/i]\nNot long after getting off the train, you come across old acquaintances Dr. Kleiner and Barney Calhoun, they send Gordon on his way to join up with an underground group known as the \"Lambda Resistance\".\nI won't risk saying and spoiling anything about the rest of story; this is one of the games that I contrast against many other story telling narratives – because it's so well done. Even replaying the game after so many years, Half-Life 2 is still a very enjoyable game and I believe the series will survive the test of time to become a staple in video game history. [i](At LEAST Steam history)[/i]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=519103207\n\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] As you progress through the game you unlock new weapons, and explore new area's, you can switch between your weapons with the scroll wheel or number keys, sometimes you double up on the same weapon categories [i](for example, you might have two pistols, or two rifles so you'll need to scroll through both of those, or hit the key twice to rotate between them)[/i]\nAll of your standard FPS's are in the game, your basic “go to” [i](Bread-and-butter, Rice-and-beans, defaulted-to, basic, etc)[/i] weapons are: The crowbar, pistol, and Submachine Gun.\nThe weapons you unlock are: [spoiler]Crowbar, Gravity Gun, Bugbait, 9mm pistol, .357 Magnum, SMG, AR2 Pulse Rifle, Shotgun, Crossbow, Grenade, and RPG.[/spoiler]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=519103220\n\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b] About half of the achievements in Half-Life 2 are unlocked on your first play through, the other half are Easter eggs, or various objectives challanges.\nThe hardest/longest achievement is Lambda Locator, which requires you to find each Lambda Cache. [i](The Greek letter “L” is known as Lambda “λ”)[/i] As you play through the game you will sometimes come across a “λ” Lambda, that means there's a Lambda Resistance weapons cache nearby.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520091228\n\n[b]Price:[/b] The standalone price for Half-Life 2 is $9.99 you will probably come close to nine hours of gameplay within this game. I've personally replayed the story several times so for me it was a great value.\nHowever, I have a better recommendation; if you are thinking about getting Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, and/or Portal, you should purchase [url=http://store.steampowered.com/sub/469/]The Orange Box[/url] for $19.99, you will get all of the afore mentioned game titles.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] Story: Excellent, a personal all-time favorite of mine. Gameplay: Solid controls, solid physics, solid, solid solid. Even after all these years the game is still very good. Achievements: Fairly doable 100% completed game. Price: Fair, but I suggest getting the Orange Box deal.\nI recommend this game to people who enjoy darker serious stories, FPS's, or don't swear by the latest game releases [i](Translation: you as a gamer are backwards compatible with older games/graphics/engines)[/i].\nThanks for reading my review!

I've had so much fun playing through it. The world is well developed, immersive, and interactable. You can shoot sawblades into wooden objects to keep them there while you perform another task. You can shoot paint cans at objects, and it will turn them white. You can crouch behind a crashed car and push it up towards baddies until you run them over. You can get in a crane and drop shipping containers on people. Most of the challenge comes from just finding your way around. Despite the fact that a simple scientist is capable of killing so many people, the story is unique and captivating. The gameplay is diverse, challenging, and fun. The environment is lovely, which is typical of all the production aspects of this game.

Ricordo però che all'epoca, il primo capitolo mi sembrò altrettanto spettacolare, se non addirittura perfetto. Per non scontentare nessuno li metterei esattamente sullo stesso piano. Due pietre miliari, anelli di congiunzione di un ciclo dei evoluzione degli FPS.\nLa saga incarna la progressiva evoluzione tra gli sparatutto \"old-scool\", in cui il gioco era un susseguirsi di livelli scarsamente coesi tra loro, con meccaniche di gioco assolutamente inverosimili (ma non per questo non divertenti); ai titoli contemporanei, in cui l'ambientazione è dettagliata, coerente e coesa, e le armi hanno un comportamento perfettamente plausibile (anche se raramente realistico).\nIl futuro è ovviamente da scrivere. Al di là di ep. 1 e 2 che affronterò presto, in molti stanno aspettando il prossimo capitolo della saga. Probabilmente la tuta si rigenererà col passare del tempo, si potranno portare un numero limitato di armi, per sparare bisognerà mirare e sarà presente un tasto dedicato per lanciare le granate. Nonostante la \"mancanza\" di queste innovazioni il gioco resta senza dubbio da provare.","timestamp_created":1442149012,"timestamp_updated":1442149012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18013412","author":{"steamid":"76561198195312537","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":725,"last_played":1590592913},"language":"english","review":"NOW I KNOW WHY EVERYONE WANTS HALF-LIFE 3, JUST PLAY THIS GAME IT'S AMAZING","timestamp_created":1442141701,"timestamp_updated":1442141701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18012732","author":{"steamid":"76561198131660311","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":712,"last_played":1443527526},"language":"english","review":"Really amazing and interesting story.\nA few good puzzles and a little is a bit confusing , took me an hour to figure out how to get up to ravenholm from the lift.
