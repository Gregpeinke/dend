If you haven't already played it I suggest you do, this is a game that actually deserves the hype it received and will probably be talked about for years to come as a benchmark in storytelling. \n\nPersonally I think it is every bit the equal to the original Bioshock (and I loved the original) and in some ways far superior. I made a concerted effort to avoid any spoilers about the story and although you can guess at some of the plot twists there are others that will shock you at the end, and like any good story it leaves a few questions unanswered.\n\nAlthough Columbia may lack some of the charm and atmosphere of the enclosed underwater world of Rapture it still is a beautifully imagined world and there are times when walking close to an edge gave me a strong feeling of vertigo. \n\nThe gameplay was slick and tight, the shooting mechanics were very solid and each gun felt very different. The vigors (plasmids) provided a decent mix of strategies to suit different play styles. I have heard some people complain about how linear the game is however I never perceived this to be an issue, there was enough freedom in your ability to handle the combat however you wanted to.  The way you would run out of ammo and need to try different guns from time to time kept things fresh.\n\nI would also like to mention the sound in the game, not the voice acting, score or sound effects, which are all excellent, but the background noise that is everywhere.  From the buzz of the crowd in the streets of Columbia to the mechanical sounds of the airship a great deal of effort has been put into creating an extremely immersive audio world\n\nMy only gripe about the game is the way some of the vigors are handed to you later in the game. Several of the early vigors you have to earn the hard way and this made the new powers felt like a real achievement. The last 3 vigors are kinda just handed to you on a plate with almost no effort needed from you, this felt really cheap after the work they put you through to get the first few.\n\nOverall 9/10\n","timestamp_created":1376947949,"timestamp_updated":1376947949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"691687","author":{"steamid":"76561197975635768","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1961,"last_played":1384295059},"language":"russian","review":"Захватывающие приключения в удивительном мире Bioshock вряд ли оставят кого либо равнодушным. Захватывающий сюжет, прекрасная атмосфера и замечательные персонажи. (Если вы прошли игру и не полюбили Элизабэт - то у вас нет сердца.) Стоит отметить замечательный саундтрек, который добавляет в игру еще больше атмосферы и делает ваше погружение в мир Bioshock более полным. Моя личная оценка 10\\10 GOTY и я думаю это действительно самый главный претендент на игру года. Фанатам антиутопии и стимпанка - обязательна к прохождению. Любителям первой и второй части, настоятельно рекомендовано пройти, прежде чем забрасывать помидорами. Конкретно в механику Bioshock, INFINITE принес совсем мало и может быть вы не совсем довольны местом действия этой части, но я вас уверяю, что творение автора SystemShock,BioShock не разочарует вас.\n\nРекомендовано #pentafeedgaming подписывайтесь и читайте наш паблик:\nhttp://vk.com/pentafeedgaming","timestamp_created":1376943341,"timestamp_updated":1376943341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6719643","author":{"steamid":"76561198073286691","num_games_owned":577,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1480722057},"language":"french","review":"Super jeu. super graphisme. super ambiance bref l'un des meilleures jeux de l'année 2013.

This game is good. I won't take that away from it. It is fun, but gets boring rather quickly. It took me a long time to beat this game because I would play it for 30 minutes at a time and than say screw this and play something more entertaining. It follows the Call Of Duty follow rule which means you basically just follow the arrow. People have talked about how wonderful the story is but to be truthful people overhype it. It is a decent story. Yes there are twist and turns, but it is a story that has been done before. Let me explain before people start getting angry and yelling that no it hasn't. After I beat the game I didn't feel surprised. I really didn't. If you take out all the \"twist\" than it is a story that has been told before. Not 100% but still somewhat been told before. There is a girl and *spoiler alert* your her father and also you are the bad guy. If you played the game you understand what I'm saying. To me story is everything. Well not everything but it plays a huge role in the game I play. If there is no story than all you have is a bundle of crap put together with no direction. What made the first Bioshock great (not amazing but great) is how original is was. This game has been done before through both movies and other games. Do I recommend this game? Yes. Do I think this game is the second coming of christ? Hell no. Do I think this game could have been a lot better? Yes. Am I disappointed in this game? I am somewhat. The thing is these big companies who make one great title will take the title and dumb it down and make it seem better than what it really it. The same thing happened to Call Of Duty, Medal Of Honor, Mario, Sonic, Assassins Creed, Final Fantasy, etc etc etc. Take any of these big name titles and look back at how the originals and how  unique and fulfilling they were. Now look at the newer ones. Are they really that good or are you just in denial because you love the franchise so much. Yes they added the grappling hook which I've never seen so many people orgasm over, but honestly it wasn't that fun. People talk like this game is the greatest thing ever and it isn't. So in conclusion buy the game. It is worth the play through, but do not think this game is unique because....it isn't.","timestamp_created":1376903176,"timestamp_updated":1376903176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6653642","author":{"steamid":"76561198071532751","num_games_owned":508,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":1709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1192,"last_played":1525120284},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая часть серии Bioshock! всем советую! 9 из 10","timestamp_created":1376892072,"timestamp_updated":1376892072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1605268","author":{"steamid":"76561197995286276","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":863,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":863,"last_played":1376786632},"language":"english","review":"The first 30 minutes are excellent and the game as a whole is very good.

This game had amazing visuals and stunning level design (also a lot of the enemies concepts are really well thoughtout, like my favourite enemy the fireman). \n\nElizabeth's AI is easily the best AI a game has to date. She interacts with just about everything, and not just with words but sometimes a facial expression to show how she feels. \n\nGuns can be upgraded in so many different ways, and there are tonnes of these clothing pieces to help you with their different properties. With this, playing the game through once doesn't show you everything, and you really need to replay it to experiance all the different customization. \n\nThere are dozens of secrets to find, so you don't have to bore youself with the main mission if you feel its dull (which i wouldn't say it is).\n\nThe story is very enticing and very deep. Lots of people are muddled by the ending, but after a little bit of understanding, it is a very good ending. The game has a nice twist at the end, and throughout the game, it helps you understand why that plot twist is. \n\nAlso through the game are voice clips, known as 'voxaphone's', which can help you learn more about Columbia's past. \n\nThere is so much good about this game, and pretty much nothing bad (apart from a mildly clunky gamplay), so i highly recommend picking this game up...NO!...I force you to buy this stunning masterpiece of a game!

At 8 to 12 hours of gameplay it can easily be beaten in a day, but the replay value that it tries to pride itself on is a bit lacking - in your first playthough you'll create a character build that works best for you but quickly becomes mundane after about 5 hours, and trying to play in a different way just seems lame in comparision. I am somewhat awaiting some of the larger DLC because the gameplay is fun enough to make you forget about some of the errors and it's short length does leave you wanting a little more (The last tower defense mission however makes no goddamn sense because the gameplay had been all about progressing up until that point and fighting waves and waves seemed utterly retarded).

The BioShock games have always had great stories and an even better way of telling it, and this entry into the series is no exception. Without a doubt the best story we've gotten in a game for a long while, some amazing plot twists here and there. Lovely contrasts as well, when compared to the previous installements in the series, this time we get a city above the clouds compared to Rapture, which was under the sea. It also explains a lot  of the things going on in the background of the previous games giving us a whole new perspective of how the universe of BioShock actually works and what is actually is.\n\nNow, it's not all positive, unfortunately. The gameplay is not the best, sadly. Sure, it's fun to use the different exciting vigors and guns, but it just falls flat and boring after a while. After you use the new powers you unlock throughout the course of the game, they just turn boring way too quickly - and there's not customizing them. The upgrades we get are simply to buff up the damage and/or reduce cost.

The environments were great, of course, but the actual weapons felt... weak and enemies became too bullet-spongy later on in the game. Elizabeth is a pretty interesting addition, as she runs around looking for stuff you're running low on in the middle of combat which saved my ass plenty of times. Though interesting she's almost the only actual face-to-face interaction you get beyond a few non-combat areas. And the vigors were... well they were alright but mostly ripped from the previous Bioshock. \n\nIt was the gun-play which was really disappointing. Things like only being able to carry two weapons pretty much forces you to carry a gun and a heavy weapon. Plus weapons have very little kick and the bulletspongy enemies make it feel like you're using a toy gun. At the end of the game ammo is very scarce and there are no vendors you can get ammo from at all. And really, it just felt terrible at points, I found myself wanting to just get combat over with just to get back to the amazing story.\n\nI'd say its definitely worth a buy, as this is easily among the best stories ever told in a game. However in itself, not a good game. So I'd advise you play it on easy to get to the story bits faster.\n\nStory: 10/10 (amazing)\nEnviroment/World: 9/10 (awe-inspiring)\nCombat: 3/10 (far too generic and far too much of it shoved in for a story-centric game)","timestamp_created":1376093042,"timestamp_updated":1390162250,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522278249263763428","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2568120","author":{"steamid":"76561198009390116","num_games_owned":759,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":162,"last_played":1390313643},"language":"portuguese","review":"Falto o BigDaddy (um cara com roupa de mergulho no céu?) e o plasmit incinerate.
