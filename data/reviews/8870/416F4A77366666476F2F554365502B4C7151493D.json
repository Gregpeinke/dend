However, there is one recycled boss fight that gets annoying and the entire part of that lasts like an hour if your guns suck, but that's a minor complaint.

Since there are multiple fan theories to string it together, I thought I'll put out my own interpretation of the Burial at Sea Ep 2 ending.  \nBoth Booker and Elizabeth were destined to a cycle of violence throughout their lives (constants) and their lasting effects would result in different endings across the multiverses (variables).\nHowever, at the end of Burial at Sea Ep 2 - I understood it as (quantum?) plot disentanglement.\nIn all the other realities, they would end horribly despite being foreseen by an Omniscient Elizabeth.\nWhile she could see being each door and how they end, she could not change the constants that mattered to her - ending the cycle of violence that plagues the DeWitts. \n\nWhen the Omniscient Elizabeth chose to follow the events of the BaS Ep2: she did so knowing that: \n1) she was going to die, though we all do eventually\n2) it was the only one that mattered: the Omniscient Elizabeth would always exist in the other realities and thus would see to that their endings would cease the constant cycle of suffering.\n3) she was going to be ok in ceasing the violence in this one without her Omniscience. \n(Her imagined) Booker showed her that while she had lost the ability to see the future in this reality, she had a cause that would propel her to fulfill her reason for coming back to Rapture. Omniscient Elizabeth probably realised that in this reality, there would be no need for Omniscience or the understanding of the future in this reality\n4) this was the only reality worth dying for. And worth giving up her Omniscience for. Omniscient Elizabeth probably realised that her suffering will always be a constant in all the realities but this was the only reality that breaks the Circle of suffering and shows that Jack eventually saving the little sisters is proof of this. \n\nOverall, Burial at Sea EP 2 seems to be the linearisation of the quantum multiverses' multiple plotlines into a single plotline that, while no longer controlled by Omniscience Elizabeth - was able to finally move past the constant - the cycle of violence and suffering. \n\nOther reasons why you should love the game:\n- the art is fecking amazing (though the models for the birds are weird)\nThis includes the music, emotional tidbits via voice character messages, artistic rendition of the imaginary universes and more. Design of characters, guns, enemies as well as gameplay are incredibly dynamic across the main game and the DLCs.\n\n- the storyline is some inception-esque loop that makes them unforgettable. It encompasses the BS1 mechanic of having to remember important points in the story to fully appreciate and understand the universe you are thrown into\n\n- in the game, you cycle through various themes that are relevant to real life: religion, racism, war, torture, science and politics. It definitely makes it all the more memorable imagining you were involved in these events and how despite surviving, it does not make any one feel like a survivor more than a victim. Shame that the games always have a really dark ending where death seems to be the best means of closure - it shows that there are things worth dying for.\n\nMost importantly, no fecking bugs! Screw BS2 remastered, that crap won't continue without crashing every 15mins.
