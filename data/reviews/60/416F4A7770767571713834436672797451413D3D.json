With the main menu, loading screens and the HUD, it's obvious that it is Valve once you launch it. I mean you can also see that it's Valve by scrolling down and looking at the developers and publishers (both Valve). This game is a fantastic concept. There are many servers, all with very few to no people playing. The gameplay mechanics are painful to learn and inact. It is definately NOT worth $4.99! For a game that was released in 2000, has many flaws, old graphics, and few people playing? I would definately not call it a rip off, but I would call it a failure. The game can be fun if you play it right, and to see a modernized version of this game would be great, but overall the game is not worth the price it's sold for, and the gameplay can get really repetative. The horrible sounds of your character falling into the void, over and over... Ugh... Anyway, if you DO want to get this game, you should get it in the Counter-Strike Anthology or Valve Complete Pack, or other packs, god knows what else they have... Don't get me wrong, this game is an amazing concept! If they would improve and make it worth our time, effort, and MONEY, it could be a great game. Overall, the game does not look completed, I could imagine so many features to this tron-styled game. I mean it's called 'Ricochet', and that's exactly what it is, glowing platforms in space, that you can jump off and ricochet onto others.

Играли в неё конечно может и редко, но метко. Запустив на своём компьютере спустя 12 лет, меня сразу же пробила слеза настольгии при  падении игрока в бездну.\nКак не крути, игра даже для начала нулевых была на полчаса - час. Контента мало, способов убийств всего два. Мало кто в  8-10 летнем возрасте хотел вникать в системы рикошетов.\nИгроков в онлайне нету вообще. ВООБЩЕ. Зайдя с другом мы увидели всего 6 функционирующих серверов. Пустых. Правда зайдя на один из них мы увидели ботов, которые судя по кда, одиноко убивали друг друга и до нашего прихода.\nЧто сказать, хочется верить в один из давних слухов про \"Ricochet 2\". Прикрутя сорс движок,  добавив новых фич, скинов  и реализовав ранкед, как по мне игра может выстрелить.

pains me to write a negative review of this game, because I had heard so much about it, and thought it would be one of those fun but small Valve games. Maybe like Portal, short but sweet, abrupt but poignant. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The game is tiny, even smaller than I expected, and for how few people still play it, five dollars may just be highway robbery.\n\nThe whole game could be summed up as a barely more functional version of Tron: Deadly Discs on the Atari 2600. Sure there's a few powerups, two throwing modes and something like 5 maps, but it soon becomes clear that game theory prevails, and one or two powerups trump the others. Not to mention that every map feels the same, and they all play pretty identically as well.\n\nAs if the gameplay needed someone to further sand down all the interesting corners, you can't actually aim the disc in this game. It's not like your Tron fantasy where you de-rez a guy mid air as he jumps over you. No, you only control the facing (or yaw) of the disc. There is no pitch control to be had. Every throw is projected perfectly flat from a height suspiciously close to crotch-level. It's a little disorienting and hard to predict.\n\nWhen I finally found a server with two or three players on it, we played on a map that featured jump-pads as a central gimmick. This would be fine if they worked. Half the time I found myself kicked into the abyss at no fault of my own. I tried not touching movement, I tried steering into it, away from it. Everything I did or did not do seemed to doom me to another \"suicide\".\n\nThis game feels half-arsed, which is not something I've come to expect from Valve. With how small and simplistic this game is, and how Valve professes their love for this game, I'm surprised they (or some fans) haven't remade it on the most recent version of Source. I guess if you want your Tron kick, you are best off looking elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1445221598,"timestamp_updated":1554427859,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18490100","author":{"steamid":"76561198151887900","num_games_owned":479,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":14052,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":589,"last_played":1612018105},"language":"english","review":"Like Tron, but really, really f*cking annoying.","timestamp_created":1444942352,"timestamp_updated":1444942352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18437416","author":{"steamid":"76561198019639485","num_games_owned":1002,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":77,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59,"last_played":1519430971},"language":"english","review":"Valve is keeping a space on their award shelf for this game.

The cancer takes over your body like most, but replaces the cell with a disc that is in the game. I am typing this with one hand  because my left is a disc. Dispite the cancer, the game is still kinda fun if you like playing with two people max. For today there were only two people playing the game.\nSo essentially, 10/10 would play again.","timestamp_created":1436502005,"timestamp_updated":1436502005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571199238300323486","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16941520","author":{"steamid":"76561198082176650","num_games_owned":2772,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":95,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65,"last_played":1442101996},"language":"english","review":"Where is Ricochet 2?","timestamp_created":1436357689,"timestamp_updated":1436357715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59602886438369751","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16908713","author":{"steamid":"76561198073689656","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":139,"last_played":1436390473},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games of all time.","timestamp_created":1436183199,"timestamp_updated":1436183199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16903525","author":{"steamid":"76561198058110275","num_games_owned":405,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1543033586},"language":"spanish","review":"still better than ricochet","timestamp_created":1436147437,"timestamp_updated":1436147437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561752974987030029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16874641","author":{"steamid":"76561198052129321","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6,"last_played":1422605134},"language":"english","review":"Yo is this game dead or smth?","timestamp_created":1436001047,"timestamp_updated":1436001047,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16870350","author":{"steamid":"76561198048091725","num_games_owned":310,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":29,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":29,"last_played":1435972921},"language":"english","review":"omfg that game!!!\ngot spawnkilled 494924692 times\nkilled people with disks made of monkey-semen\nfell into a black(butt)hole 6182644682984 times\nscreamed at people that were bots\ncamped in a game that was supposed to be a fast pace fps\nhearing 10 times/seconds player scream from falling in butthole\nleft click for some bitchslaps\nright click for facial\nand melee is over rated cuz facial is too powerfull\nalso no ragdoll\n\n69/10 - EASY","timestamp_created":1435973180,"timestamp_updated":1435973180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpvuqq84CfrytQA=="}
