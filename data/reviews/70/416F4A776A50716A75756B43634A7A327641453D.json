Akıcı hikaye ve oynanışı ile insanı etkiliyor Half Life. Grafikleri ve oyun motoru da zamanına göre çok iyidi.\n\nOyunun havası oldukça kasvetli. Her an her yerden saldırabilecek düşmanlar, her tarafta onun dışındaki cesetler, çok az canlı insan, havalandırmalarda geçen yollar,kısıtlı cephane.. Oyun atmosfer olarak size o an oradaki insanın psikolojisi nasıl olursa aynen onu yaşatmakta. Karakter Gordon Freeman ise soğukkanlı ve kolayca bağ kurulabilecek bir karakter. Kısacası oyunu oynamaya başladığınızda kendinizi oyunun içerisinde hissedeceksiniz.\n\nArtılar (+) :\n\n- Akıcı hikaye ve oynanışı\n- Gerilim hissi\n- İlk Hikayeli FPS oyunu\n\nEksileri (-) :\n- Öğrencileri etkisi altına alıp başında saatler geçirtmesi ve bunun sonucunda öğrencilerin sınıfta kalması :D (Yok yok bu eksi olarak sayılmıyor :P)\n\n\nNot : 95/100","timestamp_created":1553018919,"timestamp_updated":1553018919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550172984600067139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49649711","author":{"steamid":"76561198275138027","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1243,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1187,"last_played":1610395700},"language":"english","review":"Game is great.

I will also make a few statements about Half-Life as a whole, which will also factor in the first game and its expansions, as they are related to this game. However, for the most part, this is going to be a raw review of [b] Half-Life 2. [/b] \n\nThe events of Half-Life 2 take place 20 years after the events of the first game. Despite this being a sequel game, it is not difficult to follow along with. The game has its own individual story that is separate from the first one. Although certain dialogues and callbacks may be confusing, they are not essential to the overall progression of the game. Meaning that this game is a great introduction to the Half-Life series, even in the event that you have never played any part of the games that came before it. The story is easy to follow throughout the entire game, and not hard to digest. There are no obvious plotholes or inconsistencies in the story, and it is never unclear how to progress, as you always have a clear objective or defined path. This is [i] not [/i] stating that the puzzle aspects of the game are not challenging to solve, or can lead to the player being unsure of where exactly to go in a radius, or not immediately knowing how to reach a certain path. The puzzles are unique, and unlike any other game, even to this day, with the impressive physics engine that the game created, and takes advantage of. Many of the puzzles require you to think logically, and imagine this were a real life situation, while still taking into account the fictional elements of the game. The physics in this game were revolutionary for its time, and surpassed all other games of the time. The physics the game brought to the table was not the only thing that the game excelled in. Despite the age of the game, the graphics are astonishing, and comparable even to some modern games. Despite this, the gameplay is far from modern, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. First-person combat and gunplay are huge aspects of the game. They are done in a unique way that can not experience in any other game. The AI of each NPC responds to different situations on how they act, between taking cover, rushing you, flanking you, or anything else. The enemy variety is also very diverse, and it is a hell of an experience to fight all of the different kinds of enemies this game has to offer. Despite all of the diversity among enemies, they all feel as though they fit into the world you are thrown into. The world itself is incredibly well thought out, and rich with lore. I won't go much into this, but the post-apocalyptic wasteland that you seemingly find yourself in is unlike any other, and feels incredibly foreign and unique in a perfect way. Apart from enemies, there are friendly NPC characters that you can recruit to follow you and aid you on your endeavors. There is not much to the ally NPCs. They are willing to aid you in combat, provide you with medkits (if they have medical knowledge), and respond to basic commands such as waiting or following you. Overall, the game is a unique and fun experience that I would recommend to anyone, especially if they were looking for an in-depth story with lovable characters  and rich lore. I personally think that the idea of the game, and the story itself are the best parts about this. The game has its flaws, just as any game does, however the revolutionary advancements this game brought onto the table, and the one-of-a-kind story that it introduced outweighs every negative aspect of this game. There is a reason Half-Life is one of the most widely appreciated and most successful video-game series' of all time. \n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1552867565,"timestamp_updated":1552867565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49620864","author":{"steamid":"76561198880639301","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2114,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":711,"last_played":1658134012},"language":"english","review":"I would recommend this game to anybody who likes shooters or puzzles!","timestamp_created":1552854788,"timestamp_updated":1552854788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.573367834091186523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49620340","author":{"steamid":"76561198877816336","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":11016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":269,"playtime_at_review":2188,"last_played":1660226934},"language":"spanish","review":"Juego Nostalgico, me siento viejo xd","timestamp_created":1552852704,"timestamp_updated":1552852704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49620117","author":{"steamid":"76561198445206904","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1210,"last_played":1649541655},"language":"english","review":"Where do I begin...\nLet's start with the story. Pretty basic, but well-written nonetheless. It's a FPS, so obviously you're gonna have to get used to blasting countless mobs with assault rifles (or crowbars). What I DIDN'T expect was platforming. Platforming in a late-90's FPS is not fun. At all. But if you can get by the incessant slipping-off-the-edge gimmicks, then enjoy. Also, the game seemed to get very... redundant after a while. Here's the bad guy, shoot him. Again and again and again. I know it's an FPS, but it's a very LONG FPS, and the lack of memorable characters really didn't help. If there was at least one lasting character that didn't either die within 1 minute of meeting him or just couldn't accompany you after a short walk, then I would have enjoyed the game much more.
