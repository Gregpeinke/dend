The servers that are left are shitty ones that play only 1 map 24/7, or they are the stupid gun game ones where the map is something out of fucking tron. The few servers that are frequently populated are fun until you get into the same old grind. The way the game goes is that there are 5 flags. Each team spawns and they charge to capture the middle. once a team has the middle they simply camp by setting up mg bipods and snipers. The riflemen run around throwing grenades as fast as they can into the enemy spawn. As the one being trapped in the spawn, you are most likely killed when you stupidly poke your head out to fire by a sniper or mg, or by a grenade as you make the short trek to the fight. There is very little fighting in the sense of one player hunting down a sniper or two soldiers going at eachother. Probably 90% of the kills ever made in this game were with grenades. The only way to get a kill without being riddled by an mg is to bounce a grenade off a wall and hope some dumb bastard steps on it. Overall this game is dying, but not dead. Like the original Day of Defeat which I also have, There will probably be players 10 years from now still playing the same map 24/7, having hundreds of hours played and millions of grenades thrown. I don't enjoy any game that does the 24/7 one map setup because I find that veteran players know everything there is to know about a map and will completely own a noob who dares to buy a game and tries to have fun in what they thought was a cool ww2 shooter. I would avoid this game unless it's on sale. I have played maybe 7 hours and I doubt I'll be playing much more. Stay away from this game and the original if you have a temper becuase if you get banned from one of the few servers left, you will not be enjoying your game much longer either.","timestamp_created":1468203531,"timestamp_updated":1468203531,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534740746021270752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24233578","author":{"steamid":"76561198249549422","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":5273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":729,"last_played":1646356376},"language":"english","review":"This game never goes boring.

Jednak osoby które są przyzwyczajone do CS-a mogą mieć pewien problem z \"fizyką\" strzelania. W CS-ie po strzale broń \"powraca\" do poprzedniej pozycji dzięki czemu nie musimy ruszać praktycznie myszą by strzelać do celu, natomiast w DoD po każdym oddanym strzale odrzut powoduje \"ucieczkę\" bezpowrotną broni i należy nauczyć się korygowania odrzutu w broni. Podsumowując - jest to czynnik który jest jak najbardziej do nauczenia choć z początku może sprawiać pewne problemy.\nJeśli chodzi o wady oraz zalety tej gry to mógłbym o jej plusach pisać na prawdę wiele. Natomiast minusem jedynym dla mnie jest niewielka ilość serwerów. O Polskich serwerach już nie wspominając gdyż takowych nie ma. Są one co prawda fizycznie na liście ale nikt ich nie odwiedza.

game is great. It mixes the snappy precise gunplay of it's cousin CS Source, mixes in some elements of classes and gametypes akin to Team Fortress, and throws it into a gritty WW2 setting as a cherry on top. This makes for a very fun, challenging, but rewarding experience for those who are willing to learn the mechanics and can think on their feet. Quite easy to hop into, but hard to master. DoD Source really sticks out in the WW2 FPS sub-genre even today.\n\n It really has that unique Valve touch to it, and it's yet to be recreated in the modern age. Commanding a small yet dedicated playerbase to this day. You can still find quite a few populated NA servers as long as you aren't playing late at night. And once you get into a full 32 player server, it's amazing. That nice chill feeling of enjoying the game and chatting it up with the regulars, busting eachothers' chops for fun, it's something that you will not find today.\n\nJust give it a try. The game is cheap, and I  promise you won't be disappointed.
