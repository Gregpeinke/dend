Being of such pedigree sets an extremely high standard for what one would expect from the game, and it still does not disappoint.\n\nIn addition to having just as fun puzzle-based gameplay as the orriginal it provides incredible atmosphere, with incredible backstory.   After playing Portal I would have never thought I could feel sorry for GLaDOS while still feeling angry at her, but this game proves me wrong.   The backstory of Aperature Science is as tragic as it is whimsical.  The major characters of Wheatly and GLaDOS are far more deeply developed than I could ever immagine.\n\nThe environments are beyond amazing, with each region having unique looks ranging from well built high-tech testing facuilties that \"test subjects\" are put through like lab rats, to aging abandoned industrial facuilaties.  \n\nThe soundtrack is incredible and sets a the mood to scenes be it fear, curiousity, anger, whimsy, or downright insanity.\n\nIn addition to the one player and cooperative story modes there are time trials for added replayability.   This is a game perfectionists will love.\n\n\nFurthermore, this game has continued to age gracefully since it's release, and looks good even by the latest standards.\n\nI honestly can't say anything bad about this game, and almost anyone would like this game.   Even the 13 year old brat swearing like a sailor on X-Box live will find GLaDOS's attempts to belittle you and all the dark humor of Aperature Labs' history to be incredibly entertaining, so even they will likely enjoy the game so long as they get over the fact that you don't get to shoot deadly guns.","timestamp_created":1414811982,"timestamp_updated":1414811982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49253728985786438","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12717946","author":{"steamid":"76561198067631940","num_games_owned":364,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":4246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4126,"last_played":1423864149},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game like no other, makes you work your mind to beat it, a lot more innovative than Portal 1 and has many new fun elements that's makes it a wonderful experience even for people who don't like puzzle games like me, simply worth your time and money.\n\nNote: don't play when you are feeling tired, you will be a lot less functioning and everything will seem a lot harder, rest them come back and the part where you were stuck will be easy, just like many other games.","timestamp_created":1414809836,"timestamp_updated":1414809836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12717258","author":{"steamid":"76561198089177746","num_games_owned":681,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1842,"last_played":1579026420},"language":"english","review":"This is one of my most favourite games, it has an amazing and in depth storyline.

If it makes you feel any better, science has now validated your birth mother’s decision to abandon you on a doorstep.” – GLaDOS\n\nIn Portal 2, you (Chell) find yourself in a hotel room of sorts where you just woke up from hibernation. The story element and the humor from the characters you become involved with are truly what make the game great. I find the puzzle element to be simply a bonus.  I won’t give away what happens in Portal 2, you’ll have to find out for yourself. I will say however that GLaDOS does make a comeback and you are introduced to a humorous AI program named “Wheatley.”\n\nThe game is much, much longer than its predescesor…you’ll find yourself playing this game for at least a few hours. Some of the puzzles were tricky, especially the later ones that brought lasers and different kinds of slime into the mix. The new features and environments help keep the game fresh while the story unfolds to its final conclusion.\n\nFor those of you who enjoy teaming up with a friend, you’ll be happy to know that there is a Co-Op mode that allows two players to tackle puzzles together. The Co-Op mode was designed separately from the main game so the puzzles you and your partner will face are completely new and just as likely to leave you scratching your head. Each player gets a portal gun, meaning you can have up to four portals in the test chambers at once. Most puzzles are designed around this, making you both coordinate your portals and movements in order to advance to the next room.\n\nEasy to recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzles and interacting with psychotic AIs.","timestamp_created":1414590224,"timestamp_updated":1414590224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12681715","author":{"steamid":"76561197991756070","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":98,"playtime_forever":19873,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4302,"last_played":1659380950},"language":"english","review":"Best game I have ever played!","timestamp_created":1414590155,"timestamp_updated":1414590155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12680842","author":{"steamid":"76561198054114612","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1225,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":723,"last_played":1462567999},"language":"english","review":"I really loved playing Portal 2, and that is saying a lot, since I usually prefer to play open-world games. I find that many games use the narrow predefined path for lack of content and because it takes less effort to program to run coherently. Portal 2 however is a game that doesn't suffer from any of the problems, these games are usually afflicted by. Firstly, while it's story may be predefined, it's gameplay is still wide-open. You have to solve the puzzle to progress, but how you solve the puzzle is up to you. Secondly, it's story is simply amazing. It's very well written and voice-acted, funny times, sad at others, but always engaging. As the player you don't feel like you're just a viewer in a movie, you feel engaged. \nAside from that, the game's mechanics and graphics, as well as soundFX are very well-refined. Solving test-chambers - at least to me - often walked the line of being challenging, right inbetween easy and frustrating. If you have trouble solving one, you don't have to go to guide, just take a step back and clear your head. Creating and using portals feels very natural, as do most of the other tools the game provides you with to solve puzzles, all of which are very well integrated into the game's graphics, that don't have to rely on any sort of HUD and still manages to convey everything relevant. The soundFX and music are integrated in a way that makes them appear very natural and cinematic at times, set to sound when executing certain steps to solve a puzzle, thus also working as small hints. \n\nUltimately I highly recommend Portal 2, for any price really, thoug chance are, it will be on sale before too long.","timestamp_created":1414584744,"timestamp_updated":1414584744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12680816","author":{"steamid":"76561198123970536","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1657463307},"language":"english","review":"looking forward to portal 3","timestamp_created":1414584572,"timestamp_updated":1414584572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12680165","author":{"steamid":"76561198056456331","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1408722299},"language":"english","review":"Potato game.\nPotato gameplay.\nPotato story.\nPotato graphics.\n","timestamp_created":1414579999,"timestamp_updated":1414579999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12679514","author":{"steamid":"76561198081531582","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":968,"last_played":1499025447},"language":"italian","review":"Uno dei miei giochi preferiti, stupendo!
