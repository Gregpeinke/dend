Although it's an old school first-person, shooter, it manages to hold up for the most part. If you are a fan of sci-fi/horror you will more than likely appreciate this game. \n\nI find the controls are for the most part fluid. It very much reminds me of Doom controls in terms of how speedy your character moves around the environment. That being said, the most frustrating part of this game also include the controls in terms of the jumping mechanics and especially going up and down ladders. Despite these flaws, I was still able to obtain much enjoyment from the game.\n\nThe enemies in this game are pretty basic sci-fi horror tropes but they do provide a little bit of variety. Being a fairly old game, it doesn't feel incredibly intoxicating when you kill your enemies but despite how old it is, it still provides some pleasure when killing the various foes you encounter throughout your journey.\n\nAll in all, I loved the game's story-concept and most of the gameplay. Although I think it would be difficult for younger gamers to appreciate the old-school look and mechanics of the game, it can, with time, still be appreciated as the masterpiece it was and still is.","timestamp_created":1601368499,"timestamp_updated":1601368499,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76750112","author":{"steamid":"76561198157253209","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":856,"last_played":1648172049},"language":"english","review":"One of the best fps games I've played!","timestamp_created":1601363364,"timestamp_updated":1601363364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76747234","author":{"steamid":"76561197991392947","num_games_owned":545,"num_reviews":142,"playtime_forever":1380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1380,"last_played":1515192969},"language":"russian","review":"Все же как не крути, первая часть Half-Life была пройдена мною гораздо больше раз чем вторая.

I'm sure some folks will write me off as just being bad at the game, or being too stupid to comprehend how amazing it is for a game that came out in 1998, and make other such excuses to invalidate my opinion. I've played more than enough old games to know what I'm talking about. If I gave it some more effort and gave it a second playthrough, then sure, maybe I'd end up loving it, it's happened before. But much like other important games from the 90's, this one takes a tremendous amount of effort to have fun with. I respect this game for what innovations it brought to the table, but the number of times I groaned and said \"Fuck I hate this game\" while playing it started to add up to the point I can't heartily recommend it to newcomers without adding a thick air of caution.

The innovations it presents are taken for granted now (Barring needlessly minute AI programming that the player will likely never see in-game, such as programmed scents). The game is fun but definitely suffers from the poor shooting mechanics of Goldsrc (That later carried over to Source games). Guns feel floaty and non-impactful, some of the puzzles can be annoying. enemy AI is well-designed but fairly simplistic, and the difficulty is very inconsistent from moment-to-moment. There are definitely things that die-hard fans will defend as essential pieces of the experience, but to the average gamer they are simply annoyances.\n\nHalf-Life is an important part of FPS history, and that's where it's main value lies now, but it is still [i]fun[/i], even if that fun is at times bogged down by frustrating level design or mechanics. The fast paced, run and gun gameplay is addictive, and the weapons are fun to use and experiment with. The story and moment-to-moment scenes of interacting with the Black Mesa staff are enjoyable. The dialogue is humorous and the game knows when to be terrifying when it needs to. \n\nAll in all I would recommend playing through it on medium difficulty and understanding the hype. If you're really interested in Half-Life, Black Mesa is a much more enjoyable experience but it would be wise to experience the original first. The Opposing Force expansion greatly improves on many aspects of this game by streamlining the experience and adding many more interesting weapons while cutting out the crap that plagued the first game. If you enjoy this title, I strongly recommend that one. \n\n4/5, a piece of history that has not aged well in many parts, but despite that, holds up strongly for pure fun factor.","timestamp_created":1601264264,"timestamp_updated":1601264264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76692828","author":{"steamid":"76561198038257991","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":752,"last_played":1388884560},"language":"english","review":"Good game but graphix are kinda bad...plus the title's chemistry reference is unnecessary.
