Tabii bu görevi asıl alma amacımız, New York'ta bazı sıkıntı kişilere borçlu olmamız ve onların borçlarımızı kapatma karşılığında bu kızı kendilerine getirmemizi istemelerinden doğuyor. Oyun, bir kayık üzerinde malzemelerimizi kontrol ederken ve birbirleriyle konuşan iki kişinin hiç bir şekilde sorularımıza cevap vermemesiyle başlıyor. \n\nÖnceki oyunlarına göre aksiyon seviyesi oldukça artmış olmasına rağmen, hayatta kalınabilirlik çok daha kolaylaşmış. Oyunun çok büyük bir bölümünde Elizabeth'in bizimle birlikte gelmesi ve etrafta bulduğu malzemeleri bize atması, bu kolaylığın başlıca sebeplerinden. \n\nOyun çıkalı 7 yıl olmasına rağmen grafiksel anlamda hiç göze batmıyor; oldukça başarılı. Önceki oyunlarıyla arasında çıkış yılı açısından çok fark olmamasına rağmen, grafik anlamında onlara oranla bir hayli üstün. Ayrıca vuruş hissi de çok daha belirgin. \n\nOyun bir çok açıdan kendini göstermeyi başarıyor olsa da, hikayesi ve anlatımı, çok fazla oyunda bulamayacağınız cinsten. Yavaş ilerliyor olsa da sizi eline alıyor ve merakınızı hiç söndürmüyor. Son dakikasına kadar oyuncusunu şaşırtmayı ve beyin yakmayı başarıyor. Ne yazık ki önceki oyunlarında olduğu gibi seçim yapma durumları ve farklı sonlar bulunmuyor.\n\nAyrıca oyunda bulunan silah çeşitliliği ve özel yetenek kullanımları oldukça tatmin edici düzeyde. Tabii ki geliştirmeleri de fazlalaşmış durumda. Aksiyonun bu denli artmış olması hikayeyi kaçırmanıza neden olabilir; şahsen konuşma olan yerde duruyordum. Okyanusun altında olan o kasvetli, gerilim atmosferi bu oyunda hiç bulunmuyor ama konusu her şeye yetiyor.\n\nOyunda Türkçe dil desteği bulunmuyor ancak internet üzerinde Türkçe yaması bulunuyor. Ayrıca çıkış yılına göre yüksek bir fiyatı olduğunu düşünüyorum ancak, indirim döneminde oldukça uygun oluyor.","timestamp_created":1601907798,"timestamp_updated":1601909202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77078930","author":{"steamid":"76561198424566895","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":812,"last_played":1601953451},"language":"schinese","review":"你从未见过如此讨人喜欢的队友NPC，会给你补弹药，补篮，甚至还会帮你搜刮钱，不说了，伊丽莎白天下第一","timestamp_created":1601906445,"timestamp_updated":1601906445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77078502","author":{"steamid":"76561198264075110","num_games_owned":300,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":670,"last_played":1601905763},"language":"schinese","review":"难过","timestamp_created":1601905834,"timestamp_updated":1601905834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77078206","author":{"steamid":"76561197998546716","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1688,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1424,"last_played":1602027632},"language":"english","review":"I have to say, I love the Bioshock Franchise, but this game falls a bit flat for me. \n\nWell, positives first:\n- It looks amazing, the update to Unreal 3 is really showing\n- Audio is fantastic. Top notch voice actors, great music, lots of ambient chatter\n- The setting of a flying city is kinda cool, and there are lots of details which make it feel coherent and alive\n-  The story is interesting, with lots of twists and turns\n- Gunplay is smooth, the skyline adds an interesting third dimension to fights. Same goes for the tears.\n\nWhy don't I like it?\n- The story feels overcomplicated. There are a few too many pseudo-intellectual twists and turns to make it really intriguing. A bit less would have been more. This is particularly true for the ending, which has a really cool, unexpected main twist and then keeps twisting it until it gets stupid. \n- The message behind the story is also a bit odd. I don't like to interpret too much into video games, but it's a bit of \"lol capitalism bad\", followed by \"look how much worse it gets when you give poor black people power\". Bioshock 1 and 2 did a so much better job at being nuanced and interesting.\n- There's zero real connection to the first two games. Yes, they make something up in the Burial at Sea DLC, but that hardly qualifies as a coherent setting. Sorry, but this is not Bioshock, it's an entirely different franchise which borrows some game ideas from Bioshock 1 and 2. \n- Virgors feel bolted on. They're rarely an integral part of game play, and purchasing them at cash vending machines like ammo is just not the same as buying for the adam you harvested out of a little sister after a thrilling fight with a big daddy. Most feel pretty useless, the only one I regularly used was the water one to kick people off cliffs and flying stuff. \n- The game is laughably easy even on hard, except for some weird spots where you feel powerless and just get smashed to death by a handyman without a chance to react. \n\nIt's a decent game, but it's not a worthy successor of BioShock 1 and 2.

Diving back into the underwater city was a great addition to the overall story.\n\nBurial at Sea: Episode 2 - The second expansion links both worlds, and we get to see some familiar faces from the first game. The mechanics fit perfectly to the character, and the ending especially winds everything up flawlessly.\n\nBioShock Infinite is an adventure that has marked itself as one of the best games of the decade.","timestamp_created":1601742204,"timestamp_updated":1601742204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76974858","author":{"steamid":"76561197971986033","num_games_owned":483,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1427,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1427,"last_played":1601739849},"language":"english","review":"Best game of this generation.
