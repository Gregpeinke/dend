The world feels static as small bits of trash and debris do not fly around during combat. Which is odd since Bioshock 1 & 2 featured this and it was shown in the trailers. The open world aspect shown via skyline across large maps did not materialize either. Instead they are mostly just compact tactical ramps on more modest maps. \n\nIt feels as though this game is but half of a larger more indepth game that was cut down into a smaller but still intensely enjoyable package. All the marks of the cutting are there from the trailers to the left in art assets for various areas. \n\nI would wager the lack of physics objects and smaller maps is a symptom of the small contraining the large. Where as this game had big plans and show stopping trailers. The final product had to be cut down for console play. As larger levels and physics would be causing all kinds of lag with the advanced graphics. 1999 mode is sort of a tacked on bust as well. 3x health enemies and if you run out of money from dying you go back to main menu. Do not get me wrong however this game is extremely fun though a tad short. Though not as short as dishonored.\n\nHey Ken Levine, since 1999 mode is not that great. How about we get a 2011 mode as depicted in the trailer of that year? Let us play through those little trailer areas.","timestamp_created":1368397815,"timestamp_updated":1368397815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3748794","author":{"steamid":"76561198026944221","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":438,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":437,"last_played":1388435635},"language":"russian","review":"\"Боже мой! Это божественно! Это гениально!\" - такие мысли были в моей голове на протяжении всего времени, проведённого в шедевральном BioShock Infinite.\nУже через полтора часа сюжет начал завязываться в узлы, создавая множество вопросов, но этим самым и затягивая. После прохождения игры (особенно бесподобной её концовки) в голове сразу появилась буря эмоций, старающихся вырваться наружу, но лучше промолчать, чтоб не испортить ощущения от игры тем, кто ещё не прошёл этот BioShock. \nОтдельная деталь геймплея - Элизабет, которую нам надо спасти. Её поведение, чувства - всё как у реального человека, что даже забываешь, что она всего лишь игровой персонаж. Она помогает в бою, сочувствует, злится, разглядывает особенности мира, в который она вышла, после многих лет заточения. И всё это делает настолько натурально, как никакой персонаж в игре не делал на моей памяти. И плюс у неё есть способность открывать порталы в другое измерение, а так же другие особенности оставляют уйму вопросов, но всё разъясняется к финалу.\nАтмосфера приносит нас в эту альтернативную реальность прямо на руках, а каждая мелочь в игре связанна с другой - ничего просто так не случется.\nЭта самая впечатлительная игра в которую я играл, я уверен, что каждый оценит гениальность её создателей.","timestamp_created":1368387091,"timestamp_updated":1368387091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"517645","author":{"steamid":"76561197971434682","num_games_owned":502,"num_reviews":169,"playtime_forever":3386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3189,"last_played":1396565709},"language":"english","review":"BioShock > Infinite.

После темных сырых коридоров Восторга Колумбия сражает наповал. Город получился отменно. Первое время действительно ходишь с открытым ртом и просто рассматриваешь все вокруг.\n\nИгровая механика почти не изменилась по сравнению с предыдущими частями, а рельсы действительно вносят разнообразие в геймплей, но это лишь средство подачи отличной истории и отходит на второй план в этой игре.\n\nГлавной находкой и изюминкой игры является Элизабет. Поражает, с каким трогательным вниманием разработчики отнеслись к ней. Я уверен, что каждый игрок-парень немного влюбляется в Элизабет, и у каждого будет любимый момент, связанный с ней. Очень быстро понимаешь, что именно она главный герой, а не игрок, но это даже лучше, очень интересно наблюдать, как она меняется по ходу игры. Стоит сказать, что Элизабет - самый совершенный и милый  напарник в играх. Она не путается под ногами, дает аптечки, боеприпасы, деньги и вообще ведет себя, как заправский солдат. А как она реанимирует героя! Даже этой тривиальной процедуре разработчики уделили кучу внимания. О ней можно говорить очень много!\n\nКонечно я поставлю этой игре максимум баллов из возможного и буду ее обязательно рекомендовать всем! В ней есть небольшие недоточеты, но они совсем не важны!\n\nP.S. Я знаю многих, кто считает игры глупостью, пустой тратой времени и уж точно не искусством.

Had no clue what it was going to be about other than \"the new Bioshock game from the makers of the original one.\" That's probably why I'm so impressed by it.\n\nThough I usually play games on Normal mode, I played through this one on Hard and feel like that's absolutely the way to do it. (Only 13% of players seem to have followed suit.) This isn't the sort of on-rails \"carnival ride\" that's become synonymous with \"AAA\" gaming.  Most sequences aren't scripted, and fights generally take place in open areas with lots of approaches. You'll be backtracking for health and ammo (which is often scarce), so the fact that there's a significant amount of optional story/upgrade content revealed for exploration makes you look forward to doing so. In fact, a lot of those battleground spots are wide open enough that you don't get to really see it all until after the music calms down to denote \"everyone around is dead.\"\n\nUnlike Borderlands, if you're playing a recording and someone starts to talk, the recording mutes for the talking. You can't cancel out the \"this will only be said once\" dialogue so easily, and you can replay all the past recordings. Note: the \"Gameplay\" menu it keeps talking about is NOT the \"Gameplay\" menu that appears when you hit Escape. Press \"O.\" That was dumb of them, to have two sub-screens with the same name. But that'll let you replay all past recordings, check your objectives, and change your gear (items that confer passive effects, many of which are quite good).\n\nLike the first Bioshock, you can only carry two weapons at a time. You can only quick toggle between two powers at once as well, though the game will pause if you want to select a new ability. Between this and the upgrade system, there's little incentive to diversify your loadout. Especially when re-enacting the Hitchcock 3D horror movie is so effective; upgrade that so it creates traps if you kill someone affected by it and you will be a BEAST. On the subject of traps: USE THEM. There are sections of the game that are intentionally quite difficult without them, and in Platinum Games fashion these are meant to be \"gates.\" As in, the developers figure \"the player should really use this if they wish to proceed past this point.\" \n\nUnfortunately, as is also Platinum Games fashion, almost everyone playing did not figure this out because there is no gameplay tip displayed on screen or character verbally telling you \"you probably want to try this now.\" Sure, you're informed traps exist each time you get a new ability, but it's up to you to figure out to use them. Global Achievement stats tell the story: 58.1% of Bioshock Infinite owners beat the game (13% on Hard). Only 25% bothered to even USE the traps. This is why you hear people SUPER pissed off at the \"boss\" encounters, saying \"Irrational, you done effed it up!\" Those people opted to brute force respawn through tough encounters. Don't do this. USE THE TRAPS. If you walk into an area and see enemies unaware? SET TRAPS. You will save many, many bullets. To not do so is to resign yourself to a cyclical fate of respawning with not enough ammo.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a damned good *game*. I'm not slogging through it just for its story and characters (both of which are also quite good). We live in a world where lots of people think \"oh, I'll just watch a Youtube video of someone playing it, because I want to treat games the same way that I treat film and television [also, I don't want to devote the money/time myself].\" The people who do that are doing the medium a disservice and only perpetuating the on-rails uber-linearity of \"AAA\" games. I say nuts to that. I say murder a bunch of dudes, then zoom the camera super close to their awesomely mutilated bodies and take screenshots.

\nAnd the former was a mystery, and the latter was his fate.\nSo upon our calm protagonist, grim melancholy lay,\nAs he wandered through Columbia, one pleasant summer's day.\n\nFor there were weird anomalies, awaiting on this trip:\nAn odd predictive telegram, and a coin that he must flip;\nWhen he came upon the fairground, a baseball in his grasp,\nThe telegram proved Prophetic, and the \"Shepherd\" was entrapped. \n\nThe policemen sent to fetch him, though, emerged in fearful shape,\nAs DeWitt procured his skyhook in a bloody quick escape;\nHe killed the hothead fireman, and the soldiers' onslaught checked,\nAs the presence of the Shepherd began to have a mass effect. \n\nAnd he struck a blow for freedom, put the Ravens in their place,\nStole Lizzie from the statue, with a grimace on his face,\nEndured the propaganda, so veiled and ornate,\nAnd in the halls of history, found cause to clean his Slate.\n\nTen thousand Founders fought him, and found that fighting hurts;\nTen thousand Vox applauded him in another universe.\nFitzroy had incited them, the Prophet's rule to end,\nAnd Comstock wouldn't tolerate this Columbian-mocha blend.\n\nFor now the Vox Rebellion was heady in the air,\nAs Booker and Elizabeth chased gunsmiths through the tears;\nHe found himself a martyr, the rebels’ hero dead;\n\"That ain't my style,\" said Booker, as in a blimp he fled.\n\nFrom the working town of Finkton, though, the city fell to storm;

one spared from Prophet's rage - \nAnd the note was found to be the key to break the Songbird's CAGE. \n\nThe bird succumbed to atmosphere, as was his destiny,\nAs the pair both stood enraptured, in the city beneath the sea;\nThey saw the timestreams branching through a million lighthouse doors,\nIn a world most Irrational, where futures are restored.\n\nBut the memories stored in Booker's mind were all subject to change,\nIn this universal chess game that the physicists arranged;\nFor to save himself and Anna, a destiny is faced - \nAnd at the river delta, his parallels erased.\n\nOh, somewhere in the multiverse, the stars are twinkling bright,\nAnd Jack is fighting Atlas, 'mid Rapture's neon lights,\nAnd always there's a city, where twin Luteces pout;\nBut there is no more Columbia...\n\n... for mighty Comstock was struck out.\n\n - ZeroKelvin & Ernest Thayer","timestamp_created":1367649265,"timestamp_updated":1394729466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1264566","author":{"steamid":"76561197990314940","num_games_owned":1299,"num_reviews":125,"playtime_forever":3379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2822,"last_played":1614627397},"language":"english","review":"This game is beautiful, intelligent and just a work of art.

Now I know, everyone is raving about it, but I just can't do it. The first disruption that isn't spoiling anything is in my opinion sloppy writing because of the way portals are used  (ie. Look! Our main characters made a mistake! Why don't we just open this Plot Device™ and all their problems will vanish!) This kind of thing was well-executed early on but it quickly became obnoxious and essentially an overused gimmick by the end. I have an even bigger gripe with the ending but I won't spoil it. So if you don't hold story as the biggest component of a game, there is no doubt that this will likely be your Game of the Year.
