What few cutscenes there are in the series feel special and they're genuinely interesting and short, straight to the point.  The developers wanted to take the control away from the player as little as possible, they wanted you to be immersed in the atmosphere and the characters; which some developers don't seem to care about anymore.  \n\nI don't feel I shouldn't really go into too much in this review since if you're buying this game you've probably already played the other games and it's been around for 9 years now so there are already plenty of other reviews that can describe how beautiful this game is much better than I can.","timestamp_created":1479942560,"timestamp_updated":1479942560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26935207","author":{"steamid":"76561197982376529","num_games_owned":548,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3574,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2889,"last_played":1630404695},"language":"english","review":"10/10 game, really amazing.
