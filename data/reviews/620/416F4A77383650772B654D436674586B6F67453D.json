Yes, I had completely missed out on all the hype and then only started playing it because of a friend. Well, as it turns out, this puzzle game is pretty good. “Portal 2” bristles with creativity and has some insanely funny characters brought to life by amazing voice actors (it's J.K. Simmons for heaven's sake). At the same time, the game also has one of these eerie sci-fi settings that Valve used to be so good at creating and which once again is presented beautifully and effectively in the Source engine. If I have any complaint at all, it would be that the singleplayer part feels like it's a bit on the short side. But that’s probably only because I didn’t want it to end at all. Luckily, there is also an exciting co-op mode, which is best enjoyed with a friend with whom you can voice chat.","timestamp_created":1529140019,"timestamp_updated":1529140019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52702707052230835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42759576","author":{"steamid":"76561198339740810","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1103,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":483,"last_played":1653081721},"language":"russian","review":"Приятная игра,\nубьет пару часов времени на прохождение\nзавлекающий сюжет, интересные механики,\nнеплохая графика, хорошая оптимизация,\nзапустится даже на тетрисе.\n\nРекомендую.","timestamp_created":1529139916,"timestamp_updated":1529139941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42758968","author":{"steamid":"76561198084584761","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":1086,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1086,"last_played":1529383662},"language":"spanish","review":"Sigue la línea del uno y la profundiza.

Oyunu hiç sevmemiştim. Grafikleri gerçekten kötüydü. Portal 2'yi satın almamın sebebi multiplayer modunun olmasıydı aslında. Markette trailer'ını izlediğimde 1. oyuna nazaran çok daha iyi olduğunu görmüştüm. Eğer singleplayer olsaydı kesinlikle almazdım ama şimdi iyiki almışım diyorum. Oyunun Multiplayer'ı Single'ın devamı gibi aslında. Ben ilk Multiplayer oynayıp bitirdikten ve sevdikten sonra Single'da nasıldır diye merak edip başladım. O yüzden ilk sonraki kısmı ardından başlangıcı oynamam biraz değişik oldu.\n\nOyuna ilk başladığımda biraz şaşırdım. Çünkü benim için çok hızlı ilerlemişti. Başta bunu da pek beğenmemek ile birlikte oynamaya devam ettim. İyiki de etmişim.\n\nOyundan bahsedecek olursak; -zaten artık bilmeyen yoktur-\nOyun aslında test odaları üzerinden devam ediyor başta. Elinizde ki portal silahı ile odaları ve bulmacaları geçmeye çalışıyorsunuz. Sonra bi anda kendinizi buradan kaçarken buluyorsunuz. Wheatley adında bir robot sizin kaçmanıza yardım ediyor ve test odalarını yöneten ''GLaDOS'' isimli robot ise sizi durdurmaya çalışıyor. Ardından GLaDOS'u devre dışı bırakıp yönetici olarak Wheatley'i bağlıyorsunuz ve hayatınızın hatasını yapıyorsunuz. :D Asıl macera bundan sonra başlıyor.\n\nMultiplayer modunda ise arkadaşınız ile birlikte denek olarak kullanılacak insanları serbest bırakmaya çalışıyorsunuz. (burada yanlışım olabilir) \n\nHerneyse oyun bu şekilde devam ediyor.\n\nPortal 2'yi bitirdikten sonra beğenmediğim halde içimden 1. oyunuda bitirmek geldi. Yine bitirmeye sondan başladım. :D\n\nHikayesi gerçekten güzel ve zaman geçirmek için ideal bir oyun. Oyunu oynarken sıkılacağınızı düşünmüyorum aslında. Ben başlarda biraz sıkıldım fakat oyun ilerledikçe güzelleşiyor ve beyninizi yakmaya devam ediyor. Son kısım biraz eğlenceli ve karmaşık gibi. Benim en beğendiğim ve eğlendiğim yer Chapter 9'du. \n\nHerneyse dediğim gibi oyun gayet güzel. Herkese oynamasını tavsiye edeceğim bir oyundur. Oynarsanız pişman olmazsınız. Ve biraz beyniniz yanabilir. :D\n\nVe son olarak; GLaDOS adamdır!\n\nSizlere iyi oyunlar, benim acilen gidip 1. oyunu bitirmem gerek. :D","timestamp_created":1528983521,"timestamp_updated":1528985690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536420345306396484","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42718888","author":{"steamid":"76561198143795902","num_games_owned":418,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":3391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1692,"last_played":1654714721},"language":"english","review":"I really enjoyed this game from start to finish.\nThe puzzles are great, and there are twists that fit right in!\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is fantastic and GLaDOS is at it again.\n\nShould totally get this when on sale.","timestamp_created":1528977591,"timestamp_updated":1528977591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42718229","author":{"steamid":"76561198441795714","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":451,"last_played":1584818103},"language":"russian","review":"Топчег\n","timestamp_created":1528974839,"timestamp_updated":1528974839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42717544","author":{"steamid":"76561198356953156","num_games_owned":220,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":1004,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":356,"last_played":1575194420},"language":"schinese","review":"Portal 2\n动脑->动腿->好玩->不好听","timestamp_created":1528972087,"timestamp_updated":1529138753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42716940","author":{"steamid":"76561198149806763","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":871,"last_played":1498504831},"language":"french","review":"Bon jeux d'égnimes à faire avec un pote.","timestamp_created":1528969863,"timestamp_updated":1528969863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42716561","author":{"steamid":"76561197964136578","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":696,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":362,"last_played":1596466003},"language":"english","review":"Fab game.

It is a sequel to acclaimed by critics Portal from 2007. Until now the game was released so far on PC with Windows, Linux and OS X, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. Maybe it is just my imagination but I think being a real gamer and not hearing at peast once about this franchise is nearly impossible.\n\nThe plot continoues story of Chell, our mute protagonist after events of the first Portal is still imprisoned in Aperture's facility, this time however she has a new companion, the AI named Wheatley. During they desperate struggle to escape they accidentaly revive GLaDOS, the AI overseeing the entire project. Once again the villainous machine force us to solve puzzles and proceed through test chambers in order to survive. The story is preety great in my opinion, thanks to side characters that can be funny yet convincing all the time really make you enjoy everything, also it has some shocking plot twists and really satisfying ending.\nJust as in previous game Chell is armed with the iconic Portal Gun that can create portals on white surfaces, allowing us to move around on very creative ways. Developers also cared to add some new mechanics including pushing streams and various gels boosting our speed or height of jumps. Turrets, buttons etc. The level design often force us to think over all the movements, the solutions are not always obvious so you can spend even an hour in one chamber just on trying out what works and what not.\nSoundtrack is not only enjoyable, but also it reacts to what player does. If you walk on orange gel for example the music speeds up for a while, it really adds some immerse to the gameplay.\nThe game has it's years so at least on modern PCs you can expect flawless performance, frames does not fall ever below 60 on highest settings, besides graphics still look great.\n\nTo be honest this is propably the one of the most intense puzzle games you can find on Steam today, story does not dissapoint, gameplay require a lot of thinking, the music fits great and it is all still enjoyable despite the years. If like me you have grown on classic Tomb Raiders or other games that challenge your way of thinking you will enjoy it so much.

The multiplayer for this game is also fantastic, with you being able to play with a partner and help each other solve puzzles (which admittingly are harder than the ones in the main story), while there *also* being a story for co-op. And even if you finish both the co-op missions and singleplayer, there is still a community who continues to make seperate puzzles and even mini storylines of puzzles for you to survive through. \nYou might want to play through Portal in order to understand the story a bit more fully, but it isn't necessary.

Всем кто еще не прошел, советую пройте обязательно.","timestamp_created":1528833924,"timestamp_updated":1528833924,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42683491","author":{"steamid":"76561198103196454","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":2098,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1902,"last_played":1531998813},"language":"koreana","review":"재밌는데 스토리도 커져서 더 재밌다","timestamp_created":1528832710,"timestamp_updated":1528832710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42683346","author":{"steamid":"76561198400521522","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3122,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1610841243},"language":"russian","review":"Норм игрулька","timestamp_created":1528832304,"timestamp_updated":1528832304,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42681429","author":{"steamid":"76561198139320435","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1528652842},"language":"polish","review":"Gra bardzo dobra tak samo jak jej cena. Myślę że Valve odwaliło kupę świetnej roboty przy tej części Portala. Fabuła jest ciekawa (kontynuacja pierwszej części po przebudzeniu się głównej bohaterki),tak samo jak bohaterowie roboty Wheatley i Glados którzy zostali świetnie napisani. Ta gra będzie popularna jeszcze przez wiele lat. Wielkim plusem tej gry jest że pójdzie nawet na słabszych komputerach.\nFabuła 9/10\nGrafika 7/10\nPostaci 8/10\n\n","timestamp_created":1528826581,"timestamp_updated":1528826581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42680041","author":{"steamid":"76561198346010848","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1082,"last_played":1628110103},"language":"german","review":"Dieses Spiel ist nach meiner Meinung immer noch das Beste Spiel auf ganz Steam!","timestamp_created":1528822420,"timestamp_updated":1528822420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42679965","author":{"steamid":"76561198122586376","num_games_owned":291,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1587024613},"language":"english","review":"cake","timestamp_created":1528822201,"timestamp_updated":1634976369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42679789","author":{"steamid":"76561198357433577","num_games_owned":325,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":120,"last_played":1524955053},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo, maravilhoso e envolvente.","timestamp_created":1528821662,"timestamp_updated":1528821662,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42677976","author":{"steamid":"76561198053385631","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":545,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":467,"last_played":1656428652},"language":"polish","review":"Tak naprawdę dobra gra, ale stoi wyżej w rankingu niż Wiedzmiń 3 dlatego łapka w dół by wspomóc najlepszą grę na świecie XD","timestamp_created":1528816606,"timestamp_updated":1528816606,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":13,"weighted_vote_score":"0.209914430975914001","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42677295","author":{"steamid":"76561198217206720","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1043,"last_played":1636907519},"language":"japanese","review":"神ゲー","timestamp_created":1528814742,"timestamp_updated":1528814742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42676650","author":{"steamid":"76561198124989233","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1421,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1352,"last_played":1581248832},"language":"english","review":"nice1","timestamp_created":1528812886,"timestamp_updated":1528812886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42674619","author":{"steamid":"76561198394112041","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":4375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3672,"last_played":1645120986},"language":"english","review":"Love this game.
