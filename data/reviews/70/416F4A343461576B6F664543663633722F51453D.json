Yes, Half-Life was revolutionary, but yes Half-Life is a game from a 1998 and it shows in more than just it's polygon count. Despite that, Half-Life excels at level/world design and gun-play, making it timeless. Black Mesa is the greatest fps environment still to this date. Every section feels unique and tells its own engaging story with incredibly thin dialogue, and each level builds off the next. To compliment this, enemies are placed perfectly and the types are varied enough to keep the game evolving with you as you gain a heftier arsenal. Each weapon proves to provide some use throughout the campaign all elevated by the optimal sound design that feeds into the chunkiness of the era. \n\nI started playing Half-Life as nothing more than a history lesson; to see what all the fuss was about and to judge how far we've come. What I learned is that I get it. Half-Life is a masterpiece. Half-Life was and still is revolutionary.

Uma obra-prima do mundo dos jogos, ainda quando esse ainda se formava, principalmente para pcs. Jogos de arma já existiam, e muitos por sinal, na verdade gosto de me lembrar do jogo de armas mais antigo que já joguei Tin Stars, em um autentico snes, não diria que é muito bom, porque aquele jogo é difícil. Mas half-life inova no pc, um jogo considerado antigo para pcs, e que dele surgiu três dos jogos mais jogados da steam, mas vamos falar primeiramente do jogo em si.\n\nEm Half-Life você é um cara chamado Gordon Freeman, um cara que na teoria nem sabe usar armas, isso depende de você afinal, e o mesmo foi chamado para realizar um teste para ir para um \"outro universo\", você pega sua armadura, bem OP por sinal, e no vai fazer o que os cientistas pendem, e se fosse tudo ocorrer bem, ia ser muito chato, então da muita bosta, explode as caceta tudo, e dai os monstros desse outro universo começam a vir para Terra, claro que eles te atacam, claro que você tem que matar eles, depois você descobre que os soldados também querem te matar. Eu dei só uma sinopse.\n\nEnfim, quero encurtar aqui então vou falar quais são os mods mais famosos de Half-Life, COUNTER FUCKING STRIKE e TEAM FUCKING FORTRESS, ué mas não eram três? Bem temos Garry's Mod, que não é um mod, mas também só existe graças a esse jogo lindo.\n\nJogabilidade: 8/10 Temos alguns bugs, que até existem em outros jogos que usam o mesmo motor de Half-Life, mas mesmo assim é muito bom.\n\nGráficos: 6/10 Eu sei que o jogo é de antes de 2000, mas mesmo assim são bonitos para a sua época, mas a nota cai porque este review é de 2020 não de 1999.\n\nLore: 10/10 Diferente de Portal, a Valve soube muito bem como explorar o universo de Half-Life, e apesar de muitas vezes você ficar fazendo as coisas sem saber porquê, você pode ver um vídeo no youtube e depois dizer: \"Nossa era isso então\"\n\nJogo parcialmente jogado free durante a realese de Half-Life Alyx, e depois comprado durante a summer's

J'ai donc décidé d'installer Half-Life (que j'avais laissé tomber) sur mon ordinateur de travail car il est obselète : Windows 10 fait sauter le disque dur lol. En jouant, j'ai compris qu'il méritait son titre de classique du genre.\n\nLe jeu est vivant : les scientifiques qui parlent, essayent de s'en sortir ou les officiers qui sert à quelque chose. Je les compare à Yoshi dans Mario. Ils t'aident à tuer les ennemis et tu peux les tuer si tu progresse comme ça.\n\nL'IA est intelligente, chose rare encore aujourd'hui dans les jeux récents : elle n'hésitera pas à se déplacer pour se mettre à couvert ou pour vous tuer. Il y a même un gars qui m'a envoyé une grenade alors que j'étais au-dessus 8-)\n\nLe jeu est aussi de l'exploration et de la survie car vous reviendriez sur vos pas pour trouver le chemin à suivre ou progresser et car vos PV se régénère pas avec le temps. Et si vous êtes comme moi, vous allez finir par utiliser la console car vous tournez en rond.\n\nLe jeu possède un mode multijoueur classique avec les armes du jeu. Les parties sont intenses, je dirais, mais seul 2 ou 3 serveurs sont actifs.\n\nPour avoir testé, le jeu n'est pas trop maniable à la manette (testé avec le Steam Contrôleur)\n\nJe vous le recommande chaudement si vous en avez marre des FPS d'aujourd'hui.
