I read that Opposing Force was a buggy mess. Well I played it, and I can confirm that those issues have been fixed by Gearbox. There may still be bugs though, so I recommend downloading patches online, such as the single player maps fix.\n\nOk, so my thoughts on the game are this. It's excellent. While Blue Shift is splendid, this is still a great game. New weapons and enemies are available here, along with new mechanics. You play as Adrian Shephard, who is a HECU Marine. You know, the enemies you faced in the original game? You're not a villain here, although you can be one if you so desire. You can play as someone else if you wish by changing the player.mdl file. Here's how it's done. The explanation also applies to Half-Life (valve folder) and Blue Shift (bshift folder). Be sure to make a backup copy of the original player file by the way.\n\n------------\n\nOk, so you download a player skin of your choice. You'll see a folder containing a .mdl file inside it. Copy and paste that file over to the models folder in Gearbox and/or Gearbox_hd. Then you rename that file to player.mdl and there, you have the character you downloaded as the protagonist.\n\nWarning, there's a player folder in the models folder. That's for the multiplayer, and doesn't effect the campaign. The single player uses a unique model with the player.mdl file.\n\n------------\n\nSingle player is not really that short. It doesn't have a long tram ride like HL. Instead, you get right to the action, which is a plus for me. It's very fun! I will say the final boss is too easy though. Now the multiplayer...it's glorious. It's a big upgrade from Half-Life's multiplayer, you get the original weapons from HL along with the ones introduced in OP, new maps, and a new game mode called Capture The Flag. By default the game doesn't have bots, but you can install them if you wish. There's still players online incase you're wondering. You can download custom made content online, which increase the fun even more! Definitely get this game.

One your pocket book won't mind a bit come the steam holiday sales. Where these vintage games go on offer for pennies almost.\n\nNow, Half-Life: Opposing Force, much like Blue Shift, was a game I have intended to play for many years. I'd started it over a friend's house, never finished it. Started up the tutorial and first level a few times, but never got around to really stepping into it. And now I have finished the game, and I have this to say.\n\nI was honestly very happy with the expansion. And it deserves its place as one of the best out there.\n\nNow, two caveats. Just like with blue shift, I needed to go into options and use hardware mouse configuration to get the game to actually read my mouse while playing (main menu and pause was fine), and the game REALLY hates dual-screen configuration. The cursor does not lock in the application, and the subtle drift means occasionally your cursor might go over to the other window, or escape the window bounds at the bottom, left, or top depending on your settings. This was really frustrating sometimes, but... We lived.\n\nThe enemies and challenge of the game was appropriate. And really helped sell the experience of a Valve expression of the Half-Life universe. Even moreso, aliens that hadn't made it into Half-Life 2 that I never saw before. Unique tech and weapons. Lots of interesting things! \n\nThe game felt well paced, for the most part. The beginning felt longer than any other (preceding Alyx), but perhaps I am mistaken. There might be a small complaint in that by the end of the game, it was somewhat tricky to remember what column the weapon I wanted was in... AS there sure were a lot of weapons.\n\nBut that meant there were a lot of enemies. And a lot of enemies who needed shot. And that's what Adrian Shepherd did best perhaps.\n\nRecommend giving it a try if you're every running vintage, and want to experience Gold Source.","timestamp_created":1603873637,"timestamp_updated":1603873637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78259687","author":{"steamid":"76561199002121148","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":300,"last_played":1603935320},"language":"spanish","review":"lo termine y esta epico","timestamp_created":1603839139,"timestamp_updated":1603839139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78248048","author":{"steamid":"76561198162080492","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":196,"last_played":1603949084},"language":"russian","review":"хуetа еbать","timestamp_created":1603823214,"timestamp_updated":1603823214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480158746242523193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78245062","author":{"steamid":"76561198100753521","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2139,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2139,"last_played":1603813483},"language":"brazilian","review":"Half-Life: Opposing Force é um jogo paralelo à franquia Half-Life, desenvolvido pela Gearbox ao invés da Valve.

Embora a jogabilidade e gráficos sejam essencialmente os mesmos, o jogo traz uma história original, assim como novas armas e inimigos, mas a trilha sonora não se destaca muito. Mesmo assim, se você gostou de Half-Life, vale a pena jogar Opposing Force.","timestamp_created":1603819579,"timestamp_updated":1603819579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78238742","author":{"steamid":"76561199055115728","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":4646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":419,"last_played":1657666573},"language":"english","review":"gud","timestamp_created":1603811192,"timestamp_updated":1603811192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78237575","author":{"steamid":"76561199040853565","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":489,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":230,"last_played":1606145585},"language":"koreana","review":"하프라이프 본편만큼이나 재미짐","timestamp_created":1603809624,"timestamp_updated":1603809624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52651512622833252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78215714","author":{"steamid":"76561198993339005","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":327,"last_played":1643081345},"language":"english","review":"Gearbox took what Valve made and expanded upon it, this is the greatest expansion pack for the original Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1603767179,"timestamp_updated":1641420224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78209661","author":{"steamid":"76561199013059040","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2072,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":921,"last_played":1649010973},"language":"portuguese","review":"I WILL KICK YOU ASS FREEMAN!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1603755656,"timestamp_updated":1603755656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78199745","author":{"steamid":"76561198180800542","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":3675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":745,"last_played":1660144440},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite expansion packs for Half-Life!","timestamp_created":1603740935,"timestamp_updated":1603740935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78187060","author":{"steamid":"76561199031702675","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":266,"last_played":1603724402},"language":"ukrainian","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1603724161,"timestamp_updated":1603724161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78181711","author":{"steamid":"76561198818566085","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":369,"last_played":1603460680},"language":"english","review":"6 hours of committing war crimes.","timestamp_created":1603716139,"timestamp_updated":1603716139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78160999","author":{"steamid":"76561198802041616","num_games_owned":233,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1337,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1302,"last_played":1605294429},"language":"german","review":"Gud game","timestamp_created":1603672778,"timestamp_updated":1603672778,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78159398","author":{"steamid":"76561198025314108","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259,"last_played":1603651229},"language":"english","review":"This game is great! It shows a great new perspective on the Half-Life story. It's harder, there's more weapons, not all of which I like, but they're certainly interesting. The new enemies are good, and much more challenging than most of the original game's enemies. The levels are great and have a fair amount of variety, with a few pushing your ammo limits and making for some tense moments in the dark. This really is worth playing if you're a fan of Half-Life and have somehow missed it","timestamp_created":1603670011,"timestamp_updated":1603670011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x82LsfUCduKTqgI="}
