Its idea is totally original and is for sure a lot of fun. The puzzles can be a bit frustrating at times but are still a joy to play through. Plus, nothing beats the feeling you get after you finally beat the level you spent a long time on. However, the game is more like an experiment. With that in mind, the game is definitely on the shorter side; you'll spend no longer than 4-5 hours on the main campaign. There are also a few challenging bonus levels that really test your skill after you watch the game's credits. Overall, it's a very good experience that is worth the ten dollars. Buy it, especially if it goes on sale. If you're craving more after you've finished this, then pick up the even more superior Portal 2.","timestamp_created":1422563919,"timestamp_updated":1422563972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14230056","author":{"steamid":"76561198142384271","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":140,"last_played":1573051983},"language":"english","review":"A game that is not expensive and worth the money,what are you waiting for? buy this game now! its just so calm,you,Glados,and ur portal gun,thats all,is so calming struggling to solve the puzzles,and shoud i mention the satisfaction of solving a hard puzzle that you get? shoud i tell you that theres a developer commentary that is very intresting,you can listen how the leves were desined why,and the most important thing,is that this game is not expensive,i mean,i buyed this with 1,74.Wait,shoud i just mention that theres a frekin bonus challanging map? now,those maps make the wole game,ive been reading some rewews saying that the game is too short,well,i invite those people to perfect complete each challange on each chamber on each chapter. 11/10 this game made my day.","timestamp_created":1422562712,"timestamp_updated":1422562712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14229748","author":{"steamid":"76561198034535375","num_games_owned":1377,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":187,"last_played":1440188022},"language":"english","review":"cake is a lie\n","timestamp_created":1422561590,"timestamp_updated":1422561590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14229679","author":{"steamid":"76561198204530500","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1437429423},"language":"english","review":"Buy them both, started up Portal to give it a try and 4hrs later completed.

Portal has a basic concept behind it, you're a lab rat, you have a gun that shoots portals and you have to solve a chamber. Even though this sounds very repetitive at first we see that the game throws us into different environments allowing for more puzzle thinking with portals. This is not a very big game, on the story i only got 4-5 hours out of it which i would say is the biggest critism of the game. However everything in the game is there and is not wasted, meaning everything that is there NEEDS to be there. It also has an interesting story plot and is leaves the audience asking \"What happens next?\"\n\nNow there are a lot of comparisons to Portal 2 its predecessor , where the story is continued. However whether you think Portal is better than Portal 2 is personal preference. Portal 2 does exceed Portal is ways like; better and more characters, longer game, more testing aparatus. However Portal 2 does not have the same charm as Portal, which is why i personally think Portal is better.

Есть интерактивные объекты, способ взаимодействия с которыми очевиден. Задача элементарна - пройти дальше. Однако головоломки разнообразны и интересны, а использование порталов с непривычки знатно взрывает мозг. Стоит начать играть, и девиз игры - Think with portals - становится понятен.\n\nПо мере прохождения игрок будет ознакамливаться с вполне себе хорошим сюжетом и фирменным чёрным юмором; познакомится с главным антагонистом, которая настолько харизматична, что её будет жалко убивать; а в конце прослушает шикарнейшую финальную песню, в одну которую души вложено больше, чем во многие игры.\n\nЕсли говорить о реализации, то тут не всё так красочно. Игра выпущена на движке второго халф-лайфа, причём от черт второго халф-лайфа не избавилась, что создаёт впечатление, что Portal - скорее мод, чем нечто самостоятельное (частично так оно и есть). Несмотря на то, что графика вполне радует глаз, дизайн выглядит непрофессионально и несколько несвязно. Местами появляется ощущение сырости и недоделанности. Завершает картину отвратная русская озвучка, с которой явно продешевили (советую играть с английской).\n\nВердикт: [b]8/10[/b], но это одна из тех игр, с которой обязан познакомиться каждый. Хотя бы затем, чтобы после приступить к истинному шедевру - второй части игры.","timestamp_created":1422231240,"timestamp_updated":1422231240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.713725626468658447","comment_count":15,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14167733","author":{"steamid":"76561198115516273","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1421663725},"language":"russian","review":"Чудесная игра! Жаль, что она достаточно короткая! Раньше не приходилось встречать игр подобного жанра, поэтому прохождение поначалу было нелегким, но быстро втянулся и прошел игру за 5 часов. В игре понравилось все - от диалогов до графики! Прекрасно выполненные игровые уровни! Звуковое сопровождение подобрано очень здорово. Графика в стиле движка Source великолепна. Спасибо разработчикам за такую замечательную игру!","timestamp_created":1422216370,"timestamp_updated":1422216370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14167392","author":{"steamid":"76561198040118835","num_games_owned":1048,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1823,"last_played":1358496000},"language":"english","review":"\"The cake is a lie\" is a lie.
