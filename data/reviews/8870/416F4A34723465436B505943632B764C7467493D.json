Para os fãs de longa data dos primeiros jogos, acredito que não vão se decepcionar com o jogo. \n\nAo contrário do primeiro Bioshock, que oferece inúmeras possibilidades de exploração e variados modos de executar os objetivos. No infinite isso é mais limitado: só se pode equipar duas armas por vez, a quantidade de poderes é reduzida, os locais são mais lineares, não se pode mais upar as armas. Em resumo, o game é inferior mecanicamente. Entretanto, a narrativa do jogo é de longe a mais complexa entre os três jogos, mais intrigante e mais bem escrita. Se você, assim como eu, é do tipo que acha a história de um jogo o ponto mais importante, os defeitos de gameplay passarão despercebidos a princípio (você vai estar muito imerso no mundo magnífico do jogo pra notar). \n\nAs mecânicas de se locomover pelos trilhos na cidade, além da possibilidade de combinar os poderes e a adição de uma companheira, extremamente carismática, que te ajuda em batalhas trazem uma ótima dinâmica pro gameplay, fazendo com que os defeitos, antes citados, não ofusquem a gameplay por completo e a torne tediosa.\n\nMesmo com suas limitações em relação aos jogos anteriores, Bioshock Infinite é uma jornada incrível que com certeza vale a pena ser experienciada. \n\n\n","timestamp_created":1607011224,"timestamp_updated":1607011224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81530091","author":{"steamid":"76561198214991956","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":391,"last_played":1613131973},"language":"russian","review":"Сюжет очень геморный, но он не становится из-за этого хуже.

But what a game!\n\nI'll refrain to talk about the plot at all here other than mentioning that the setup is you're in the shoes of US Vet Booker Dewitt in alternate history version of 1912 tasked to go and rescue a mysterious girl locked up in the floating city of Columbia since her childhood. Sounds pretty basic right? Well oh boyyy, you're in for one hell of an amazing, phenomenal ride, by the end you'll be left thinking about it for probable days. \n\nI do believe the game still holds up visually in 2020, lighting in some areas look genuinely modern and whilst the environment in certain places can look pretty dull - overall , the majority of sections in Columbia are pretty breathtaking in terms of its art direction and what they were going for. \n\nGameplay wise, it's pretty good fun! You're able to zipline across areas, giving it a sense of variety and verticality. The gunplay feels decently heavy when you're shooting , however given the plethora of new weapons you come across I do wished it gave you more than simply carrying 2 at a time on you, as combined with the vigor powers you're able to exploit it would have made for some fantastic organic set pieces and action! Though i suppose they limited it for balance reasons. I also was hoping for more cool moments of zipline fighting than what there was  as it would have for more variety than the corridor to corridor shooting that it devolves into.\n\nIt's an easy recommendation to make! The Bioshock franchise is legendary at this point and I can see why.","timestamp_created":1606907455,"timestamp_updated":1606907455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511784493923187256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"81456229","author":{"steamid":"76561199102311810","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":409,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":409,"last_played":1606906127},"language":"russian","review":"Просто вау.
