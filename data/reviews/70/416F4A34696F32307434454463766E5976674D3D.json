Mi spiegherò meglio. Possedere un account Steam e non avere nella propria libreria questo gioco, è un po’ come affermare: “Io sono un grande fan di Sega e Nintendo, però Sonic The Hedgehog e Super Mario Bros, li ho evitati.” Sarò ancora più chiaro: Half Life, E’ STEAM! A parte gli scherzi, questa applicazione nel 1998 rivoluzionò il genere degli sparatutto; eliminò letteralmente il concetto di “interruttore” o “porta” di fine sessione con successiva conta dei nemici abbattuti, creando un livello d’intrattenimento praticamente privo d’interruzioni e di conseguenza maggiormente cinematografico; appariva saltuariamente la scritta “caricamento” che ci introduceva alla parte successiva della storia, niente di più. Si trattò di un’enorme innovazione in quegli anni. Se vogliamo poi aggiungere all’ispirata sceneggiatura: contenuti action di alto livello, un arsenale molto vario (armi leggere, pesanti, prototipi ed aliene) ed uno stuolo di nemici (extraterrestri ed umani) dotati di una discreta intelligenza artificiale, non possiamo assolutamente restare indifferenti di fronte a questo titolo. Logicamente oggi giorno Half Life può sfigurare a fianco di nomi più blasonati come “Call of Duty”, “Battlefield” e così via (soprattutto per quanto riguarda il comparto grafico), ma è normale, fu pubblicato nel 1998 ed esistevano i limiti software dell’epoca. Scommetto che se fosse stato rilasciato nel corso dell’ultimo decennio, sarebbero altri i giochi ad essere meno apprezzati ora. In conclusione vorrei affermare che… ma scusate, state ancora leggendo? Cosa state aspettando a catapultarvi nello store e fare vostro questo capolavoro immortale?","timestamp_created":1655576549,"timestamp_updated":1655576549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519774019718170166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117194286","author":{"steamid":"76561199223142429","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":41,"playtime_at_review":376,"last_played":1660494799},"language":"english","review":"a\n","timestamp_created":1655576166,"timestamp_updated":1655576166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"117193273","author":{"steamid":"76561199127886619","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":72,"playtime_forever":293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":93,"last_played":1657905854},"language":"russian","review":"ЛЕГЕНДАРНАЯ
