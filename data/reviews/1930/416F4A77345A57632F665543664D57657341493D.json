Spiel ist richtig gut ABER die Bugs die die PC Version hat verderben einen den Spa√ü mit der Zeit daran, muss ich leider sagen.\nAlso Bugs wie: \n- man wird von bestimmten Monstern mit 1 Hit get√∂tet w√§hrend der Gro√üteil einfach l√§cherlich leicht ist (auf Schwierigkeit Normal) \n- Sequenzen startet das Game nicht von selbst, die musste ich mir selber aus dem Spieleordner raussuchen und da anschauen,\n- das Pferd wo man reitet ist unf√§hig einen leichten Berg rauf oder runter zu reiten, man sollte immer die Stra√üe benutzen\n- ab und zu, also echt ganz selten ist das Spiel abgest√ºrzt\nso das war die Bugaufz√§hlung, damit die Leute hier wissen worauf sie gefasst sein m√ºssen DENN,\n\neigt ist Two Worlds ein echt richtig geiles Spiel!\nEs ist zwar schon echt alt, aber der Hauptcharakter ist so gut geschrieben, dass zumindest ich immer mit den Antworten die er gesagt hat, mich schon fast gefreut habe, weil es genau das war wo ich mir dachte.\nDie Story ist eigt recht interessant, wenn man ihr richtig folgen k√∂nnte (siehe Bug mit den Sequenzen) und das K√§mpfen ist eigt auch ganz gut gemacht, daf√ºr dass das Spiel schon so alt ist.\nDas coolste am ganzen Game ist, dass man seine Ausr√ºstung fusionieren kann, also gleich mit gleichem und dann wirds st√§rker, also lohnt es sich auch endlich mal alle Gegner zu looten :)\nWas wiederum nicht so gut geklappt hat, waren eigt fast alle Zauber, ka warum aber die einzigen 2 Zauber die gute Arbeit geleistet haben waren der wo Untoten schaden zuf√ºgt und der andere wo man sich selbst St√§rke bufft.. zumindest um nicht mehr √úbergewicht zu haben, am DMG selbst hat das irwie nicht viel ge√§ndert.\n\nSo das war jetzt lange, hoffe das hilft ein paar weiter.","timestamp_created":1621758121,"timestamp_updated":1621758121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512987017631530762","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92325180","author":{"steamid":"76561199167938821","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1174,"last_played":1622755592},"language":"russian","review":"–ö–ª–∞—Å—Å–µ–∫–∞)–õ—É—á—à–∞—è

Unser namenloser Held l√§uft in Third-Person-Perspektive durch die riesige Welt, k√§mpfen gegen Tiere, Geisterwesen und Orks, gehen Missionen nach, reden mit Dorfbewohnern, gewinnen Erfahrung, leveln auf und looten, was das Zeug h√§lt.\n\nIn der Fantasy-Welt herrscht gerade Krieg zwischen den Orks und dem Rest der Welt. Unsere Schwester Kyra wird von einem mystischen Orden entf√ºhrt und wir machen uns auf den Weg, sie zu retten.\n\nInsbesondere das simple Loot-System kann wegen seiner Zug√§nglichkeit √ºberzeugen. Gleiche Waffen k√∂nnen wir zum Beispiel einfach im Inventar √ºbereinanderziehen und schon haben wir eine verst√§rkte Waffe.\n\nDas Kampfsystem ist f√ºr das Genre in Ordnung, wenn auch zu unkomplex. Grunds√§tzlich haben wir drei Angriffsm√∂glichkeiten. Wir k√∂nnen mit einer Schlag und Stichwaffe wie einem Schwert agieren, dem Fernkampf mit einem Bogen fr√∂nen oder uns auf Magie verlassen und so etwas wie Flammenb√§lle verschie√üen. Nat√ºrlich gibt es auch Lebens- und Manatr√§nke.\n\nDie Welt ist gro√ü und durchaus kreativ gef√ºllt. Allerdings k√∂nnen Story und Missionen nicht immer √ºberzeugen. Viele Aufgaben sind Standardged√∂ns. Immerhin machen die deutschen Sprecher im Gro√üen und Ganzen ihre Sache gut.\n\nAuch das Pacing ist etwas unausgeglichen. Sind wir zu Beginn ziemlich schwach und k√∂nnen schnell sterben, wenn wir auf die falschen Gegner treffen, sind wir sp√§ter so √ºberm√§chtig, da√ü die meisten K√§mpfe keinerlei Herausforderung mehr bieten.\n\nGrafisch ist das Game schon zu seiner Ver√∂ffentlichung bestenfalls Mittelma√ü gewesen. Die Animationen der Protagonisten sind insbesondere in den Cutscenes nicht wirklich √ºberzeugend. Daf√ºr hat man aber eine ziemlich gro√üe und sch√∂n gebaute Welt, in der man sich verlieren kann. Der Sound kann daf√ºr wirklich stimmungsvoll sein ebenso wie der Soundtrack wof√ºr der legend√§re Komponist Harold Faltermeyer (Axel F.) verantwortlich zeichnet.\n\nInsgesamt ist das Game ein guter und interessanter Vertreter seines Genres, der allerdings nichts wirklich anders oder besonders. Richtig gut und zug√§nglich ist das Level- und Lootsystem ausgefallen. Story, Kampfsystem und Technik kommen aber kaum √ºbers Mittelma√ü hinaus.\n\n[h1]Wertung:[/h1]\n7/10 Atmosph√§re\n7/10 Story\n6/10 Grafik\n7/10 Sound\n7/10 Spielmechanik\n6/10 Balancing\n7/10 Spielspass\n\n[h1]Fazit:[/h1]\nSolides Rollengespiele.\n\n[h1][b]7/10 Gesamtwertung","timestamp_created":1618516490,"timestamp_updated":1618516556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.672484338283538818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90334873","author":{"steamid":"76561199070056825","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":685,"last_played":1627836283},"language":"english","review":"Too good to pass up","timestamp_created":1618465707,"timestamp_updated":1618465707,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"90321795","author":{"steamid":"76561198172085779","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":619,"last_played":1620421320},"language":"german","review":"Ich finde das spiel immer noch super: Klar ist die Grafik etwas in die Jahre gekommen, aber wer spiele wie Gothic mag wird hier einen riesen Spa√ü haben .

somehow)\nGreat Integration of spell and swordwork - makes you feel a real person\nAnd despite other reviews the voice stuff is perfectly adequate - not perfect but functional\nLoved the fact that i could build the character as i wanted\nLoved the loot stacking to get better weapons\nLoved the huge array of monsters in the different biomes\nNegatives:\nI think they ran out of money before finishing it - the single japanese style city makes no sense whatsoever (why only one) - and their merchants didn't even sell katanas (one of the best swords in the game)\nthe 'bad?' ending was

I said, and meant it for a change.\n[i]~Robert Lynn Asprin[/i][/h1]\n\nAh, role-playing games from Germany... You know how it is about them. Most of the time, those are extremely ambitious, extremely clunky and, well, extremely buggy. And, well, this one is not an exception. Somewhat big open world, seven factions, two endings, multiplayer... And you know what? I can't say I even hated this one that much. Just because... I kinda like this kind of stuff. [i]Kinda[/i]. Can't say I [i]love[/i] such games, but you know... I totally don't mind one or two of those clunky [b]ARPG[/b]s from time to time. I mean, why freakin' not, right? Heck, I even finished games like [b]Dragon Riders: Chronicles of Pern[/b] and [b]Darkened Skye[/b]. So, yeah... I'm not afraid of clunky gameplay. I laugh in its face! I have finished [b]Falling Stars[/b]! On a bloody [b]PS2[/b]! I've reached the enlightenment! OK, OK, I'm shutting up now. [i]Anyway[/i], you've got the idea. I can totally deal with clunky stuff.\n\nUnfortunately... I still can't recommend [b]Two Worlds[/b]. But not because it's completely unplayable. Long story short, what we have here is a mix between [b]The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion[/b], [b]Gothic[/b] and [b]Sacred[/b]. There's literally nothing else to say. [b]Two Worlds[/b] looks like [b]Oblivion[/b] (up to the point where some parts of this game look like a cheap [b]Oblivion[/b] rip-off), it comes with [b]Gothic[/b]-like core mechanics and, well, there are vast empty spaces and horses from [b]Sacred[/b]. That's pretty much it. With multiplayer feeling more like a bunch of activities than the real deal. I mean, it felt... back when it was a thing. But I'll return to it a bit later. One way or another, if you don't mind clunky German [b]RPG[/b] with tons of stolen design (armor and [b]Imperial City[/b] from [b]Oblivion[/b], mages and their towers from [b]Gothic[/b], skeleton horses from [b]Sacred[/b], it's all here, just because [b]Reality Pump[/b] are [i]that[/i] lame)? I'd say, this game is somewhat playable. With one huge ‚Äúbut‚Äù. See, this game? It's f*ckin' broken.\n\nBelieve it or not, but even though in its current form the game is called ‚Äú[b]Epic Edition[/b]‚Äù, it's more like an epic failure. I mean... seriously. How many games you can recall, in which the first thing you'll need to do is to manually edit your [b]Windows[/b] registry? Well, that's how things work here. Go to the [b]Steam[/b] store page, see the promise of ‚Äúpartial gamepad support‚Äù, launch the game, notice how there's no gamepad option whatsoever and... well, press [b]Win+R[/b] to launch [b]RegEdit[/b]. Why did updated version of the game that comes with pretty fair gamepad support that even offers the rumble, needs you to manually enable it through [b]RegEdit[/b]? I don't freakin' know. And guess what? Things here will only get worse. The game will often crash for many different reasons (bugged [b]EAX[/b], bugged [b]PhysX[/b], bugged autosave feature, etc, etc, etc), the cutscenes won't play with no obvious reason whatsoever (in my case after I've beaten the final boss, the game just returned to the title screen), multiplayer is long dead... [i]what... the f*ck is going on here?![/i]\n\nSo... yeah. You liked things like [b]Divinity II: Ego Draconis[/b] (not to be confused with the [b]Original Sin[/b]) and don't mind something way less creative ([i]way[/i] less) and way more cheesy (the entire story in this game is just a random guy saving his sister from baddies and [i]man[/i], the acting here is almost as cheesy as in [b]Uwe Boll[/b]'s movies, [i]almost[/i])? Technically, there's a chance for you to enjoy [b]Two Worlds[/b]. If, of course, you'll be able to make it work. And that's, my friends, are a very big ‚Äúif‚Äù. And you know what? The experience this game offers? It just doesn't worth it.

I'm in no way saying this is a bad game, it's actually a wonderful game with quite a few flaws is all.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Open world exploration\n\n+ Freedom to do quests or exploring at your leisure\n\n+ Great soundtrack\n\n+ Beautiful environments and scenery\n\n+ Apparel/Weapon/Spell stacking system\n\n+ Enchanted weapons never run out of charge and can stack elements (to a degree)\n\nCons:\n\n- Unbalanced combat system\n\n- Awkward/Bad voice acting (some spoken dialogue doesn't even match what the text box displays) \n\n- Stiff/Janky dialogue animations\n\n- The player character comments out loud often when something happens, sometimes it's easy to just ignore it, but it can be annoying to some.\n\n- The main story is sub par at best, the side quests are MUCH more interesting\n\n- If you don't do all you want to do before completing the main story line, you'd better hope you have a previous save before beating it, otherwise you have to start a new game.\n\n- SPOILER: [spoiler] The main enemy of the game is easy to defeat, and it's very anti-climatic regardless of what side you choose. [/spoiler]\n\nDespite the flaws this game has, it holds a special place in my heart, as I first played it as a child when it first came out in 2007; at the age of 11.

You will also meet several species of dragons.\n\nAn unforgettable moment that quite annoyed me, when I just calmly stole inside the house and even though no one could see me through the closed door, the whole village fell on me that morning.. sometimes the inhabitants fell on me even when I was in them he just accidentally ran a horse.\nIn the final stages of the game and at a high level, I had to take revenge for this and kill literally the entire human population (feelings), but that's just my curious journey through this brilliant game.\nThe only thing I miss in this game are the achievements.

this 10 years after the fact and I have several things to say about it.\n\nOverall: It's a solid, playable game. It doesn't have as much of the glitchyness that you associate with open-world games, which is great. Also, all the old-timey nay's and mayhap's are equal parts corny and charming.\n\nStory: The story is a little convoluted with a lot of pseudo-European fantasy names making it a little difficult to parse out the different characters and factions. The plot is ultimately not anything exciting, but it's simple, manageable and at least cohesive enough to get you from one act to the next - even if you're not entirely sure of what you're supposed to be doing or why. One thing that kind of gets old is having to travel around the map just to have conversations with people who tell you to travel somewhere else to have a conversation with other people, and so on and so on. Most of the fighting you do is simply from your character trying to get from one point to another and encountering gangs of mobs outside of story missions.\n\nGameplay: The *combat is a little sluggish and finicky, but ultimately not game-breaking. Progression is a combination of stat and skill leveling on a point-based system that feels pretty intuitive. Inventory management is alright - it's a mix of both physical capacity and weight limits so prepare to do a lot of trips if you're a compulsive looter. I found that you have a tendency to accumulate a lot of unnecessary items especially if you are dabbling in the crafting/brewing system. There's a lot of fast travel available for getting around the map and there are absolutely no penalties at all for dying, it seems. There's a hot-key system where you access your magic, items, and skills. It works, which is the most important thing. There's limited character customization - you play as a medieval white european dude (pick from a few hairstyles, skin tones, change how buff you are and also how long-short your arms and legs are LOL).\n\n*Mounted combat is a thing you can do, which is cool, but it sucks. Controlling a horse/mount is a task in itself and trying to manage the timing, distance, direction of a swing from horseback feels like a one in a hundred chance. It makes combat encounters tedious, boring, and long, which is bad when you take into account how many fights you get into on the road (it's like a bear, wolf pack, wyverns, groms, and bandits every 500 feet, 100% no joke).\n\nGraphics: It's a late 2000s game, so don't expect much. The environments are large, a little bland, \n\nAudio: I was surprised that the game has a pretty kick-ass soundtrack. At least for me, I like games where the BGM doesn't just fade into nebulous white noise that puts you to sleep (*cough*oblivion*cough*). Also, holy crap, everything is voice acted. Sure, there are only a handful of voices, and the acting is really bad, but it's better than most.\n\nNitpicks: The dialogue scenes are super lore-dense and there's no way you'll remember who is who or did what among the sheer number of similar-sounding names. I literally glaze over during dialogue scenes despite legitimately wanting to understand the nuances of what's happening. It is a cool touch that almost all generic NPCs have names, but becomes tedious if you have to track down a specific person who shares a character model with hundreds of other NPCs in the world.\n\nContinuity can be broken in some instances especially when there are intersecting quests and whatnot - which basically means you start over, not that you would.\n\nImpressions: Overall, it's a playable game. It's a little janky if you're on Mac, but it comes with a WINE workaround assuming you haven't upgraded past compatibility. I personally find it fun and pretty mindless. I still don't know who anybody is or who any of the factions are or what they stand for, but I hear about them a lot from the NPCs. If you want a basic-ass game to play and kill time, you can work through it at a decent pace if you don't get too bogged down in the side quests.\n\nRecommendation: If you just want a game to play with not a lot of frills, this is as good as any. If you're looking for a super story-rich game with a lot of immersion, beautiful graphics, characters you are emotionally invested in, agency and decisionmaking that matters, definitely skip. It's not that game. It IS however, what you would expect from an XBOX game (yes, the first-gen one). Is it worth the money now? Probably not, but if you're seriously considering buying it to play, then I'd say you can afford it. Otherwise, get it on sale. If you're looking to get this because of multiplayer, don't.\n\nAll I can say is that for a 2007 release, it's not bad.","timestamp_created":1608081172,"timestamp_updated":1608081183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502839148044586182","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82285134","author":{"steamid":"76561198073677073","num_games_owned":728,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":5113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5113,"last_played":1607880086},"language":"spanish","review":"Excelente

crooked animations, presence of \"Gothic-style wood\" everywhere and other flaws, [b] this low-budget Polish Action RPG from 2007 [/b] is surprisingly playable for me if we focus on the exploration of the world, character development of our hero and we will not be using a few exploits found in the game such as the mentioned before completing the game by killing the main boss at the beginning.\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n+ Great soundtrack\n+ Very good character development system: traps, poisons, extensive magic system (the ability to strengthen spells, one of the best summoner magic systems in Action RPGs)\n+ Interesting inventory system: the ability to combine items to obtain their enhanced versions\n+ Good alchemy system, similar to the one in Skyrim (with the additional ability to create potions that increase character stats permanently)\n+ The general atmosphere of the game, supported by a great soundtrack (during exploration of the world outside combat, I recommend to use TAB button to switch to the First Person Camera)\n+ Models and animations aside, graphics such as landscapes and forests are still looking good and better than TES Oblivion\n+ In my opinion, the UI is much better than in Two Worlds 2\n\n[b] It could be better: [/b]\n+ - The main story is not the worst, but it is too short, some side quests are typical fetchquests.\n+ - The lore of the presented world is interesting, but not sufficiently developed\n+ - Melee combat system is average (plays better when you use dodge - default Q and E on the keyboard)\n+- Voice acting could be better (except main hero, he is quite good in my opinion) but I've seen worse in other titles\n\n[b] Cons[/b]\n- Animations and general clunkiness\n- Repetitive NPC faces (low budget effect)\n- Few bugs and exploits to use\n\nTwo Worlds 1 is not a title in which you should rush the main storyline, but rather you should focus on the exploration of the game world and developing your character.

Wer √ºber kleinere M√§ngel hinwegsehen kann, wird mit dem Spiel viel Spa√ü haben.","timestamp_created":1606426398,"timestamp_updated":1606426398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80265148","author":{"steamid":"76561198860399853","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1072,"last_played":1606740094},"language":"russian","review":"–æ–æ","timestamp_created":1606391455,"timestamp_updated":1606391455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79809543","author":{"steamid":"76561197996273719","num_games_owned":985,"num_reviews":710,"playtime_forever":346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":222,"last_played":1606381368},"language":"english","review":"[h1] Information / Review English [/h1]\n\nTwo Worlds Epic Edition is a classic role-playing game developed by Reality Pump Studios.\n\n[h1] Gameplay / Story [/h1]\n\nYou take on the role of a nameless young bounty hunter whose sister Kira was kidnapped by a villain named Reist. After months of searching in vain, the hero is contacted by Reist Tungard. For the release of his sister, he is supposed to search for five parts of a relic with which the god of war Aziraal can be freed. So the hero gets right in the middle of the power struggle between long-forgotten gods. In the huge world of Antaloor, the hero now has to solve many different tasks that develop his character or serve the main storyline liberation of the sister.\n\nThe search for the five parts of the amulet leads the hero from the glacier areas high in the north to the desert and volcanic areas deep in the south across the world of Antaloor. In the center of the country lies the imperial capital Cathalon on the banks of the river Gon, which runs through Antaloor from the northeast to the southwest. The world is about 60 km¬≤ in size (35 km¬≤ upper world, 25 km¬≤ underworld) and is home to five large cities and more than 50 villages as well as numerous caves and other hidden places\n\nAt the beginning of the game you have a level 0 bounty hunter who, however, already has certain combat skills. These need to be expanded and new ones learned. In the hero's interface you can see the personal development area on the left, where you can distribute the 5 points you get per level-up in life, strength, skill or willpower. On the right are the various skills where you have to decide in which direction you develop your character (e.g. close-range fighter, long-range fighter, ...). Not all skills are available to upgrade at the beginning. However, the hero can learn these additional skills (combat skills, magic, special tricks, etc.) from teachers in the villages and towns for a fee. What is new here is that there are so-called soul masters in the game who return incorrectly set skill points for a fee. Skill points are obtained for solving quests, for special combat attacks, skillfully opening locks, etc.\n\nThe game has certain peculiarities. Objects such as armor and swords do not appear multiple times in the inventory, but can be stacked. They receive a randomly generated upgrade. Another idea are the so-called \"dirty tricks\". These \"unfair\" methods affect the opponent in combat, e.g. B. sand can be put in his eyes. In addition, every action that the hero takes has an effect on the course of the game. For example, some quests cannot be solved if the hero chooses to cooperate with one or the other party.\n\nWith the magic system, the hero can put up to three magic cards in an amulet and then cast these spells. This means that the hero collects magic cards from the five magical schools of magic in the course of the game and, after learning, can freely decide which magic card to use for which task. Furthermore, each spell can be upgraded with a maximum of three so-called \"boosters\", for example to reduce mana consumption or to increase the effectiveness of a spell.\n\nAnother special feature is the alchemy system. The player can freely put together up to five different ingredients to make potions or traps.\n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ interesting story\n+ wonderful landscapes\n+ intuitive combat system\n+ living flora and fauna\n+ countless weapons & armor\n+ Diary\n+ comfortable teleport system\n+ Villagers tell about your deeds\n+ Trading cards\n\n[h1] Contra [/h1]\n\n- lots of little bugs around\n- mixed soundtrack\n- the opponent's AI is terrible at times\n- stubborn horse control\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nTwo Worlds Epic Edition offers you a great role-playing game with minor mistakes. Clear purchase recommendation f\n\n\n[h1] Information / Review Deutsch [/h1]\n\nTwo Worlds Epic Edition ist ein klassisches Rollenspiel, welches von Reality Pump Studios entwickelt wurde. \n\n[h1] Gameplay / Geschichte [/h1]\n\nDu schl√ºpfst in die Rolle eines namenlosen jungen Kopfgeldj√§gers, dessen Schwester Kira von einem B√∂sewicht namens Reist entf√ºhrt wurde. Nach monatelanger vergeblicher Suche wird der Held von Reist Tungard kontaktiert. F√ºr die Freilassung seiner Schwester soll er f√ºnf Teile eines Relikts suchen, mit dessen Hilfe der Kriegsgott Aziraal befreit werden kann. So ger√§t der Held mitten hinein in den Machtkampf zwischen l√§ngst vergessenen G√∂ttern. In der riesigen Welt Antaloor muss der Held nun viele verschiedene Aufgaben l√∂sen, die seinen Charakter weiterentwickeln oder dem Haupthandlungsstrang Befreiung der Schwester dienen.\n\nDie Suche nach den f√ºnf Teilen des Amulettes f√ºhrt den Helden von den Gletschergebieten hoch im Norden bis zu den W√ºsten- und Vulkangebieten tief im S√ºden quer durch die Welt von Antaloor. Im Zentrum des Landes liegt die kaiserliche Hauptstadt Cathalon am Ufer des Flusses Gon, der Antaloor vom Nordosten bis zum S√ºdwesten durchzieht. Die Welt ist etwa 60 km¬≤ gro√ü (35 km¬≤ Oberwelt, 25 km¬≤ Unterwelt) und beherbergt f√ºnf gro√üe St√§dte und mehr als 50 D√∂rfer sowie zahlreiche H√∂hlen und andere versteckte Orte\n\nZu Beginn des Spiels hat man einen Kopfgeldj√§ger auf Level 0, der allerdings bereits gewisse Kampff√§higkeiten besitzt. Diese gilt es auszubauen und neue zu erlernen. Im Interface des Helden ist links der pers√∂nliche Entwicklungsbereich zu sehen, in den man die 5 Punkte, die man pro Level-Up bekommt, in Leben, St√§rke, Geschick oder Willenskraft verteilen kann. Rechts befindet sich die verschiedenen F√§higkeiten, bei denen man sich entscheiden muss, in welche Richtung man seinen Charakter entwickelt (z. B. Nahk√§mpfer, Fernk√§mpfer, ‚Ä¶). Zu Beginn stehen nicht alle F√§higkeiten zum Ausbau zur Verf√ºgung. Der Held kann aber gegen Bezahlung bei Lehrmeistern in den D√∂rfern und St√§dten diese zus√§tzlichen F√§higkeiten erlernen (Kampffertigkeiten, Magie, spezielle Tricks etc.). Neu hierbei ist, dass es sogenannte Seelenmeister im Spiel gibt, die einem falsch gesetzte F√§higkeitenpunkte gegen Bezahlung wieder zur√ºckgeben. F√§higkeitenpunkte bekommt man f√ºr das L√∂sen von Quests, f√ºr besondere Kampfattacken, das geschickte √ñffnen von Schl√∂ssern etc.\n\nDas Spiel weist gewisse Besonderheiten auf. So erscheinen Gegenst√§nde wie etwa R√ºstungen und Schwerter nicht mehrere Male im Inventar, sondern lassen sich stapeln. Dabei erhalten sie eine zufallsgenerierte Aufwertung. Eine andere Idee sind die so genannten ‚ÄûDirty Tricks‚Äú. Diese ‚Äûunfairen‚Äú Methoden beeintr√§chtigen den Gegner im Kampf, z.‚ÄâB. kann ihm Sand in die Augen gestreut werden. Dar√ºber hinaus hat jede Aktion, die der Held vollzieht, eine Auswirkung auf den Spielverlauf. Einige Quests k√∂nnen beispielsweise nicht gel√∂st werden, wenn der Held sich f√ºr Zusammenarbeit mit der einen oder anderen Partei entscheidet.\n\nBeim Magiesystem kann der Held bis zu drei Zauberkarten in ein Amulett legen und diese Zauberspr√ºche dann ausf√ºhren. Das hei√üt, der Held sammelt im Laufe des Spiels Magiekarten der f√ºnf magischen Zauberschulen und kann nach Erlernen frei entscheiden, welche Zauberkarte er f√ºr welche Aufgabe benutzen m√∂chte. Des Weiteren l√§sst sich jeder Zauber durch maximal drei sogenannte ‚ÄûBooster‚Äú aufwerten um bspw. den Manaverbrauch zu senken oder den Wirkungsgrad eines Zaubers zu erh√∂hen.\n\nEine weitere Besonderheit stellt das Alchemie-System dar. Der Spieler kann hierbei bis zu f√ºnf unterschiedliche Zutaten frei zusammenstellen um daraus Tr√§nke oder Fallen herzustellen. \n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ interessante Story\n+ wunderbare Landschaften\n+ intuitives Kampfsystem\n+ lebendige Flora und Fauna\n+ zahllose Waffen & R√ºstungen\n+ Tagebuch\n+ komfortables Teleportsystem\n+ Dorfbewohner erz√§hlen √ºber deine Taten\n+ Trading Cards\n\n[h1] Kontra [/h1]\n\n- viele kleiner Bugs im Umlauf\n- durchwachsener Soundtrack\n- die KI des Gegners ist manchmal schrecklich\n- st√∂rrische Pferdesteuerung\n\n[h1] Fazit [/h1]\n\nTwo Worlds Epic Edition bietet dir ein gro√üartiges Rollenspiel mit kleineren Fehlern. Klare Kaufempfehlung f√ºr RPG Fans.","timestamp_created":1606323523,"timestamp_updated":1606323523,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.737305819988250732","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79797456","author":{"steamid":"76561198039226330","num_games_owned":1773,"num_reviews":112,"playtime_forever":141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":141,"last_played":1585338101},"language":"koreana","review":"Ï§ëÏÑ∏ ÌåêÌÉÄÏßÄ ÏõåÎ¶¨Ïñ¥Î•º ÍøàÍæ∏ÏãúÎÇòÏöî?
