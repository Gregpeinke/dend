Uno dei giochi più belli che abbia mai giocato.\nTecnicamente è eccellente (è un gioco del 2011 e come tale non deve essere paragonato a quelli usciti di recente), con effetti sonori e doppiaggo di alta qualità. Il gioco è vario e rifinito in ogni suo aspetto: i personaggi sono molto ben caratterizzati, i livelli sono studiati per non far mai annoiare il giocatore (con una difficoltà che aumenta sempre di più) e le ambientazioni sono favolose. Una piccola nota dolente sta nella seconda parte del gioco in cui c'è stata una cura e una rifinitura minore rispetto alla prima parte, ma questo non intralcia l'immensità e la bellezza di uno dei puzzle game più belli mai creati.","timestamp_created":1450890999,"timestamp_updated":1450891101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19878842","author":{"steamid":"76561198217576035","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":611,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":611,"last_played":1450885052},"language":"schinese","review":"先摘录一段评测：\n\n“你能想象，一个主角全程不说话，有且只有一个机器人为数不多的台词，玩法是3D版推箱子的游戏，斩获无数奖项，其中甚至还包括一个年度剧情大奖吗？”\n\n玩之前我也不信，玩通以后我信了，这是在《生化奇兵：无限》之后第二款一口气通关的游戏了，还是连着两作。\n\n    这款游戏真的很难去安利，因为你无法通过任何的语言描述和图片去体现它的魅力，论核心玩法，主角只是一个拿着一把传送门枪的普通人类，游戏中没有花样繁多的装备，技能和敌人，只有大到空洞的场景和机器人机械的声音。打开两扇门，从一边走到另一边，仅此而已。\n\n    但是，它带给你的惊喜却数不胜数，当你发现通过动量守恒可以让你快速地穿过障碍时，当你发现你开的两座门可以成为武器轻松的消灭拦在路上的炮塔时，当你发现这个解谜游戏居然还有BOSS站，而击溃BOSS的方式依然是你手上那把能打开两座门的枪，你就可以体会这个游戏真正出彩之处在哪里了，正如ip6s的宣传语，“一处不同，正是处处不同”。利用一把枪，结合场景中所有你可以利用的东西，这把枪可以成为武器，可以成为桥梁，可以成为跳板，可以成为道路，甚至可以成为推进器。\n\n   仅仅是将一个解谜游戏从2D做成3D，是没办法让这款游戏达到如此高度的，而除了那把枪，游戏的剧情表现也是非常值得称道，人工智能的话题在影视剧和游戏中已经被讨论了无数次，然而这款游戏的表现形式却十分特别，和大部分大型游戏不同，借助解谜游戏的慢节奏，传送门利用的是沉浸式的剧情体验，而不是长长的过场动画和不同角色的互动对白。游戏中的剧情线，隐藏在BOSS机器人看似毫无感情的旁白中，隐藏在墙壁上的涂鸦挂画中，隐藏在场景不断的变化中。这在第一部表现的尤其惊艳，当Glados的语气从毫无感情变得充满不耐烦，当场景从光鲜而充满科技感的光圈科技实验室变成破旧的老式实验室，就会慢慢的感受到剧情的真意。\n","timestamp_created":1450889010,"timestamp_updated":1450889010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19878626","author":{"steamid":"76561198200787251","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":170,"last_played":1483983632},"language":"tchinese","review":"so good so cool so nice so portal!!!","timestamp_created":1450888536,"timestamp_updated":1450888536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19878425","author":{"steamid":"76561198241932820","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":36,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1450980224},"language":"hungarian","review":"GREAT LOGISTIK GAME!","timestamp_created":1450888207,"timestamp_updated":1450888207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19878016","author":{"steamid":"76561198114839452","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":457,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":313,"last_played":1450679578},"language":"english","review":"I wish i could have gladdos :D","timestamp_created":1450887408,"timestamp_updated":1485275997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19876991","author":{"steamid":"76561198100825845","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":491,"last_played":1585332837},"language":"tchinese","review":"為什麼要買?\n1.便宜又大碗，可以玩很久\n2.人家可是V社出品的遊戲欸\n3.有其他人做的模組，玩到腦袋短路\n4.多人模式可以跟朋友耍智障\n5.支援工作坊，耐玩度多10倍\n6.劇情一流，因為人家可是V社好嗎\n\n硬是要說缺點\n那就是他沒出三代:c","timestamp_created":1450885390,"timestamp_updated":1450885390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19876152","author":{"steamid":"76561198212358792","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":514,"last_played":1522165228},"language":"finnish","review":"Erinomainen tarina, joka osaa yllättää.

para mi gusto tiene muchas cosas que me hacen amarlo mucho\n\nPrimero que nada empezemos por la historia, la historia de Portal para un principiante puede ser bastante mala ¿Porqué? porque no saben qué sucede realmente.....\nSi eres un jugador de juegos a nivel intermedio, tienes que tener en cuenta lo que son los Easter Eggs...bueno si es así, de eso estoy hablando, los Easter Eggs le ponen el misterio y el Hype entero a este juego para que comienzes a disfrutarlo como un drogadicto....\nPara saber el rollo de la historia comprate el Portal 1 y 2 y empieza desde el 1, probablemente dirás que el portal 1 es muy aburrido o no tiene la emoción de un juego divertido, pues te diré una cosa y es que por más aburrido que lo notes esucha lo que te diré:\nsi eres una persona muy dedicada o curiosa en los juegos, estos titulos tienen muchos Easter Eggs y cosas ocultas para que te entretengas muchisimo más, y a medida de que escuches y veas todo te darás cuenta que hay una historia bastante extensa e interesante, ya cuando investigues todo tendrás la sensación de que te falta algo, piezas de la historia que están perdidas, pues eso es el \"Continuará\" de esta saga.\n\nLa Segunda cosa que me agrada de Portal son los Puzzles, Los Puzzles en Portal son la caracteristica más notable del juego y es que estás jugando con algo ficticio que tiene su logica y mientrás las estás descubriendo entras en un shock mental de la fisica bastante increible que hasta te puedes preguntar \"¿Qué se fumaron los cabrones de Valve?\"\nEstás jugando con una Pistola De Portales, un particular objeto que te acompañará durante todo el juego y que su función es como su nombre lo indica:\nun arma que es Capas de Crear Agujeros que te teletransportan según donde los coloques y de solo pensar que estarías haciendo con esa Pistola de Portales si existiera, te echarás a carcajadas.....ahora de este sistema de Puzzle Viene lo interesante...\nsi es una Pistola que coloca portales donde tu plazcas y usarlas para teletransportarte, esto genera muchas cosas, miras un callejón largo y con solo poner portales aquí y allá te ahorras una caminata, o bien imaginate un lugar inalcanzable de llegar pero con crear portales te ríes de las leyes de la fisica.\n\nEste Portal 2 tiene algo muy grande y es el modo cooperativo, ya sea en Splitscreen o en linea, puedes jugar con tus amigos y conquistar los puzzles de Aperture Science o bien matar o jugar concientemente a tu amigo para joderle la paciencia, pero claro, el también puede hacerlo...\n\ny lo más novedoso del Portal 2\nEl Editor de Niveles: Portal 2 ha integrado un editor de niveles y claro que en el Portal 1 también se puede (pero a exepción de tener que usar algún tipo de programa) pero este Portal ya lo tiene integrado, puedes poner lo que a tu retorcida y macabra mente se le ocurra para subirlo a la Workshop y ver como la gente se desmorona de la panciencia con solo jugar tu dificultoso y extenso nivel y si eres una persona que en resumidas palabras \"Creatividad = 0\" tampoco es nesesario que crees niveles, mejor que eso puedes jugar los niveles de la gente para viciarte unas Horitas más.","timestamp_created":1450868744,"timestamp_updated":1450868744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19868825","author":{"steamid":"76561198141011992","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":875,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":107,"last_played":1657310771},"language":"russian","review":"Поистине
