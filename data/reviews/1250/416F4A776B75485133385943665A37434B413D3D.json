Floor is an awesome FPS zombie title that, at a first glance may be deemed as a \"Call of Duty rip-off\" but when one actually plays it and takes a closer look, one sees that they are immediately comparing apples and oranges. The game is extremely fast paced and offers a much different style of playing zombie survival by actually having a definitive end point to the game. There is a limit to the amount of waves, and the zombies do not gain health as the waves increase. Instead, the game sends various types of zombies and as the waves get higher the harder more difficult zombies get released into the game as well. The co-op zombie shooter also forces you to work together rather than work alone as in most cases attempting to survive rounds solo will only end in your own demise. The shooting mechanics are awesome as well, as they feel more realistic and closer to how one would actually hold weapons and also gives a nice variety of weapons, along with classes or \"perks\" as they are called, which give bonuses to various actions depending on which perk one chooses. As for the cons to the game, I would say the biggest con is the Steam Workshop. When I say this, I mean that the game is extremely glitchy with downloading your subscribed items and many times you run into hassles with getting them to work. If they could better integrate the Workshop into the game, I would give a 9.5/10, but instead, I think this game is a solid 8.5/10 for all that it's worth.","timestamp_created":1403415340,"timestamp_updated":1403415340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10648520","author":{"steamid":"76561197984012833","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":382,"last_played":1403656221},"language":"english","review":"Gets the job done","timestamp_created":1403414138,"timestamp_updated":1403414138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10648482","author":{"steamid":"76561197972166917","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1130,"last_played":1373229850},"language":"english","review":"Definatly a fun game, using class combos and twitch shooter action to battle your ways through hordes of the undead/mutants I would recommend this to anyone who loves fps games and zombie games.","timestamp_created":1403414045,"timestamp_updated":1403414045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10647583","author":{"steamid":"76561197999294734","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4412,"last_played":1415688329},"language":"english","review":"Well, I have to say, if you enjoy shooting zombies this game is definitely up your alley.\n\nTo play on the harder difficulties you'll need to level up various in game classes that give you better perks.\nThis gets pretty grindy at times, but if you don't want to grind just play lower difficulties!","timestamp_created":1403411788,"timestamp_updated":1403411788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10646073","author":{"steamid":"76561198079098063","num_games_owned":326,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2039,"last_played":1590141069},"language":"japanese","review":"so good game !!","timestamp_created":1403408062,"timestamp_updated":1511623828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10645483","author":{"steamid":"76561198048494948","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1621,"last_played":1486188855},"language":"english","review":"kill them all with the golden katana","timestamp_created":1403406720,"timestamp_updated":1403406720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10645481","author":{"steamid":"76561198020492748","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7289,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6753,"last_played":1501973215},"language":"german","review":"Im Sale definitiv kein Fehlkauf.\n\nGrafik ist recht matschig und nicht gerade ein Augenschmauß für Grafikverwöhnte, das Gameplay ist wie man es sich von einem Rundenbasierten Survival Horrorgame vorstellt, auf höheren Schwierigkeitsgraden bietet das Spiel sogar große Herausforderung und erfordert Teamplay.\n\nWer ein Fan davon ist mit Freunden zusammen eine große Horde Zombies wegzumetzeln und nicht all zu kritisch mit leicht matschiger Grafik und etwas monotonem Gameplay zurecht kommt - Für den ist Killing Floor definitiv ein Kauf wert!","timestamp_created":1403406717,"timestamp_updated":1403406717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10645063","author":{"steamid":"76561198008681367","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":18884,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12926,"last_played":1448225100},"language":"english","review":"I played this game ages ago, and recently picked it back up.

If someone dies you can snake his pistol from his grips for some dual wielding goodness or if you survive long enough some broad will sell you equipment you can only afford after wave 8/10. Jesus don't die either or it will set you back another 3 waves waiting to get that long awaited grenade launcher.\n\nThankfully it's a moddable game! You won't even need to buy any of the DLCS unless you want a skin.\n\nIn this survival horror fps you must work together or expect to be raped by super mutants. You can weld doors to protect Team Killjoy from the onslaught of rabid mutants or drop a couple of mines to make for a messy situation. But expect that 12 foot tall mutant go through a half dozen of those or 200 rounds before eating lawn clippings. Or don't, like me? Everytime dangit. Try not to die or you may find yourself waiting 10 minutes for all the monsters to be cleared out, team work is the key!\n\nSince it is a modded game you will need to find a modded server to play this game to it's fullest potental; which is easily done  with a few keystokes over google. In these servers you will find no aspect of the game hindered by Tripwire, which makes for some interesting content and months? of playtime.\n\nI recommend this game because it is just so darn much fun and I paid 5.00 bucks for it, it will provide me with endless amounts of enjoyment. Killing Floor is due for release in mid 2014, however I do not believe the devs will make it as moddable as it is now because they lost a ton of money on content. Who doesn't like a coop game?

For being a 10 round survival game, one would think it would get old after a few bouts but this cannot be farther from the truth. The amount of teamwork that is called upon to complete the 10 rounds ( plus boss) is unlike most co op games. The random people you often play with and their playing styles keep the game fresh (plus the many perks and guns). There is also a great community on the servers. There aren't many people who die to screw you. Its more like they die becuase 20+ zeds maul them. One of the biggest positives of this game is that they continue to come out with new maps and guns a few times a year (yes this review is in 2014). The maps are given free and the guns and characters are for purchased DLC. \n\nOverall, this game is a must have just to experience what true gaming teamwork is.
