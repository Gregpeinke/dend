Still excellent though, some of the best atmosphere and story in any FPS ever, even if the last hour sucks. Definitely feels a little unfair in the second half as well with the soldiers that constantly ambush you and the aliens that spawn in with zero indications to prepare you for them. Valve definitely learned their lesson with Half-Life 2, and I still think 2 is the far superior game, but this still has its moments that shine above the flaws. Definitely better than Black Mesa though, and the speed-running capability + abundance of mods for the game are sure to keep you coming back for more. Has definitely aged in a few areas, but still very fun and very satisfying to play through today.","timestamp_created":1616392083,"timestamp_updated":1616392083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88868657","author":{"steamid":"76561198260718186","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":3376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3149,"last_played":1655562989},"language":"english","review":"MY.

have a complicated relationship with this game. I first played it years ago and only got a few hours in thanks to my frustration with it and, honestly, the desire to play anything else. After trying to get back into it an embarrassing amount of times since that first encounter - Half-Life's historical value was enough to keep me going, but only for a while - I finally hunkered down and played through the game start to finish. And... yes, I see why people love this game. I am now on the Half-Life 3 hype train.\nIf you are interested in the series at all, I recommend you start with this original version of this first game like I did. Yes, play the game as it was in 1998, not through Black Mesa and NOT through Half-Life Source. The graphics are dated, but most other things either haven't aged a day (like the sound, level design, and \"feel\") or haven't yet been fixed in newer versions (mainly, some agonizing combat sections). Again, Half-Life is important piece in history that is worth seeing in its original format, non-HD textures and all. Once you have a good baseline for the series, go ahead and enjoy Source and Black Mesa. But make sure you experience this game in all of its old-school glory.\nBut back to my story. When I first tried to get into Half-Life nearly four years ago, I had almost no experience with first person shooters. Nowadays, I do have games to compare Half-Life to, for better and for worse. I see how the Halo was inspired by the AI and level design of Half-Life and how 90's twitch shooters inspired the movement and arsenal of Half-Life. These comparisons made me appreciate the game, though they also made me wish for the Halo sandbox and the fast pace of the modern Doom titles. So, duh: Half-Life feels old. That's not a revelation, but it is worth saying because I made the mistake of playing Half-Life like it was Doom or Halo.\nIt wasn't until I beat the game and watched a couple videos about it that I learned that I might have been playing Half-Life wrong. Again, the reason I kept falling off of this game was because I just wanted it to be more like Far Cry 4. I was and still am frustrated with turrets that kill you in seconds, the incredible movement speed that makes platforming more than tedious, and the onslaught of aliens that keep me up at night. Those things are still problems, but if you take a second and plan out your encounters before going in guns-blazing, you might die a few million times less. Half-Life is all about tactics, not mindlessness. I was playing with the assumption that I had to think and shoot at the same time, but things work out a lot better if you think first and only then execute your 10th level plan. So while I personally hate to say that there is any \"right way\" to play a game, I believe there is with Half-Life. And I don't like that about Half-Life. Sure, you can technically get your way through the game playing like Master Chief, but let's just say that you won't have nearly as much fun as you would when playing like Gordon Freeman.\nBut all of this is to say that yes, you should play Half-Life. At the end of the say, it's awesome. It's frustrating, somewhat-dated awesomeness with a fantastic story that is fantastically told. You just might have to have some patience to supplement the awesomeness. Hope you like it!\n#FreeFreeman","timestamp_created":1616221995,"timestamp_updated":1616221995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88746875","author":{"steamid":"76561199019927126","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":1219,"last_played":1659815409},"language":"english","review":"Amazing Debut, good game","timestamp_created":1616218538,"timestamp_updated":1616218538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88746618","author":{"steamid":"76561198407520266","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":78,"playtime_forever":678,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":678,"last_played":1607563860},"language":"english","review":"the game itself is not very fun and pretty hard at some points, but it's a really cool piece of history in video games that, through playing it, makes you realize how much it has influenced so many games","timestamp_created":1616218074,"timestamp_updated":1616218074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"88745235","author":{"steamid":"76561198434876249","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1643614025},"language":"english","review":"i was pretty good","timestamp_created":1616215586,"timestamp_updated":1616215586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzZb9pvgCc9HE0gI="}
