Gordon Freeman is fully subjected to fate, the world is a completely linear path from which he cannot deviate and everything feels scripted. There is no incentive to discover the environment in this game, as there are also no documents with story clues around. Freeman's mouth is sealed and he has no agency nor is there a clue what city 17 is. The game wastes a lot of time with long and cumbersome passages from one meaningless place to another, instead of developing a thrilling story. \n\nFor a FPS the gunplay is horrendous, only the revolver is a good gun, maybe that's a part of the \"horror\" game. The combines are interesting enemies, but the gunfights are still boring. The physics seem to be the only good part of the game and I advise Gordon Freeman to stick with theoretical physics, instead of surrendering to

Познакомился я сначала с Portal, потом с Portal 2.\nШикарный левел-дизайн и харизматичная GLaDOS с её остроумными комментариями захватили меня быстро и убедили в шедевральности игры и в надежности разработчиков.\nИ с теми же ожиданиями я купил HL2. Я ожидал харизматичных персонажей с запоминающимся цитатами, я ожидал шикарные уровни, на которые будет интересно полюбоваться. Я ожидал, в конце концов, историю, в которую я бы мог погрузиться. Первую часть я прошел, и я ей простил немного скудный сюжет и местами плохой левел-дизайн (не забуду ту мусорную свалку, на которой я кругами плутал), которые скомпенсировались вполне интересной второй половиной, в которой мы были в мире Зен и скидкой на возраст игры и на то. что это была первая игра в серии. И мои ожидания от второй части были такие: ну сейчас выстрелят просто, бомба будет.\nСпустя семь часов я уже просто заставляю себя силой доиграть в эту игру. Потому что ну невозможно так строить игру. Нельзя так делать просто. Персонажи цепляют лишь на мгновение, но это мгновение перекрывается бесконечной беготней из пункта А в пункт Б. Не говорю, что это плохо. Просто эта беготня должна быть веселой. Но я вижу чаще всего недружелюбную и депрессивную обстановку. И иногда левел-дизайн просто сводит с ума и заставляет желать сломать руки тому, кто уровни строил - иногда просто довольно сложно понять, куда двигаться вообще - игрок никогда не должен задаваться подобными вопросами. Допустимо лишь застревание на минуту-другую в попытке восстановить в памяти построение уровня и быстрое нахождение выхода. В Portal подобной проблемы не было - уважение тем, кто строил их уровни. Эта игра содержала головоломки, но не запутывала в пространстве никогда. В HL я запутывался, как минимум, три-четыре раза за семь часов. Это значит, что в течение полтора часа я мог застрять один раз. И это в игре, прохождение которой занимает, около 15 часов. Недопустимо, господа присяжные заседатели!\nГоворят Рейвенхольм был крутой миссией, я же скажу - к черту того, кто решил поставить на уровне поиск рычага, передвигающего платформу и поиск пути к этой платформе, во время того, как чертовы хэдкрабы атакуют беспрерывно. Это испортило мне настроение и я хотел просто поскорее убраться оттуда.\nИстория не цепляет от слова вообще. И это спустя семь часов. Ну как так-то а, я не из тех, кто многого требует от хорошей истории: завязка, кульминация, развязка, мотивация главного героя и окружающих его персонажей. Мотивация Фримана же... а какая у него мотивация? Верно, мы играем за бревно. Точнее, капсулу с руками. Даже в Portal это не было заметно в отношении Челл, потому что все тащила на себе GLaDOS. В HL никто не тащит на себе сюжет. Аликс? Ну, очаровательная девушка, появляется то тут, то там. Но я не привязываюсь к ней. Почему? Да потому что большую часть игры я просто один. А она появляется эпизодами, не более. И интересные сценки не тащат на себе игру, они лишь сглаживают общее негативное впечатление от игры.\n\nМожет быть, в свое время игра была шедевром из-за технических и геймдизайнерских решений. Но сейчас эти решения не являются новаторскими. Все то, за что хвалят HL, есть уже в каждой стоящей игре. Физика? А я для физики в игры играю? Я историю хочу хорошую. Физика лишь развлекает, но, как и любое другое развлечение - оно надоедает.\n\nВ итоге я скажу: Half Life уже устарела, как игра. Она останется лишь в позиции первопроходца, но это не делает её культовой. Потому что запоминается сильнее всего нарративная составляющая, так как она вызывает эмоции, играет с ними, за счет чего мы и запоминаем яркие моменты. В игре же ярких моментов нет. Персонажи выдают плоские шутки, иногда выстреливают хорошей цитатой, но не более. Большую часть своего времени они находятся \"где-то там\", вне восприятия игрока. А что в фокусе? Геймплей, который уже ничем новым не удивит нынешнего игрока. Когда-то он и удивил, но сейчас ничто из этого уже не ново.\n\nЯ не рекомендую играть тем, кто ожидает хорошего нарратива и ярких эмоций.

Tons of cut content, killer soundtrack, and gameplay that either redefines or even flat out reinvents a genre of games. THIS is one of few examples of the best FPS ever made. Even a beta and source code leak didn't stop this game from exceeding expectations.\nI recommend this to anyone, even if you have a kinda crappy PC, I bet you can run this med-high with above 100fps. Even brand new pre-built all-in-one computers can run this game well. Hell, they even ported this to an Android phone controller hybrid thing called the Nvidia Shield back in 2014. (That port also gave us more juicy cut beta content as well, thanks Valve.)\nAlso, did you know that this game probably has the most insane speedrunning scene? Valve updated the engine to remove bhopping only for those nerds to figure out you could bhop faster in the new engine by tricking the engine into thinking you're looking backwards. It completely breaks the game, allowing you to jump across Highway 17, the most open chapter in the game in like 2 minutes.\nThe lore to Half-Life 2 is also really good, but there was planned to be more to it. The original concept was much more dark, grittier, and more hopeless. I recommend you take a look at The Cutting Room Floor website as well as Valve News Network's and Radiation Hazard's videos on YouTube if you want to know more about this concept. Personally I think a darker approach would give the player a better feeling of accomplishment at the end, but when you beat this game and it's episodes, it does feel pretty good.\nFor a game that launched Steam into being the biggest virtual retailer for all PC games, it's a damn good one. I'd recommend you buy it, even when it's off-sale. The $10 USD price tag is perfect (unlike how Activision still has Black Ops 2 at $60 USD WHY IS IT STILL FULL PRICE, IT'S AN 8 YEAR OLD GAME WHAT THE F)","timestamp_created":1608304211,"timestamp_updated":1608304211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82628545","author":{"steamid":"76561199111471705","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1079,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":654,"last_played":1659166132},"language":"schinese","review":"好玩\n！","timestamp_created":1608303279,"timestamp_updated":1608303279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82627547","author":{"steamid":"76561199100731110","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":759,"last_played":1639127417},"language":"russian","review":"Игра легендарная.

half life 2, 16 odd years later & although its showing its age both visually and mechanically, it is not only still really good looking, it also plays incredibly smoothly. \nnot to mention the hundreds if not thousands of mods that have been developed for this game over the better part of two decades is insane & some add tons of replay value, others are a total meme (realism mod xD) and others are simply a new coat of paint with some extra guns added. \n\npoint is, this game HAS BEEN old enough to have a little something for everyone, and at this point, it certainly is a gaming classic. \nif youve never played HL before, no problem starting here, if you only ever played the first game and not the second, go for it! \n\nbest part of it all is considering this games age and the advancements made in computer hardware since its release, you're not going to experience any issues (lag, stutter, etc etc) if you intend on playing HL2 along with episodes 1 and 2 on even the cheapest of laptops.\n\nget it, play it, love it, play it again & finally, understand all the memes and references that this cultural zeitgeist has implanted throughout our world!!! <3 \n\nIn Gabe we trust, In Gabe we love, Please father Gabe, turn the instinct suppression fields off... We're begging you..... \nALL HAIL THE ONE TRUE FREE-MAN!!!\n\nP.S. \nMay Elune guide you","timestamp_created":1608248991,"timestamp_updated":1608248991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40YPHufYCcOCHuwI="}
