Well, the reviewers weren't lying.  It's an excellent sequel to the original Half Life.\n\nIt's difficult to know where to begin because there are so many great things I could write about this game. I love how it combines gameplay and storytelling in a seamless way.  It has perhaps the most perfect pacing I've ever seen in a game and I became so engrossed with it that I refused to sleep until I had seen the end.  \n\nI love the dystopian atmosphere and the menacing presence of the Combine Citadel and how it literally eats away human civilization.  I love the various enemies you fight and how they are inspired by classic sci-fi monsters such as the Alien Facehugger, the bugs from Starship Troopers, and the Tripods from War of the Worlds.  My favorite part has to be Ravenholm because it managed to disturb me more than most horror games that I've played.  If only the creators of the Dead Space series had studied this level!\n\nThe gameplay is also tremendously fun.  Vehicle combat can be hit or miss in some games but in this one they are very easy to use and help your character a great deal. Each level offers an interesting challenge that distiniguishes it from others.  For example, one level teaches you how to use creatures to attack enemies while you run from cover to cover avoiding heavy fire, while another forces you to use objects in the environment as weapons because ammo is scarce.  Usually there is at least one level that's a boring slog in FPS games but I enjoyed all of the ones in Half-Life 2. \n\nWeapon variety and utility can make or break an FPS, but this game does not disappoint. While I enjoyed all of the weapons, the Gravity Gun is one of my all-time favorites for an FPS, ranking up there with the Wraithverge from Hexen (an awesome-looking cross that shoots four wraiths that can traverse through walls to tear apart your enemies).  \n \nHalf-Life 2 improves upon the original in every way except for level design.  Older FPS games like the original Half-Life have complex levels that offer multiple paths to explore.  Quake is especially known for its amazing level design, which is why its deathmatch community remained strong for many years.  Half-Life 2 is very linear by comparison, and though that assists with story pacing, it reduces the game's replay value.  Even so, I loved this game so much that I played it twice and still had a blast during my second run.  \n\nIf you have never played this game I highly recommend it.  Yes, the graphics are dated compared to today's games, but Half-Life 2 is so well-crafted that you will enjoy it regardless.","timestamp_created":1468470107,"timestamp_updated":1468470428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24308272","author":{"steamid":"76561198074254259","num_games_owned":402,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":613,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":602,"last_played":1549398354},"language":"english","review":"[b]Half-Life 2[/b], the game everyone is talking about and wants a sequel for.\nPersonally, I didn't like the game that much. It sure had it's moments, but if I'd never played it I really don't think I'd care, and I couldn't ever care less if Half-Life 3 ever comes out.\n I guess I should tell you why.\n\n[h1]Why I Didn't Like It[/h1]\nThe game was alright, but I just found it to be like one of those movies where they nearly get to the end\nthen something magically happens and all of a sudden they're back right where they started.\nI really do believe there was way too much hype around this game, and that's the reason I picked it up. \nIt was quite disappointing really. I found the combat super linear, you have lots of guns but you basically just spray at the enemies until they're dead, and to me that's not a lot of fun. The game had some puzzles which were actually the part I enjoyed the most even though I'm not a puzzle game guy. I had to push myself to even finish this game, I really found it boring, the story just didn't interest me at all. This game was not my cup of tea.\n\n[h1]How's It Holding Up?[/h1]\nThis game runs super well, it's silky smooth, if you can't run this game there is seriously an issue.\nAny computer now should be able to run this game without a hitch.\nI'm running Windows 10 Pro 64Bit and their was no startup crashes, sound bugs, performance issues, it was perfect.\nThis game is very well made in that regard.\nThere are some points in the story where you'll get little teammates along the way, which was alright at first but I found them extremely annoying as they'd get in your way in a small space like a door, staircase, or ally way.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nNormally I list the pros and cons, but there really isn't any cons, besides my opinion on the gameplay itself.\nI suggest watching a video of the first chapter on YouTube so you can get a feel if you'd like it or not.\nAlso, if you've never played these games before make sure to play the original, it's showing it's age but you're better off getting the remastered one. The story is hard to follow without playing the original.\n\n[h1]7/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1468469435,"timestamp_updated":1468469673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24305180","author":{"steamid":"76561198197131806","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":545,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1578723639},"language":"koreana","review":"옛날 게임은 역시 오래된다.","timestamp_created":1468452548,"timestamp_updated":1468452548,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24303753","author":{"steamid":"76561198064189065","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":826,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1558306778},"language":"turkish","review":"Yeni Aldım ve oynuyorum keşke daha önceden alıp oynasaymışım.","timestamp_created":1468446133,"timestamp_updated":1468446133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24302466","author":{"steamid":"76561198194969519","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1111,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":465,"last_played":1557770636},"language":"czech","review":"good game and good story :)","timestamp_created":1468441101,"timestamp_updated":1468441101,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24292295","author":{"steamid":"76561198220460128","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":60076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1628956732},"language":"polish","review":"Fajnie się gra :)","timestamp_created":1468403082,"timestamp_updated":1468403082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24291490","author":{"steamid":"76561198050612847","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":502,"last_played":1466189075},"language":"english","review":"I'm still waiting for the 3rd episode/game...\nReason?

That game was a huge success for reason, but it was quite hard to create a new episode after that. But they did it! Half-Life 2 became the first element of a new era again, an FPS game with a unique world, \"a right man on the wrong place\", and You are a right one when you are in, but warning! Once you are really in, it is hard to get out.\n\nThe game has three parts, the 'original' game, Half-Life: Episode 1 and Episode 2.\nIn the original game you immediately meet the world of City 17 and it's leader, Wallace Breen. I think that most of you can or will feel the strong atmosphere which could inspire fe. the Bioshock games (even if Rapture with the lead of Andrew Ryan can have a stronger effect for the players).\n\nBut I don't want to bore you, so, let me tell a few points at last.\nThis game is RECOMMENDED for those, who\n- like to become a part of a collapsing future world where humans are in a great danger but try to stick together,\n- like a dinamic story line with various places, from the city to the zombie world (...)\n- like to not just be on foot but 'driving hard and shoot them'\n- have good knowledge of english language to understand the in-game conversations\n- who played Half-Life 1 and want to know the sequel of it\n\nThis game is NOT RECOMMENDED for those, who\n- has less patience for in-game dialogs or finding the way on some places\n- cannot excuse for some in-game 'mistakes' /maybe bugs/\n- who has confidence about some kind of story-line but the game offers something else\n- has less skills for FPS games (easy difficulty is still playable I think)\n\nSTEAM offers achievements you can earn during the play. This is a very good thing but You think first before You try to get all Lambda signals, complete Ravenholm by using just the gravity gun and complete Sandtraps without touching the Sand. These achievements can reduce the experience of the game.\n\nHave a great time, everyone!","timestamp_created":1468245525,"timestamp_updated":1468245525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24252625","author":{"steamid":"76561198120279130","num_games_owned":330,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1056,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":965,"last_played":1590139375},"language":"russian","review":"отличная игра))","timestamp_created":1468240339,"timestamp_updated":1468240339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24251881","author":{"steamid":"76561198176292225","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":6,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1496675217},"language":"turkish","review":"Gj\n","timestamp_created":1468237385,"timestamp_updated":1468237385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24250821","author":{"steamid":"76561198021677156","num_games_owned":1084,"num_reviews":90,"playtime_forever":4021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3931,"last_played":1585836076},"language":"english","review":"Honestly it gets stale, repetitive and just generally boring.

You'll probably find yourself aiming up a lot because usually you're in some kind of ditch or pit while the enemies attack from above apache style and it gets old and repetitive.\n\nI have no idea why Half Life seems to get a free pass for all criticism but I sure don't think it should.
