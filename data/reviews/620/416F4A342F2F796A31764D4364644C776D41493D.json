First off, this game in my mind has a really good intro that helps you link up to the old game, at first it doesn't, but once you really start playing the game, you'll start noticing old places, this in my mind is how you start off a sequel. Later on in the game you'll discover more things about Aperture, thus making an even better world of the Portal AND Half Life universe. On a technical term, the level design and puzzles are easy but well made, and soon get more complex and harder.  That isn't all, you also have CO-OP mode, and you can make your own puzzles to. The CO-OP mode is really good, as you actually have  to work as a team to finish puzzles, if you've played through these puzzles you'll know that the team at VALVe really likes to get creative, which makes this Gaming company and Hardware company, the more better. While this  may be all the game offers, The Dialogue, Voice Acting, Atmosphere, Tone, Official Soundtrack, Game play and more are very well made and hand crafted, thank you VALVe for making if not a 2nd better sequel!","timestamp_created":1596341846,"timestamp_updated":1596341846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73637271","author":{"steamid":"76561198955921159","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1201,"last_played":1619908712},"language":"english","review":"This is my favorite Valve game ever.

I enjoy puzzle games in general, but the use of portals adds an entirely new depth to it. It really does make you think differently, hence \"Thinking with portals\". As the second game in this franchise, it really experiments with new ideas. With the addition of the excursion funnels, light bridges, the different gel types, etc, it adds all these brilliant things into game that I already loved. On top of the great mechanics and challenging puzzles that build the base for this game, there's just enough humor and story elements sprinkled in to make it a really unique experience.\n\nCo-op:\nThe co-op is on an entirely different level. Now instead of 2 portals, you have to think with 4? And work together, resisting the urge to send your partner-in-science shooting into the pits below? Now that's a challenge. On a serious note, the co-op does require a lot of teamwork and thinking outside the box. Doing puzzles with 2 people, 2 portals each is much different than doing puzzles alone. The co-op built into the game is fantastic as is, but the community maps are something I can appreciate after originally playing this game on console. From the unique puzzle maps, to the gel racing maps, it reinstalled my love for this game with new content.\n\nRatings:\nGameplay       9\nEnjoyment    10\nMultiplayer     9\nReplayability  5\nOverall        9.5\n\nHighly recommend","timestamp_created":1596328654,"timestamp_updated":1596328654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73631289","author":{"steamid":"76561198813515477","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1580854391},"language":"brazilian","review":"big brain time!","timestamp_created":1596328585,"timestamp_updated":1596328585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73631013","author":{"steamid":"76561198084989542","num_games_owned":934,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":678,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":678,"last_played":1596327108},"language":"latam","review":"Si jugaste el primer portal y te gustó lo que viste, preparate porque esta secuela deja a su antecesor como una demo de 3 horas. Toma el concepto tan original de puzzles con portales y lo expande en todos los sentidos, tanto en el gameplay, en su historia, en su apartado gráfico; en fin lo profundiza. Se nota como el equipo de desarrollo de Valve le pone su toque en muchos puntos del juego. \nSi tuviese que dar las razones de porque debes comprarlo y jugarlo, puedo resumirlo en que el juego está estructurado en una forma de afrontar la trama que me recordó mucho a los half-life, con detalles en todo momento. Desde el lado jugable, sigue utilizando portales de entrada y de salida, pero mientras avanza el juego añade distintos tipos de implementos que juegan con la física del entorno para resolver los puzzles (fluidos de hipervelocidad, de repulsión, campos gravitacionales, etc). \nPor fuera del modo historia, existe el apartado de mapas hechos por la comunidad que son una locura, la oportunidad de jugar en co-op tanto la historia como el modo comunidad, modos de desafío, y niveles agregados como citas de audios con conceptos del equipo de desarrollo mientras estaban organizando el juego.\nEs un juego que me dejó una gran sensación al terminarlo, al igual que el primero.
