Well I atleast hope you know about the WWII 1942 Times in Germany well this games relates to that time in war, it's a two team war game USA Army, and Wehrmacht, Wehrmacht are German Soldiers in WWII Times. Its TF2 Because how the gameplay and team war based of the game is, its like Counter Strike, because sorta same thing it's like CSS But DoD Aka Day of Defeat. DoD:S and CSS, I hope you know what im trying to say they have \"Source\" at the end of the names or the game and its like that hard to explain how its like CSS. I reccomend this game for ages 12+ on my opinion from how it is, yes I am 12 at the time 2014 but, does that really matter unless you are the parent reading this and does not like your young daughter or son playing games that have, Blood, Violence, and WWII 1942, because in real life 1942 WWII was bad times. I hope this review helped you parents, ladies and gentleman to know more about the game before buying it.","timestamp_created":1416722976,"timestamp_updated":1416722976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13047744","author":{"steamid":"76561198124005505","num_games_owned":342,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":17138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3976,"last_played":1652400474},"language":"english","review":"10/10 A multiplayer WW2 themed FPS game.

Mich hat das Szenario interessiert.\n\nSetting/Story: Day of Defeat: Source spielt gegen Ende vom Zweiten Weltkrieg, als die Amerikaner auf der Normandie gelandet sind und Stück für Stück Frankreich befreien. Also um 1944 rum. Es gibt jedoch auch einige italienische Karten wie Anzio.\n\nGameplay: Es ist ein sehr stark \"vercasualisiertes\" Counter-Strike: Source. Der Movementspeed ist ziemlich hoch, man kann sprinten und man braucht nich unbedingt besondere Taktiken. Der Recoil is immens hoch und beinahe unkontrollierbar, deswegen muss man sich daran gewöhnen um in Firefights zu gewinnen. Es gibt verschiedene Klassen zur Auswahl, alles haben eine besondere \"Fähigkeit\" mit der rechten Maustaste. \n\nMaps: Die Maps sind alle abwechslungsreich, bieten mehrere Wege um an das Objective ranzukommen oder Gegner zu flankieren. Meine Matches verliefen immer so, dass ein Teil von unserem Team mir durch so einen Weg gefolgt ist und wir so gewonne haben. \n\nFazit: Day of Defeat: Source ist ein gutes Spiel, jedoch fehlt dem die Aufmerksamkeit, die es bräuchte. Es gibt zu wenige Server, die wirklich \"spielbar\" sind. Aber wenn man den passenden Server findet kann der Spaß schon losgehen. Die 10€ sind definitiv gut ausgegeben.","timestamp_created":1412538434,"timestamp_updated":1499748741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56103217601776123","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12380439","author":{"steamid":"76561198153413267","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":21,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1412977546},"language":"french","review":"trop bon jeu","timestamp_created":1412537630,"timestamp_updated":1412537630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12377536","author":{"steamid":"76561198099350431","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":897,"last_played":1474422994},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game!

I like this idea (unless your team is filled with idiots) because it requires teamwork in order to succeed. You can't go lone wolf in this like most games. Now is it good for new players?
