Serinin son oyunu olan BioShock İnfinite'yi bitirmiş olup seriyi tamamlamış bulunmaktayım. Serinin önceki oyunlarına bakarsak BioShock serisi adeta bir devrim yapmış. Sizi içine çeken bir hikayeye, büyüleyici bir atmosfere, son derece kaliteli bir oynanışa, günümüz oyunlarıyla yarışabilecek cinsten efekt, grafik ve yapay zekaya sahip. Kesinlikle tadına bakılması gereken bir yapım. Serinin önceki oyunları beni hiç mi hiç içine çekemedi. Gerek atmosferleri, gerekse oynanışları açısından, içimi daraltıyordu resmen. Ama İnfinite öyle değil.  Hepsinden farklı, serinin önceki oyunlarının sürekli kapalı alanda geçiyor olması, bende oyunu hemen bitirip kurtulma isteği doğuruyordu. Fakat İnfinite'ye girdiğim an \"İşte bu, Sonunda yapmışlar, şu canlılığa, şu atmosfere, şu hikayeye bak\" dedim. Oyunun sonlarında çok şaşırdım ve bittiği an adeta duygusal bir boşluğa düştüm. Kesinlikle oynanmalı ve indirimlerde asla kaçırılmamalı.

At least, that's what did it for me and why I have over 90 hours on this game.\n\nHowever, the gunplay is absurdly simplified compared to the previous two entries in the series with the player only able to carry two weapons at once, no ability to make traps, no alternate ammo types, and the enemies, frankly, seem dumber than the previous games, even on the hardest difficulty.\n\nNot to mention that, unlike [i]Bioshock 2[/i], which attempted to do something about the boring hacking mini-game from the first game, [i]Bioshock: Infinite[/i] chooses to just...give up on it entirely and remove it. Which seemed to be a theme of the developer just removing features from the previous games for no real discernible reason.\n\nAs for the story? The way it's told is fine with the pacing of it being amazing along with most of the dialogue being entertaining, but the overall writing is super poor in a lot of parts, such as Booker literally both-siding a conflict between a slave owning society and slaves. It doesn't help that the first half of the game actually does focus on this plotline, but then it's pretty much dropped entirely for one completely unrelated in both theme and genre.\n\nSo, if you want to sightsee, while killing folks at your leisure, then it's worth it. Otherwise, if you're looking for deeper gameplay, go play [i]Bioshock[/i] and [i]Bioshock 2[/i] instead.","timestamp_created":1596797925,"timestamp_updated":1596797925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73907839","author":{"steamid":"76561198375972049","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":552,"last_played":1596796629},"language":"english","review":"Story Rich indeed.

The story might seems random in the beginning but as you progress and knowing more, the dots will be connected. And it is a great story, there's a spice of scifi delivered through steampunk designs.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, backtracking are mostly possible but feels a bit stressful due to linear world design. Gunplay is great, every weapon category has its own play style, but it's a shame you can only carry two at a time. Enemies do drop their weapon if they're dead and the game gave you weapon crates pretty often but, I guess it's just the way it meant to be played. The animations still holds up to today's standard, executions feel so violent yet satisfying the same type of feeling you get for playing DOOM. You can create epic kills with the help of the environments, it feels so good when you managed to pulled one off\n\nMovement in this game feels so intuitive, the only thing that grinds the gear for me is getting stuck by some invisible wall on objects, you have skills that'll help with any kind of gameplay, it's just in early game you won't be able to use it as much due to the small number of \"salt\" bar (skills drain salts), and salts can only be restored by consumables or by rarely seen salt dispenser. \n\nOverall it's an experience worth having, the more you fall deeper the more you'll be invested in the story, at least that's what happened to me. The story might be strange but keep an open mind for this game is far from realism. This game has changed many people in a good way and I hope it did the same for you. \n\n","timestamp_created":1596723659,"timestamp_updated":1596723659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73865761","author":{"steamid":"76561198234861412","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":189,"last_played":1597160022},"language":"schinese","review":"补票","timestamp_created":1596723415,"timestamp_updated":1596723415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73864232","author":{"steamid":"76561199048517164","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":129,"last_played":1599191562},"language":"schinese","review":"进不去，调了半小时进去都是卡的然后直接闪退","timestamp_created":1596721219,"timestamp_updated":1596721219,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444444447755813599","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73864169","author":{"steamid":"76561198869774540","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6050,"last_played":1596652563},"language":"schinese","review":"优点剧情逻辑性强，原声出色，尤其是伊丽莎白角色创建很棒，很惹人爱，AI互动，可以称为最佳队友","timestamp_created":1596721103,"timestamp_updated":1596721103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73862477","author":{"steamid":"76561198356403610","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":560,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":538,"last_played":1651318043},"language":"schinese","review":"夹带私货，涉及政治，要点脸不？","timestamp_created":1596718494,"timestamp_updated":1624178794,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73861931","author":{"steamid":"76561198422846430","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":614,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":614,"last_played":1596572689},"language":"russian","review":"Многим эта игра не нравится из-за механики шутера то, что она здесь плохая и не удобная. Как по мне шутер не плохой, особенно система энергетиков, в этом и уникальность серии. Но в любом случае самое главное это сюжет и визуальный стиль. В этой части стиль очень красивый. Воздушный город в Эдвардианскую эпоху.\nС сюжетом же всё сложнее, очевидно, что ничего не понятно. Хотя сюжет это алтернативная история первых двух частей. То есть из-за какого-то выбора или совпадений подводный город стал воздушным. Dlc же очень интересны особенно на контрасте. Я проходил игру раза 4, поэтому для меня могу назвать её реиграбельной.","timestamp_created":1596717573,"timestamp_updated":1596717573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73861103","author":{"steamid":"76561198927442658","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":731,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":731,"last_played":1586105243},"language":"schinese","review":"这就是第九艺术，满分剧情，八分画面，六分手感，总体九分","timestamp_created":1596716206,"timestamp_updated":1596716206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73859606","author":{"steamid":"76561198272493432","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1293,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1224,"last_played":1627139417},"language":"russian","review":"Когда прошел игру почти нихуя не понял.

You could pick any objective measure and I would say this game is better executed than the original Bioshock, yet if I were to chose either game to play again, it would definitely be the original.
