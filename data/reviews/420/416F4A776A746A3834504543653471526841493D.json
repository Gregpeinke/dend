Summed up all is kind of aged but still enjoyable and gets the job done.\n\nSo, why does this DLC got a thumbs up and Episode 1 doesn't?\nBecause the story is better. You are more involved and you got a feeling what the motivation of characters is. Your goal from the beginning is clear and you work towards it step by step. The sometimes clumsy controls doesn't matter as much as in episode 1 because most of the time you are in a more rural than narrow urban scenery. Which is refreshing after you spend HL2 and episode 1 in a mostly urban scenery. The levels and tasks got a better variety and (what leaves me smirking) you get the crowbar early enough! And the scripted events felt of a more atmospherical usage than in HL2 - ep1. You also get a glimpse on... lets say another science project to avoid spoilers ;)\n\nOnly downside is the forced use of the gravity gun.

Fue lanzado en Octubre del 2007, y hasta el día de hoy fue el capítulo que culminó con la saga de Half-Life 2, ya que el Episodio Tres, por conflictos entre Valve y Marc Laidlaw, nunca vio la luz.\nContinuando con lo ocurrido en el final del Episodio Uno, Half-Life 2: Episodio Dos arranca con Gordon Freeman despertando en el vagón del tren en el que viajaba con Alyx Vance, completamente destruido por la explosión del núcleo de Ciudad 17. Intentando escapar, Alyx aparece con vida fuera del tren para ayudar a Gordon a salir utilizando el Manipulador de Campos de Energía Cero. Una vez fuera, los dos se dan cuenta que donde estaba Ciudad 17 ahora hay un remolino gigante de energía con dirección al cielo, el cual emana explosiones cada cierto tiempo. Luego de avanzar un poco, se logran comunicar con Eli Vance y el Dr. Kleiner, y estos explican que ese remolino de energía es un portal gigante de la Alianza para invadir en masa una vez más el planeta Tierra, a lo que Alyx cuenta que durante el escape de Ciudad 17 encontró información importante que la Doctora Mossman encriptó desde una ubicación desconocida, y todos concuerdan que podría ser importante ya que tiene el código para cerrar el portal de los Combine, por lo que les piden a Alyx y Freeman que lleven cuanto antes esos datos a una zona llamada \"White Forest\", donde se encuentran Eli, Kleiner, y el Dr. Magnusson (Un nuevo personaje que está desarrollando un cohete para cerrar el portal, quien requiere de esta famosa información). Gordon y Alyx emprenden su viaje a White Forest, no sin antes enfrentar un gran problema que va a desviarlos por un momento.\nYa como algo normal en los últimos Half-Life, los puntos criticables son las pausas a la hora de cargar nuevos niveles, y este juego es víctima de aquella molestia que se arrastra desde Half-Life 2. Otro punto negativo es la inclusión de Magnusson, no por su carácter ni cómo está planteado el personaje en la historia, sino porque a estas alturas en que estamos finalizando el juego siguen apareciendo \"viejos conocidos\" de Black Mesa de los cuales no teníamos ni la más mínima idea de su existencia, por lo que opino que en su lugar podrían haber traído de vuelta a la historia al Dr. Keller o al Dr. Rossenberg.\nComo puntos positivos se destaca la buena continuación de la historia luego de lo ocurrido en el Episodio Uno, ya que siento que es una historia un poco más desarrollada y entretenida que en su antecesor, ubicando muy bien al jugador dentro de esta y jugando con sus emociones. Además, el juego presenta mayor duración que el Episodio Uno, sumándole entre 5 o 6 horas para completarlo. Por otra parte, este título añade nuevos enemigos a la saga con quienes mantendremos constante enfrentamiento directo: Las larvas, las Hormigas León Obreras, la Hormiga León Guardiana, los Raptores, y los Consejeros Combine. También, es destacable la cantidad de niveles y enfrentamientos en zonas abiertas, ya que ponen al motor Source a funcionar a su máximo nivel y le suman muchos momentos memorables al juego.\nHalf-Life 2: Episodio Dos tuvo sus cosas buenas como malas, sin embargo, esa combinación logró formar un muy buen título y una buena continuación del Episodio Uno, con muchas escenas y enfrentamientos para recordar, y con uno de los finales más crudos de los videojuegos, dejándonos con una tristeza e ira absoluta por no poder hacer nada, y además porque Valve nunca decidió sacar el tan esperado Episodio Tres, dejándonos una historia inconclusa y con un final demasiado abierto.\nRecomiendo el segundo episodio ya que fue muy bueno, con varios momentos cargados de emociones, pudiendo lograr que pases de la felicidad a la tristeza en poco tiempo. Un juego que vas a disfrutar y a llorar cuando lo acabes, pero sin continuación alguna. Valve, por favor, sacá algún día el tercer episodio...","timestamp_created":1588617564,"timestamp_updated":1588617564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.642857134342193604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68556811","author":{"steamid":"76561198368469141","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":674,"last_played":1589978263},"language":"russian","review":"Эта игра очень крутая для тех кто хочет поиграть.
