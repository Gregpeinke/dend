So screw it, I'm talking about the bad in this game so to start let's talk about the good.  It has the best art direction I've seen from a triple A game in years, is very well-written, and has some of the best friendly AI you will ever see in a game, and considering all the negatives I'm about to list off, it is still a good game and I recommend picking it up.  Alright that was the good, now for a list of the bad.\n\n-A victim of Call of Duty Syndrome, with only two weapon slots and enemies that just stand there and shoot you.\n-What is the point of vigors?  They serve no practical purpose to the game other than justifying calling this a BioShock game.\n-The Handymen are awful, being nothing more than bullet sponges before they die out of pity (and no one can say these are similar to Big Daddies.  They don't protect something, aren't passive, have a weak point, and don't have different forms.)\n-The ghost fights\n-The final gunfight\n-The civilians just disappear when a gun battle erupts.\n-No multiple ammunition per gun\n-The gun upgrades have no impact on some guns since there are different versions of the same gun.\n-The guns have no recoil.  You could spray a dude with an entire clip of a machine gun and your aim wouldn't get thrown off.\n-The story, although good, has too many plot-holes. \n-in a game that is supposed to be about fate, multiple universes do not fit, especially since they are used in this game as a retry button.\n-The Ending throws too much info at you.\n-Elizabeth being an invulnerable companion derails the point of having to protect her.\n-Why is this even a BioShock game?  The changes to the previous two are enough to make it its own IP. \n\nHate comments, commence!","timestamp_created":1435527086,"timestamp_updated":1435625190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16768184","author":{"steamid":"76561198009325312","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":519,"last_played":1403650272},"language":"english","review":"Crazy good story, graphics and gameplay.

When I first launched Bioshock: Infinite, I was surprised by the aesthetic of it. Cheery, late 19th or early 20th century music playing with all that lovely record-like scratchiness (scratchiness? Is that a word? Spell-check checks out. Heh.) That's just the menu, by the way. Then the logo at the beginning, with the banner tearing and the name of the game weathering before your eyes. You can see right away that there is an air of foreboding -- and that's what I really liked about this game. It's contrast of almost utopian cheerfulness mixed with the notion that something darker is behind the curtain.\n\nNow I won't bore you with details, or ruin your fun with spoilers if you haven't played the game yet, but I have to tell you if you like surprises in your games, this is a game for you. It tricks you nicely with the almost Disney-esque atmosphere, the pleasantness of the people and the animation style. Much like Dewitt (the main character aka YOU) who is surprised by his suroudnings finds that he was only sticking his head into the rabbit hole (more like a viper's nest, but like I said: NO SPOILERS!) The charade, or thin veneer if you will, quickly drops and you find yourself seeing the true darkness playing behind this supposed Utopia! \n\nHope my review helped (probably didn't), though I tried to avoid putting too fine a point on it. Here's some specs that will help out otherwise:\n[olist]\n\n[*]Key controls: very standard, with WASD motion and key commands similar to Half-Life, Left 4 Dead, etc. with only a few changes to incorporate elements of the game (vague enough for you?) So you guys shouldn't have any trouble getting the hang of it.\n\n[*]Style: First-Person shooter, so again you Half-Lifers or even Metro \"Rangers\" will adapt nicely to this beauty.\n\n[*]Challenges: not too hard. So far, puzzles are seldom and easy, tasks are laid out easy to find and opponents die after ~4 shots from your gun. So if you're a dead-eye, you shouldn't have too much problem. Challenges only come from initial low health, so watch that meter closely. You don't carry med packs with you to heal on the run, you strictly pick them up and use them as you find them, or food for a lower health boost. There are also higher levels of diffuctly if you're one looking for a challenge, though. Just like the guy who eats spicy chips for breakfast (it was ONE TIME), some of us just like it hot early on.\n\n[*]Currency: Yes. Just, yes. Like with Metro, you need to collect currency as you go for upgrades, ammo, etc. Luckily you can also pick off the dead guys so ammo isn't too hard to max out. \n\n[*]Story: this is where the game absolutely shines.

В десять — пятнадцать часов игрового времени утрамбовано невероятное количество событий, и обо всех очень хочется рассказать, вот только боишься испортить первое впечатление. В отличие от исходного BioShock, сюжет которого был почти полностью построен на обмане игрока, здесь обманчива сама система морали. Даже после прохождения не получится назвать персонажей добрыми или злыми — мотивы поступков и их последствия сплетаются в такой тугой клубок, что разматывать его придется несколько прохождений и множество часов горячих дискуссий на форумах. Пожалуй, по духу игра больше всего походит на цикл книг о Геральте Анджея Сапковского — только здесь дилеммы не выведены столь откровенно, а схватившее тебя за шиворот Зло не шипит на ухо: «Выбирай!» Раньше в BioShock всегда было ясно, хорошо ты поступаешь или не очень.

      Now, where do i start. oh yah ill just say this game is possibly my favorite story game. just because of the ending.\nthis game is filled with so many emotions at once. now let me tell you the story (warning spoilers} hover over the text to view.\n\n[spoiler] So the game starts off with you booker dewit being on a boat with two other people that cant be seen since they are facing away they take you to a tiny rock island that has a lighthous on it. you go inside and you se a dead man with words saying repay the debt written in blood on the wall you go up and find a chair (i do skip sometimes cuz its a long story} that take you to the floating city of columbia. after exiting the chair thingy u encounter many different things in the city that seems to have a religion that worships a man prophet. after an encounter with a group that wants you to hurt a couple that is of two different races you are known as the false prophet because of a mark on your hand. you continue your jurney to the main building statue thingy that holds a girl you have to get to repay a debt. when you find her you find out that she is named elizibeth has a cut off pinky and has the power to open tears witch are basically portals that open up to a differnt version of the world i cant really explain. you tell her that you will set her free and take her to paris, so she follows you. when you get to a ship to paris, she finds out that you actually set the cordinates to new york and trys to fly the craft by knocking you out. but she runs into trouble and you both get caught by a trades group against the government. she asks you for guns in return for his ship. so you open a tear to a world where she already has the guns. but in this world you are a marder that fought and died for the cause of taking down the government. she refuses to give you a ship thinking you are an imposter. you kill her and go to comsock house wwich houses the prophet matthew comstock. you kill him and tak his ship but in the end you end up having to destroy elizibeths tower to destroy the power cell things that keep elizibeth from having her full power. she then takes you to  rapture the underwater city witch has a light hous on the sea top. they go inside and elizibeth shows him the many world with many differn outcomes they need to kill comstock wich is alive in many worlds. she takes him to a part in his life where he sold his child to pay off a debt but as he trys to take the baby becaus he changed his mind. the portal seperating him and comstock closes, cutting off the babies pinky that baby is elizibeth. he then decides to kill comstock because of this. because comstock is alive in many worlds he must kill hime as a child elizibeth takes him {booker dewit} to a baptism where she tells him that in another world booker dewit became baptised and became a new man named matthew comstock. he is matthew in another world so elizibeth kills him like he wanted then every elizibith that was alive in a different world dissepears exept the main one             and the screen goes black[/spoiler] yah the ending is quite a plot twist but it was so mind blowing to that i really wanted to write a review   im sorry if my story telling made it seem boring because it really isnt pleeeaaase go play it you wont regrert it.\n\n\n    NOW FOR PROS AND CONS\n\n             MAIN PRO\n\n         the story: this games story is probably the most interesting and compelling story that ive ever seen, i mean, its filled with so many emotions and action, how could you not love it\n\n\n\n\n\n             MAIN CON\n        the gameplay: i know that this game has a objective pointer system on the ps3 but on pc i couldnt find it in the settings, making finding where i was supposed to go was extremely hard. thy bioshock infinite map is huge making it even harder. i might be wrong and there was actually an option in the settings for an objective leader and i was just dumb. but even if there was one this game needs a map badly.\n\n\n\n\n           Anyway, i would recommend this game for people who have and havn't playd the original bioshock games. its a new experience compared to the old bioshock games but i think its better.","timestamp_created":1435398782,"timestamp_updated":1435398782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16735379","author":{"steamid":"76561198128933383","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1369,"last_played":1435520045},"language":"czech","review":"První Bioshock byl ve svém jádru naprosto dechberoucí. Znepokojivá atmosféra, podivuhodné schopnosti a zábavné mechanismy vynáší hru nad ostatními, avšak slabší vyprávění příběhu a nudná poslední část příběhu táhne první Bioshock dolů, neboť mu chybí srdce z mého pohledu. Teď momentálně stojím před verdiktem nad druhým pokračováním Bioshocku. \nI přestože, co se týče mechanismu, se jedná o podobné hry, Bioshock Infinite dokáže to, v čem první naprosto selhal - odvyprávět zajímavý příběh. Grafika a hudba jen podtrhují výsledný dojem ze hry. Pokud jsem měl po dohrání prvního Bioshocku pachuť na jazyku, tady mohu mít jen otevřenou pusu, protože Bioshock Infinite dokázal říct příběh s takovou ladností a elegancí se kterou se neodváží většina konkurence. Tato hra je jasný důkaz, že i hry můžou být umění.","timestamp_created":1435392965,"timestamp_updated":1435392965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16735203","author":{"steamid":"76561198119692220","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":840,"last_played":1438008410},"language":"koreana","review":"돈 안아깝다. 한글화 되어있지만 유저한글패치활용을 권함.","timestamp_created":1435392137,"timestamp_updated":1435392137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16734487","author":{"steamid":"76561197981861981","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":635,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1441383367},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую только по следующим критериям:\n1.

I haven't really plaayed much of the first two games but this game is intense pretty much right out of the gate. The game looks stunning on ultra settings and I had no studdering even though newer games studder on even the lowest settings on my pc. The game is kind of one big escort mission but the person you're escorting can't die and helps you find money and ammo. Gunplay is great. You can upgrade your weapons but I only did this to help get some achievements later on in the game. There's no quicksaves but the checkpoint system is fine and on normal difficulty I only died a few times becuase I was trying to get those weapon achiements. There are two (maybe three?) more difficult setting though so upgrades and checkpoints might be more important there. Vigors are meh; I didn't really use them too often except to knock some bullet sponge enemies off the map. The only real downsides I can find is that you can only hold two weapons, three is you count your melee weapon, and that looting everything felt tedious and forced.. even though I didn't really need anything other than health at point (again played on normal though).","timestamp_created":1435383516,"timestamp_updated":1435599119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16733578","author":{"steamid":"76561198060243741","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":1700,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":856,"last_played":1585535248},"language":"english","review":"Great, kind of hard, but a great game with a amazing story.\n\n9.5/10","timestamp_created":1435383165,"timestamp_updated":1435383165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480769246816635132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16733275","author":{"steamid":"76561197962522958","num_games_owned":795,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":505,"last_played":1435376178},"language":"english","review":"No meth heads in this one, so less butt hole puckering through the game, but this one still is top notch quality 11/10 would play again!","timestamp_created":1435381363,"timestamp_updated":1435381363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16732032","author":{"steamid":"76561198071490179","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":766,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":726,"last_played":1511244651},"language":"english","review":"Amazing!

Me di el gusto de comprar el triple pack, de Bioshock durante la Summer Sale.\n\nSolo puedo decir que es un juego obligatorio en la biblioteca de cualquiera que se precie de disfrutar el guion de un juego, mas alla de su excelente Jugabilidad. Graficamente, Columbia es un paseo gratificante, un refrescante aire a lo que la serie (y los FPS y juegos de accion en general) nos tienen acostumbrados. Los personajes en general poseen un carisma y un trabajo de guionado que excede el marco del juego y nos acerca a nosotros mismos. Nos pone a pensar. El juego cumple, entretiene y se disfruta. Elizabeth es sencillamente un protagonista no controlable, y mucho mas que un simple personaje secundario. \n\nDesde el punto de vista jugable,  Bioshock Infinite es una joya en todos los aspectos, Control, Direccion, Punteria, Combate, Personalizacion. El apartado tecnico de control de Infinite destaca y en ningun momento me encontre con problemas de controlador. Tal vez, el unico pecado del Juego es la Dificultad, demasiado simple en Hard, y poco desafiante hasta el ultimo episodio. Es perdonable, puesto que parece que los desarrolladores equilibraron de forma correcta la Dificultad con la necesidad de mantener una narrativa fluida y constante.-\n\nEl final del juego y la conclusion de la historia detras de Booker de Witt y Elizabeth deja sin aliento (literalmente terminando la partida me encontre tapando mi boca con las manos incredulamente) y es algo que recordaremos como una de las mejores conclusiones de un saga.-\n\nEn aspectos negativos, podemos destacar solo uno, la ausencia de multijugador, aunque mas no fuera en modo cooperativo resta valor a un producto de una baja rejugabilidad.-\n\nPara finalizar, Bioshock Infinite es una experiencia unica e irrepetible, un juego que trasciende las fronteras de lo ludico y se convierte, lisa y llanamente, en una obra de arte.\n\n","timestamp_created":1435371305,"timestamp_updated":1435371305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16731016","author":{"steamid":"76561198129337424","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":4908,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2284,"last_played":1492886117},"language":"russian","review":"Прикольненько ヅ","timestamp_created":1435368610,"timestamp_updated":1435368610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507334411144256592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16730381","author":{"steamid":"76561198099005201","num_games_owned":339,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":2684,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1146,"last_played":1625951636},"language":"turkish","review":"BioShock oyunun bütün serisini alın arkadaşlar gerçekten bıkmadan oynayacağınız senaryosu iyi bir oyun aynı gelenek bu oyundada devam etmiş ve görüntü kalitesi arttırılmış daha da güzel olmuş ayrıca arkadaş bir oyun ancak bu kadar başarımları yaptırmaya tahrik edebilir.Oyunu ilk bitirişimde tüm Voxophone'ları bulamamıştım ve başarımı alamadım.Tekrar bi başarımları kazanmaya yönelik oynadım ve yine kazanamadım bulamıyorum şu lanet olası Voxophone'ları.","timestamp_created":1435365491,"timestamp_updated":1435365491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16729657","author":{"steamid":"76561198191127725","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2819,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1483561837},"language":"german","review":"waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahnsin...\n...dieses spiel ist der hammer!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nkleine frage mal:\nwenn ich das spiel fast durch habe und ich mir dann alle zusatzinnhalte herunterlade, muss ich dann das spiel von vorne wieder beginnen oder wie läuft des ab???","timestamp_created":1435362059,"timestamp_updated":1435362059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16729644","author":{"steamid":"76561198159971191","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":923,"last_played":1609346197},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun tam manasıyla muhteşem atmosfer süper grafik iyi senaryo dehşet inidirimden aldım çok memnun kaldım 2 kez bitirdim çok zevkli Öneririm.\n\nGrafik 10-9\nSenaryo 10-10\nAtmosfer 10-8 \n","timestamp_created":1435361997,"timestamp_updated":1435361997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16729195","author":{"steamid":"76561198046776431","num_games_owned":211,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":48,"last_played":1456231037},"language":"russian","review":"Мультивселенная -

Meaning world items are largely static with many polygons and detailed textures. Not a problem, but for someone who prefers a Half-Life2 style of interactive \"as much as possible\" it may be a dissappointment. Lighting and effects are spectacular with character models that still tend to be too smooth for reality, but work in the quasi-fantastical Bioshock Universe.\n\nGameplay revolves around the now Bioshock standard gun / \"plasmid\" (in this game called \"vigors\", but the same thing) type. You can spend money to upgrade weapons for increased damage/accuracy/etc or \"vigors\" for much the same. After playthrough, gun play seems to be more a resource trap as multiple enemy encounters seem to require fairly upgraded \"vigors\" use to clear. As a Bioshock game, this may seem obvious, but sometimes the \"vigors\" are finicky in their implementation / usage and thus I found myself prefering the reliable nature of the firearms...at the cost of almost not being able to finish an area due to the aforementioned lack of \"vigor\" upgrades.\n\nStory is typical Bioshock...amazingly intricate at first glance with many facets that reveal more about the depth of the story if the player is willing to find them, but invariably a story that is too smart for its own good. I won't spoil anything, but very few stories using this type of plot device successfully pull it off and Infinite comes up short. In any case, enjoy it for what it is and you'll probably be left more than satisfied.\n\nThe characters are however what hold that story together...both the player and various characters met throughout the game are fully fleshed out and feel real within the world (for the most part). The best however, is your companion Elizabeth. Interesting back-story, great voice acting, realistic personality, and good AI. If it weren't another game with a strong female companion that came out the same year (The Last of Us) I say she was the best character that year, but as it is she'll have to settle for second place.\n\nAnyway, if you are a FPS junky you should already have this game in your library. If you like beatiful graphics, good story, and one of the best (female) characters in recent gaming history its well worth a play.","timestamp_created":1435351702,"timestamp_updated":1435351717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16727088","author":{"steamid":"76561197976228903","num_games_owned":406,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":757,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":756,"last_played":1436466623},"language":"russian","review":"Одним словом - Шедевр. \n11 мезинчиков Элизабет из 10","timestamp_created":1435351643,"timestamp_updated":1435393258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16726132","author":{"steamid":"76561198031092153","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1460320585},"language":"english","review":"A brilliant game that has extremely Beautiful graphics and has a very interesting and complex story.","timestamp_created":1435348529,"timestamp_updated":1435348529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16723994","author":{"steamid":"76561198060927514","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":458,"last_played":1594409176},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo muito divertido e bonito, viciante, mas complica quem nao esta acostumado a jogar no controle.

You are speechless, still trying to get your head around the masterpiece you just saw. This is exactly what the story of BioShock Infinite achieves and there are not many games that leave you with goose bumps staring at the credits. BioShock Infinite is by far one of the best games i have ever played! \n\n~~~ Game Mechanics ~~~\nBioShock Infinite is a First Person Shooter with RPG elements. You'll find different \"Spells\" (called Vigors)  that can be leveled up at certain vending machines for money. Money can be looted off fallen enemies, as well as the environment. Guns can be upgraded in the same way. You will also find different sorts of clothing that will grant you different buffs. \nThe level design is linear but you won't run into invisible walls, unless this game wants you to attend to a scripted scene. That gives you the opportunity to explore and in most cases this will be rewarded with special items.   \nPeople who played one of BioShock Infinite's predecessors BioShock and BioShock 2 will instantly get back into it. BioShock Infinite handles pretty much the same way. \n\n~~~ Technical Review ~~~\nThe game looks beautiful even by modern standards. It has a unique look and style. It uses the Unreal Engine and therefore it should run on most systems quite well. Make sure to use VSync because the tearing effect seems to have a strong impact on the atmosphere and the general look of this game in particular. \nThe sound is also very good. Blasting explosions, crisp and clean sounds of coins falling on the ground and a subliminal, never too loud soundtrack. The voice acting is superb and this makes the story-telling so good.\n\n~~~ Conclusion ~~~\nIn the end there is much more i could write about this awesome game, but i leave that to you to explore and find out for yourself. Get this game, you won't regret it! \n","timestamp_created":1435298318,"timestamp_updated":1435298318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16712968","author":{"steamid":"76561198152011078","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":98,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1436524130},"language":"russian","review":"Очень хорошая игра которая подходит и для слабыл компов, если вам нужет захватующий сюжет то вам сюда.
