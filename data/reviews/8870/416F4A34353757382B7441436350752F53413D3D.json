But, as this game has no death penalty, just like the predecessors, it is not really a challenge. Except one part of the game, which was so difficult, I struggled to beat it and it made me sweat in places I have never been sweat.\n\nIt is not due to the challenging AI or anything like that, but the fact that they don't give you enough ammunition. They give you plenty of other resources but ammunition which you need more than anything else to be honest. Of course you can change the difficulty whenever you like, but who does that? Who changes difficulty when one comes across a hard part? The game is well balanced, until this part which is way into the game.\n\nStory wise, the game has almost nothing to do with the first two BioShock games, except some minor almost unrelatable references here and there.\n\nThe visuals are amazing, and the gameplay is modern and has some unique elements to it. But they kept the feeling of a BioShock game, and the best of it is that they are \"mindfcking\" you just as in BioShock 1, and which was not included in BioShock 2, sadly.","timestamp_created":1447539347,"timestamp_updated":1447539347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19081182","author":{"steamid":"76561198061144351","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":931,"last_played":1427466191},"language":"german","review":"geil","timestamp_created":1447538244,"timestamp_updated":1447538244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19081107","author":{"steamid":"76561198025415754","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":592,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1563724765},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would be an awful dad again","timestamp_created":1447537940,"timestamp_updated":1447601164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19080198","author":{"steamid":"76561198215877296","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":560,"last_played":1508281709},"language":"german","review":"Dieses Spiel ist der Hammer so geil","timestamp_created":1447534952,"timestamp_updated":1447534952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19079908","author":{"steamid":"76561198072128200","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1640287604},"language":"english","review":"This game is a masterpiece.

За всю игру наберется пару тройку интересных моментов.\n   Сама Элизабет с её неестественной внешностью и мультяшной анимацией не вызывает никаких положительных эмоций. Те кто ей восторгается и фапает на неё наверное вообще не видели настоящих девушек и их прёт от одной возможности подержать за ручку, поговорить, побегать и пострелять с представительницей противоположного пола. \n   Сюжет бредовый и не логичный. Утопия, революция, квантовая физика, параллельные вселенные... Всё смешано в кучу и перемешано. При этом НИ ОДНА тема не раскрывается. Да и видно что сами авторы мало понимают те темы которые вплели в сюжет. Отхватили кусок который не в силах переварить. Революция существуют где то на фоне, в ней мы даже не принимаем участие, нас просто вкидывают в неё и мы бежим дальше через те же самые толпы врагов, но только уже перекрашенные в цвета революции.\n   Далее возможны спойлеры:\n   Сплошной бред в качестве сюжета. Авторы в погоне за интригой наворотили такого что без пол литра не разберешься. Элизабет прощает ГГ за то что он устраивал резню на войне, за то что он проигрался в азартных играх и теперь за долг вызволяет ее из города. Но потом устраивает скандал потому что ГГ везет ее не в Париж а в Нью Йорк! И это в тот момент когда им в зад летят вражеские пули. Да еще и бьёт его за это ключем по голове и сбегает не пойми куда.\n   Далее мы ищем оружие для повстанцев и нас кидает в реальность где революция уже во всю идет и наше оружие им уже и не нужно совсем, но мы его всё равно ищем. Зачем спрашивается?!\n  Потом еще призрак мамы Элизабет появляется(???!!!), прыжки в будущее и путешествие в Восторг из первого Биошока... Зачем и почему это происходит не спрашивайте, просто примите  как данность, это ж \"шедевр\"...\n  В конце апофеоз маразма. Оказывается ГГ продает свою дочь Элизабет самому себе из параллельной вселенной. Ну вы только вслушайтесь в это... Зачем другому Букеру понадобился ребенок? Как он вообще узнал про него? И почему у ребенка, которая Элизабет, все эти способности? Ну а потом, через 20 лет он решает её вдруг вернуть...\n   И так можно продолжать и продолжать...\n   Про DLC вообще молчу.

It's story is clear, concise, and creative. The characters invite you in, and I felt genuine emotions as the charactes felt it, along witha complete mindfuck ending. It explores morality, with it's main enemy being who he is, and the problems faced towards him (I would go more into depth, however, that would bhe going into some serious spoilers). It has you thinking the whole time into the world of the game, as it is set in 1912, and has the societal issues that came out of that time period, and with those being well integraeted into the plot. The character development is amazing, as the two main characters essentially swap personalities and feelings, and how sickening it feels to have someone in that situation evolve in the way theat they do.  The collectables in this game are audio recordings, and give an extra layer of depth into the characters, and setting.\nThis game isn't a hard game, and I feel that anyone who needs to love video games should be given this game to enjoy.","timestamp_created":1447403637,"timestamp_updated":1447403637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19046299","author":{"steamid":"76561198068467650","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":5539,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":890,"last_played":1654490986},"language":"english","review":"This is by far one of the best games in PC.
