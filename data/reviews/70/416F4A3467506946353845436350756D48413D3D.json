If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:\nhttp://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/05/half-life.html\n(As a note: I have played this game longer than the listed time before I had Steam.)\n\nWhat sets this game apart?\nHalf-Life was an influential milestone in gaming and has been considered one of the best games of all time by various magazines and critics. The main reasons for its acclaim and success deal with the way the game is presented, completely through the eyes of its protagonist, who is unseen and unheard except for his hands. This full immersion into Gordon Freeman's perspective means that there are no virtually no cut scenes or text boxes, leaving the player in control and learning the story through observation and conversation. Progression through the game is often not completely linear, featuring puzzles and exploration that had not been featured in earlier first-person shooters. Half-Life also utilizes aspects from the survival horror genre, both atmospheric and mechanical, from jump scenes to limited ammunition. Half-Life was a unique entity on the first-person shooter market, and a milestone for PC gaming in general. In addition to its contributions as its own entity, several expansions were released and Valve Software encouraged outside developers to create third-party mods.\n\nWhat is the difficulty factor?\nThe introduction to the game is amazing in its simplicity. To teach you how to move about and to introduce you to the Black Mesa complex, the game begins with Gordon Freeman is running late for work and you must hurry to the lab. From here, new information is displayed as it becomes necessary, although anyone familiar with PC first-person shooters should be able to pick things up quickly.\n\nAs a whole, Half-Life tends to be a fairly difficult game, however the difficulty rarely comes from the same place as first-person shooters that came before it. The puzzles and three-dimensional platforming make up the core of the game, and the survival horror elements like limited ammunition and unique enemy AI and detection make Half-Life a thinking game. Rushing and running and gunning will be less successful than a patient and thoughtful strategy.\n\nDoes it use media effectively?\nHalf-Life looks great and it has aged fairly well. The environments are detailed and diverse, exploring the full range of the Black Mesa complex, inside and out. The creatures and alien weapons are creative, drawing on similar creatures from science fiction and putting a unique twist on them. The horror aspects of the game are well set up with plenty of jump scenes and tense moments. The soundtrack helps add to the suspense at times, while adding to the adrenaline of the actions scenes at others. The voice acting left a bit to be desired, even when the game came out, but the croaking computerized voice is a recognizable relic of Half-Life that you won't soon forget.\n\nBest moment in the game?\nHalf-Life has a lot of great moments, several of which involve blowing up helicopters, trains, or giant monsters. Half-Life also has a lot of great quiet moments, even the train ride to work at the beginning of the game is impressive in its own way. When I sat down to think about the best moment in the game, for me, one scene popped immediately to my mind. During the chapter Apprehension, you encounter your first Ichthyosaur, a giant fish rivaled only by the Boss Bass in Mario 3 in virtual-fish-frustration. The Ichthyosaur grabs a scientist in a flash when you first enter his domain, and soon you find yourself dangling over his pond in a cage, forced to confront the force of nature before you run out of oxygen. I remember this sequence as the one that made me jump the most during my first play through, and it holds up now. It is also when you receive the crossbow, and I'm a bit of a sucker for sniping weapons, but the scene is still really memorable with that fact aside.\n\nWho needs to play this game?\nYou mean you haven't played this game? Shame on you! Half-Life is a classic game and is often considered among the best in the history of gaming. Even 15 years later, it holds up extremely well. Even if you are not normally a fan of first-person shooters, this is not the action dredged game that you might expect; it has its moments, but they do not define the game. It plays closer to a faster paced survival horror game, full of atmosphere and puzzles and monsters. Half-Life is available on Steam and is frequently on sale during their sales. If you pick it up, I would highly suggest getting the pack that includes Opposing Force and Blue Shift, the two expansion games released by Valve.","timestamp_created":1385656083,"timestamp_updated":1385656083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524685263633728027","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7802710","author":{"steamid":"76561198075169020","num_games_owned":1210,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":193,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":82,"last_played":1493541537},"language":"english","review":"10/10 best game ever!","timestamp_created":1385631893,"timestamp_updated":1385631893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7802093","author":{"steamid":"76561197966267877","num_games_owned":410,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":4604,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4333,"last_played":1654544742},"language":"english","review":"A benchmark in computer game history that raised the bar for first person shooters and action games in general.","timestamp_created":1385627939,"timestamp_updated":1480407380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579222261905670166","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7801288","author":{"steamid":"76561198057678471","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":2500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2159,"last_played":1647254713},"language":"english","review":"There's literally no reason to hate this game.

Son succès incontestable ouvra la voie à ce qui est malheureusement devenu une solution de facilité pour la plupart des grosses boîtes d'aujourd'hui : Privilégier l'histoire au détriment d'un gameplay bien huilé. Heureusement des jeux capables de concilier les deux existent.\n\nJ'ai bien entendu apprécié le début du jeu. Mais ça s'est un peu gâté par la suite à cause des mouvements de Freeman. Se bloquer dans un mur tout plat, buter dans les marches d'escaliers, mourir parce qu'on a toucher le mur dans la cage d'ascenseur... (╬ Ò ‸ Ó)\n\nEt ne me dite surtout pas : [i]\"Ouais mais c'est un vieu jeu, faut être un peu clément\"[/i].\nLe moteur 3D de Half-Life, GoldSrc, est un dérivé du Quake Engine. Et même malgré l'âge, on bouge toujours très bien dans Quake 1.\n\nEn dehors de ce soucis, le scénario de Half-Life était déjà très bon.\nPasser les 5 premières minutes dans un wagon, suivant un rail dans un sous-terrain... Vous pouvez bien vous y déplacer mais il est vide et finalement peu spacieux. Rien qu'avec cela, le ton est donné concernant votre champ de liberté.\n[spoiler]Et pour le coup, la progression toute linéaire tout le long du jeu n'a rien de choquante. On pourrait même se demander si cela n'a pas justement motivé les développeurs à en faire un jeu particulièrement long pour son époque.\nEt le jeu se permettra à la toute fin de reboucler avec l'introduction en vous faisant miroiter le choix de suivre ou non le fameux G-Man. Deux fins pseudo-alternatives, or il est clair que si vous voulez vivre, vous n'avez juste pas le choix.\nEt pour pousser dans l'ironie, il se trouve que cette séquence a lieu dans le même wagon que l'introduction du jeu, alors qu'on avait pourtant été téléporté sur une planète extraterrestre.[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1384729446,"timestamp_updated":1439903965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7682677","author":{"steamid":"76561198018412369","num_games_owned":1287,"num_reviews":109,"playtime_forever":1048,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":950,"last_played":1506707562},"language":"english","review":"FPS genre started out with Id Software's Wolfenstein in 1992. \n\nThat same company later released Doom, and for quite a while most shooters were simply tagged as Doom Clones. Games like Quake, Duke Nukem, Shadow Warrior, Star Wars Dark Forces, Unreal were among them. These games lacked narrative and had a very maze like level design. It's very different from what we have today in our shooters.\n\nThen in 1998, came Half Life. Love it or hate it, this game is the blueprint for all the shooters that come out these days. It was among the first shooters to have narrative. To account for the narrative, it had to make the level design more linear. The game is driven by the story, so to say. Level would be build around it, having set pieces here and there.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nGames from the Doom era focused on you trying to avoid the incoming projectiles that are shot at you. They focused on mobility. Since they had a very maze like level design. They also would usually have a lot of secret places, where you could get better gear or ammo. Exploration was another thing that was focused on in older fps.\n\nHalf Life on other hand played differently from earlier FPS games. Accuracy wasn't something that was a thing back then, but with Half Life it was. You had a crosshair and you could not only look at x-axis, but also move your camera up and down (y-axis). All weapons in Half Life would also feature recoil on their guns.\n\nYou would also face enemies, with guns just like you. They would have cheater like accuracy. You wouldn't be able to dodge their incoming bullets. All you will be able to do is go behind cover.\n\nI hope you find all this familiar.\n\nThat said, Half Life did feature elements from Doom games - mostly when encountering aliens. Headcrabs for example will jump at you. Vortigons would shot a green beam with a few seconds of delay. There are some that that spit corrosive fluid. All of these are dodge-able. The game also has Grunts, which are very big bullet sponges.\n\nWhen encountering normal soldiers on other hand, it will play like today's shooter. Still, there is a fair amount of both in the game.\n\nThe game still has plenty of secret places with ammo and weapons stashes, so exploration isn't completely off the table.\n\nFinally, it features a lot of puzzle solving and platforming, which is a bit unusual for an FPS. I personally found it very frustrating.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nBack in the days, there was no story in FPS games. And even if there was, it would be delivered via cutscenes. Well, Half Life changed that. Like a said, a linear level design. Along that level, they would have friendly NPCs, with whom you could interact with, and cinematic set pieces. You would do more than just \"run and gun\".\n\nHalf Life story may not be unique, but it's about how they deliver it, that makes it so special. No one has ever done that, up till that point. They were the first.\n\nAlso, it may not look like it, but back then it was amazing. The game didn't even come to PS1 simply because the console couldn't handle the technology involved. Valve used GldSrc, which was based on Quake's engine. It's a groundbreaking game.\n\nThe only thing i want to complain about is the sounds. It really hurt my ears.\n\nThis game consists of 18 Chapters and an Epilogue, giving you 2 choices. It's fairly long - about 15 hours.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI really like Half Life. In fact i like it more than the second game. It has elements from both pre Half Life and post Half Life. I highly recommend it to anyone.\n\nCurrently, there is a fan made remake called Black Mesa. Better graphics, but the same game. It was developed since 2004 and was released to the public by 2012. That's 8 years of hard work. It's still missing 4 levels, but they plan to add them at some point. Nevertheless, i suggest you to support them.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/","timestamp_created":1384707882,"timestamp_updated":1470406284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637523412704467773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7678049","author":{"steamid":"76561198009430218","num_games_owned":912,"num_reviews":198,"playtime_forever":689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":689,"last_played":1384668380},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life is the game that set the standards to all first person shooters, this one being more and more interesting than the rest and several titles following it for it's mysterious protagonist, Gordon Freeman, and the bleak government cover-up attempt of the Black Mesa incident.

This is good. The gameplay is your regular, pretty hard good ol' shooter, but the story and atmosphere are superb. As I've said many times before, old games are masters of ambience, and Half-Life is master of masters. The best part about it is probably the eerily mysterious g-man, who you sometimes see calmly walking around an immense base, where, for reasons unknown, hell broke loose. \n\nYou play no part in the unleashing of hell. You are just some research assistant who is relatively new to the place and one day got caught up in this 'accident'. First you see this g-man walking around, obviously unaffected by the chaos, and you wonder what the fuck he has to do with this mess. Later the military shows up trying to kill everybody involved, and you're just trying to figure out what the hell happened. Right now I'm getting messages from the Lambda Team (no idea who they are) and I've done them some favours. I am seriously eager to meet them and shake some answers out of them. I won't spoil much more, but I think it's clear that the story is sublime. And if you've enjoyed HL2 without playing this game, get ready to re-enjoy the crap out of HL2. I was kinda playing HL2:EP2 and this through eachother, but when Alyx randomly said: 'Prepare for unforseen consequences' shivers went down every single one of my bones.

Choć wersja dostępna na platformie Steam jest nieco odświeżona w stosunku do oryginału z 1998 roku, to i tak jest to tylko poprawiony pod względem tekstur i ustawień graficznych 15-letni... hit.\n\nGra mimo swojego wieku wciąż potrafi zaskakiwać. Wstyd mi przyznać, że miałem okazję ukończyć ją dopiero w tym roku, ale z pewnością tego nie żałuję.\n\nGordon Freeman to pracownik laboratorium Black Mesa umiejscowionego gdzieś na pustkowiach Nowego Meksyku. Właśnie nadszedł czas na przeprowadzenie nowego eksperymentu, który na zawsze odmieni życie zarówno Freemana, jak i reszty pracowników Black Mesa.\n\nW wyniku nieszczęśliwego wypadku, otwarto portal pomiędzy Ziemią, a alternatywnym światem zwanym Xen. Od tej pory Freeman i pozostali pracownicy ośrodka badawczego muszą walczyć o przetrwanie i balansować pomiędzy dwoma równoległymi światami. Zagrożenie czyha nie tylko ze strony istot pozaziemskich, ale także sił opozycyjnych, których zadaniem jest schwytanie Gordona i pozbycie się wszelkich świadków...\n\nBrzmi trochę oklepanie? Ale jakże to grywalne!\n\nOd samego początku wiedziałem, że gram już w grę legendę, także trudno było mi jej nie rozliczać z tego tytułu. Ku mojemu(miłemu) zaskoczeniu, gra na to miano zasługuje. Mimo, iż to gra z gatunku FPS, to określenie jej mianem pierwszoosobowej strzelanki moim zdaniem trochę jej ubliża... Gra z początku przytłacza rozmiarem poziomów, które nie są prowadzone w sposób korytarzowy jak to ma miejsce np. w serii Call of Duty, mimo to, projekt poziomów stoi na tak wysokim poziomie, że zawsze wiemy, gdzie iść i co robić.\n\nInteligencja przeciwników jak na 1998 rok bije na głowę. Dla przykładu w grach takich jak Return to Castle Wolfenstein przeciwnicy z reguły prowadzą ostrzał z góry ustalonego miejsca. W Half-Life tak nie jest. Tutaj wrogowie(mowa głównie o nieustannie próbujących nas zabić żołnierzach) nie mają problemu z oflankowaniem nas, a kiedy mają potrzebę przeładowania broni lub nie są w stanie wytrzymać kolejnej serii z M4, lubią chować się za skrzyniami, skąd trudniej ich będzie trafić. Stworów ze świata Xen jest naprawdę dużo. Począwszy od przypominających kurczaki headcrabów, które nieustannie próbują, niczym facehugger z serii Obcy, wskoczyć nam na głowę, przez rażące piorunami Vortigaunty, po przypominające Uber Soldaty z późniejszego i wspomnianego już RtCW Alien Grunty.\n\nJeśli chodzi o bronie, mamy tu dostępny całkiem spory arsenał. Najbardziej kojarzony z serią łom, na początku jest niezbędny, by przetrwać, a później, jak najbardziej, wykorzystuje się go do rozwalania skrzynek z zaopatrzeniem. Oprócz tego mamy tu pistolety, wspomniany już karabin M4, a nawet bazookę, są także ściśle tajne prototypy oraz bronie wykorzystywane przez niektórych mieszkańców świata Xen.\n\nTaki zestaw jest niezbędny do pokonania bossów, których choć nie ma zbyt wielu, to każdy z nich z pewnością stanowi wyzwanie.\n\nMuzyka pojawia się niestety dość sporadycznie, ale tytuł radzi sobie i bez niej co najmniej dobrze. Utwory są krótkie, ale doskonale oddają klimat gier FPP z końca lat 90, a klimat ten w Half-Life jest przedni...\n\nPodsumowując, pierwszy Half-Life, to świetna gra dla fanów Quake'a, którzy chcieliby poznać wreszcie jakąś ciekawszą historię. Fabuła gry może nie jest sztuką, ale w kinach mamy masę blockbusterów z o wiele słabszym wątkiem.\n\nHalf-Life miał ogromny wpływ na całą branżę, a jego spuściznę możemy dostrzeć we wspomnianym po raz kolejny Return to Castle Wolfenstein, a nawet gier o wiele nowszych, takich jak np. seria Dead Space.\n\nJeśli jeszcze nie grałeś w pierwszą część serii Half-Life, musisz dać jej szansę.","timestamp_created":1383601323,"timestamp_updated":1385465401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7569385","author":{"steamid":"76561198038654689","num_games_owned":838,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1377977703},"language":"english","review":"Because this game relied on shock and awe cinematics back in the day of 1998, and I havn't really taken this game seriously at all and prefer to noclip to where devs wouldn't really want players to go.

The graphics are actually really good considering its age and the story and gameplay are simply on point. I highly recommend to play this game on Hard difficulty in order to get the best experience out of it. Playing on Normal Mode was fun but I felt more like an unbeatable super trained veteran marine than like a scientist just trying to survive a catastrophic scenario he accidentaly got thrown into. However, on Hard the Gaming experience changes a lot (positively):\n- you are very short on ammunition making you think twice weather you simply try to rambo everything with your guns or if you take the (really lethal) risk of trying to kill stuff with your crowbar or if you actually try to sneak past certain enemies\n- Aliens and Enemies in general HURT (they really do). This actually made me get scared of those Aliens. They might not (considering today's graphics standards) look scary as a 3D-Model but if they are actually able to kill you with ease you start to feel true fear if they suddenly pop up behind a corner you just walked by.\n- Your playstyle becomes a lot more stealthy and thoughtful. This is actually really realistic. I mean how should a scientist with no combat experience and conditioning apart from maybe having watched the Star Wars Series take out a huge Unit of special Forces together with a bunch of invading aliens if he doesn't try to outsmart and surprise them ?\nThese and some other experiences I gathered are really reasons to play this game on Hard difficulty. I was actually so surprised about how much better the Game felt on Hard that I decided to play all my future games on hard difficulty without beating it on any lower difficulty anymore. \nAs a result to my 30 hours journey into Half Life 1 I have to state that this is an awesome part of gaming history that everyone who calls himself a gamer should have played.","timestamp_created":1383506176,"timestamp_updated":1482315742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7536046","author":{"steamid":"76561198044770180","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":2698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2369,"last_played":1547273060},"language":"english","review":"Am I really sitting here writing about why Half-Life is good? Yes, I am, but that's because it's so amazingly fantastic, so mind-blowingly good, so unquestionably a masterpiece, that it deserves to have what has already been said about it millions of times said again by me. If there was any doubt in my mind that video games are art, it has been eradicated by this game and it's sequel. This may seem like an odd choice for claiming games are art, but I believe it has the depth, complexity, and emotional attachment that a true work of art has. People latch on to games like Braid as examples of games as art because they outwardly appear to be \"artsy\" games, with vague plots and symbolism and plenty of emotional torment thrown at you, but once you look deeper a certain amount of pretentiousness is revealed, and you have to question how meaningful such works really are. Half-Life is not pretentious. It is not trying to appear \"artsy,\" because it knows it has enough value to not have to hide behind such a facade to convince the public of it's worth. It may seem silly to reccomend such a famous game because \"everyone's played it,\" but no matter how famous a game is there will always be someone who hasn't played it (I know I have a whole bucket list of essential titles that remain unplayed, such as Final Fantasy VI and Resident Evil 4), and if that person is you, rectify the situation as soon as possible. It remains a staple of any gamer's collection for a reason. Just be careful dismounting ladders. Fall damage is a bitch in this game.\n\nScore: 10/10","timestamp_created":1383294100,"timestamp_updated":1505425393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533898293972015381","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7522889","author":{"steamid":"76561198069540604","num_games_owned":444,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":455,"last_played":1527196717},"language":"russian","review":"Старый-добрый Half-Life, для его прохождения потратил не много - не мало 18 часов, но не сожалею об этом.
