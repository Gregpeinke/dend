Но всегда можно начать дополнительного контента из Мастерской.\nСтоит отметить, что донат не особо и влияет на игровой процесс.

Конечно стоит не забывать про хороший мультиплеер, хотя что там, 95% игрового времени вы будете проводить там. Из наиболее приятных плюсов это сезонные ивенты, в которых разработчики дают заряд игре, что бы она еще жила и приносила прибыль.

Но при всем этом игра завлекает ощутимой стрельбой по серьезным противникам, требующих от вашей команды немалую отдачу. Вместе с медиативным аспектом на низких уровнях сложности, отлично располагающем к игре с друзьями.[/h1]\n\nСо временем появилось немного карт в режиме заданий, но изначально игровой режим в Killing Floor один. Это выживание на протяжении десяти волн, где после основной мясорубки начинается схватка с боссом. Какие-либо игровые правила не меняются, враги всегда одни и те же. Сколько можно продержаться в такой игре? 10, 50, 100 часов? \n\nВозможно, даже больше, о чем свидетельствуют некоторые игроки. С отсутствием какого-либо развития игровых правил, время за ней приобретает медиативный характер. Выжившие быстро разбираются с мутантами, бегут до магазина, а потом обратно на свои излюбленные позиции, чтобы продолжить отстрел. А стрелять в условиях выживания приятно, легко и чрезвычайно полезно. Этому поспособствовала физика повреждений, у монстров отрываются конечности, да и сами они ощутимо разлетаются под мощным огнем.   \n\nОдно лишь такое эстетическое удовольствие едва бы выиграло для Killing Floor хотя бы пары баллов. Просто эффектность ваших выстрелов сочетается еще и с опасностью, исходящую даже от самых маленьких болванчиков. Группа из трех клотов может схватить игрока и вкупе с его перезарядкой сыграть для него плачевный исход. Ползуны умирают чуть ли не с одного выстрела, но берсерку они являются в ночных кошмарах. Как и ободранные для огнеметчика. Рядом с вами не взрывается толстяк, не тянутся противные ручки и ничего не горит? Осторожно, к вам спешат отбивальщик и мясник, требующие особого внимания. \n\nTripwire постарались хорошо проработать игровые классы и их противодействие определенным мутантам. С выбором одного из шести классов в некоторых случаях даже координально меняется стиль игры. Берсерк быстр и вряд ли будет сидеть на месте, в то время, как техник наоборот предпочтет крепко заварить дверь и отсидеться в глухом коридоре. Медик окажется мало эффективным в бою, но благодаря прочному жилету не только выживет сам, но и приложит все усилия для лечения своих друзей. В целом для каждого выбора есть свой какой-то крауегольный камень в рядах противников, требующий поддержки со стороны. Важно учитывать, что все это распространяется больше на шесть игроков и повышенные уровни сложности, где количество денег сильно ограничено, а угроза мутантов повышена. \n\n[code]\n+ Хорошо проработанная механика столкновения с противником\n+ Эффект slow-mo прибавляет к зрелищности\n+ Карт и уровней сложности хватает с лихвой\n+ Уровни прокачки\n[/code]\n[code]\n- Противники все же странно двигаются на неровной местности. Переодически застревают в текстурах. \n- Версия Unreal Engine 2004 года\n- Сложности с созданием своего сервера. Приходится играть с друзьями на публичных и умирать из-за малоопытных игроков.\n- Большинство из карт - темные. Попадаются запутанные, тесные или черес чур большие.\n- Прокачка отдельных классов занимает слишком много времени.\n- Отсутствие связующего повествования и всего один игровой режим.\n[/code]\n\nФеномен первой части Killing Floor для 2016 года все же больше неоднозначен. Кто эти люди, только начавшие или продолжающие в нее играть? Ведь основной имеющийся здесь примитивизм был исправлен с выходом второй части. Без этого Killing Floor - это правильный, динамичный и кооперативный шутер 2009 года, в котором для успешного выживания по-настоящему хочется завести друзей.\n\n[h1]7 из 10. Среди достойных кооперативных шутеров про зомби есть не один лишь Left 4 Dead.[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ObServer#curation] Подписаться, чтобы отбивальщик рядом никогда не злился[/url]","timestamp_created":1386806730,"timestamp_updated":1469020389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":245,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.85493171215057373","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8010068","author":{"steamid":"76561198011795649","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1508332766},"language":"english","review":"Very fun to play.
