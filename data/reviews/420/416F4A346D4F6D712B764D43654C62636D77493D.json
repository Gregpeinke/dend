game with some fucking insane achievements. some of them (pedal to the metal, neighbourhood watch) are really fun (although neighbourhood watch is very tough even if you know what you're doing), and some of them (get some grub, little rocket man) are insanely annoying and tedious. thankfully, there are sections where you can leave the gnome behind, but the chapter riding shotgun is absolute hell, and it was by far my least favourite chapter to do with the gnome, despite being a favourite on a normal playthrough (i went through it with the gnome on normal difficulty, but i'm told that the chopper is less frustrating on easy). my favourite part of the game is definitely the antlion caves and hive. that environment is just so well realized and the setting complements the source engine's strengths. it is definitely the most hl1 thing valve has done since hl1.\n\nin summary: play this one [strike] to get to episode 3 [/strike] before playing alyx (if you can afford to lol), but do not go for the achievements on your first playthrough. it will probably ruin parts of the game for you.\n\nnote: the game is a bit buggy on intel hd, starting with some strange textures in riding shotgun and continuing into some occasional rendering freezes and weird model glitches (like the gnome becoming splintered and see-through). the final map of the game is particularily buggy but restarts fix it.","timestamp_created":1598558596,"timestamp_updated":1598558596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75017624","author":{"steamid":"76561198135123485","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4453,"last_played":1611693836},"language":"english","review":"Honestly

They have turned our eyes toward the stars.\"\n― Wallace Breen, addressing citizens' concerns about the Combine negating human reproduction.[src]\n \nThe Combine, abbreviated as CMB, and referred to in propaganda as \"Our Benefactors\"[2], is an immense inter-dimensional empire, comprised of a number of species either as allies or as slaves. The Combine's ultimate goal is to enslave and control the Multiverse.[3]\n\nFollowing the Black Mesa Incident, and the death of the Nihilanth, the Combine invaded Earth and emerged victorious from the ensuing war against the humans in a mere seven hours. Nevertheless, humanity did not remain subjugated, and nearly twenty years later, Earth's Resistance culminated in The Uprising, and the Combine were beaten thrice in pivotal battles.\n\nThese events were spearheaded by Gordon Freeman, having been released by The G-Man from stasis. The Combine serves as the overarching antagonistic force of the overall Half-life series and is the main antagonistic force of Half-Life 2, its episodes, and Half-Life: Alyx.","timestamp_created":1598287290,"timestamp_updated":1624542944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74839850","author":{"steamid":"76561198356861002","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":292,"last_played":1515606972},"language":"english","review":"neat","timestamp_created":1598281163,"timestamp_updated":1598281163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74837907","author":{"steamid":"76561199000982587","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":258,"last_played":1602248085},"language":"russian","review":"Ну это халва (умели раньше валв делать игры) так что это топ!","timestamp_created":1598278589,"timestamp_updated":1598278589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503816783428192139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74835815","author":{"steamid":"76561198979319278","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":397,"last_played":1597051506},"language":"russian","review":"Нуу... неплохо!

Story is just ridiculous, but some children may appreciate, that player-Gordon is constantly praised for his great achievements (to the point that it is laugable as well for an adult player). On the plus side is some nice nature scenery (a player in Ep2 does not constantly look at the typical HL hallmark concrete, although it is still present in abundance) and slightly improved graphics in comparison to HL2. It unfortunately also means even longer loading delays (another hallmark of series), that are still present on modern gaming computers, but graphics is obviously dated today.

longer than the first episode DLC, the second episode reintroduces a vehicle for you to use and some fun defensive set-pieces. Otherwise it's more of the same you'd expect from Half-Life.\n\nOnly problem with this game is that Valve leaves the story hanging and they haven't picked it up again for over a decade. Everyone's waiting for Half Life 3, but I have to say that the developers have probably run out of gameplay ideas, and what new ideas they had they poured into the Portal games.\n\nI say that because when you play enough half-life, the gameplay elements start to become somewhat repetitive and easy to figure out. They'll have to come up with something fresh for HL3 to push the technology if they don't go ahead and make a VR-only game.","timestamp_created":1597891229,"timestamp_updated":1597891229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74584260","author":{"steamid":"76561198143137799","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":152,"playtime_forever":1112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":997,"last_played":1597962394},"language":"english","review":"yes sir\n","timestamp_created":1597875401,"timestamp_updated":1597875401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74567892","author":{"steamid":"76561198797874537","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":354,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":354,"last_played":1596893048},"language":"english","review":"Best fucking too many year cliffhanger ever.","timestamp_created":1597852736,"timestamp_updated":1597852736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74561979","author":{"steamid":"76561198968660353","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1047,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":365,"last_played":1626806688},"language":"russian","review":"если эта игра не лучшая халва,то одна из лучших","timestamp_created":1597845203,"timestamp_updated":1597845203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74550349","author":{"steamid":"76561198219762519","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":255,"last_played":1597827497},"language":"russian","review":"4 часа проёбано","timestamp_created":1597827673,"timestamp_updated":1597827673,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.463461041450500488","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"74549806","author":{"steamid":"76561198314403143","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":392,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":392,"last_played":1582611084},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo do final sacana é esse kkkkkk.

Это происшествие никак не сказалось на здоровье Гордона, немножко только правое яйцо прищемило железками, но это пустяки.
