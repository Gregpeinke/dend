Front and center are dubious cnahges regarding game mechanics, such as regenerating shield and two weapon limit which affect combat in a profound way. But in my opinion the biggest downfall of all is the technical roughness. BioShock Infinite truly does not play well out of the box. Noticeable texture streaming, borderline unusable sensitivity settings, forced aim assist, stuttering, forced post processing effects - these are some of the most obvious nuisances. Take a look at PcGamingWiki article for this game and see for yourself - the list of troubles plaguing this game is downright impressive. And while many of them can be solved one way or another, a prospective player has got to ask oneself if it is worth it at all.\n\nFor many it was and it is. Many a player enjoy Infinite's story, atmosphere and twists despite all the technical shortcomings. Whether or not you are a kind of player that looks past the bad to see the good is up to you and only you to decide. \n\nI have beaten the game years ago, but haven't gotten to actually writing a review until now.

up for the spectacle, but buy it on sale\n\nThe connection to Rapture seems contrived. The setting and atmosphere of the games couldn't be more different, so the only way they COULD connect them together is with a bunch of trans-dimensional hogwash which doesn't sit right with me. Individual games and game series end up continuing on through spiritual successors all the time, so I don't think many people at all would bat an eye if they just kept the game worlds separate and had no real, tangible connection like the tears. People know what motifs are, you don't need to have a rock solid reason for your new setting to have vigors, or the lighthouse, or a steampunk vibe, or the large mechanically augmented damage sponge mini-boss. Fixating too much on having a \"good\" explanation of these items' origins in columbia (particularly the vigors) just led the devs to the correct conclusion that there [b]isn't[/b] a good reason for them to be there, so the only way to maintain that physical connection between the settings was to basically throw their hands up and say \"eh, we're already jumping between universes, let's just say they stole them from rapture\". This physical connection between the settings also constrains the developers of future titles since they may feel obligated to maintain it while also trying to avoid retconing older games (though, despite their clumsiness, retcons aren't a big deal in my book since you can just pretend the new games don't exist).\n\nIt was an inelegant solution and an elegant one wasn't necessary anyway. I understand and, to a degree, even commend the desire to have a solid justification for stuff like vigors since it's objectively better than a half-baked one. However, re-treading old ground with rapture (and retconing it at that) is basically punting the ball and stops this from being a solid justification and with this setting and these elements they're trying to carry over, I don't think there is one. The developers would have been better off keeping the connection between the settings confined to the ending sequence with its \"constants and variables\".\n\nThe gameplay got pretty fun near the end, though it was still slightly annoying and, in spite of the fun, most of what I recall is bog standard fps gameplay. It's due in no small part to me using the same two weapons for about 80% of the game, but considering the combination of a two weapon limit and an upgrade system, the game actually coerces players to play this way.\n\nThe whole southern religious vibe seemed to be getting laid on thicker and thicker in the last ~1/4 of the game and I kind of liked it. The hymn songs about faith and jesus and stuff just felt rather, i guess you could say welcoming? idk, I just like it despite not being religious myself. It sold a really heavy feel-good, soothing, harmonious atmosphere (I found it easy to disregard the quantum physics stuff entirely, being unable to do so would have changed my opinion a bit I'm sure).\n\nI'm not sure it's worth a replay since there's too much standard fps gameplay before the good stuff, and i don't even think starting where it gets good would go over too well. The story's pacing will get in the way of all the shooting too much if you just want to jump in for the gameplay, and even disregarding that, Fink's factory is quite a slog and takes up just under a quarter of the game (or about half of the game after the \"intro phase\", which in this situation would be getting skipped).\n\nThe environments kind of run the gambit in terms of quality. The paranormal/supernatrual stuff like comstock's lab (the snowy entrance anyway) and the lighthouses are pretty cool. The normal environments vary a bit. I [b]really[/b] like booker's past baptism at the end of the game, and entering columbia and the hall of heroes displays before fighting slate (like comstock on the bridge) are alright, but the boardwalks are meh and all the industrial shit and slums are a REAL drag to get through.\n\nI think the key is to split \"environments\" into the setpieces and the combat areas, the former I find interesting, but the latter are generally ass (for exhibitive purposes, see Fink's areas, the ghetto, the boardwalks and all of columbia after [spoiler]killing daisy[/spoiler]). I don't mean this to put down the developers' capabilities, the combat areas all contributed well to the late 19th/early 20th century atmosphere; they nailed what they were going for. My main issue is that I just think it's ugly and boring, which is a bad thing to have along with less than spectacular gameplay\n\nStepping away from personal taste though, I feel the two types of environments, if not in direct conflict with one another, are at least tugging the game in their own separate directions which really hurts the setting's cohesion. Half of the game is pushing the magical flying city angle with the quantum balloons, vigors, tears and tesla-esque machinery, while the other half is pushing second industrial revolution with bits of independence-era americana. Contrast this with rapture which had a nearly [b]perfect[/b] trifecta of bottom of the sea floor location with art deco and steampunk styles. The sea floor alone has a [b]much[/b] stronger presence given how exotic it is and the number of ways you can set up the environment to keep that in the player's mind, but it also pairs amazingly with art deco (given Ryan's whole \"pushing boundries through unfettered individualism\" idea) and even gels better with steampunk than a city in the clouds supported by quantum physics with a bunch of interlocking islands that feel as disparate as sections of a theme park (how that happened despite them mostly being from the same time period I'm not sure).\n\nLastly, although phonographs fit the setting, audio diaries are way too played out. Also, booker regularly telling himself what he should do is annoying.","timestamp_created":1653066700,"timestamp_updated":1653066700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115728015","author":{"steamid":"76561198849584192","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":2682,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2642,"last_played":1657463267},"language":"brazilian","review":"Não acredito que demorei quase 10 anos para jogar essa obra de arte !","timestamp_created":1653041993,"timestamp_updated":1653041993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115719950","author":{"steamid":"76561198206619308","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1357,"last_played":1519554867},"language":"schinese","review":"什么是第九艺术啊！！！","timestamp_created":1653022779,"timestamp_updated":1653022779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115718865","author":{"steamid":"76561198856981882","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1798,"last_played":1653361135},"language":"english","review":"I have played this game so many times.

This game is not as good as 1 or 2 in many ways.\n\nCombat is not particularly satisfying overall.\n\n1. Tonics - less liberty to build your power\nYou no longer have physical tonics and whatnot to build your character. You wouldve had 18 slots (6 combat tonics, 6 physical tonics and 6 security tonics) to diversify your build but  instead you get shitty \"Gears\" that you can only simultaneously wear 4. \n\n2. Enemies - less fun, more annoying.\nInstead of houdini splicers they split the teleportation and fire ability into two enemy types. You have some crow-loving-teleporting men that teleport next to you to melee you, not much of a threat really. But then you had the fire-projectile enemy that acts liked a field cannon and shot explosives that damaged you even if you were behind cover. At least in the previous games you could research nitro splicers so that they could only throw duds, and you can also use telekinesis to counter nitro. The game had enemies with RPG as well. It was fairly common to meet these annoying enemies in the game. \n\nAlso in this game you have the handyman which were big daddies but worse. Instead of big daddies who just wanted to protect the little sisters, you have these handymen who really just serve as the brute type enemies of which I could hardly care. They have no interesting motivation to fight except the game demand so. These handyman were also annoying to fight against base on the simple fact that the camera shake like its fucking earthquake all the time. It was more mobile than big daddies. It did AOE damage so fuck covers. Its pure garbage. \n\nThe enemies in this game were more of a bullet sponge than in the previous games. \n\n3. Controls - just felt worse\nI do not know how but as clumsy as the controls for plasmid/weapon in 1 were, this game felt worse. You want to just jump normally? Sorry theres a skyline here and youre going there instead. You want to select other weapons weapons? Just hold scroll (wtf) to select from all your weapons... and if you rebind the key you can no longer use scroll to switch the two weapons that you were using. They even managed to butcher the control in the DLC for some stupid reasons.\n\n4. Weapons - more weapons but largely useless\nThere were more guns but some guns were simply inferior/annoying to use while in the first 2 games each weapon had their roles and you'd probably use 70% of the weapons you had.\n\n5. Plasmids - meh\nPlasmids animation style was worse. Plasmids themselves were less interesting. For example, instead of using decoys to distract turrents and instant hack them, you just use possession to temporarily take control of the turrents... except the fact that possession is a projectile that misses often.\n\n6. Research - gone\nA part of the fun in the original bioshocks 1 was to stun enemies and take their pics. In 2 you could hit a variety of plasmids on the enemies to increase your research score. Theres no research here so theres less fun to have with plasmids.\n\n7. Tears:\nTear was a new mechanic that i found mostly useless except to distract the enemies for but a few seconds. \n\n8. Health kids and Hypos:\nYou can no longer buy extra meds or hypo cuz reasons. Instead Elizebath will throw useful stuff (e.g. when youre low on ammo/health) at you during combat. It made her useful but also took away the players' control and now you just rely on RNG to give you a hand.\n\nThe story was a mess and they sacrifice a coherent/satisfying story-telling to make plot twists. Some dialogues make no sense as if they were triggered too early. You may talk to elizebath about one thing despite the thing was not revealed yet and act all casual only to react to it strongly later in the game when the thing is properly revealed. Your bond with her also seem forced. She should not have trust you so much given your motivation.\n\n","timestamp_created":1652633725,"timestamp_updated":1652633725,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hK2p5IADeszQuAM="}
