The story, much like its successor, is full of memorable and likable characters, creatively designed monsters, and is overall a well written plot.

It is also very challenging, even on the easy difficulty, as you need to economize weapons and supplies and perform tricky platforming.

The game offers a great mix of puzzle solving and action.\n\n+ The game has a variety of different weapons to fit the situation at hand as well as your playstyle\n\n+ For an old game the AI is surprisingly pretty good, granted it does get stupid sometimes but that is forgivable\n\n+ I love the sound effects in the game.

You'll be faced with something new every time, which is somthing most games need to stay fun. Another great thing was the amount of different wepons you keep finding thoughout the entire game, so by the end you have somthing like 20 different wepons (with most of then having a right click secondary fire).\n\nThe graphics in the game were terrible (but it was made in 1998 so thats ok). The level design was ok (but sometimes you crouch lower then you thought was posible). There is no sprint, only nomal, walk and crouch. The AI sucked, because they somtimes have too fast or too slow reactions, it's really hard to sneak up on them, they occasionly shoot at you before they've finished turning to face you, and some enemys kill you instantly (but your speed make up for most of these problems with the AI).
