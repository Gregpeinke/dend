Czy było warto? Cóż.. dawno nie byłem tak pozytywnie zaskoczony grą, która wydawała się tym samym co poprzedniczka ale nieco ulepszonym. Tymczasem tu wszystko jest lepsze do kwadratu albo i lepiej  'do sześcianu' ;) Sequel jest znacznie ulepszony, przyjemniejszy, zabawniejszy, urozmaicony oraz posiada przyjemną fabułę ze zwrotami akcji. Tak TA GRA MA FABUŁĘ. Zaskakująco dobrą, choć nie jest to fabuła rodem z gier RPG a głównie rozmowy i perypetie AI oraz innych 'głosów'(bez spoilerowania) z masą ironii oraz czarnego humoru a miejscami nawet nutką grozy. Czasem czułem się niczym w Bioshock lub też w Falloutach. Wszystko jednak jest przyjemnie przedstawiane z dubbingiem aktorów i muzyką na czele. Głosy i teksty to majstersztyk, stałem nie raz w miejscu by usłyszeć wszystkie dialogi/monologi postaci. Doszło wiele nowych i ciekawych rozwiązań, które dają czasem kilka możliwości rozwiązania zagadek. Natomiast sama koncówka to cudo. Jedno z lepszych zakonczeń jakie widziałem w grach. Do tego Creditsy i scena po nich również. Nie wiem jednak czy to przez doświadczenie z jedynką czy też rzeczywiście tak jest ale gra wydaje się łatwiejsza niż poprzedniczka. Możliwe , że zagadki wydają się dość logiczne i szybko wpadamy na to jak je rozwiązać. Nieco za dużo jednak jest szukania miejsc na portale w dalekiej odległości oraz samych dużych przestrzeni w środkowej części gry. Ale to tylko moje odczucie. Dodano tryb co-op, który z pozoru wydaje się niczym ciekawym ale to niemal druga część gry z 'też jakąś fabułą' - polecam sprawdzić i pograć ze znajomym, zwłaszcza dla końcówki po dodatkowym 6 rozdziale. Podsumowując - GRA GENIALNA, każdy fan Portal MUSI zagrać.

Portal 2 lets you guide brave yet mute heroine Chell though a series of puzzles all in hope of escaping Apeture Labs. However (SPOILER ALERT) Wheatley, your companion and helper throughout the game, stops your plans in your tracks after he betrays you when he takes over GladOS's body. Then Chell must go though the oldest parts of Apeture, and return to fight Wheatley. Overall a great game, and some humor scattered around the game makes the game enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1437622929,"timestamp_updated":1437622929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501793920993804932","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17180711","author":{"steamid":"76561198230951904","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1029,"last_played":1591095096},"language":"english","review":"I am not what most people would call a \"gamer\".  I gravitate more toward card and board games, or their digital counterparts.  But I'd just gotten a new computer with a pretty powerful video card and was looking for something to try out with it.\n\nI don't like most \"shooter\" games, or anything where you have to have perfect lightning reflexes.  But this game (along with Portal 1) was recommended to me by some friends so I figured I would trust them and give it a whirl.\n\nPortal 1 was fun and interesting and proved to be an interesting challenge, even including the parts where you're getting shot at.  But Portal 2 is an entirely new level of superb game design and play.  It keeps the same general puzzle format of its predecessor, but adds in several new features, like the various liquids you can spray to change the game dynamics.  \n\nOn top of that, the characters of the robots that both accompany and confront you are delightfully creative and add a lot to the feel of the game.  Stephen Merchant is a pretty hilarious narrator as he bumbles along and intersects your gameplay at several points.\n\nBut for me, the brilliance that floored me the most came from two places: One was the boggling walk through decrepit historical Aperture facilities with a cohesive storyline that reveals a lot about both the company, and the figures you interact with.  The other was this was the first game I've ever seen where some of the levels actually blended together.  Many of these games are just a sequence of levels you have to conquer one by one.  This is the first time I've seen one that you actually have to advance, then backtrack, then proceed forward again to complete it.  Unexpected, but brilliant.\n\nThe final boss scene is pretty complex and I had to resort to some help (a walkthrough) to understand what I was supposed to be doing, and even then it's still a challenge to do everything at just the right time.\n\nAll in all, I found this game breathtaking and spellbinding and couldn't stop talking about it or thinking about it for days after finishing it.  Highly highly recommended for people who like some thinking with their gaming.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1437611521,"timestamp_updated":1437611637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17180263","author":{"steamid":"76561198042267552","num_games_owned":239,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":847,"last_played":1587816373},"language":"english","review":"its god","timestamp_created":1437608549,"timestamp_updated":1454694884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17180042","author":{"steamid":"76561198138448631","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":561,"last_played":1437606881},"language":"greek","review":"Nice gameplay and Nice story .","timestamp_created":1437607153,"timestamp_updated":1437607153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17178390","author":{"steamid":"76561198128202734","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":604,"last_played":1654626450},"language":"english","review":"Portal is a puzzle game where you Navigate test rooms and avoid obstacles by making Einstein your bitch","timestamp_created":1437598429,"timestamp_updated":1497799927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17177928","author":{"steamid":"76561198004107431","num_games_owned":741,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1466,"last_played":1619047384},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would throw friend into room full of sentry turrets at Mach 8 again.","timestamp_created":1437596176,"timestamp_updated":1437596176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17177272","author":{"steamid":"76561198061405467","num_games_owned":346,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":711,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":702,"last_played":1454116679},"language":"english","review":"Great game","timestamp_created":1437593228,"timestamp_updated":1437593228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17176092","author":{"steamid":"76561198153912912","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1376,"last_played":1437914867},"language":"turkish","review":"gayet iyi bir oyun ama bu oyunu aksiyon için almayın","timestamp_created":1437588180,"timestamp_updated":1437588180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17175928","author":{"steamid":"76561198207929948","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":5290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1560,"last_played":1626359372},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever 100/10","timestamp_created":1437587450,"timestamp_updated":1437587450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwifW4284CeNfCQQ=="}
