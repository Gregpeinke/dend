Balancing these more arcade mechanics - frantic movement speeds, excellent accuracy while not using sights, and near-perfect accuracy while ADS - with more \"realistic\" mechanics like scope sway, players dropping their weapons when they get shot in the arm, and suppressing fire that effects players' aim was undoubtedly a tough task for the DoD team... and somehow, they pulled it off. \n\nBoth DoD games are well worth a purchase for anyone interested in seeing early \"arcade realism\" FPS design experimentation. I'd recommend the original to anyone who'd like to see the game's mechanics distilled to their utter basics, and Source to anyone who's interested in seeing what the technological achievements of Source brought to the table. Note: the first game had factions, weapons, and maps that aren't present in its Source version at all. Which is yet another reason I'd honestly recommend purchasing both games, if you can. Also, [i]please[/i] pick up Day of Infamy, 'cause that game's a pretty perfect unofficial third entry in the series.","timestamp_created":1312054079,"timestamp_updated":1652167694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3491624","author":{"steamid":"76561198023648319","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":2960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2871,"last_played":1376096779},"language":"english","review":"I do not like alot of WWII shooters but if your a fan of this one, try this.
