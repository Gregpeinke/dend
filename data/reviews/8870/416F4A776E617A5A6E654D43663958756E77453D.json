[spoiler] The way the different universes work the end should have to happen, it could have had a much better ending [/spoiler].

Вы не найдете здесь запредельной сложности и тщательного продумывания боя как во второй части, когда нужно было подготавливаться к перестрелкам. Расстановка ловушек, грамотное использование плазмидов, выбор правильного оружия и боеприпаса, тактика.... все это кануло в лета и любые сложные места сводятся к отстрелу обоймы пока работает щит, а дальше кружим от неприятеля вокруг укрытия и методично расчищаем путь. Энергетики по большей части бесполезны и лишь часть из них оказывается реально полезной во второй половине игры. Торговые автоматы щедро расставлены по уровням и проблем с боеприпасами на харде почти не было. Взлом убрали как таковой и для открытия запертых дверей нужно лишь найти отмычку и отдать приказ Элизабет, после чего через пару секунд она откроет дверь.\nБоевка в общем стала примитивной и скучной, но что же на счет сюжета? Сюжет хорош, но увы для полного понимания происходящего все же придется дотошно разыскивать все голософоны, раскрывающие нюансы сюжета, а также требуется приобрести еще два сюжетных DLC, в которых более подробно раскрывается история, а так же бонусом объясняется начало первой части. Все три части с DLC на самом деле связаны между собой и это не просто набор сюжетов про создание идеального города для жизни и его увядание... это одна вселенная, в которой всё происходит не просто так, но за этим всем нужно следить иначе можно легко запутаться и получить обычный сюжетный винегрет.\nИгру настоятельно рекомендую, она стоит своих денег, как и предыдущие части.

Play this game if you love story in general, Bioshock in general, and don't have a fear of giant mechanical birds attacking you constantly while you're trying to bring a girl to Paris...or New York...it gets complicated.\n\nHaving re-played the game, couple things:\n\n1) This trailer makes no sense. It's cool af, but considering who Elizabeth is, this never would have taken place.\n\n2) While I do LOVE this game...it sadly didn't live up to the expectations the other two laid down. 2 is still the absolute best of the trilogy, and this game just didn't do much to set it apart from the first two. Colombia is basically just the reverse of Rapture: instead of athiesm, it's Christianity; Instead of water, it's air; instead of Big Daddies, you have Songbird, etc.\n\n3) The ending deals with quantum mechanics, the multiverse theory, and a whole bunch of scientific hypothesis and quantum entanglements, most of which likely goes over a player's head entirely. It's very convoluted, and most people likely didn't completely understand the ending without having to Google it after the fact. And then there's the grandfather paradox which...**sighs** goes into a whole new level of problems.\n\n4) The gameplay is unremarkable, save for the addition of a few weapons that, if used correctly, made even the hardest levels much easier, namely the sniper rifle and carbine. Weapon selection was, to put it bluntly, poor. Having tried each of the weapons at least once, and now realizing that some of them are literally just tweaked versions of each other (the Hail Fire and Volley Gun come to mind), roughly half of the weapon list I found myself actively avoiding unless I literally ran out of ammo for everything else. Weapons that are good: Machine gun, Carbine, Sniper Rifle, RPG, Crank Gun, Shotgun (NOT the Heater). I could hesitantly add the standard Pistol, because it's sort of a Jack-of-All-Trades weapon that only really let me down when I was facing someone/something that was tougher than normal/a large group of enemies. Everything else is utter garbage.\n\nVigors, Infinite's version of Plasmids which use Salts, Infinite's version of EVE, were equally as underwhelming. Throughout the game, you eventually gain access to only 8 Vigors total...compared to the nearly two dozen in Rapture. Standard Fire/Electricity ones, a few that affect the environment like Bronco and Undertow, though the ones you'll get the most out of are Possession and Return to Sender, the latter of which is a bloody godsend on harder levels. \n\nThe former is Infinite's answer to 2's hacking bonus, where you'd get some random item for free from the machine if you did super-well at hacking. You don't even hack in the game, you just use Possession on a vending machine and it spits out money that you can collect and then re-use on the machine. More or less gives you a one-time discount. The latter is for when you're in the thick of it, being slammed into from all sides by enemy fire. At it's base, it's a last-ditch get out of jail free card, and even allows you to accumulate the damage you WOULD have gotten, and send it right back as a ball of pure pain and suffering. Depending on how much you accumulate, you can kill nearly anything in the game this way, even Handymen. At max level, you can absorb ammo from your opponent's shots, decrease the Salts used to keep it active, and thus use it more frequently and more effectively.\n\nOverall, I would write this game off as a sub-par entry were it not for the story, which is likely why it has such good ratings. The story is phenomenal. Absolutely amazing. Yes, the ending does more or less drag it down, but the addition of a voice for the protagonist, Booker DeWitt, as opposed to Jack from 1 and Delta from 2 who were voiceless, adds a whole new depth and feeling of reality to the game. Elizabeth is...well, one of the best supporting characters you could ask for. She's not a useless POS like some characters I know of (Ashley Graham from RE 4 comes to mind), and has such strong supporting abilities that she could easily act as a protagonist all her own later on in the game. It doesn't hurt that she's very pretty, to boot, but that's more icing on the cake as opposed to the actual cake itself.\n\nSummary: The story, despite it's convoluted ending, takes what would be a sub-par game and allows it to stand proudly among it's otherwise better brethren in the trilogy of Bioshock. Anyone who's a fan of Bioshock should absolutely play this game. Anyone who's a fan of quantum mechanics should ALSO play this game. Anyone who enjoys a compelling story from start to finish will enjoy this game. Those who dislike birds need not apply.","timestamp_created":1526030403,"timestamp_updated":1526030403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41975732","author":{"steamid":"76561198117775245","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":858,"last_played":1520805646},"language":"german","review":"Story Hammer!

Формально есть и оружие, и вид от первого лица, и интересные решения по части механики боя. Но в целом - стрелять скучновато. И легко.\n\nК счастью, не самая привлекательная шутерная механика с лихвой компенсируется Сюжетом. С большой буквы. Потому что это реально круто, даже для прожженного меня. Раскрытие персонажей, конфликт, кульминация и катарсис - все на высоте! Только ради этого игру стоит пройти. Обязательно! Но есть и иные плюсы.\n\nПлюсы:\n1. Как уже сказал - сюжет. Очень грамотная подача. И концовка не слита, что тоже редкость в наше время.\n2. Элизабет. Наблюдать за тем, как меняется ее персонаж по ходу событий игры, невероятно интересно. Фактически - лучшая часть игры.\n3. Дизайн. Локации летающего города невероятно детализованы и красивы, даже с поправкой на возраст игры.\n\nМинусы тоже есть.\n1. Единственный серьезный минус - неправильный выбор жанра. Рассказывать такую потрясающую историю в жанре шутера - кощунство. Да и шутера как такового не получилось. Враги глуповаты, механика оружия какая-то невнятная местами.\n2. Низкая сложность. Играть нужно на hard. Иной уровень сложности выбирайте только, если Bioshock: Infinite - первая игра в вашей жизни.\nОстальное - придирки, которые не портят впечатления в целом.\n3. Лут. В первых частях это обясняется, здесь - нет. Зачем копаться по мусоркам в поисках патронов и аптечек? Все есть в магазинах же. Почему энергетиками практически никто не пользуется? Почему в \"голодающих\" трущобах в мусорках полно еды?\n4. Анимация. Немного буратинообразная.\n\nРезюмирую: шутером лучше взять Doom. Сильная сторона этой игры - сюжет. Лучший в 2013 году и все еще один из лучших сегодня.\n","timestamp_created":1525772320,"timestamp_updated":1525772320,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49824562668800354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41913931","author":{"steamid":"76561198067937686","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":624,"last_played":1483666029},"language":"english","review":"Fun Game, good story, but kinda linear.

Me lo estuvieron recomendando durante mcuho tiempo y cuando lo jugue no me arrepentí para nada de jugarlo. Es triple a diferente con sus partes buenas y malas, pero al final es un buen juego. La parte mala es que hay muchas veces que te fuerzan a pelear simplemente para que el juego dure mas y hay bastantes combates que son inecesarios, no obstante tiene otros muy necesarios y bastante epicos, esto en parte se compensa con el sistema de combate diferente a otros juego ya típico de la saga bipshock. El punto fuerte sin lugar a dudas es su historia, una historia algo compleja de entender pero muy intrigante y con personajes bien desarrollados a los que se les coje cariño con mucha facilidad. Si puedes perdonar los pequeños fallos de este juego a cambio de una buena historia te recomiendo que juegues Bioshock Infinite,si te gusto juega tambien los DLCs que estan a la altura del juego principal.\n\n Gracias por su atención.","timestamp_created":1525731322,"timestamp_updated":1525731322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41911738","author":{"steamid":"76561198051762021","num_games_owned":758,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2865,"last_played":1541566494},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic story and characters, excellent combat system and a stunning world to explore.
