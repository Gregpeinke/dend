Во время первой попытки я, сам того не осознавая, почти прошёл игру, но нервы не выдержали и было принято решение взять перерыв. А второй этап случился совсем недавно, мне пришлось потратить всего несколько часов для завершения начатого.\n С вступлением закончили, преступаем к обзору:\n1. Мир: тот же самый. События игры Half-Life Opposing Force происходят параллельно событиям игры Half-Life, по этому мир не изменился.\n2. Механики: интересные. Несколько нововведений неплохо разбавляют игру. Механики перекочевавшие из предыдущей игры работают безупречно.\n3. Баги: отсутствуют. Мне не попалось ни единого бага. Вполне возможно по тому, что я наиграл слишком мало часов чтобы их встретить.  \n Минусы: \n-Стилистика: устаревшая, хотя мне это не помешало играть.\n-Управление: инерционное. После того как вы отпустите клавишу движения, персонаж остановится не сразу, а через несколько секунд, будто двигаясь по инерции.\n-Компоновка: неадекватна. Затишье и экшен сменяют друг друга слишком резко, из-за чего игрок не понимает, когда он может перевести дух.\n-Нелинейная линейность: сейчас объясню. Игра Half-Life Opposing Force является линейным (коридорным) шутером, но при этом в \"коридорах\" слишком много бесполезных ответвлений. \n-Финальный босс: личное мнение. Интересная идея загубленная огромным здоровьем червя или кто он там.\nСкажу честно, Нихилант был лучше: интереснее, сложнее и как бос чувствовался крепче.\nИгра Half-Life Opposing Force не совсем ужасная, но советовать её не могу никому. Если решите играть, то Бог вам в помощь.","timestamp_created":1636712675,"timestamp_updated":1636730076,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518031775951385498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102623425","author":{"steamid":"76561198010939085","num_games_owned":793,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":326,"last_played":1644421949},"language":"english","review":"OpFor might honestly be better than Half-Life 1, but I still recommend playing (or at least watching a playthrough of) the base game first, as the story heavily entwines with it.\n\nIt might have too many weapons (including a sentient grappling hook and a BFG), a couple new annoying enemies, and an obligatory Xen section that must be included in any unofficial Half-Life story, but Opposing Force executes itself well enough that it eclipses the base game.\n\nValve, where the fuck is Adrian Shepard?","timestamp_created":1636685867,"timestamp_updated":1636685867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102611763","author":{"steamid":"76561198857598353","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1647849443},"language":"polish","review":"Tak polecam 100%","timestamp_created":1636666228,"timestamp_updated":1636666228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102604504","author":{"steamid":"76561198332927738","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":431,"last_played":1589116456},"language":"english","review":"I like this one better than og Half-Life.

Учитывая изложенные факты любая другая студия скорее все потонула бы под тонной условностей, да вот Valve поступила хитрее. В Gearbox работают настоящие трудяги, умеющие из сомнительных концепций выжимать максимум и с Opposing Force они не подкачали. Управлять оперативником Шепардом на удивление интересно, он быстро движется по сюжетным рельсам, динамично справляясь с волнами инопланетных и вполне земных противников, а также решая лёгкие физические головоломки. В игре куда более удобная стрельба и более злые по сравнению с оригиналом соперники, ну а пушка в виде живого барнакла меня порадовала как ребёнка. Из небольших недочётов отмечу длину продолжения (около 3 часов) и более прямолинейный геймплей. Всё таки первая Халфа куда более монструозна.

Во-вторых, под конец прохождения игра становится чрезвычайно сложной, даже на легком уровне сложности.
