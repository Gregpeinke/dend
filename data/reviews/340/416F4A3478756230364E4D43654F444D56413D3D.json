Lost Coast is a removed section of the original Half Life 2 game in which you liberate a small sea-side town from the Combine forces. What intrests me the most is that the Fisherman NPC, a NPC exclusive to this REMOVED section, is one of, if not Valve's highest quality NPC's when it comes to detail and animations. This intruiges me since he was removed, and never seen again in the HL series, or in any other Valve game (to my knowlegde).\n\nOverall, I'd suggest getting it in a bundle, not as a single purchase.

Coast is a spin-off to Half-Life 2 where Gordon finds himself at a sea port town where a fisherman informs Gordon that the Combine have a gun cannon base in the town and needs to be shut down. So Gordon takes on the job by killing the Combine soldiers stationed in the town in order to get to the cannon that needs to be dealt with. While it has the same graphics and game play as Half-Life 2, this game is completely non-canon to the franchise as it doesn't fit anywhere in the Half-Life franchise. I like to think of it as a dream Gordon had at some point, cause originally I thought it takes place before Half-Life 2, except Gordon has his Gravity Gun which he obtain during Half-Life 2 so it's a dream sequence in my opinion. The game is short in length but worth playing if you want to play something related Half-Life but just don't expect to witness anything that provides more to the franchise cause it doesn't.","timestamp_created":1462944394,"timestamp_updated":1462944394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22877423","author":{"steamid":"76561198257314709","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":46,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1466666871},"language":"english","review":"I got this game for free alongside Half-Life 2 for some reason :/","timestamp_created":1462788922,"timestamp_updated":1462788922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563611626625061035","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22869020","author":{"steamid":"76561198141519076","num_games_owned":330,"num_reviews":92,"playtime_forever":30,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30,"last_played":1448702452},"language":"turkish","review":"Gaben'dan e-mail adresini alma simülatörü.","timestamp_created":1462735994,"timestamp_updated":1462735994,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22833574","author":{"steamid":"76561197987843932","num_games_owned":490,"num_reviews":96,"playtime_forever":59,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":59,"last_played":1381090247},"language":"english","review":"I do recommend you play this cut Half-Life 2 chapter.","timestamp_created":1462570381,"timestamp_updated":1462570381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22812932","author":{"steamid":"76561198056956482","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":20,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20,"last_played":1462464793},"language":"english","review":"This is just a showcase of HDR, lighting and such.

It's a short mission cut from the campaign of HL2 that also serves to showcase the high dynamic range Lighting added to the Source engine a bit after the release of the game. This is pretty much a fancy way of saying \"improved lighting anf draw distance\", and it certainly shows. \n\nGoing in, I knew Lost Coast was gonna be pretty short, but I had no idea it was gonna be only 20 minutes long -- in fact, I spent around half as much time fiddling with the options as I did playing through the game for the first time. If you want an idea of how short Lost Coast is, I'll list literally everything that happens:\n\n1. Gordon wakes up on a beach with a crud ton of weapons\n2. Some old fisherman tells Gordon to destroy a Headcrab Shell launcher\n3. Gordon ascends a mountain and shoots some Combine soliders\n4. Gordon comes across a monestary and (most likely) tries in vain to open all the locked doors\n5. Gordon enters the church where the launcher is and jams it with a random object\n6. Gordon is assaulted by more soldiers and takes them out\n7. Gordon takes on a helicopter with a rocket launcher\n8. Gordon takes an elivator back down to the beach\n9. THE END\n\nWhile this demo may be only half as long as I expected, the few enemy encounters are all enjoyable, and the brevity serves the game's replay value. If you're like me, you'll want to play it again several times so you can explore every nook and cranny of the coast. In fact, it's even possible to reach the city of St. Olga! Read the guide below to get a step by step tutorial of how to reach the island:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=195911970\n\nOne of the things you'll notice when you begin the mission is the beautiful sight of an oceanside town in the distance, which would have been concealed by a cloud of \"fog\" in the original HL2. HDRL would've have made the coast of Highway 17 look so much better that I almost wish HL2 would've been further delayed so the feature could be implemented. Combine that with incredibly detailed environment, and even over a deccade later, Lost Coast looks stunning.\n\nAside from its brevity, my only issues with HL2: Lost Coast are its lack of enemy variety (you only come across soldiers, poison Headcrabs, and a chopper) and the scarcity of Kelly Bailey's pulse-pounding techno soundtrack.\n\nIf you've already purchased Half-Life 2, you'll be able to install Lost Coast for free, and the fun you'll have more than justifies adding this title to your library.","timestamp_created":1459739799,"timestamp_updated":1485037412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22228775","author":{"steamid":"76561198058812262","num_games_owned":184,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":21,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1459729672},"language":"english","review":"Great replay value!","timestamp_created":1459729991,"timestamp_updated":1459729991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22213505","author":{"steamid":"76561198273562844","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":39,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1459767252},"language":"koreana","review":"27분만에 엔딩보구 왔습니다 근데 많은걸 한거같은 기분이네요","timestamp_created":1459671119,"timestamp_updated":1459671119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53608250617980957","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22208430","author":{"steamid":"76561198179134515","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":389,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":177,"last_played":1517544027},"language":"english","review":"very good game love it\n","timestamp_created":1459643355,"timestamp_updated":1459643355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22188909","author":{"steamid":"76561197982628667","num_games_owned":549,"num_reviews":292,"playtime_forever":24,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1558757435},"language":"english","review":"It's fun\n\nRather Half-Life over this.","timestamp_created":1459562792,"timestamp_updated":1459562792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487083077430725098","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22177288","author":{"steamid":"76561198129493429","num_games_owned":428,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":65,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65,"last_played":1455130792},"language":"english","review":"If you like hl but dont have the money for it this is a short but fun game so download it have fun!","timestamp_created":1459514193,"timestamp_updated":1459514193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xub06NMCeODMVA=="}
