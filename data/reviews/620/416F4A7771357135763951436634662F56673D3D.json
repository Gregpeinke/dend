I regret that I haven't put much time into it. \n\nI don't know what I can say about this game that hasn't been iterated already. \n\n- The story will leave you with several different emotions over the course of the game, ranging from joyful and adventurous, to vengeful and enraged. On top of that, there are constant moments in the game that can become rather comedic, directly or indirectly, and really make the game that much more enjoyable. It keeps your spirits up, and legitimately allows you to forget that your character's life is on the line!\n\n- The characters are likable and developed. You know some of these characters from the previous installment, and there still is plenty of room left to develop them. You found a likable villain in the first game, and despite all of those moments of rivalry, betrayal, and demise in the first game, you find respect for them in this game, and like them all the more. Among that, you also have new characters that are always interesting, and when you think you begin to have an understanding of the character, the story throws a curveball, and they're trying to kill you to pursue what they believe is right.\n\n- The audio... oh man. The voice acting is incredible in this game. Ellen McLain can still provide an incredible performance as her returning character. I don't know much about Stephen Merchant, but his performance makes me want to look more into his other material. Dee Bradley Baker even takes part in this game, voicing some of the robots. Dee Bradley Baker. The king of voicing animals and making noises.\n\nAnd then... J.K. Simmons. I'm at a loss of what to say about his performance, it's that good. He allows his character to be enjoyable, have comedic moments, be hilariously eccentric, and still allow the character to be one of the most believable characters I've seen in recent times. And yes, I am a Gravity Falls fan. After his performance as Ford, I would play this game over again just to hear that stunning voice of his. \n\nIn terms of other audio, the soundtrack is incredible, really giving your actions in the game that extra energy and motivation. However, it's the sound effects that really finalize this game and fill in that final piece to create a truly iconic game. \n\nI cannot praise this game enough. I would strongly urge other people that, if they were looking into buying a game, this would be at the very top of my recommendations. This is a must-play for players of any genre.","timestamp_created":1462809406,"timestamp_updated":1462809406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22879437","author":{"steamid":"76561198177777235","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":358,"last_played":1455372132},"language":"russian","review":"Одно из лучших творений в игровой индустрии!","timestamp_created":1462800619,"timestamp_updated":1462800619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22879417","author":{"steamid":"76561198258022753","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":323,"last_played":1592986873},"language":"russian","review":"Хоть я головоломки и не очень люблю, но игра мне правда очень понравилась! 10/10","timestamp_created":1462800557,"timestamp_updated":1462800557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22879241","author":{"steamid":"76561198154568747","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1186,"last_played":1513426830},"language":"japanese","review":"FPS視点のアクションパズルゲームで一度は遊んでいただきたいゲームです。\n\n1Pと2Pのステージは同じではないでの２度楽しめる為おすすめです。","timestamp_created":1462799746,"timestamp_updated":1462799746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498084276914596558","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22878531","author":{"steamid":"76561198185478705","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2205,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1264,"last_played":1525518895},"language":"english","review":"BUY IT RIGHT NOW DO NOT LOOK AT THE REVIEWS THE GAME IS WORTH MUCH MORE THAN 20$","timestamp_created":1462796174,"timestamp_updated":1462796174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22877108","author":{"steamid":"76561198202670632","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1023,"last_played":1514823498},"language":"russian","review":"Как тот, кто до конца прошёл одиночную кампанию, я смело могу рекомендовать игру.

And really, you're going to enjoy both of them, so why not play both? This one is at least twice as good as the first Portal, though -- for me. Not only does it introduce new puzzle elements and devices, but the humor is a good combination of the dry, sarcastic humor from the first game and a bit more of an obvious, British-type humor.
