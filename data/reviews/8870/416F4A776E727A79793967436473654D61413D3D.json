Mehrere Male fügen sich im letzten Drittel die Puzzleteile im Kopf des Spielers zusammen und lassen die Kinnlade förmlich runterfallen. Wer viel Wert auf die Handlung legt, wird hier nicht enttäuscht.\nAuch atmosphärisch ist Bioshock Infinite sehr stark und entwickelt mit seiner detailierten Grafik und den lebendigen Leveldesign eine kleine eigene Welt, in welche man sich einlebt.\nDiese Stärken lassen die zu vielen Kämpfe verschmerzen, die mit der Zeit zu einfach werden und dann als Hindernis zwischen dem nächsten Storyteil gesehen werden. Die Schießereien machen Laune und oft kann man durch verschiedene Wege den Gegner cool austricksen. Aber man hat schnell die Kniffe raus und dann ist Infinite bis zum Ende keine Herausforderung mehr.
