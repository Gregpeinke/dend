After a friend [i]insisted[/i] that I buy this game multiple times, I finally grabbed it on sale for $4.99. Let me say that it's probably the best $4.99 I've spent in awhile. This game perplexed me, and honestly I couldn't complete it without the help of a walkthrough, it's that challenging. It forces you to think in a way that you usually don't in puzzle games, and that's what makes its play style so unique. \n\nThe final boss battle is fast-paced and you have to think quickly or die. And I did die a few times, but it was fun. Well, I suppose if you want to include the entire game, I died way more than a few times...\nThe entire game is story-rich and has some \"humorous\" jokes as well. Apparently robots [i]can[/i] have a sense of humor. Our future society is at risk.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to, well, everyone. It requires some practice, patience and critical thinking, but it was well worth my money and even at full price is worth every penny. I plan on playing through it again at least once. Haven't tried co-op yet but I'm sure that's just as great.
