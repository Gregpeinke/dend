Unlike other players who have only experienced the glory of Ricochet for 5 minutes of their unproductive waste of lives, I have achieved the euphoric life changing exception to human flaws known as Ricochet for more than 1,200 hours. \n\nRicochet has brought me many gifts, and one of those gifts granted to me is my burned  retinas, allowing a new way of peering into this world, for example, you filthy subspecies can look at something and see smooth seams and vertices, but to me, every defined corner has a distinct glow illuminating even the darkest of voids with the same semblance of a low polygonal object. The people around me are no longer just people to me, for every person I see is just a target waiting for the sweet release of a flung Laserdisc to decapitate them, breaking them from their meager existence that have been ignorant to the touch formed by the greatest thing our Creator Lord Gaben has granted to us. \n\nYou see, Half-Life was put on this Earth to distract the people of the Steam Civilization, which was built in his image to hide the true gift in plain sight. You may ask for some merit for such a preposterous statement, if you can take the time and listen to my story you too will be enlightened by the masterpiece: Ricochet. \n\nOnce I reached 1,200 hours, all servers seemingly went down to reveal only one remaining, the name of this server only contained one letter: G, even though such a queer disruption of my playtime was ensuing, I was blinded by the addictive desire to play Ricochet to pay any attention. It was password protected, but it didn't stop me from trying to breach into the glorious arena, I tried a series of standard passwords such as: Valve, Steam, Ricochet, etc. After a great many attempts, I sat back and thought hard on some clues, the maker of all the things I've dedicated my life to is Lord Gaben, and the server name is just “G”, it all made sense. The password must be: “Gabe Newell is GOD”... I was correct, how could I be so arrogant and stupid, it was so obvious and everybody knows God and Gaben are synonymous. \n\nMy router began beaming my request into the entangled web and it shot back connecting me to the server, there, I sat in the goldsource downloading menu which displayed various things that were in a language beyond human comprehension. Once the seemingly endless amount of time I sat there came to an end and I was in the server, my player spawned facing my opponent. The timer rang loud while the anticipation for a glorious fight grew, the same old countdown vibrations that were hitting my ears ended and the game began. \n\nThe other player, which possessed the absence of a player name, began his launch forwards my platform, though he was quick witted hopping from platform to platform with an ease and finesse, my raw aim and skill carried me through the entire skirmish. The points stacked up and time seemed to fade away, my mind was of nothing besides the match. Laserdisc after laserdisc, my arms grew tired, my stomach ached for more snacks, my eyes burned bright red like gems, all biological interfaces stability were now corrupting, but my soul was now even more infused with the game. My opponent no longer seemed like a stranger, I began to know him better than even myself, his play style grew into appearance and his strategical follies were now unearthed allowing me to achieve the first 1,000 points and the victory I strained myself for. \n\nThe host timescale froze, and our characters were now stuck in a dimension absent of change, this broke my flow state and allowed me to tear my eyes away from the luminessence to just stare off into my dark room. This was a good chance to reflect on the event which had taken place just seconds ago. I knew I just finished an accomplishment, but, an accomplishment of what? It just didn’t make sense, why would something like that even happen? Is this real? Or am I in a dream? Before I could ponder my mind into its own world, a barrage of steam notifications came flying to my account, it was from the man I had just faced, his message read as so: “come look outside,” before I could even finish the message I heard a revving of a powerful engine drawing me from my shitty office chair. There he was… Gaben standing in front of his 2014 Porsche Cayman packed with a 911s engine. I was ecstatic and ran down to greet him, but before I could speak he put his hand up and spoke…\n\n“Quiet, I know what you’re thinking, lets just go and all your questions will fade away, like shit games in Greenlight.”\n\nWe hopped in Gaben’s 2014 Porsche Cayman, packed with a 911s engine, and zoomed off to Valve Headquarters. I’m not much of a talker, and I didn’t get any more talkative sitting next to my all time hero and man whom is richer than both [i]Oprah[/i] and [i]The Don[/i], but I could tell he wasn’t much of a talker himself as we only spoke once, which was only about his car. He went into great detail about it, especially about his cars mods which he emphasized that they were “paid mods, just how they should be!”\n\nAfter a couple hours passed and the smoothness of the car ride which brought me a nice nap ended, we were at the doors of Valve’s new office. I busted through the doors and was overwhelmed by all the memorabilia that poured into my senses like a nice big glass of Ruby Red Squirt. Gaben, watched me prance corner to corner in excitement from the entrance, giving a Jolly laugh reminiscent of old Saint Nic (and its rumored they are actually cut from the same bloodline); we spent all day with each other playing Source games and just chatting it up on the latest games, I really got to know the guy on a personal level which was really nice, but we knew this was just an entree to the main meal, a meal of something which was about to shock the gaming world forever.\n\nGaben led me to the janitors closet, that seemed rank until he pulled a secret lever disguised as a stale box of cheez-its, that opened to a lair full of hundreds of programmers and other various game designers, we walked through the legions of workers to Gaben’s Throne. From there he sat high and mighty, drawing the utmost power from it, his voice boomed across the dark den of nerd stench congratulating me on my skill…\n\n“[b]YOU[/b]! Are the chosen one, the messiah, the man which will bring news that will change the landscape of gaming as we know it!” A giant projector dropped down from the ceiling and started beaming what would become everything my life was building up for. \n\nValve’s logo blared with its eardrum piercing music, which melted in with the rest of the cacophony that displayed a timeline of Valve and its image before fading away to a new title, the title formed from all the signature intellectual properties Valve owns to read word for word one at a time: “Counter. Strike. Global. Trade.” \n\nAnd before me was a new Counter Strike game where you cant kill people or do any of the other classic things you would do in a Counter Strike game, as the game was just a fucking excel like spreadsheet meant for trading virtual fucking skins.

I see myself to be perpetually indebted to whatever deity unfurled the momentary lapse and position in which not only is this masterwork accessible, but also that I dwell in the juncture of living among the virtuosos who gave birth to the interactive marvel. How might a single mind solicit to inspect such a transcendent monument? Be forewarned, dear reader, that I, nor any man, could possibly hope to dissect a work of this calibur by his lonesome. Hell, I refuse to consider that an array of one thousand strong could decipher it! However, similar the prodigies that created it, I can only hope to muster the copious amounts of genius pouring from this work and cram it into the confines of the english language.\n\nUpon initiating \"Ricochet\", you are greeted with so much symbolism to consume that most average citizens of our realm would choose to exit such a dense and meaningful screen. It is too much to the man with an anemic consciousness. I hardly know where to start when considering bringing this knowledge to the common people. I shall begin with how the work addresses the aboriginal of life and nature itself--birth. The anterior screen showcases many images, one of which tends to dominate the human's attention, as it is the most leviathan icon currently viewable. The gargantuan circle adorned by futuristic glows and structures is a symbol for the birth of the individual, as well as the birth of man into the technological age. Allow me to elaborate. The neo-digital ring depicted is an obvious allusion to the birth canal that nature devised each human to pass through. \"Ricochet\" proves this by how close up to the circular (or rather, somewhat polygonal) shape the art goer is. The moment is almost demonstrated as if your head is about to pass through, yet you are not quite out yet. You, dear reader, may be asking \"Well, if it were the birth canal depicted, why isn't there a light on the other end? Isn't that usually how the birthing process is shown?\" Well dear reader, you are absolutely right! Keen observation of yours, if I do say so myself! However, this is clearly intentional coinciding the entirety of \"Ricochet\"'s premise. You see, \"Ricochet\" proposes that in a rapidly advancing digital age, you are born into as much shadow as you were conceived in originally, hence the futuristic design of the configuration. Whether or not the craftsmen of this piece intended to imply that we are merely headed in that direction or we have already lived this concept is entirely disputable. There is much, much more to discuss about this object, but for now the picture requires more context, so I shall leave it at that. Moving on to the next point of interest, another image stands out. Yes, the icon associated with the game's title (to be discussed later)--the feature's logo. On first observation, one may assume the logo is but a relapse of something straight out of a 1980's film--font and all. Be that as it may, the visual holds a profound connotation. When the logo is rotated 180 degrees, the image appears to imitate the lower section of a triangle! Of course! Now, as you would assume from such a work, this holds a variety of nuance. However, I will discuss my interpretation of the logo's meaning. You see, the bottom of a triangle can be associated with the masses. The largest in number, yet trampled upon by its aristocratic counterparts. A classic case of the proletariats versus the bourgeoisie. The logo attaches itself with the work--\"Ricochet\". Clearly, the masterpiece's author's intended to represent the common man. Not only that, but the logo suggests something more, as it is rotated so the bottom of the triangle is at the top, The rotation confronts the idea that this piece will give the proletariats the power to overthrow the few that control them and restore power back to mankind itself. While this has not happened, I presume that the craftsmen who administered \"Ricochet\" assumed that would happen. That is one of the major reasons for the game's futuristic settings, after all. \"Ricochet\" shall not bring light to the people until technology and the people have collided with one another, allowing the work's true power to disseminate. Such tenacity bequeaths my soul optimism for our posterity. What beauty to behold, the day \"Ricochet\" provides its rightful nectar to the dry third eyes of the public! Excuse me, I got a tad passionate there. Yet, the principal still stands. I digress, there is more to discuss, and so little allotment for one lifetime! The next immensely abstract element of \"Ricochet\"'s title card are its four options. Of course, an important element to any interactive piece: choice. \"Ricochet\" insinuates that any choice you make can be boiled down into four simple decisions: \"Find, Create, Options, and Quit\". Allow me to elaborate on each of those phrases. Find--discovery, you choose to make a journey of some kind to quench your nature-given curiosity. You may not only find what is on the outside, but also evaluate what is on the inside. Create--to craft, to make something of your own. To use your abilities to craft your own solution to any problem. To create is to show yourself to others, much like the artists of \"Ricochet\". Options--to alter or change how you will solve a problem. You may not solve the solution in the most efficient way, but by changing how you operate, you can avoid any negative feedback one may receive. And finally, quit--to cease, to make null any progress of your heart and mind. To stop evil, or to stifle good. The most threatening and harsh choice of them all. Each of these choices can be intertwined with one another, yet they each build a unique experience. Moving along with my simple observations, the first two options specifically state the word \"Server\", along with \"Find\" and \"Create\". It's my humble opinion that the word \"Server\" serves as an opportunity for the creators to manifest a dissection of religions and their deities and how they are found by many people, and how each and every one of them was also created by many people. A \"server\" is someone who, well, serves another man. Many look to gods as mere reflections of mankind, showing them as forgiving or blessing, rather than a lonesome creator of all. The authors of \"Ricochet\" point out the obvious irony that humankind tends to worship themselves when establishing religions based around gods. These deities, while on a surface level they are higher than humans, are merely there to serve as a torch to show man its way. \"Ricochet\" shows these two options alongside one another to demonstrate how comedic and silly the concept of religion seems to be. While you may not personally agree with those statements (and I may not as well), it is the view of mankind that the work builds. True or not, the work still stands. While there are many more avenues of the starting screen, one man cannot possibly see them all. I, for one, cannot hope to understand every concept displayed. Therefore, I must continue my analysis.\n\nWithout getting into the still immensely compact consequences for selecting one of the phrases, the systems of \"Ricochet\" hold a host of implications. First off, you, the player, control a clearly hominoid individual. You represent a member of the public. A representation of the base of the triangle of class, as discussed earlier. In this future, you are pitted against another bipedal combatant, to serve as entertainment for the bourgeoisie. There is no other explaination of the rediculous colours you are adorned with. It's an allegory for a sport, two opposite teams compete against eachother to entertain--\n\nWait, I'm running out of space!
