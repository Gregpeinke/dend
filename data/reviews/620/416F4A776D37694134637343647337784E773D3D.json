Ale po kolei. Grę udało mi się kupić za 1,5€; w innym przypadku raczej bym się na nią nie zdecydował, pomimo wielu pozytywnych komentarzy zasłyszanych na jej temat. Prawdopodobnie również bym w nią nie zagrał, ale byłem po formacie dysku, nudziło mi się, a Portal tak mało zajmuje... Zmotywowany nadmiarem wolnego czasu - i wolnego łącza - zostałem porwany w wir (portal...?) zabawy! \nOgólne założenia są wręcz ordynarnie proste: za pomocą działka tworzącego dwa portale przedostań się do wyjścia. Ale z czasem zyskujemy możliwość korzystania z pudełek, zakrzywiających światło \"pryzmatów\", kilku rodzajów żelu, mostów świetlnych i kilku innych drobiazgów. Sprawia to, że gra nigdy nie staje sięmonotonna. Poziom zagadek jest, według mnie, wyważony. Nigdy nie są przesadnie trudne, czasem po prostu wystarczy wrócić do gry za jakiś czas, ze świeżym umysłem. Pod sam koniec zagadki są proste, ale jest to uzasadnione fabularnie. \nJeśli już mowa o fabule - jest ona świetna! Co prawda nasza protagonistka jest niema, lecz GLaDOS i Wheatley rekompensują to z nawiązką. Ich teksty są genialne. Nie zdawałem sobie sprawy, że tak dobra i zabawna fabuła może być wykreowana za pomocą jedynie dwójki bohaterów. Ale czym byłaby świetnie opowiedziana historia, jeśli nie potrafi się jej dobrze zakończyć? Portal 2 na szczęście posiada nieprzewidywalny, satysfakcjonujący i zabawny finał. Po prostu cudo.\nJeśli chodzi o grafikę, to jest ona... praktyczna. Nie twierdzę, że jest brzydka, ale nie jest również najładniejsza gra (choć to może być wynik upływu czasu, nie wiem). Niemniej jednak, Portal wygląda znośnie, grafika nie rozprasza a tytuł działa wybornie również na starszym sprzęcie. Odgłosy i muzyka są dobre, ale to głos dwójki wspomnianych wcześniej bohaterów gra pierwsze skrzypce; słucha się ich z przyjemnością.\nDlaczego zatem nie uważam Portala 2 za grę idealną? Przez sporą część rozgrywki -  - niewiele się dzieje. Ot, przechodzimy z jednego pomieszczenia do drugiego... i tyle. Również niektóre zagadki są denerwujące nie przez swoją trudność, ale przez to, że czasami jedynym problemem jest znalezienie skrawka ściany/sufitu/podłogi, gdzie możemy otworzyć portal. Ale to drobiazgi.\nOczywiście grę polecam, nie tylko fanom łamigłówek logicznych, ale w zasadzie każdemu, kto lubi w coś pograć. Nie jest to gra dostarczająca tyle adrenaliny, co najnowsze tytuły AAA, ale satysfakcja z przejścia Portalu 2 jest zdecydowanie większa!","timestamp_created":1425146278,"timestamp_updated":1479926364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14695340","author":{"steamid":"76561198022910770","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":37075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33127,"last_played":1566487677},"language":"russian","review":"Эта игра отлично подходит для  двух игроков.

The Perpetual Testing Initiative also lets players create their own chambers without having to know much about Hammer or any of those fancy things. There's only two parts that annoy me:\n1. Controller support. They say it has FULL support for 'em, but most of the UI of the Testing Initiative does not work, like in example when you've already subscribed to one or more chambers, pressing DPAD UP or DOWN or moving the joystick at all after having selected \"Play singleplayer chambers\" does totally nothing. Also, if you were to accidentally select Robot Loadout on the main menu with the controller, go get your mouse. You will not be able to exit it with your gamepad. The mouse isn't hidden while using the controller (in-menus), which is honestly [b]VERY[/b] annoying since when in menus, it usually selects what's in the middle of the screen. In gameplay itself, however, it's good. You can at least customize the controls, but sometimes, it doesn't work and you gotta toggle between Default 1 and Custom until it finally updates. The part that you can't make chambers with the controller is understandable...enough.\n\n2. Splitscreen Co-op on one computer. It just throws you right into the game, completely ignoring wether you're a CS:GO pro or a COD noob. No co-op intro. No nothing. You don't get any keybind/controller hints in the intro of the game like you do in the retail version, either...you gotta figure out how to go back to bed yourself. Not that that troubles me, but...\n[i]\"For your convenience, all the test chambers are now unlocked.\"\n[b]-The Announcer[/b][/i]\n\nNow, for the pros. It's got a good story line, continues off of Portal, except several years after 'murdering' GLaDOS, and has a round Personality Sphere called Weedly, who apperently does not smoke. (Yes, that was a lie. His real name is Wheatley) Only thing bad about the story is they have no more cake. It is never mentioned. NO. CAKE!\n\nGraphics-wise, great. To be 2011. This isn't exactly a next-gen game, but it's okay. Only thing I don't get, is how you shoot Portals. The gun doesn't even have a bloody trigger. It doesn't have a clean trigger either. Hand transplant?\n\nThere's lots of new gameplay on here, including in the intro, which includes old chambers from Portal and some new ones which are original. Except on certain chambers later in the game, I just sat there. And started at all corners of a chamber. I was like \"What the (BEEP) am I supposed to do!?\" and forced myself after 2 hours of thinking to go to the Portal 2 wiki just to find out the answer was obvious. That's what I usually call the \"Legend of Zelda effect\".\nNot saying you'll end up like that, but just might happen. Certain chambers just require you to act fast as *BEEP*, so if you're \"simple-minded, old, or just irradiated in such a way the future should [i]not[/i] start with you,\" or don't know how to move a camera, don't play this.\n\nTotal rating (ignoring the lack of controller support on most areas of the UI): 8/10.\nAlso, a quick note...if you own two Wireless xbox 360 gamepads and have an adapter, or own 2 wired gamepads, you can play splitscreen co-op with yourself if you're a loner.

Зато какой! Отточив перья и логику на первой части, Valve выпустила образцовый сиквел, к которому почти не придраться. Локации масштабнее и разнообразнее, графика — техничнее, повествование — глубже. Основа основ — по-прежнему пушка, создающая два взаимосвязанных портала, правда, механика стала гораздо сложнее.\n  Раньше я просто дырявила поверхности, дабы миновать зону обстрела или притащить ящик в нужную точку. Теперь в уравнение добавлена целая охапка параметров. Лазерные лучи и кубические линзы, их преломляющие. Световые мостики для перемещения по воздуху или, если поставить их «ребром», защиты от охранных турелей. Пластина, подбрасывающая объекты. Гравитационные тоннели, которые подхватывают и медленно уносят все, что в них попадает. Три типа гелевой краски: синяя усиливает прыжок, оранжевая здорово ускоряет разбег, белая делает любую плоскость пригодной для открытия портала. (В раннем прототипе был четвертый оттенок, позволявший ходить по стенам и потолкам; его списали в утиль, когда тестеров начало подташнивать.)\n  Изменений — куча, только Valve не спешит вываливать их разом. Из главы в главу дизайнеры потихоньку переписывают правила, приучая мыслить новыми категориями. Уровни рассчитаны идеально: в меру хитрые, чтобы бросить вызов и растормошить серые клеточки, но без уклона в садизм. В худшем случае вы потратите 15-20 минут на поиски решения, стукнете кулаком о стол и почувствуете себя дураком — ибо ответ лежал перед глазами. В лучшем — порадуетесь, как быстро вы разгрызли еще один кусочек гранита. Portal 2 вообще благосклонна — для каждого многоходового пазла предусмотрены невидимые «чекпойнты»; если допустите фатальную ошибку в миллиметре от победы, вам не придется повторять все с нуля.\n  Отполирован до блеска и режим совместной игры, чьи звезды — закадычные друзья-роботы P-body и Atlas — заимствовали интерфейсные наработки Left 4 Dead. Радиальное меню команд предлагает на выбор не только веселые жесты, но и полезные функции. Например, целеуказатель, значок «открой мне здесь портал» и таймер (отличная штука, когда нас просят синхронно потянуть два рубильника).
