Whereas left 4 dead focuses mainly on making it to an objective whilst w+m1-ing all the way with weapons found lying around, killing floor focuses on the teamwork side of things. Without a communicating, coorperative team, winning a round is near-impossible. This attribute can be creditted partially to the perk system the game uses. By choosing from one of 6 possible perks, players can focus on different specimens to kill, strategies to use, and tactics to put into acion. Take the commando, for example. This perk focuses on assault rifles, and is unable to kill any large specimens. Paired with a sharpshooter, who can take out these specimens, but who has a difficut time taking out masses of them, they are unstoppable, the sharpshooter killing big guys and the commando kiling mobs of small ones.

Decent graphics, TONS of replayability, very fun, and super intense. You team up with 5 friends and try and survive 4 to 10 waves (depending on server settings) of 100+ Zeds (not zombies) that continuously spawn all around the map. There are 9 different types of zeds (excluding the boss - which is fought on the last wave) and each zed has their own way/weapon of choise for killing you and your teammates, and a couple are VERY dangerous and VERY tough to kill. There are 7 different classes to choose from - all with their own special abilities, strengths, and weaknesses - and an ass load of weapons to choose from. I definitely recommend this game!
