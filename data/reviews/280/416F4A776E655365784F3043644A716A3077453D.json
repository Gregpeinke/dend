Игра так себе раз и багована два. Графика улучшена местами и похожа на франкенштейна, как говорят люди мыло(растянутые текстуры) плюс детализация местами все выглядит инородно. Вещи некотороые блестят слишком сильно, оружие, некоторые места, ботинки пехотинцев. \nБаги такие есть:\nХитбокс вертолета о как же сложно попасть, в оригинале он проходится нормально.\nБарнаклы могут вас засосать, но при этом щупальце то не свисает, просто как фишка не плохо, но в оригинале не так.\nГонарч плюет и после квадраты черные какие то.\nЕще я застрял в проходе при наступлении вертолета и не мог выйти, но тут помогла загрузка.\nЕще в одном месте поплыли текстуры скайбокса, у меня чуть голова не закружилась.\n\nЛокализация странная, местами на русском озвучка, там с костюмом связанные, а диалоги на английском.\n\nПройти то можно, но зачем? Если в оригинале нет таких ошибок и игрется приятней.","timestamp_created":1570351260,"timestamp_updated":1570351578,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623180985450744629","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55447360","author":{"steamid":"76561198155448713","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1442,"last_played":1632646629},"language":"english","review":"This game has tons of errors due to the updates of this game. :(","timestamp_created":1570217108,"timestamp_updated":1570217108,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55436966","author":{"steamid":"76561198882487079","num_games_owned":535,"num_reviews":121,"playtime_forever":1618,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1244,"last_played":1590104462},"language":"russian","review":"🐓🐔🐔","timestamp_created":1570167003,"timestamp_updated":1570167003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55431457","author":{"steamid":"76561198197315821","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":236,"last_played":1597436549},"language":"english","review":"One of the most popular series Half-Life.I rate it for 10/10 because this game has good story and graphics :)","timestamp_created":1570133869,"timestamp_updated":1570133869,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55430016","author":{"steamid":"76561198307482477","num_games_owned":670,"num_reviews":180,"playtime_forever":288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":288,"last_played":1570126684},"language":"english","review":"Default HL + source game engine","timestamp_created":1570127473,"timestamp_updated":1570127473,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477319151163101196","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55415517","author":{"steamid":"76561198327047502","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":419,"last_played":1572821519},"language":"english","review":"got trapped in an endless death loop bc i entered a checkpoint with like 5 hp and didn't manually save. now i have to restart the entire chapter. this game makes me go \"nngh. augh. augh. nngh\"","timestamp_created":1570059640,"timestamp_updated":1570059640,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454834610223770142","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55414499","author":{"steamid":"76561198446737577","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":723,"last_played":1590843762},"language":"english","review":"Good","timestamp_created":1570054021,"timestamp_updated":1570054021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55410998","author":{"steamid":"76561198974520522","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1570198607},"language":"english","review":"Neat portation of the original.\n\nIt's a total bugfest too apparently.","timestamp_created":1570038835,"timestamp_updated":1570038835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"55384484","author":{"steamid":"76561198086796541","num_games_owned":648,"num_reviews":1019,"playtime_forever":98,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1569952211},"language":"english","review":"Yes!
