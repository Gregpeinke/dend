If you liked any of the previous Shock games then don't bother, Colombia is a laughable world that puts looking pretty and being navigable by a child over being sensible or deep. No  more map, to make sure you've explored everywhere and have a sense of the location, now there's just an arrow button to lead you to the next fetch quest objective.\n\nIf you like FPS games, don't bother. Infinite has a greater weapon variety than previous, but a 2 weapon limit, which means you don't get the same sense of attachment to your guns as you did previously, they don't stick around for more than a few minutes before running out of ammo. Bullet sponge enemies return, ensuring only the most powerful weapons (namely the sniper) are anywhere near satisfying.\n\nIf you like political stories or quantum mechanics, don't bother. What holds Infinite back is how simultaneously hard and soft it goes on its themes. Colombia is a straw-city of nationalism turned to racism, but outside of \"racism is bad, black people have to hide their intelligence because the whites are insecure, but they also heavily advertise a Chinese gun mechanic by the name of Chen Lin\". I've lost count of the times I encountered signs saying \"racial purity\" or something of the sort in all manner of places, really for no other reason than to be shocking. This game is so edgy it hurts, maybe racism is used to control people, but any exploration of how nationalism leads to racism or how a malicious government can manipulate the populace into being racist is missing. All of the racism stuff, along with some The Jungle-esque classism feels like it's for its own sake, for the player to be shocked. It's not shocking though, it's cartoonish. This includes the \"abolitionist\" household having 2 giant replicas of the same painting of Lincoln proudly displayed when that would be rather foolish in their location, or the giant JW Booth statue. A lot of this goes for the Quantum BS throughout as well. There's one mention of probability, which is obviously a big deal with quantum mechanics, but besides that none of it is informative nor internally consistent. It's magic that works however Ken Levine thought would be the coolest. Becoming crazy when another universe's version of you being the most glaring issue.\n\nThis game treats you like you're dumb, no discussion of heady themes, just that racism is bad and (smokes weed while listening to deGrasse Tyson) \"science is crazy man\". The gameplay is an oversimplification from a greatly simplified source, the depth of Bioshock 1 and 2 mostly came in environmental planning, but now Infinite's maps feel stripped from CoD, which really breaks down the combat, it was just never designed for these kinds of maps with a long time to kill across long sight lines being just one  of the sins committed. \n\nThe soundtrack (mostly the rewritten licensed songs) is really nice, the visuals are genuinely pretty, Elizabeth warming back up to you is handled well, but Elizabeth on the whole is the weakest part of this game. There's a conversation where she confides in Booker that she's insecure about being weird due to her powers, however this is the first mention of any social inadequacy from her. She is a Disney princess despite her horrid upbringing. She is the emotional core of the story, and the devs were too scared people wouldn't like her, so she's portrayed as the social butterfly while Booker is the one out of his element, a little brash and awkward. Her have difficulties from her past would've been more realistic, and also would have better portrayed the relationship they were evoking between Booker and Elizabeth. Having her be emotionally damaged, distant, and otherwise effected by her time in isolation would have been the riskier, but ultimately more rewarding and sensible, route to take. Infinite was afraid of taking that risk I presume, outgoing and compassionate people are easier to like so that's what they made Elizabeth, a Disney princess because they didn't trust the player to care about her otherwise. \n\nThis game pulled the medium back upon release, the racism it needs to be entirely overdone and cartoony, the gameplay and level design has to be simplified to allow for less choices, the science is all explained away with \"quantum whatevers\" or a poor understanding of probability and constants, Fitzroy has to be evil to show revenge is bad, Elizabeth needs to be unaffected by her past so the player likes her. All of these decisions that hold the game back feel like the result of low expectations of the consumer as much as incompetence on part of the devs.","timestamp_created":1613360194,"timestamp_updated":1613360194,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612476527690887451","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86678608","author":{"steamid":"76561198807736842","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1011,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":531,"last_played":1633131104},"language":"schinese","review":"神中神 !","timestamp_created":1613357907,"timestamp_updated":1640404195,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492798000574111938","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86678000","author":{"steamid":"76561198040658330","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1824,"last_played":1613361997},"language":"latam","review":"Uno de los mejores juegos de 2K, ya va siendo hora de una nueva entrega","timestamp_created":1613357191,"timestamp_updated":1613357191,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86675991","author":{"steamid":"76561198862822895","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":495,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":93,"last_played":1613802472},"language":"schinese","review":"伊丽莎白在跳舞我怎么办，在线等能不能直接走","timestamp_created":1613354873,"timestamp_updated":1613354873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86673164","author":{"steamid":"76561199008856649","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":713,"last_played":1642964667},"language":"brazilian","review":"MUITO BOM","timestamp_created":1613351277,"timestamp_updated":1613351277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86672844","author":{"steamid":"76561198016256303","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1256,"last_played":1511043504},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogão!
