In questo caso ci troveremo nei panni della guardia Barney Calhoun (importante per lo svolgimento di HL2), anche lui propenso a scappare dalla struttira dopo che l'esperimento è andato male.\nOra, se OF era serratissimo e divertente con momenti epici quasi al pari del fratello maggiore, BS NON HA NIENTE di tutto ciò. Il nostro scopo sarà quello di trovare il dottor Rosenberg per scappare dalla base. Fine.\nNiente colpi di scena, niente situazioni belle, niente eventi particolarmente godibili.\nFa schifo.\n\nL'unica cosa che salvo è il gameplay, ovviamente, visto che è preso di pari passo dal primo. Ma anche qui mi scade nello schifo. Se OF inseriva nuove armi e addirittura nuove razze aliene, BS non aggiunge niente di ciò e toglie addirittura molte delle armi di HL.\nDico, almeno lasciate tutte le armi del gioco originale. E invece no, sono pure di meno.\nIn più ci aggiungo che è curato pochissimo, pieno di bug e glitch davvero spaventosi e addirittura invalidanti.\n\nPerché dovrei consigliare un gioco simile, senza nessuno spunto interessante, senza eventi davvero godibili e dove non succede NULLA per 2 ore, quando ci sono HL e OF che durano il triplo ed il doppio del tempo e sono belli il quintuplo?\nUn gioco inutile e che non aggiunge nulla di nulla alla storia principale.\nE voi potreste pensare che anche OF non aggiunga nulla alla storia, siccome è in realtà una storia separata. Ed io vi dico si, avete ragione. Ma OF è divertentissimo, spettacolare e interessante.\nQuesto è aberrante.\n\nPRO:\n- La \"\"storia\"\" da un altro punto di vista\n- Il gameplay è sempre quello di HL...\n\nCONTRO:\n- ...seppur castrato e con meno armi\n- Nessuna aggiunta\n- Ritmo praticamente inesistente, senza davvero nulla di rilevante\n- Per chi non ha apprezzato HL, non apprezzerete neanche questo.

You spend a lot of time fighting either soldiers or weaker enemy types, or listening to exposition like in Half-Life 2.  The reason for this is because Blue Shift was intended to be an exclusive for the Sega Dreamcast console port of Half-Life 1, so the design needed to be toned down for console controls.  The Deamcast port later got cancelled, so with the work they already had they figured it would be better to release it for PC instead than to not release it at all.
