Novamente a trama é extraordinária e ainda mais complexa, tudo isso aliado aos lindos gráficos e uma jogabilidade excelente.\n\nA história se passa após Gordon Freeman ser acordado de sua hibernação por G-man, que o avisa de que há um novo trabalho para ele. Logo após, Gordon se vê dentro de um trem a caminho da cidade 17, e lá chegando fica sem entender o que está acontecendo, já que a terra agora esta cheia de alienígenas, sendo os humanos tratados como gado.\n\nÉ que Gordon havia ficado cerca de 20 anos aprisionado no tempo/espaço, enquanto que a terra foi tomada pelos Combine, raça alienígena que agora exerce total controle sobre as atividades humanas e já não enfrenta quase nenhuma resistência.\n\nGordon era praticamente dado como morto, mas a sua volta reenche de esperança a resistência, e agora ele deve combater esta tirania à qual se sujeitou a humanidade durante o tempo em que ele estava hibernando.\n\nExistem vários acontecimentos marcantes durante a trama, que é contada em tempo real de forma a prender ainda mais a atenção do jogador. A maior exploração dos \"diálogos\"(entre aspas, já que Freeman não fala nada) também contribui neste sentido.\n\nO jogo apresenta uma física surpreendente que por muitas vezes precisa ser usada para superar determinados obstáculos ou puzzles espalhados pelo caminho.\n\nOs cenários são lineares, embora por vezes exista mais de um caminho, ou forma de se chegar a determinado lugar. São também bem diversificados e detalhados, mas oferecem pouca opção de interação.\n\nDiferente do primeiro jogo, a maioria dos inimigos desta vez são soldados humanos que usam de tecnologia Combine, e provavelmente modificados geneticamente. Há momentos em que enfrentaremos extraterrestres, mas bem mais restritos.\n\nA única coisa que não me agradou foi o fato de os capítulos serem meio que longos demais pra o meu gosto. Talvez se houvessem mais capítulos de menor duração seria algo mais adequado.\n\nDe qualquer forma, Half Life 2 é um jogo surpreendente, e que mesmo com a idade, ainda persiste como um título bastante influente. É certamente a frente de sua época e um jogo que todos deveriam jogar.

Valve's gamble on mitigating software piracy in the gaming sphere by introducing Steam not only accomplished that, but introduced a community that nobody ever imagined.  I introduced the game to my ten year old recently; he fell in love with it for the same reasons that I did.  He could not believe that the game was as old as it is.  It's amazing how well that it has aged, being eight years old this month.  The game brought me hours of joy in its prime and continues to do so today through a fresh set of eyes.","timestamp_created":1417294379,"timestamp_updated":1417294379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13148644","author":{"steamid":"76561198147402230","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":649,"last_played":1503300257},"language":"english","review":"Scientest who kills aliens simulator 2004\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1417292788,"timestamp_updated":1417292788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13148374","author":{"steamid":"76561198046454638","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":569,"last_played":1430686068},"language":"english","review":"I'm not sure how I went so long without playing this game.  The graphics are amazing for 2004, the AI is great, the story is interesting, the controls feel good (except the crouch button, but you can move it), and the facial movement isn't far behind today's games.  This game did hit a bit of a lull after the Ravenholm level though.  I got tired killing the same combine soldiers over and over again.  I would've like to see a little more variety in enemies, but that's a minor complaint.  Some seemless loading like God of War could have made the experience a little smoother.  Overall, it's easy to see how Half-Life 2 has influenced so many games of future generations. 9/10","timestamp_created":1417291941,"timestamp_updated":1417291941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13147696","author":{"steamid":"76561198155902837","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":842,"last_played":1439995536},"language":"english","review":"this game is awesome even in 2014 it is still better than most of the games we have now","timestamp_created":1417289621,"timestamp_updated":1417289621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52731090784072876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13146659","author":{"steamid":"76561197970682872","num_games_owned":1179,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1345,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1610329634},"language":"english","review":"Pretty Good.\nYou probably know everything else.","timestamp_created":1417286263,"timestamp_updated":1417286263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540874898433685303","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13145089","author":{"steamid":"76561198115287833","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1823,"last_played":1434260057},"language":"english","review":"The Graphics are on par with CS:GO and yet the game came out 10 years ago.","timestamp_created":1417281257,"timestamp_updated":1417281257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13143786","author":{"steamid":"76561198053965946","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":125,"last_played":1418039072},"language":"english","review":"Nice game but no coop only in Synergy","timestamp_created":1417276864,"timestamp_updated":1417276864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473933637142181396","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13142921","author":{"steamid":"76561198090448856","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":601,"last_played":1386005983},"language":"russian","review":"Шедевр!\n\nНичего гениальнее вселенной халф-лайф, на мой взгляд еще не придуманно.
