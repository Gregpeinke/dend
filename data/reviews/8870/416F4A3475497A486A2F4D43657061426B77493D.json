start off this review by saying SPOILERS will be in this review. If you want to play the game without spoilers do not look at this review at all.\n\nMain Game:\nWhen walking through the gates of columbia for the first time I didn't know what to expect. It was a very beautiful sight to a game i've wanted to play since it came out but was either too young or just forgot or just didn't care it existed until I bought the collection. The main game was smooth I had no problems with it, the enemies are balanced(I played it on medium) and was very fun to get used to it and see every new and old mechanic in the game. The ending of the game was..confusing for most people but I understood it bc I've watched plenty of videos and read reviews prior to even playing. it didn't ruin my experience as I nearly cried at the main game's ending.\nBurial at sea dlc 1:\nOhhh boy this dlc was pretty incredible, you start off in the office and see elizabeth come in. My first thoughts were \"Hey is this another universe or something..?\" throughout the game it was clear to me that it really wasn't. Elizabeth's comments throughout the game were evidence to it being the one I saw and loved fighting along side with during my main story adventure. Then we have the ending...I must say I actually didn't expect that at all. But with you playing as comstock the entire time and Elizabeth wanting you to KNOW it you know she meant business. I usually love playing as the main character and want them to live, don't get me wrong at all I loved playing as comstock in the dlc but seeing and hearing Comstock say \"Child\" to Elizabeth at the ending was just..made me want him to perish, with one single word you can tell he wasn't sorry at all...that the same man in any universe is the same man and that he never changed at all.\nBurial at sea dlc 2:\nWe continue off from dlc 1 in paris, I saw many references to the letuce in it and how things went from peppy  loving and like Elizabeth's dream impression of paris it quickly turned dark and sour and gloomy. The first thing I noticed was that Elizabeth, throughout the game, can climb things. Like the rubble at the start or the vents. What I did notice is she climbs them like a little sister, like the end game shows constants and variables,  the thing I loved most about this dlc? The stealth. You didn't HAVE to kill anybody and so I didn't (Excluding turrets bc sometimes it's easier to possess a turret and let it shoot the room up than sneaking past everyone) people usually complained about the \"13 minute introduction where there's no gameplay\" but I actually WANTED that to happen. I loved it plain and simple, I wished dlc 1 had more of it..more of rapture and the lives of the people in it. And dlc 2 had more story to show, the walking sections made me examine everything I could and listen. I loved it..now the ending..ohh boy the ending. The ending made me cry. Bioshock 2's good ending made me sob and years later when I even knew the ending and what would happen I still cried...this game is perfect in my book and DESERVES all little bit of praise it gets. Thank you irrational games for making this master piece of a game and thank you to everyone reading. If you have any thoughts or would like to correct me on anything I said I left comments open..thank you again for this masterpiece and reading.","timestamp_created":1593984949,"timestamp_updated":1593984949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72117399","author":{"steamid":"76561198006678614","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1559,"last_played":1428152563},"language":"english","review":"Amazing single player game.","timestamp_created":1593980973,"timestamp_updated":1593980973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72117018","author":{"steamid":"76561198137562801","num_games_owned":246,"num_reviews":107,"playtime_forever":667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":667,"last_played":1593978660},"language":"german","review":"Trotz seines Alters ein optisch wirklich hübscher Shooter.

С одной стороны перед нами не плохая история, но с другой стороны не очень интересный геймплей. Начало игры очень удивляет и лично меня шокирует. Ведь начало столь же похоже как начало первого BioShock-a который я очень сильно люблю. Но BioShock Infinite это не тот BioShock который я знаю и этого я в начале не понимал постоянно сравнивая с прошлыми частями. Что делать было не правильно ведь эта игра про другое, про историю и персонажей, нежели атмосфера и тд. Единственный атмосферный момент это начало игры. Геймплей очень скуден и не очень интересен. Большую часть игры мы бегаем и с точки A в B, но это не проблема самой игры это проблема всех игр подобного плана и винить BioShock я не могу, ибо локации действительно интересны и разнообразны нежели коридоры и залы из первой и второй частях. Плазмидов стало меньше. Ой извините. Теперь у нас энергетики и они скучнее плазмидов. Многие из них это просто один и тот же энергетик только чуть другой, что я интересным не нахожу. Оружия много и оно хорошо. Стрелять приятно и это для шутера уже очень даже хорошо. Локации все очень хороши в плане геймплея. Теже аэротрассы очень прикольны и очень разбавляют обычные побегушки. Но к сожелению этого не хватает, в начале да интересно, но ближе к середине игры может на скучить, а так более мение. Сюжет прост и интересен, интригует.\n\n8,5 из 10.\nСоветую крайне хорошая игра, в меру интересная, но геймплей скудноват.
