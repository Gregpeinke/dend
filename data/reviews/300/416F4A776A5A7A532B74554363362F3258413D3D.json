But there is kind of a downside to DOD:S and it is becoming an old game, but... Don't worry there are still quite a reasonable amount of servers that are active 24/7 and suprisingly there are about 2 good ANZAC servers that are on 24/7  which is very good if you live in NZ or Australia.\n\nNow are you going to join the war son?

Zarówno żołnierz amerykański czy niemiecki, również są rodzaje piechór i tyle. To samo co poprzednik zdobywa flagi, podkłada dynamit na pojazdy i działa.                                                                                                                                                                             -Nieźle wypada też płynność pracy silnika Source Engine. Do tego ciekawie wygląda ta gra niż poprzednik, choć dość długo oferowany od 6 lat to i tak mocno osłabł na technice która bazowała na Half-Life 2 czy Counter Strike: Source zwykłym silnikiem Source, skoro Valve udoskonala montyfikacje silnika Source do nowszych i młodszych grach tak jak miało miejsce: Left4Dead 1 i 2, Portal 2 czy Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Niewiadomo czy menedżerowie Valve myślą o kolejnej odsłony gry Day of Defeat? Ale według mnie i mojej opinii będzie to nazywać najnowszym grą Day of Defeat: Global Offensive. Dlaczego? Ta nazwa raczej będzie upodobnić do wzoru nazwy obecnej gry od 2012 roku Counter Strike: Global Offensive i będzie bazował na ulepszonym silniku Source Engine. W najnowszym odsłonie przejmie te same zasady walki i niekoniecznie musi być scena z drugiej wojny światowej, lecz może być: pierwsza wojna światowa, wojna wietnamska czy wojna w Zatoce Perskiej [to samo miejsce miało CS:GO która nie tylko miała te zalety jak w poprzedniku, lecz dodała różne opcje np: deathmach, turniejówki, wyścig zbrojeń czy demolka]. Nie zabraknie też Steam Workshop czyli warsztat [w obecnym grze DoD: Source brakowało tej opcji].                                                                                             -Co to dzisiejszym tej gry. Może ma co kilka wad, choć gra mocno starzeje na technice Half-Life 2 to i tak uznaje, że nie musi być wyrzucone pieniądze w błoto, zaś przedmiotów czy mapy pojawią się w grze Garry's Mod na liście gry jako dodatki. Dopóki Valve myśli o nowym grze Day of Defeat to obecną grę polecam. :)","timestamp_created":1468699042,"timestamp_updated":1468699042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528706073760986328","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjZzS+tUCc6/2XA=="}
