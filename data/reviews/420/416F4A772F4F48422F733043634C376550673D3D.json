Действия разворачиваются сразу после событий Episode One и нашим героям нужно добраться до места под названием Белая Роща и доставить туда секретные документы, украденные из Цитадели. Перед нами весьма достойное продолжение легендарной истории - сюжет, насыщенный действием и неожиданными поворотами событий. Здесь нас ждет путешествие по новым локациям, встречи с новыми друзьями и новыми врагами и конечно же та самая атмосфера Half-life 2.

Ezenkivül Alyx szinkronja is sokat beszél az élményeiről a Valvenál és, hogy mit is jelentett neki ez a szerep a pályafutásában.\nMint mind tudjuk ez lett volna a finálé elötti rész. Sokszor meg is emlitik, hogy mi képpen akarták felvezetni a storyt ep3ra, amit meg is akartak csinálni csak közben ott volt Team Fortress 2 is ami egyre nagyobb sikert hozott, ezért úgy látták jobbnak, hogy inkább azt fejlesztik tovább.\nTovábbá megemlitik azt is, hogy a Borealist csak útolag rakták bele, hogy összetudják kötni Portallal, szóval részükről HL2 folytatása Portal 2 volt. Ezekután pedig jogos a kérdés, hogy akkor mire vártak Portal 2 után? A válasz pedig a Source 2 engine, mivel már eleve bajok voltak Portal 2 fejlesztése során a Source 1-el ezért jobbnak látták előbb ha befejezik Source 2-t, továbbá a hardver projecteiket is.\n\nÉs most itt vagyok a jelenben, amikor a Valve befejezte a Source 2 motor, kiadta a HTC Viveot, és gőzerővel ráállt HL3 befejezésére. Szóval ha valaha is volt alkalmunk reménykedni HL3-ban akkor az most van.","timestamp_created":1435665558,"timestamp_updated":1461586605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.723073303699493408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16805422","author":{"steamid":"76561198159648849","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":376,"last_played":1435659533},"language":"russian","review":"Нечего писать, печальная концовка,  жду 3 эпизод.","timestamp_created":1435657133,"timestamp_updated":1435657148,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16784544","author":{"steamid":"76561198036947328","num_games_owned":408,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":962,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":392,"last_played":1605900104},"language":"english","review":"When all hope is gone, i think thats the time when Half Life 3 will arrive.......","timestamp_created":1435603135,"timestamp_updated":1435603135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16774444","author":{"steamid":"76561198103370700","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":409,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":409,"last_played":1411862923},"language":"english","review":"Great extention, Worth it m8.","timestamp_created":1435555779,"timestamp_updated":1435555779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16770830","author":{"steamid":"76561198085166007","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":546,"last_played":1438891590},"language":"spanish","review":"Obra maestra, continuación de la otra obra maestra, continuación de la obra maestra.","timestamp_created":1435536205,"timestamp_updated":1435536205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553571403026580811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16770130","author":{"steamid":"76561198170105995","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1435505799},"language":"english","review":"It's fun.

Though it also ends on an infamous cliffhangar that won't be resolved (shots fired) and it has an slightly tedious intro involving a cave (tedious when you are replaying it for the 100th time) I would say it's still worth getting. Hell all the Half-Life titles are worth getting and playign but that's besides the point. If you've somehow never played this I'm torn between recommending this as it's great or skipping it so you won't be stuck...waiting for a resolution to the series. In terms of pacing you'll be moving around a lot better (Or at least faster) than in Episode 1 partly because and with one exception there aren't many places for them to lock us up while they dump exposition on us even if it is as always consistantly well written and not terribly uninteresting. The highlight of Episode 2 is it's open environments in the great outdoors which were also present in Half-Life 2 and the game even hinted more a focus on exploring off the beaten path going forward in the series. But there lies the biggest problem. Going forward after playing Episode 2.

Sonradan da muhtemelen vazgeçtiler çünkü [i]Half-Life: Alyx[/i]'in motoruna Source 2 deniliyor.\n","timestamp_created":1434547880,"timestamp_updated":1617277658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16462602","author":{"steamid":"76561198119980804","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":471,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":417,"last_played":1548663334},"language":"english","review":"There is no Half Life 3\n-1/10","timestamp_created":1434517104,"timestamp_updated":1434517104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.452054768800735474","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16460991","author":{"steamid":"76561198034144370","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":387,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":387,"last_played":1434509887},"language":"english","review":"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh so thats why everyone wants hl3!","timestamp_created":1434509990,"timestamp_updated":1439503191,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16451514","author":{"steamid":"76561198151026070","num_games_owned":366,"num_reviews":156,"playtime_forever":393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":320,"last_played":1641700834},"language":"english","review":"A continuation of Half Life 2 Episode One, unlike Episode One it's almost as long as the base game.
