Where to start.\n\nKilling floor is a brilliant adddition to the survival/horror genre, with amazing weapon balancing and a smart way to get you into higher difficulties. The fact that every time you level up one of your perks, your aresnal gets stronger and cheaper is a smart way to coax you into increasing your difficulty level, aswell as keeping you from joining the hardest difficulty as a level 0 and getting annihalated.\n\nThe maps are well designed, with some open areas where ZED's can spawn from all angles, keeping you on your toes, and narrow corridoors/rooms where there's no turning back if you push forward. Although my one complaint is that the maps can be too dark for a large area. I fully understand that maps should be dark to add to the \"horror\" aspect of the game, yet some maps are always well lit, and others are completley pitch black, with only a few such as kf_london and kf_offices retaining a good balance.\n\nThe ZED's ai is also outstanding, with them always coming to get you, and rarley ever getting stuck or bugged. The variety of the mobs is amazing, with you always running from a different threat. Wether it be stalkers being directly infront of you as you're running away and halting your progress, or a husk chipping away at you from a distance, aswell as the patriach being a brilliantly difficult final boss to a match, varying his attacks such as firing a chaingun or rockets at you from a distance, then closing in on you and swinging wildly at you, then running off to heal. \n\nThe communtiy is also outstanding, with there rarley ever being dicks/trolls, and everyone is constantly trying their best to keep one-another alive.\n\nAll in all, if it wasnt for the maps occasionally lacking sufficient lighting, kf would be a solid 10/10, but that single factor knocks it down to an 9/10.","timestamp_created":1395761021,"timestamp_updated":1395761021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9625582","author":{"steamid":"76561198050797781","num_games_owned":270,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1715,"last_played":1457877191},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1395753872,"timestamp_updated":1395753872,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9625542","author":{"steamid":"76561198046977056","num_games_owned":586,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":2268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2089,"last_played":1633756821},"language":"english","review":"Brilliance, in the goriest of arena based games.

Одиночная игра трудна, так как никто не прикроет спину. Суть игры очень проста. Есть карта-локация, выйти за пределы которой нельзя. Со всех сторон прут волны зомби, 10 волн. На 11 волне приходит босс. Между волнами можно сбегать в магазин и затариться оружием (деньги дают за убийства зомби). Есть классы прокачки персонажа, которые дают преимущества в бою и в магазине.\n\nГрафика слегка устаревшая, игра далеко не нова, но это не главное. Геймплей! Не бывает простых волн зомби, крутиться приходится не по-детски. Жуть, кровь, расчлененка - ну что еще нужно для хорошего геймплея? А еще фишка в том, что оружие имеет более-менее реальные характеристики. Крестика-прицела на экране нет, приходится целиться, как в реальной жизни.

The premise is pretty simple; bad stuff happened at a biotech lab somewhere in the UK and you've got to fight them, the story doesn't actually matter except to explain why you're fighting what you're fighting where you're fighting them, though. The vanilla game consists of several waves of a set number of enemies (Zeds), the composition of these waves increases with difficulty as you go along, and the game also scales in difficulty (number of enemies and their health) depending on the number of players and, of course, the difficulty you set. Generally speaking you can finish a Normal round with a disorganised team of randoms, but by the time you get to Hell on Earth you'll need a well-rounded team who know what they're doing, so there's a lot more to the game - in an 'emergent', sort-of-exploity kind of way; things like how hitboxes aren't synced to clients so you can't always get a headshot by aiming for the head or how if you jump and look down while shooting certain enemies at point blank range the bullets can hit more than once, thereby saving you ammo - than you'd ever figure out for yourself.\n\nAll in all, if you have a group of people to play with, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this. If you don't and you just want to play with randoms, you probably won't ever experience the game at its hardest. The community, like many others, is a mixture of people who will accept new players and try to teach them and others who will kick low level players on sight. Which, honestly, is kind of justified; low level players physically cannot keep up with anything harder than Normal difficulty.\n","timestamp_created":1395608210,"timestamp_updated":1395608210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516736388206481934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9611466","author":{"steamid":"76561198094720357","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1398,"last_played":1473373103},"language":"english","review":"it is really addictive and fun :) MUST BUY!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1395606409,"timestamp_updated":1395606409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9611328","author":{"steamid":"76561198005015919","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3719,"last_played":1475901751},"language":"english","review":"I've had this game for two years, and I still find myself playing it.

finde Killing Floor ist ein gelungenes Spiel.... aus irgendeinem Grund macht es mir mehr Spaß als Left 4 Dead 2 es jemals könnte, liegt wohl auch daran das bei L4D die Leichen verschwinden was ich ja ziemlich zum kotzen finde.

Aber im großen und ganzen bin ich zufrieden mit dem Spiel, ich hatte es mir vor Jahren mal gekauft und dann links liegen lassen. Und vor knapp 2 einhalb Jahren also das war noch 2011 hab ich damit erst so richtig angefangen. Man kann es sich ruhig kaufen der Preis ist mehr als in Ordnung. Aber noch etwas an Steam.

It's crucial to work with the team later on in the waves and to work cooperitively to manage the trash mobs and the big zeds at the same time. The content is also kept fresh because the team adds seasonal content (i.e. maps and skins for the zombies, along with achievements and skins for you).

Не смотря на графику, которая, к стати, не сильно и плохая, игра очень хорошая, затягивающая.\nИтак, что именно мне понравилось:\n-Прокачка. Что бы покачаться до максимальных уровней все классов вам нужно будет поиграть в игру где то 100 часов, благодаря чему вы не потеряете интерес к игре.\n-В игре очень много оружия, как ближнего боя, так и дальнего.\n-К игре есть множество DLC и частенько добавляются новые. DLC добавляют интересные оружия и скины для вашего персонажа, что еще больше веселит игру.\n-Игра атмосферная и отлично подходит для отдыха с друзьями, здесь не надо много думать, просто расслабляешься.\nИз недостатков здесь, разве что, графика, по современным меркам, хотя она не делает игру менее захватывающей. Также непонятное слоумо, непонятно, зачем оно надо и частенько раздражает.\nВ целом, моя оценка: 8/10","timestamp_created":1395520848,"timestamp_updated":1395520848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9598419","author":{"steamid":"76561198065637682","num_games_owned":1121,"num_reviews":88,"playtime_forever":24995,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24691,"last_played":1580409169},"language":"spanish","review":"[h1] Análisis de Killing Floor [/h1]\n\nPara mi este juego es un homólogo del L4d aunque con bastantes diferencias estre ellos.\n\n➮Comencemos diciendo que es un Shooter Survival Horror en primera persona, dónde tu y tu equipo (de hasta 6 online) debéis sobrevivir a múltiples oleadas de especímenes que  intentarán devoraros. Tambien puedes jugar solo.\n\n➮Después de cada oleada (10 en total) tienes intervalos de tiempo para comprar gran variedad de armas, más de 30 diferentes y mejoras para la siguiente lucha.\n\n➮Incluye sistema de Perks, 7 diferentes (médico, demoliciones, tirador, cuerpo a cuerpo, etc..) en los cuales irás progresando y tu personaje será más fuerte y poderoso. \n\n➮La camara lenta o ZedTime nos permite ser más efectivos en nuestros ataques y recrearnos en esas muertes especialmente violentas de nuestros enemigos.\n\n➮Este juego no posee workshop pero si DLC´s los cuales puedes adquirirlos en la tienda Steam.\n\n➮También decir que los escenarios son bastante buenos y apocalípticos, un aspecto visual notable, en definitiva un buen juego que no debe faltar en tu biblioteca. 8/10.\n\nOs dejo captura:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=245760434\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=331878759 \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=329085726","timestamp_created":1395519485,"timestamp_updated":1626273666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.69601517915725708","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9598278","author":{"steamid":"76561198009870365","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":9460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6860,"last_played":1616555365},"language":"english","review":"Awsome shooter i enjoy seeing the zombie heads pop","timestamp_created":1395518766,"timestamp_updated":1395518766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9597612","author":{"steamid":"76561198020933633","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1346,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1327,"last_played":1396541209},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor is a cooperative FPS in which players fights waves of zombie-like specimens. This game is very similar to the concept of tower defense, where waves gradually get harder and harder as each successful wave is cleared. There is a total of 10 waves + a final boss fight in each of the various maps that are available.\n\nPlayers earn in-game money for each kill, as well as for surviving to the end of a wave. At the end of each wave, players can visit a trader to buy and sell ammo, armor, and additional weapons. Specific weapon, armor and ammo drops are scattered around the map. Weapons range from melee arms to rifles, shotgun to flamethrowers, and demolition/explosives to medic guns.\n\nPlayers are encouraged to work together; they can trade items and drop money, healing is more effective on other players than on oneself, and the team can strategically weld doors shut to provide a temporary barrier from the oncoming horde while funneling the other creatures to specific areas.\n\nPlayers select one of seven perks at the start of a match and between rounds. The perk provides bonuses towards certain weapon types, armor, movement, and other factors. Players can level up each perk to increase the benefits it offers (each perk is equally as important as one another, especially in the harder difficulties).\n\nPlayers that die during a wave will drop their current weapon and re-enter the game at the start of the next wave, as long as at least one squad member survives. If the entire squad is wiped out, they will have to restart the game from the first round.\n\nOverall this game is super fun with friends, the more the merrier!\nThe super addictive levelling and killing system makes every wave more fun and intense, making you crave for more!\nThere is so much additional content in the workshop, as well as developer skins and weapon packs available on the Steam store.\n\nLVL 6 PERKS FOR EVERYTHING!!! GIMME MORE LEVELS, AND CLASSES, AND GUNS!!! :DDD","timestamp_created":1395515031,"timestamp_updated":1395515031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43a/L9cQCfKrOJA=="}
