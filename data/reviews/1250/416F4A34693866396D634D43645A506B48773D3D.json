tried to ride the fly wheel on the map \"Steamworld\" for 6 hours. When I finally reached the carts, they were invisible nonexistant fuck squares. The developers of Killing Floor are lazy pieces of fucking trash. Any game in 2014 or whenever this game was released that does not have an intact flywheel is garbage malware. It's not the fly wheel, it's the lie wheel, and tbh killing floor has made me feel feelings of chronic depression. I'm fucking done. All I wanted to do is ride my fucking fly wheel but there was no fly, not even a wheel. I instantly uninstalled this malware garbage off of this computer and attemted suicide via electrical. I cannot believe this excuse for a game exists in todays modern market. A non-existant fly wheel is an insult and a spit in the face of gamers and this garbage cannot be tolerated. I had previously given this game a positive review, but after the lie wheel digitally raped my gamer rights, I have opted to give this game a negative review and end my own life. Some people say that suicide is a direct path to hell, and if I go to hell I know exactly what I will find waiting and it will be this game. Fuck Tripwire and their disgraceful wheel of lies.
