Players may recall Barney's role in Half-Life 2 and in the case of Blue Shift, it felt nice to view the events of Half-Life through a different lense, just as in Oposing Force.  That being said, the game is indeed short and does not really introduce anything new in terms of weapons or gameplay compared to Half-Life.  The only major gameplay difference is that Barney cannot use the H.E.V. charging stations and instead must collect armor vests and helmets (actually a nice throwback to older shooters).  You'll go back to Xen for a short mission but most of the time you will be working your way through Black Mesa resuing scientists.  There are a few nods to other games in the Half-Life timeline too scattered throughout Barney's journey.  For the price and length of the game, I'd recommend getting this on a sale if you enjoyed Half-Life and want more lore.","timestamp_created":1467472283,"timestamp_updated":1467472283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23983657","author":{"steamid":"76561198253567873","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":486,"last_played":1467376829},"language":"french","review":"excellent jeu pour l'époque et encore aujourdh'hui.

It does have problems though. Compared to Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force, this is the least good out of the three. It didn't introduce any new enemies or guns.

Nothing really new came out of the game. I feel that the makers of the game could've done a way better job. However, since I am a big Half-Life fan, I do think this game is fun to play. There are moments where the combat is intense. I would say it's a nice little game to play and finish in one weekend. It was worth the 99 cents I payed in the summer sale.

Barney’s journey through Black Mesa isn’t an easy one, but surely it is a short one, as Blue Shift is even shorter than Opposing Force.

Als Gordon Freeman trug Dich eine Schwebebahn durch den riesiegen unterirdischen Forschungskomplex Black Mesa. und an einer Stelle, ganz am Anfang, nur kurz, fuhrst Du an einem Wachmann vorbei, der gegen eine Tür klopfte, die offenbar eine Störung im Öffnungsmechanismus hatte. Du weißt es nicht, aber dieser Wachmann war Barney Calhoun und wird der Protagonist von \"Blue Shift\" sein.\n\nEin einfacher Wachmann also, kein Superheld. Die Introsequenz beginnt ähnlich wie im Original mit einer Schwebebahnfahrt zu eben jener Tür. Diese wird erst geöffnet, nachdem wir Gordon Freeman an uns vorbeifahren gesehen haben. Wir rüsten uns aus, mit einer Pistole, Schutzweste und Helm und sollen einen steckengebliebenen Aufzug kontrollieren. Da nehmen die Dinge ihren Lauf, Explosionen, Feuer, Tote. Außerirdische Lebensformen dringen durch ein Portal, das aus Versehen geöffnet wurde in unsere Welt und greifen alles an, was ihnen über den Weg läuft. Unsere wichtigste Aufgabe: Black Mesa möglichst lebend zu verlassen.\n\nTechnisch ist Vergleich zum Hauptspiel wenig passiert, lediglich ein paar Texturen wurden verbessert. Auch akustisch hat sich nicht viel getan. Die Shooter-Mechaniken funktionieren aber nach wie vor hervorragend.\n \n\"Blue-Shift\" ist mit 3-4 Stunden Spielzeit erstaunlich kurz und im Vergleich zum Hauptspiel erstaunlich eintönig. Dabei ist das Leveldesign nach wie vor exzellent. Gegnerpassagen wechseln sich mit kleinen Jump- und Schalterpassagen ab. Aber die Entscheidung einen simplen Wachmann zu spielen, hat einige Einschränkungen zur Folge. Wir tragen keinen Power-Suit, sondern nur eine Schutzweste, können uns also auch nicht an HEV-Stationen aufladen. Trotzdem Teile von \"Blue Shift\" auch auf der Alien-Welt spielen, bleibt unser Waffenarsenal im Vergleich erstaunlich erdgebundene Standardkost. \n\n\"Blue Shift\" macht ohne Frage Spaß, man kann sich aber nicht dem Eindruck erwehren, daß bei weitem nicht das Potential ausgeschöpft wurde. \n\n[h1]Wertung:[/h1]\n8/10 Atmosphäre\n6/10 Story\n8/10 Grafik\n7/10 Sound\n8/10 Spielmechanik\n8/10 Balancing\n7/10 Spielspass\n(Wertungen von Klassikern beziehen immer die technischen Möglichkeiten der Zeit mit ein)\n\n[h1]Fazit:[/h1]\nNette Zugabe, die aber in keinem Punkt an das geniale Original heranreicht. \n\n[h1][b]7/10 Gesamtwertung","timestamp_created":1464345946,"timestamp_updated":1464345946,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508793473243713379","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23227926","author":{"steamid":"76561198079335778","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":143,"last_played":1598861988},"language":"english","review":"Like Opposing Force, Blue-shift is another take on the Black Mesa Incident.

Developed by Gearbox and overseen by Valve. Blue Shift is definitely weaker than Opposing Force in terms of pretty much everything. That does not mean it is bad, the game just refuses to take risks or add anything new. You play as Black Mesa security officer Barney Calhoun, who is in the middle of his shift when the Resonance Cascade happens, he then has to find a way to escape Black Mesa. The gameplay is the same as the original Half-Life, but with no fun new enemies or weapons like in Opposing Force. But I still recommend the game because it reveals more of the story of Half-Life, and it is always fun to see a game's story line from a different perspective.\nTLDR: The weaker of the two expansions for Half-Life because it does not take risks or attempt anything new. Still keeps the fun gameplay, and it is cool to see the Black Mesa Incident from a different perspective.","timestamp_created":1464140502,"timestamp_updated":1470885658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23192573","author":{"steamid":"76561198030271401","num_games_owned":2779,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":422,"last_played":1463810863},"language":"polish","review":"HL: Blue Shift kontynuuje zapoczątkowane przez HL: Opposing Forces przedstawianie historii nieudanego eksperymentu w Black Mesa z różnej perspektywy (gdyby Valve było bardziej konsekwentne, to trzeci dodatek opowiadałby tę historię właśnie z perspektywy mackowatych najeźdźców), więc ma wszystkie zalety i wady poprzedników.
