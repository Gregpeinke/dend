I just knew that it was a horde mutant shooter but never saw it in action.\nI can see myself spawning for the first time, the map was KF-Bedlam and the first thing i did was shooting the wall with the 9mm, and it was like \"WOW\". The gunshot was feeling so good and powerful, that's the first thing that hooked me in this game. I played on this pirated version for countless hours. I was unable to level up on this version so all my perks was level 0, but i didn't care, the game was too good. I purchased it when i've been able to, and kept playing this awesome game. The game was often updated and i thanks Tripwire for these gifts from the gods.\n\nToday, Killing Floor 2 is making a lot of thing better. I will not return to Killing Floor except for some nostalgia sessions, but Killing Floor had something than Killing Floor 2 doesn't have. This game has an atmosphere, a feeling. Something creepy, like a dream or a nightmare. It's really hard to describe, but for this reason it can still makes sense to play KF1 over KF2. KF1 is also a lot slower than KF2, it's not better or worse, but different.\n\nIf you never played this game, i can only recommend it, it's awesome ! But i have a little warning : the game has some element that are not very intuitive for new players and some movement and controls are pretty dated. You may have an hard time as a new player if you're not used to older games, but once you tamed it, it's only good fun :D\n\nKF1 & KF2 are probably my favorite games with Doom & Doom 2.","timestamp_created":1324498242,"timestamp_updated":1537132712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5070829","author":{"steamid":"76561198044750552","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":22252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11630,"last_played":1438525128},"language":"italian","review":"già le musiche del gioco valgono l'acquisto!","timestamp_created":1324486730,"timestamp_updated":1324486730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4652404","author":{"steamid":"76561198040372604","num_games_owned":469,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":63942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":46571,"last_played":1653391518},"language":"schinese","review":"爱老虎油！！","timestamp_created":1324478005,"timestamp_updated":1324478005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"771553","author":{"steamid":"76561197977910293","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3701,"last_played":1429326887},"language":"english","review":"Such satisfying headshots and good brutal fun with friends.","timestamp_created":1324472397,"timestamp_updated":1324472397,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1854156","author":{"steamid":"76561197998885285","num_games_owned":629,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":58399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":31974,"last_played":1649783740},"language":"italian","review":"un giochino che io avevo preordinato pirma che uscisse, un consiglio? prendetelo! molto divertente da giocare con amici e conoscenti, sitema di livellamento longevo (e' dir poco) prendetelo!","timestamp_created":1324470909,"timestamp_updated":1324470909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495173752307891846","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4771641","author":{"steamid":"76561198041672830","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1416669614},"language":"english","review":"AAAAAAAAH","timestamp_created":1324463447,"timestamp_updated":1324463447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"135424","author":{"steamid":"76561197962973671","num_games_owned":1005,"num_reviews":129,"playtime_forever":30663,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30582,"last_played":1576955617},"language":"english","review":"One of the greatest \"zombie\" killing games, awesome weapons and enemies and the music ROCKS!","timestamp_created":1324458268,"timestamp_updated":1521871742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1333307","author":{"steamid":"76561197991591636","num_games_owned":577,"num_reviews":144,"playtime_forever":3112,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2770,"last_played":1410580373},"language":"english","review":"This game is alot of fun, If you where a fan of the Left for Dead series then this is a Must have.
