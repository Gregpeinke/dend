You still use portals \nin conjunction with the new puzzle mechanics like \nthe gels, which flow really well.\n-The music is excellent, Highly recommend getting it.\n-The added plant life and broken down interiors \nto the test chambers are a great addition.\n\nCons:\n-Test chambers now have A LOT more \nblack panels, making it really obvious where \nyou're supposed to place portals. This means \nmost puzzles are limited to one type of solution.\nIn the first game white panels were more common, which \nactually made the puzzles a bit more challenging because \nyou needed to figure out where the portals had to \nbe placed yourself.\n-Also, even when there are many white panels around,\nthe game gives you the portal placement on a \nsilver platter. Most white panels in the game \nare either broken or covered in moss or rust....\nExcept for the one panel where you need to place \nthe portal, which is often completely clean and free of any\nimperfection, and often has a different line pattern \nto make it stand out from the other white panels.\nThis is taken to the point where puzzles are so \nsimplified you could argue (and I would) that they \nare not really puzzles.\n-Wheatly doesn't have any distortion in his \nvoice. Considering that he is a core, and every single \nother core has a distorted voice, this is a bit off. Not saying\nhis line delivery is bad.\n-The game more often than not tries it's hardest to be \nfunny, often stoppinjg the game and having you listen to a \n\"funny\" line. Stuff like the Birds, the potatos, and GLaDOS \npoking fun at Chell being adopted and fat. Same with Wheatly.\nIt feels as if Valve is trying to re-capture the level of viral humor \nthey got from Portal 1 with stuff like the Companion Cube.\n-Cave Johnson's addition is a bit off. Again his lines often spout \nout jokes or funny-sounding lines. I mean Aperture always had \nreally crazy scientists, but at this point the game just \nspits out all sorts of crazy experiments. Like how apparently \nthere is or used to be a race of Mantis Men created by \nAperture Science in the Half-Life/Portal universe.\n\nI do still think Portal 2 is a good game, and do recommend it. \n","timestamp_created":1491666844,"timestamp_updated":1491666844,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31018115","author":{"steamid":"76561198046257051","num_games_owned":302,"num_reviews":91,"playtime_forever":1951,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1191,"last_played":1515009359},"language":"english","review":"If you are reading reviews to see if you should get Portal 2, then you should be ashamed of yourself.

Игра была официально анонсирована Valve 5 марта 2010 года. Изначально её выпуск планировался осенью того же года, однако после нескольких переносов датой выхода Portal 2 было назначено 18 апреля 2011 года. В России игра вышла 21 апреля 2011 и распространяется компанией «Бука».\n\nПродолжение развивает игровой процесс первой игры, состоящий из головоломок, построенных на использовании специального устройства для создания порталов — разрывов в пространстве — позволяющих игроку мгновенно перемещаться из одного места в другое. Среди множества нововведений геймплея в Portal 2 присутствует кооперативный режим для прохождения двумя игроками. Действие игры происходит спустя некоторое время после событий Portal в разрушенной и заброшенной Лаборатории исследования природы порталов (Aperture Science) и фокусируется на дальнейшем противостоянии всё той же главной героини, подопытной девушки Челл, и маниакального суперкомпьютера GLaDOS. В кооперативном режиме присутствует отдельная сюжетная линия.\n\nСравнивая Portal и его продолжение, Valve подчёркивает, что первая часть была лишь экспериментом, в то время как Portal 2 является уже полноценной игрой с совершенно новыми элементами геймплея и гораздо большей продолжительностью[6] (игровой процесс рассчитан примерно на 6 часов в одиночном режиме и столько же в кооперативном[7]). Более того, на конференции GDC 2010 директор Valve Гейб Ньюэлл заявил, что Portal 2 — это лучшая игра за всю историю существования компании.","timestamp_created":1491652783,"timestamp_updated":1491652783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493809819221496582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31013272","author":{"steamid":"76561198378951608","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1513682869},"language":"russian","review":"Топ","timestamp_created":1491642356,"timestamp_updated":1491642356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31012297","author":{"steamid":"76561198104108052","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":791,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":356,"last_played":1491625985},"language":"schinese","review":"神作啊，相比第二部，我们得以窥探光圈科技更多的一面，不过也减少了神秘感最后射像月球屌屌哒","timestamp_created":1491637949,"timestamp_updated":1491637949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31012250","author":{"steamid":"76561198289252363","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":967,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":592,"last_played":1530493658},"language":"english","review":"Brain exerciser.

It is a puzzle game for everyone and an extremely fun game to play. It was not a difficult game to complete and the story was very satisfying. Portal 2 is absolutely worth the purchase even if you are terrible at puzzle games. Every puzzle was clever and engaging yet none of the puzzles were difficult enough to make my brain hurt. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, Portal 2 is a cakewalk to complete compared to games like The Witness, though I don't consider it a bad thing since I got too frustrated with that game to continue playing it. Being so well-balanced in its difficulty, Portal 2 is much more of a joy to play than all the other puzzle games combined. It is a puzzle game I was actually able to get through smoothly without having to look up hints/answers or trying to pull my hair out.\n\nMy only complaint is that the final chapter was way too easy. None of the final puzzles were challenging and the final boss battle was easily completed on my first try. The most difficult puzzles were in chapters six, seven, and eight, but there were only a few puzzles in the game that had me stumped for a while trying to figure out what to do. \n\nOverall, this game is almost perfect in every way. The only other puzzle game I found to be anywhere near as engaging and interactive as this game is The Talos Principle, which is great in its own way but fails to match Portal 2 in terms of pacing, dialogue, and entertainment value. This game is truly something special and I recommend it to all gamers, regardless of their puzzle solving skills.","timestamp_created":1491585659,"timestamp_updated":1492658792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30999787","author":{"steamid":"76561198298383686","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":11744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2218,"last_played":1643046759},"language":"english","review":"A great game! :)","timestamp_created":1491581199,"timestamp_updated":1491581199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30999458","author":{"steamid":"76561198264387163","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":484,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":340,"last_played":1497076139},"language":"english","review":"Clever puzzles, great storyline, cool sidekick, and it also has a steam workshop AND a co-op feature which will give it more hours of fun with your friends.

How they have done it is anyone's guess, but I managed to get about 13 hours out of this game compared to about 3 in the first game, enjoyed every minute, and somehow Portal 2 seemed just as tight, taut, and economical as Portal was. There's still no flab or unnecessary padding and the game, despite being puzzle after puzzle, never feels repetitive.\n\nThe main reason for this is the quality of the puzzles. They are absolutely ingenious. The solutions to all of them are deceptively simple yet it still feels like a major breakthrough when you solve them. The level design is such that in some of the bigger ones you might spend upwards of 20 minutes trying to find an answer, and when you eventually do it seems like the most obvious thing in the world. Often the simplest way is the best. As soon as you get an idea in your head, try it! Don't come back to the game another time as you may forget it.\n\nOnly a few of the walls/surfaces accept portals, but somehow the answers to the puzzles still never feel contrived or obviously placed. Still, when you see surfaces that can accept portals, you can be sure that this is a clue for how to crack the puzzle. Other than that, pay attention to the info boards at the beginning of each test - they show you what elements are needed, but otherwise it's all up to you on how to use them. There are plenty of new innovations in the sequel, like light bridges, tunnels of light that can transport you and any other physical objects over gaps, and new fluids or \"gels\" that manipulate physics in some way. I won't tell you what they do, as discovering that is part of the fun. It's not just a matter of pressing buttons but also you need to get the timing right in many puzzles as well. It's also worth noting that many of the chambers are huge - the sense of scale and the number of things you need to use can be daunting at first, which only makes the feeling of getting to the exit in the end sweeter. \n\nFlaws are minor. I did have a couple of crashes, it's a bit odd that there's no fall damage (although the game would probably have been less fun if there was), the loading zones are small, and there is one gel puzzle two-thirds of the way through that relies on a little bit of luck as well as timing. But that's about it, I had more fun playing this game than anything since Half-Life 2, and I wasn't even a puzzle/platforming fan before playing Portal 2.","timestamp_created":1491500687,"timestamp_updated":1491500996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30982311","author":{"steamid":"76561198337517679","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1064,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":230,"last_played":1658079821},"language":"russian","review":"tttttt","timestamp_created":1491497522,"timestamp_updated":1491497522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30981826","author":{"steamid":"76561198047315435","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":674,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":674,"last_played":1491495727},"language":"english","review":"Get the BUNDLE when it's on Summer Sale!

After playing the first Portal relatively quickly, I started up Portal 2 and sat down thinking it would be as short as the first one. I was wrong, this game has much more meat than the first Portal. It was fun to shoot portals across large areas and teleport across them. What I loved about Portal 1 and Portal 2 is that it all can be done without a walkthrough, but it's not easy either. It has an interesting start and a legendary ending. The middle part wasn't that amazing, but it wasn't bad either. All in all, I am happy that I finally played the two Portal games, and even though I am not a huge fan of puzzle games it was still enjoyable. It is a great buy when it's on sale.\n\n[b] This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: [/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nThis review is just my opinion.

It's a demanding first person puzzle game requiring careful observation of your surroundings, testing for its properties, testing how you could possibly interact with it and then somehow concoct a plan to use the information you've collected to achieve an objective. Sometimes you have to carefully plan in order to chain an interaction or effect to reach your goal. It's almost like Dark Souls series in a sense that, you need to concentrate intensely observing and planning without which, you cannot progress past a certain area. But once you've gotten past something, it feels nice. Portal 2, unlike Souls series, however, doesn't ruthlessly punish players for failure. I haven't tried multiplayer but I'd love to, however, none of my friends own the game. Also, I love GLaDOS and Wheatley, they're absolutely endearing and they have some of the best quotes in PC gaming history. My favorite, you can probably tell because it's in my featured badge, is: \"how are you holding up? BECAUSE I'M A POTATO\".
