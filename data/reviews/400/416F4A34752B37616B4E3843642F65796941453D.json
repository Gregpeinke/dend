Is Portal as good as Portal 2? My answer is no, but it features the same great concept that gave birth to its masterpiece sequel. I wouldn't recommend this game, but the concept is so great I don't feel like not recommending it.\n\n\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n\n[*][u]GAME MECHANICS[/u]: Just like Portal 2, it shares the same mechanics, the very ingenious portals never seen in any other game, gravity and objects to solve puzzles. There's not much to say, it's just unique and ingenious, it's great if you're looking for something new for your brain.\n\n[*][u]PUZZLES[/u]: Puzzles are very nice, I love solving them, although they are not so difficult sometimes, probably they are meant for the new players still not into the game's logic. \n\n[*][u]AGING[/u]: Some great games have a curse called aging, they were great games back when they were released, nowadays they aged bad and looking so bad. It's not Portal's case, the game aged great and looking pretty good, thanks to the good Half Life 2 decent graphic engine and the semplicity of the maps. It's very enjoyable and not too far from Portal 2, it's still a pleasure to play it today.\n\n\n[/list]\n\n\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n\n[*][u]LONGEVITY[/u]: The campaign and story is way too short, I could complete it twice with half achievement in about 5 hours. That's very disappointing because a game can't be that short while being a single player only with no support for custom maps, challenges made the game a bit longer but they are not as good as the story. Thumbs down for being so quick.\n\n[*][u]WORKSHOP[/u]: Another weak point is the lack of the workshop, custom maps could have made the game much longer and enjoyable, it's a shame they didn't think about it, but it's available for Portal 2.\n\n[*][u]UNBALANCED DIFFICULTY[/u]: Portal lacks of difficulty balance, the story's puzzles are very easy, much easier than Portal 2, the challenges are way too hard if played with no walkthrough. There's no middle way.\n\n[*][u]MINOR BUGS[/u]: I went through some minor bugs, some were rare but quite bad, others not so serious. I went through them mostly during challenges, I had the steps counter going up while standing on the cube on the moving platform, hitting objects while running can add a lot of steps despite you're standing on the same point, if you're hit by turrets, the counter highly increase. I experienced 2 serious bugs, one made my last savegame crash the game everytime it was loaded (luckly the autosave did a great job, unlike many other games), the other bug I solved a puzzle to open the door, despite everything was activated, the door didn't open, it was a bad one because it was the step challenge and couldn't just reload and finish it easily again. \n\n[*][u]PORTAL 2[/u]: Portal 2 is just the first Portal with everything fixed and added, even if this game is great, I wouldn't see any point to buy it. It happens when the sequel doesn't feature any major changes but mostly fixes of the old version, that's exactly why I would recommend Portal 2 more than this.\n\n[*][u]PRICE[/u]: The price is not too high if you don't consider all the cons I listed, unfortunately it's pretty senseless to buy it. Why should I spend this much for a 2 hours long story, a few challenges for a dozen extra hours, no multiplayer or coop, no custom maps and nothing truly different than Portal 2? Its price should be much lower because this game is ingenious and revolutionary, but way too short and incomplete compared to the sequel. It's a good choice to buy The Orange Box with a discount instead, Half Life 2 is a great game and Portal is included into the box.\n\n\n[/list]\n\nFinal word: The original project that gave birth to the masterpiece called Portal 2, it's as smart as short. Recommended only with a huge discount for The Orange Box, otherwise better skip to Portal 2, which is complete.","timestamp_created":1508535276,"timestamp_updated":1508535276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538529455661773682","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35872722","author":{"steamid":"76561198127395868","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1508530049},"language":"english","review":"ez game for me.","timestamp_created":1508530106,"timestamp_updated":1508530106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483796268701553345","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35871714","author":{"steamid":"76561198173339691","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2578,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2047,"last_played":1648763440},"language":"english","review":"One of my favourite Games of all time!!\nWould recommend!","timestamp_created":1508527277,"timestamp_updated":1508527277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35870589","author":{"steamid":"76561198072012236","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":447,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":37,"last_played":1522102643},"language":"spanish","review":"Si eres aficionado a los videojuegos no puedes no jugar a Portal.

Valve'ın oyunlarına karşı hiçbir zaman çok fazla ilgi beslemedim. İnsanların genel olarak Valve'a yaklaşımını fazla abartı buluyor , oyunlarının sanıldığı ve anlatıldığı kadar mükemmel olduğunu düşünmüyordum. Aslına bakarsak hala daha öyle düşünüyorum. Fakat bu kötü oyun yaptıkları anlamını taşımıyor. Evet , Valve kaliteli yapımlarla karşımıza geliyor , fakat bunların bazıları benim açımdan başarılı iken bazıları ise yetersiz kalıyor. Portal , kesinlikle bu kısımlardan başarılı olan tarafta yer alıyor ve hakkında söylenen yorum ve incelemeleri de herşeyiyle hak ediyor ...\n\nÖncelikle oyunun bir birinci şahıs , platform ve bulmaca oyunu olduğunu ve bilim-kurgu temasında geçtiğini belirteyim. \n\nKocaman bir laboratuvara kapatılmış olan karakterimizin kim olduğunu ve neden oraya kapatıldığını bilmiyoruz. Tek bildiğimiz , yapay zekâlı bir robotun arkadan bize bir takım komut ve mesajlar vermesi ile bizim bir teste tabi tutulduğumuz. Ve testi geçersek sonunda pastaya ulaşabileceğimiz. Önümüze sunulan tüm bu bulmacaları çözmeye çalışırken yapay zekâlı robotun arka planda kara mizâh unsuru barındıran diyalogları , elimizde portal yaratabildiğimiz bir silah ve zekice hazırlanmış eğlenceli bulmacalar...İşte Portal'ın özeti. \n\nDışarıdan bakıldığında bu oyunun neden bu kadar övüldüğünü anlamakta bir çoğumuz gibi bende güçlük çekiyordum. Ta ki oynayınca nedenini anladım. \nOyun elindeki unsurları o kadar yerinde ve miktarında kullanmıştı ki hiçbir şekilde bulmacalarda aşırı zorluk veya kolaylık , esprilerde yapmacıklık veya sıradanlık , oynanışta herhangi bir eksiklik hissetmiyorsunuz. Bulmacalar tam olması gerektiği gibi gerçekten düşündürücü ve özenle hazırlanmış. Bazen gözünüzün önündeki çözümü göremeyip uzun süre kafa patlattığınız olabiliyor. İşte burada da oyunun size sunduğu hayalgücü unsuru çıkageliyor. Oyun belki bulmaca çözümleri konusunda sizi fazla özgür bırakmayıp kendi istediği şekilde çözmenizi istiyor , ama çözüm aşamasında bile hayalgücünüzü kullanıp hesaplayarak doğru yola sapıyorsunuz. \"Nasıl yapabilirim ?\", \"Burayı geçmem imkansız !\" dediğiniz anlarda bile küçücük bir boşluktan çözümü kendiniz bulabiliyorsunuz. Tüm bu bulmacalarla uğraşırken yapay zekâlı robotun gerçekten kaliteli mizah barındıran konuşmaları oyuna ayrı bir renk katıyor.\n\nOynanışa yakından bakmak gerekirse , elimizdeki portal silahı ile oyunun bize belirttiği duvarlara portallar açıp ilerliyoruz. Tabi bu sınırsız değil. Portal sayımız 2 ile sınırlı , mavi ve turuncu renklerini kullanabiliyoruz. İsteğe bağlı renkleri değiştirebiliyoruz. Aynı zamanda zaman zaman bize yardımcı olan belli başlı oyun içi unsurlardan ; momentum ve fizik kurallarından faydalanabiliyoruz. \n\nEkstra olarak oyunun , arka planda neler olduğunu bir sır gibi saklaması ve bulunduğumuz ortamın aslında psikolojik olarak ürpertici olması Portal'ın atmosferini beğenmemi sağladı. Seslendirmeyi başarılı bulduğumu ve oyunun ana soundtrack ini de çok sevdiğimi söylemek isterim.\n\nPortalın belki benim açımdan tek hayalkırıklığı yaratan noktası oyunun çok kısa olması. Oyunları uzun uzun tadını çıkarta çıkarta oynayan birisi olmama rağmen oyun sadece 5 saatte bitti , ve credits ekranına bakarken \" Hayır , bitmiş olamaz...\" demiştim. Ekstra olarak aynı bulmacaların zorlaştırılmış madalyalı modları da mevcut , fakat oyunun kendisi maalesef fazla kısa.

The physics of the movement feel like a standard FPS, but add two portals and you have a whole bunch of new tricks up your sleeve! Ironically once you get your portal gun, the game stops feeling like another FPS. It looks like a shooter to on observer, yet it plays like a puzzler but with the new portal physics. I was recommended this game a long time ago, but I had never played it until now, I found it to be extremely fun and everything it had been hyped up to be.\n\nYou feel like a lab rat running a deadly maze, armed with your trusty portal gun and the promise of cake. You eventually find out all is not all as it seems, with secret rooms and crazed messages from other test subjects, making you thirst for more information about what is going on, who you are, and why you are here.\n\nThe first few levels really show you how the new portal physics can be worked to your advantage, how to grab things like crates to throw switches that open doors (familiar to the original Zelda puzzles), then new skills where timing your shots is thrown in the mix. A new switch is then introduced in the form of a deadly floating ball of plasma that you need to put back in its home. The gradual build-up of skills is in the Goldilocks zone, it’s not too hard, not too easy, it's just right. Whenever you feel stuck you just need to stop and look for the signs, because there is always a path to follow to get to the end of the level. There are signs in the form of visual cues (like lighting effects highlight a point of interest) to show you the order of the maze and its puzzle pieces. I found these subtle cues a great part of the game, as it helps the player navigate each step. The players can always see the WHERE, the challenge is figuring out HOW to get to the next bit. It usually involves improving upon already developed skills built on the previous levels. This gives the game a steady, natural flow.\n\nSo, I felt the game had a good flow, it starts with easy levels that progressively get harder as they balance your skill set accordingly. With each level being long enough to entertain, but also short enough to quickly jump on and just finish a single level. I spent many hours playing in one sitting which felt to me like minutes.","timestamp_created":1508145353,"timestamp_updated":1508145353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35767664","author":{"steamid":"76561198131673654","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":269,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":143,"last_played":1643031425},"language":"english","review":"Short and sweet, a classic puzzle game that everyone should play.","timestamp_created":1508142103,"timestamp_updated":1629144169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35765147","author":{"steamid":"76561198207663184","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":209,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":173,"last_played":1587453746},"language":"english","review":"Though somewhat short, Portal is a fantastic experience years later.
