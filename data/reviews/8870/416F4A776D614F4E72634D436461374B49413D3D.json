As soon as you are spilled into Columbia, you are given a set of increasinly zainy and deadly weapons and paranormal abilities. Dispatching foes is a manic and fun time, and your AI partner does well to help you when she can, and stay out of your way when you don't need it.\nIt's a very story-driven game, but in a good way. While you might find long spells without any real fighting sequences, the diologue, visuals, and story being conveyed are enough to keep you interested.

You not only ruined your current game, you went back in time and ruined your first two games as well. What the HELL is wrong with you?

Your writing is so horrible you lost track of your own ending while you were writing it then forgot it again when you made your DLC. Oh, and before I forget, your game play was utter crap. Two weapon rule wasn't fun in the 90s, it damn sure isn't fun now. Your combat is boring enough to be seen as a chore.

I do however feel that it is a fantastic piece of art. The environments are gorgeous, and exploring Colombia were rather enjoyable. Also the story was well told and quite moving despite some gaps in continuity. However that's the extent of its positive qualities.\n\nAs game it fails to be challenging, even on Hard mode the combat is incredibly trivial. Elizabeth can keep you feed with an infinite supply of ammo, health, and salts, which you don't even need because you can just kill everything with the skyhook. Aside from the combat the game was incredibly linear, with very few secrets, and of those that did exist none really provided any substantial benefit because the combat was so easy to begin with.\n\nAnd again back to the problems with it being so linear, I can't help but compare it to the first Bioshock, which was also linear, however at least had multiple endings. With Bioshock: Infinite there is one ending, and honestly it's not that good. For a game that has a theme of infinite worlds with infinite possibilities you have only one ending? Really?\n\nTo sum it all up it's just not a good game; like I said the story was pretty good, but the combat is poor, and the player cannot change the outcome of the ending. In terms of gameplay it's more like Myst or Riven than a shooter. It's just a beautiful enviornment to explore. However, unlike Myst or Riven, Bioshock: Infinate is devoid of any choice or challenge. Overall I'd have to say that you would probably be better off just watching all the cutscenes on youtube, because it would make a better movie than a game.","timestamp_created":1388807172,"timestamp_updated":1388807784,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56004023551940918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8545487","author":{"steamid":"76561197993210051","num_games_owned":645,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":1719,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1351,"last_played":1395858041},"language":"english","review":"As I compared BioShock 2 to BioShock 1, so shall I compare BioShock Infinite to BioShock 1 and 2. BioShock Infinite is leaps and bounds better than both BioShock 1 and 2, in many respects. First, the bad: the gunplay feels a bit restricted, compared to BioShock 2, although it's much better than BioShock 1. You can only hold two weapons at a time, and unlike BioShock 1 and 2, you don't get to hold onto all your other weapons when you find new ones. However, even with this major stifling to the creative gunplay of BioShock 2, BioShock Infinite is much more fun to play and combat feels incredibly rewarding. I enjoyed using every weapon and plasmid - erm, I mean vigors - even though some got more use than others. Also the vigors really don't add much to the story, unlike the plasmids of BioShock 1 and 2 did.\n\nInfinite is a game worth playing despite those minor gaffes, and what a game it is. The story is well written, well voiced, and well developed, despite a slow ascent to an ending that nearly drops you off the cliff it happens so fast. The locales are beautiful, artistic, and infused with enough alternate history nuggets that you want to explore every part of it, even if the characters and themes within are a bit unsettling. Unlike 1 and 2, Infinite's backdrops are colorful and varied enough that you never feel tired of traversing through them. \n\nIf you enjoyed Bioshock 1 and 2, Infinite is a no-brainer. Give it a shot - you'll enjoy it. If you didn't like BioShock 1 and 2, but you like colorful, full voice acted, ambitious games that reward you for exploring its world and playing smart, then give Infinite a chance.","timestamp_created":1388806658,"timestamp_updated":1388806658,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8545311","author":{"steamid":"76561198065179007","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":1274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":674,"last_played":1591512262},"language":"koreana","review":"걍최고 무조건 최고 짱짱짱","timestamp_created":1388805915,"timestamp_updated":1388805915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8545094","author":{"steamid":"76561197993617451","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":764,"last_played":1377576961},"language":"english","review":"This was a very fun game.

It'll fuck with your mind and the last hour won't make any sense at first, but then it DOES AND IT'S AMAZING. Also, Elizabeth is the stronges female character in video gaming probably ever. Very few to zero bugs, the battle mechanics are fluid and enjoyable, and the Vigors are very fun. Plus one huge epic reference to BioShock 1 that'll also blow your mind.

I suppose it's a matter of preference, but I enjoy games that are not so linear and allow more exploration. That's not what you'll get with this game. You are led through each part of the game with no option to go back and look for any hidden treasure/open any locked doors for which you had not enough lockpicks. Probably meant to encourage being replayed, but with such a linear style of gameplay, I wouldnt play it through again. All and all though it was a great game with a fantastic storyline. The maps are fantastic and beautiful to look at. There are a limited number or weapons and the vigors are a nice touch, but you don't absolutely have to use them. On top of that, the AI isn't really that great. You can hide aand they won;t try and find you for the most part.\n\n7/10","timestamp_created":1388790013,"timestamp_updated":1388790013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8541461","author":{"steamid":"76561198039465800","num_games_owned":351,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1064,"last_played":1501884658},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic game!
