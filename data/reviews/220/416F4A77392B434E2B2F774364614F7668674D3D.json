Mas de fato cada aspecto do primeiro Half-Life foi melhorado no segundo. Desde os mais óbvios (e superficiais) como os gráficos até os que verdadeiramente importam como o gameplay e o level design de cada cenário.\n\nCabe ressaltar como a linguagem clara e intuitiva tanto da jogabilidade quanto do level design do jogo continua desempenhando um dos (vários) pontos fortes da sua sequência, dando mais um salto com a sua física avançada  e sempre respeitando a inteligência do jogador confiando que ele entenderá o que fazer. Como eu disse em Half-Life e repito para Half-Life 2: você bate o olho e sabe/sente o que o jogo espera que você faça sem ficar te apontando.\n\nAqui há uma ênfase maior na ação logo de cara, com as primeiras horas de jogo recheadas de sequências de perseguição bem hollywoodianos que já colocam a emoção e os risco lá no alto. E nesse aspecto que entra a beleza do level design de Half-Life 2 que se molda perfeitamente com o tom de cada um dos seus capítulos. Nesse início, por exemplo, temos muitos corredores longos, retros e por vezes estreitos que aumentam a tensão da perseguição. Quando temos acesso aos veículos os cenários se ampliam para absorvemos não só a extensão desse \"novo\" mundo como também a extensão do poder dos Combine, a raça alienígena que dominou a Terra na trama. Nos capítulos finais os mapas ficam mais confusos e os destroços tornam mais difícil entender qual rota seguir em meio ao caos do combate criando a sensação de como é estar numa zona de guerra. No último capítulo somos inseridos em locais de proporções titânicas que fogem completamente da realidade mas que demonstram toda a magnitude e opulência da raça dos Combine.\n\nE, por fim, temos mapas com atmosferas mais sombrias como Ravenhom e Nova Prospekt que nos fazem entender os horrores aos quais os antagonistas tem submetem quem se opõe a eles. Ravenhom em especial tem uma das melhores atmosferas do jogo, com um level design incrível que conta uma história sem precisar de texto, um bom exemplo de narrativa visual que é empregada em vários pontos do jogo. E deixei essa área por último porque nela encontramos o personagem do Padre Grigori, uma das figuras mais marcantes desse jogo, e que serve como um gancho para outra evolução observada em Half-Life 2: os NPCs. Em Half-Life NPCs serviam apenas com o propósito de nos guiar tanto pela trama quanto pelo jogo e não temos nenhum personagem construído de fato a não ser pela figura misteriosa do G-Man e a própria instituição da Black Mesa. sso muda em Half-Life 2 que separa um bom espaço de tempo e diálogos para apresentar e desenvolver novos personagens que enriquecem o universo do jogo e nos fazem criar mais laços com a história. O próprio Gordon Freeman cresce muito aqui, saindo de um mero avatar pelo qual o jogador interage com esse universo e se tornando um uma lenda e então um líder. Isso não é apenas reforçado pelos NPCs, mas pela própria jogabildade quando nos faz comandar pequenos de rebeldes tornando o Gordon uma figura heroica e símbolo revolucionário.\n\nEu poderia ficar citando o que Half-Life 2 traz de novo pra franquia como um todo, mas eu não acho isso tão importante quanto as \"novidades\" que ele traz pra dentro da sua gameplay. E o que eu quis dizer é como o jogo sempre se renova nas suas cerca de 15 horas de duração. Tem sempre algo diferente para que o gameplay não perca o ritmo e motive o jogador a seguir em frente. Isso produz o mesmo fenômeno que observei no primeiro Half-Life onde eu podia jogar por horas e sentir como se poucos minutos tivessem passado de tão imerso que eu ficava nesse gameplay e não tenho dúvidas que muitos tiveram e terão a mesma experiência.\n\nNão faltam elogios para se rasgar seda sobre Half-Life 2 e é devidamente merecido. Ele não só apenas manteve a qualidade como também a elevou para outro nível definindo-o também como outro dos maiores clássicos do seu gênero.","timestamp_created":1636410667,"timestamp_updated":1636458456,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102455529","author":{"steamid":"76561198282953035","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1626,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1623,"last_played":1646682091},"language":"russian","review":"Пушечкаа...","timestamp_created":1636408563,"timestamp_updated":1636408563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102454553","author":{"steamid":"76561198350150014","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":615,"last_played":1596113888},"language":"english","review":"One of the best game I have ever played","timestamp_created":1636406916,"timestamp_updated":1636406916,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"102454306","author":{"steamid":"76561198820939625","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2468,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2023,"last_played":1651250002},"language":"russian","review":"Чёрная Меза.

My Thoughts [/h1]\n[i] I never played half life 2 when it came out, but 14 years later, i decided to buy the game in 2018. I felt so nostalgic playing through it even though as i said - i never played it prior. Its just a (good) weird feeling you get when playing this game. The characters are well written and the combat is surprisingly deep and fun. I find some parts like the \"base defense\" sections where you fortify an area with turrets and basically just wait for rounds and rounds of soldiers to surge in, kind of tedious and lazy, although they are usually over with in 10-15 minutes, so its not a big deal.\n\nI like the pacing in the game and the big action fight sections in city 17 are a joy to take part in. I find it hard to believe that anyone could ever hate this game. \n\nPart of the reason why this game feels nostalgic and so dream-like is the graphics and [b]atmosphere[/b] (emphasis on the atmosphere).

Not only that, but the game challenges you to think outside the box. Can’t get up a ledge, that’s because you weren’t enough of a genius to realize that the default controls don’t bind any keys to “jump.” Sometimes you can’t even progress and you just have to use your epic hacker skills to clip through the map. Big brain underappreciated gameplay\n\nKinda coming off 2 but THAT LEVEL DESIGN OOOOOO BOY ITS LIKE DARK SOULS LEVEL OF DESIGN. The claymore level!? Banger. The ship?! Banger. Just brilliant level design, half the time it felt like i wasn’t even going the right way and that’s how you KNOW it’s good\n\nThe challenge is too much, it’s like this game is dark souls of first person shooters. The level in the mountains with the instakill space lasers is brilliant, like veteran mile high club levels of fps coordination is required. Or you can again use the dynamic game mechanic of no clipping past the level\n\nThe story, cmon baby, THE STORY. This is like the dark souls of story driven games! Move over naughty dog and rockstar, nobody has ever made a detailed story driven game like hunt down the freeman, which is why most of the game is just beautiful AAA cinematic cutscenes. Pair that with the star-studded cast of amazing voice actors like the guy that voice acted the president and this game is just indestructible on its story and detail, even the witcher 3’s story pales in comparison. And that twist at the end!? Amazing, didn’t see it coming\n\nIn conclusion guys, i don’t wanna see anyone on r/halflife r/gaming or r/sonic06 talking shit about my favorite game ever again!
