В игре можно принять участие на одной из двух сторон, за союзные войска в лице Американцев или на стороне Вермахта в лице элиты Германской армии.\n\nТут пара-тройка ранений или пара-тройка гранат не прокатывает. Если в тебя попали, то скорее всего ты сразу окажешься на земле или, если повезёт, продолжишь хаотическую беготню в предсмертной агонии, но это точно не на долго...\nМеханика другая, смысл тоже и игроки на много старше чем ты можешь представить.\nЕсли хочешь играть без \"ср*ча\", пустой ругани и оскорблений - заходи на европейские сервера. \nИ если вдруг случайно \"зацепил\" или убил своего, не забудь извиниться, ведь правда обидно когда тебя застрелил свой и даже этого не заметил пробегая через твой труп!\n\nИ ещё, знай! Именно ты должен прикрыть \"своего\" снайпера, гранатомётчика и пулемётчика! Только вместе и сообща можно добиться успеха своей комманды.\n\nЧто же касается недостатков игры, есть пара моментов которые иногда напрягают и хотелось что бы они были реализованы. Первое это то что нельзя выстрелить по гранате что бы она отлетела от вашего выстрела и второе это то что трупы не реагируют на взрывы гранат. По идее если граната разрывается возле убитого солдата, то тело должно реагировать на взрывную волну. \nЕщё есть один смешной момент, когда попадаешь по голове так что каска остаётся на бойце, на ней образуются раны, раны на каске, выглядят очень смешно. \nЕсли бы эти моменты в игре были поправлены и реализованы, то в целом игра была бы более \"живой\" и общая \"картинка\" игры была бы реалистичнее и приятнее.\n\nА так всё очень не плохо, особенно если поинтересоваться о том когда игра была выпущена в свет.\n\nOverall Score: 09 of 10.\n\nP.S: Это та самая игра к которой я буду возвращаться всегда.

Разработчик - всеми известная VALVE, которая выпустила эту игру в 2005 г. на движке Sourse. По своей сути DoD - это та же CS, только на тематику Второй Мировой Войны. На выбор нам дается две стороны: вермахт и союзники. Каждая сторона разделена на 6 классов, каждый из которых имеет свою экипировку, достоинства и недостатки. Задачи перед вами будут стоять разные, в зависимости от карты. Это либо типичный захват точек, либо уничтожение/защита объектов. Так чем меня зацепила на столько простая игра? Так простотой и зацепила! Любителям Battlefield 3 и отличного графона тут не место! DoD - это просто хороший тактичный шутер, простой в освоении, а главное - с адекватными игроками! Наиграл я в неё 70 часов и не припомню, чтобы за это время встречал в игре неадекватов и вопящих школьников.

Day of Defeat: Source is a old game. (2006 to be exact) It was built on Source, the engine Valve engineered for Half-Life 2, Day of Defeat: Source features amazing graphics and physical gameplay for its time back in 2006. The main object of the game is to cap all the flags and then the round is over. Most servers that you play on unless its a 24 hour server of the same map will then change after one team caps all the flags 5 times. Day of Defeat: Source is kind of like a WW2 game of Counter Strike but with this game you can respown after you die before the round is over. There has always been cool mods for this game that make you crawing back for more and more. Game mods like Left 4 Dead (DoD:S) stile, realism mod and gun game just to name a few. The game is smooth and movement at times can feel like your just floating while in movement. What keeps me interested is the fact that the game is easy to learn but hard to master. You have to learn how to compensate for recoil of every firing weapon in the game. If you are not happy with the sights that are the defalt sights you can always change them to your liking to diffrent cross hairs and diffrent colors. There are not that many set backs to the game besides that all the models are the same. However you can go on Gamebanana and download any skin you may like and change it up a bit even change the weapon skin. At times you might feel like your team is at a disadvantage because of your map postion but thats again is what keeps you into the game. The number one thing that will keep you into the game is the community. This community is very helpful with any questions you may have about the game. Just know that if you have never played Day of Defeat: Source dont expect it to be like a Call of Duty game that is easy to play. Like said before this game is easy to learn but hard to master. Before you start to play just know your going to die and die a lot but, with time and good practice you will start to become better. Dont expect it to be like a Call of Duty game that is all about how many kills you get per round but more so about just having fun with other players. Most if not all hard core Day of Defeat: Source players HATE Call of Duty and do not appreciate when little kids talk all about how Call of Duty is so much better. The game is very cheep for what you get and you will not be let down.","timestamp_created":1442959288,"timestamp_updated":1442959288,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523946285247802734","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18129000","author":{"steamid":"76561197995570552","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":151989,"playtime_last_two_weeks":8,"playtime_at_review":34644,"last_played":1659685127},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic Game.","timestamp_created":1442823354,"timestamp_updated":1442823354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18126849","author":{"steamid":"76561197967099734","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13593,"last_played":1643574657},"language":"english","review":"one of the best first person shooter out there love the game an the gameplay the germans speak in their native language","timestamp_created":1442802104,"timestamp_updated":1442802104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18124467","author":{"steamid":"76561198069582092","num_games_owned":382,"num_reviews":116,"playtime_forever":1082,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1033,"last_played":1497721448},"language":"english","review":"Pretty good WWII simulator, but hard to master, and difficult to have fun in (at least for me)","timestamp_created":1442785740,"timestamp_updated":1442785740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.324853271245956421","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18122037","author":{"steamid":"76561198078807553","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":6027,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1094,"last_played":1648308421},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um Jogo Perfeito Para quem gosta da Segunda Guerra Mundial Muito Bom Recomento","timestamp_created":1442774924,"timestamp_updated":1442774924,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18113641","author":{"steamid":"76561198053808305","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":110,"playtime_forever":325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":135,"last_played":1638358087},"language":"finnish","review":"Basic Counter Strike style game and a classic..","timestamp_created":1442739844,"timestamp_updated":1442739844,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18112856","author":{"steamid":"76561198127076219","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":578,"last_played":1505922666},"language":"english","review":"Best WWII game.
