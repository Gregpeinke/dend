First of all, the graphics. Visually it is a master piece, as the excellent colors and animations allow it to put recent titles to shame. The story is amazing, although even if you have an IQ of over 9000, you will still probably have difficulty understanding the ending. The 3 main characters are masterfully voice acted and constructed with precision rarely seen in modern gaming. All of them are developed extremely well as the story progresses. The female protagonist, Elizabeth, is without a doubt the best companion of all time. Her personality is amazing, she is very useful, and you do not have to protect her. (thank god!!!) While all these features are excellent, i would not go as far as to call it one of the best games ever, as some people have done. This is mainly because the gameplay is nothing out of ordinary and, from what I have heard, very similar to Bioshock's. In addtion the game is only about 14 hours, which is a little short. All in all, definately pick it up for like 7$ when it goes on sale, as I do not recommend buying it for 30$ simply because it is short.

I can no longer hack my way through everything and having locked doors are basically useless because Elizabeth just opens them all.

The weapon varity might be a little bit limited, but it is still there and with very creative guns of the lot that exist. The shooting is the best out of the three games with the tight controls. You now have a shelid that will deplete as you take hits and an amazing cover system to put the cherry on top. The infamous plasmids are back and better than ever with all new delicious flavours such as \"Devils Kiss\", \"Bucking Bronco\", and my personal favourite: \"Muder by Crows\". The also introduce two new systems: the Sky-hook and the ablity to control space and time in the later hours of the game. The hook is very fun to zip along with and provides us with some very gory mele kills. The albilty to control space and time is a little limted and is only there for a little part of the game, but it is still very helpful for finding cover and finding ammo. \n\n \"What did you ask 'what' when the delicious question is why didn't you buy this game already?\"","timestamp_created":1457307475,"timestamp_updated":1457307475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21672970","author":{"steamid":"76561198121325115","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":73,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":73,"last_played":1457459755},"language":"spanish","review":"no lo he terminado pero con lo que he jugado puedo valorar todos los detalles que tiene y lo cuidado que esta lo recomiendo muchisimo.","timestamp_created":1457294800,"timestamp_updated":1457294800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21672415","author":{"steamid":"76561198005763228","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1991,"last_played":1458404775},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego.. joder me acuerdo la sensacion d ecuando era niño y jugaba, este juego ha conseguido recordarmelo","timestamp_created":1457293174,"timestamp_updated":1457293174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21671272","author":{"steamid":"76561198095984105","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":764,"last_played":1516070688},"language":"brazilian","review":"O jogo foca na história, na riqueza do cenário e no realismo do shooting.

The game is one of the most beautiful game i have played visually. What about the sound? Non stop obnoxious banging, explosions and yelling from start to finish. I swear the composer of the battle music is more a danger to my health than the enemies. Extremely basic spammy FPS waves that disorientate you as the \"music\" and yelling assaults your ears. The gameplay actually reminds me alot of infamously bad \"Goldeneye rogue agent\". Towards the 3/4 mark, the enemies become bullet sponges. One of the smaller flak launching enemies took FIVE RPG rockets on EASY mode, which is the mode i played it on because i quickly realised i wanted to be done with it as soon as possible. The much praised \"innovations\" were the skylines and the vigors. The skylines served only to confuse me as i attempted to rush through the game. The vigors are almost exclusively identical flashy reskins of \"grenade\" and \"mine\". Finally the much praised story didn't do much for me considering that very early on in the game, in a flashback, I saw that the protagonist drinks absinthe. So all of the wonder and mystery about this world was *gone* when i realised \"oh, this guy is a drunk who is out of his mind laying in a ditch somewhere\" because he drinks bloody absinthe. None of it is real. It's like finding out at the end of the game that the character was *dreaming* except i found out he's a hallucinating drunkard within the first quarter hour of the game.","timestamp_created":1457289639,"timestamp_updated":1457289639,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480158746242523193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21670134","author":{"steamid":"76561198116170544","num_games_owned":701,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":811,"last_played":1577625309},"language":"russian","review":"я начинаю обзор обрати к монитору внимательней свой взор, небось слыхали вы об агентстве \"Пинтеркона\" главный герой наш именно от туда родом с законам правда теперь он уже не связан, алкоголь долги образ жизни отвязанный, действие игры происходят в 20-веке когда летающий город построили в Америки, все довольны и гордятся новым чудом света, \"Колумбией\" назвали, город плавает по ветру, вся проблема в том что Пророк начал качать права, все слушают его, и если надо умрут за него, пропала ,,Колуммбия\" за облаками где и как ее искать не кто не знает, что она замышляет не кто не в курсе, власти в панике ведь не кто не поможет и в это заварухе наш герой вступает в игру, те кому он должен бабок решат его судьбу, надо ему в тот город попасть и одну девушку сыскать, потом ее отдать, что за девушка, зачем? и в ней ли разгадка, а сможет она помочь, вернуть все обратно, и дать на все ответы, ты узнаешь когда пройдешь эту игру, ребят прошу к сюжету отнестись серьёзно, это не та игра где тупо пострелять можно, сложно всё запутанно но если понять суть, раздумья не дадут вам уснуть","timestamp_created":1457286482,"timestamp_updated":1457339301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.455985873937606812","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21669884","author":{"steamid":"76561198121768890","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":594,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":594,"last_played":1428597914},"language":"german","review":"Shooterparts manchmal zu schwer, ich empfehle den leichtesten Schwierigkeitgrad aus dem einfachen Grund damit man die Story genießen kann.

I finished the game on a friend's account before I bought it on mine, thinking I'll want to play it again.\n\n While this is game is an achievement in terms of graphics and storyline, the gameplay doesn't change much throughout the game. Sure the combat is cool and exciting, but the fact that it's mostly swarming enemies trying to shoot you doesn't require you to think strategically. If you shoot them enough they will all die. This makes the game not very replayable, which means that when you finish it the first time, there is no desire to play it again.

Zuerst war ich mit dem Ende von Bioshock Infinite 0 zufrieden... bis die DLC's kamen. \nDie DLC's waren wirklich die Rettung für eine absolut gelungene Spielereihe, denn erst mit dem zweiten \"Burial at the Sea- Episode 2\" wurden die Vorgänger wieder aufgegriffen und machten die gesamte Geschichte rund.\nSomit lohnt sich dann doch jede Stunde, die in der Welt von Bioshock verbracht wird, oder verbracht wurde.
