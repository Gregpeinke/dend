Countless times the audio would just stop altogether, the game would bug out and I would be stuck to an item, or crate would kill me, but the bugs were a small problem to a fantastic experience.

The combat is fast paced, and there are many ways to approach a situation, which is good. The game has little to no bugs. (except a bug that can glitch a mini boss into not fighting you, which happened to me.) I had no problem of finding how to progress, which 90's games always have that stigma for.

As far as the story goes, I would recommend this game. Much of the level design is interesting, and the situations you often find yourself in in this game are amusing. However, what makes me on the fence and into the realm of not recommending this game is what splits me from the many people who would recommend this game. \n\nI still play and enjoy older style and older made games in the early 2000's, but this game is hard to play at moments. Obscure sections of difficult platforming with a character who slides across surfaces as if they were lightly covered in a sheet of ice, hidden caves to continue on the story that blend in completely with the environments, enemies that come at such strength that often you almost feel like it is necessary to \"cheese\" them in order to progress. I love challenging games, I often play on the hardest difficulty in games, but with this one I went on normal difficulty, and still was often frustrated by the enemies, platforming, and generally not knowing where to go. You see, I could look past the hard enemies, and strange hidden platforming, but these hidden spots and platforming are often so un-obvious that I often found myself watching a guide in order to progress. Which is not how I would usually enjoy playing a game. \n\nMaybe I just don't know what's going on, maybe I am not meant for this game, but I just wanted to toss my 2 cents in for a game that is sitting with overwhelmingly positive reviews.\n\nDid I enjoy the game? Yes. Did I enjoy the game as a video game (actually playing it)? At times, but not so much. This game is by no means bad, but not one I would recommend to others unless they already wanted to play it.","timestamp_created":1590955870,"timestamp_updated":1590955870,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70108615","author":{"steamid":"76561198143656614","num_games_owned":515,"num_reviews":78,"playtime_forever":26,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1591311319},"language":"turkish","review":"Diyecek fazla bir şey yok fps türüne yön vermiş, zamanın ötesinde olan efsanevi oyun YARIM YAŞAM.

Слишком тугие враги по параметру “выстрелы на убийство”. И всё же он хорош. Своим нарративом и интерактивом. Своим настроением и атмосферой. Даже своей, теперь кажущейся неуклюжей, динамикой. Игры плохо проходят проверку временем, и эта не исключение. Но лучшие примеры, постарев, всё равно сохраняют то, за что их любили “тогда”.
