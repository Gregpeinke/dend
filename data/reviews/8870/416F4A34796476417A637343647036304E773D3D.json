Конечно! Такого шедевра я еще не видел! Я имею в виду не супер боевку, исскуственный интелект и чудо графику(хотя графика очень приятная и цвета насыщенны не как во многиих шутерах), а про сюжет. Сюжет очень запутанный его нужно разбирать очень быстро так как игра короткая, но все же он шедевральный. От концовки я был в шоке,  настолько там интересная развяска что хочется найти объяснение этому. Объяснение находишь, но на это требуется много времени. Про остальное могу сказать что оружий вполне достаточно, способностей тоже, локации интересные и различаются между собой, много мелких деталей как и в построении уровней так и в сюжете. Баги встречаются, куда без них? Но они настолько редкие, что их вообще можно не заметить. Бои интересные, и скучно мне стало только когда я убивал три раза одного и того же босса, а так однообразия я не ощущал.\n\nВ итоге хорошая игра с хорошей графикой и великолепным сюжетом.\n\n11/10","timestamp_created":1424811047,"timestamp_updated":1542825483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14637736","author":{"steamid":"76561197997911298","num_games_owned":829,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":1709,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":991,"last_played":1614969140},"language":"russian","review":"Шикарная игрушка, одна из моих любимых.

The story was so and so, some hate it, some love it. The ending, some people love it, others hate it. It had some interesting ideas and potential, but repetitiveness killed it for me. I couldn't even bother more than a few hours on my second playthrough (and my playtime counts with DLC and somewhat of a second playthrough).\n\nThe story has multiple plot holes and an out of nowhere plot twist that they shamelessly tried to explain in the DLC, and it has little replay value other than getting achievements and collectibles.\n\n\nIf you are looking for something a little different from other shooters (and thats mostly Elisabeth and the powers), pick it up, I can recommend this as an above average shooter, bonus when it is on sale. \n\nBut when I look at the previous bioshock games, this game is a huge failure, having very little to do with the older bioshocks and adding very little good (kind of like the \"thief\" games).","timestamp_created":1424732732,"timestamp_updated":1424732732,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.455621302127838135","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14616485","author":{"steamid":"76561197998220526","num_games_owned":1515,"num_reviews":105,"playtime_forever":3602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1859,"last_played":1541227738},"language":"english","review":"Wow.

However, as a Bioshock game, I cannot recomend this. In a couple parts Infinite is a step forward, nice visuals, not bad story, pretty good detail in some of the evironments. In othe parts though it is several steps backwards. \n\nThe main character now speaks, which I find to be extremely imersion breaking and possibly my least favorite thing about this game.\nThere's probably around 20 guns in the game, but half of them are just weaker reskins of the guns that can be aquired in the first half of the game, also a carrying limit of two guns at a time has been imposed, drastically limitting the options available for killing enemies while increasing the overall annoyance level of the game. \nUsing a melee attack is now a quick CoD like event that just involves hitting a button on the keyboard to do a scripted cinematic flashy kill.\nThe plasmid system and its associated ADAM and EVE mechanics from the first two games are gone, ripped out and replaced by a handful of vigors that attempt to stand in for the old plasmids and a few pieces of magical clothing that try to imitate tonics without success. \nAll of the vigors are practically the same, shoot to stun enemies or hold to lay a trap. \nThe hacking minigame present in the first two games is completely gone with nothing even attempting to replace it, instead there is the posession vigor that will effortlessly take control of something for a few seconds. \nFirst aide kits can no longer be stockpiled and carried around and a regenerating shield has been given to the player making health pratically meaningless anyway. \nShould the you somehow get low on health despite the shield, your new buddy Elizabeth will near instantly heal you by tossing you a free first aide kit.\nThere is nothing really worthwhile to buy from the vending machines, and the few things that are useful are obscenely expensive\nThere is a very limited number of enemy types with very few inpressive hulks like the ever present Big Daddies of the first two games. Throughout my play through I proabably encountered less than five Handymans, the supposed Big Daddy replacement.\nThe \"boss\" fight about halfway through the game just does not know when to end, it's like Irrational outsourced the design for the fight to Square Enix or something. You litterally have to kill the same thing THREE times in a row, and it is constantly summoning and reviving enemies that hardly drop any ammo. Add in the two gun limit on top of this and you quickly run out of bullets while the enemies you literally just killed come back to life over and over again.\n\nAgain, call this game by any other name and it will get a pass from me. Try and pass it off as a Bioshock game? I am extremely dissapointed with it and would not think twice about calling it the biggest letdown I've encounted in a long time","timestamp_created":1424311704,"timestamp_updated":1424311704,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14537780","author":{"steamid":"76561198116837344","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":520,"last_played":1424306177},"language":"english","review":"Never played Bioshock 1 or 2, and I just finished Infinite.

It is absolutely polished.  The stand out for me is Elizabeth.  I VERY rarely felt she was less than a true companion.  Her presence may be the first time having an AI character with you in a game didn't feel like a giant pain in the @$$.  Meaningful conversations are frequent and she is an ally that actually helps.  The small portion of the game without her was lonely!  Bravo!\n\n The environment is unbelievably rich with everyone room being completely fleshed out.  The powers, guns, items and upgrades are spaced out so that you are constantly acquiring new toys to play with.  And as you spend money to upgrade stuff you really feel them getting more powerful.  The 2 gun system is balanced and fair. The powers are extremely fun to play around with.  There is always a new way to dispatch an enemy.\n\nThe combat itself is classic Bioshock; absolute controlled chaos.  I had forgotten how intense the Bioshock combat was and was very happy with the ridiculous pace of it.  \n\nThere are a couple of small things that I think could have been better though.  There are two antagonist characters that I don't think were fleshed out enough.  Fitzroy and Slate both had more potential to be more fully fleshed out.  I think a couple more major conversations delving into who they were and more dramatic final confrontations would have done the game a lot of good,  The game also drags a bit in the 3rd quarter.  It dissolves into a bit of a grind of go here and there without a whole lot of motivation.  Specifically the 3 tears quest was a bit boring.  The confrontations with Elizabeth's mother were great, but the quest didn't have to be a grind.  I think more time with Fitzroy and Slate could have created a similar length game experience without the somewhat average portions of the game.  That being said, these things only stand out as negative because the game as a whole is so unbelievably good.\n\nOverall this is probably the best game I have played since Fallout 3.  It has been a very long time since I enjoyed a game this much!\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1424261139,"timestamp_updated":1424261139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14524902","author":{"steamid":"76561198063116291","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":682,"last_played":1440812097},"language":"english","review":"Feels like a tie with the first Bioshock, though they feel like completely different games.\n\n   I loved the soundtrack, and the voice acting was spot on. The game's setting not being in Rapture was essential. I for one was tired of underwater tunnels, and the sky world is a bright, contrasting switch. The environments are just much more colorful, in comparison to the dim Rapture. Overall, the game was much less dark than the first Bioshock, and the new setting contributes to that. If you're looking for the dark, mysterious, psychotic story and characters of the first game, it's not there. This isn't to say that Infinite does not have interesting characters, because Elizabeth is both an interesting character and good support.\n   As far as combat and gameplay goes, I was able to feel more destructive than in the first games. I think the vigors are more interesting than the plasmids of past games. With the introduction of a recharging shield, combat changes considerably. One one hand, the shield removes some of the direness of managing health, and it passively introduces spammy enemies. On the other, this is a different game than the first two. You're having to manage obvious, larger groups of enemies, where in the last games, is was more often a 1v1 or small group, and ambushes were frequent.\nLastly, I liked the ending of the story, but it was a lot of information at once, and it felt rushed.\n\n8/10, would recommend","timestamp_created":1424234831,"timestamp_updated":1424287087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ydvAzcsCdp60Nw=="}
