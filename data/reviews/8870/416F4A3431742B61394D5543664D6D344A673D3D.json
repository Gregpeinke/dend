The skyrail mechanic is interesting and has potential, but its usage within such linear level design turns it into a glorified QTE.

The combat is made somewhat interesting with the \"vigors\" powers, but for the most part, the gunplay is generic and monotonous.

Все, от начала до конца, определенно стоит внимания. 9,5/10\n\nBioshock Infinite - это один из лучших шутеров из всех, что можно себе представить. Для любого геймера (пускай даже не для любителя шутеров) говорю - это того стоит. Для головоломов найдется сюжет, для казуалов скажу - тут вы не получите экран с надписью Game Over (ни считая финальной битвы), для хардкорщиков есть режим 1999 (финальные главы попахивают Dark Souls).

Just simply beautiful. The gameplay is a slight step back from BioShock 2 in terms of difficulty and being engaging, but i think that is because of the change of scenery. Only having access to two weapons at a time limits the kind of strategy you get from having all those weapons to choose from and the different ammo you can use. Also the \"vigors\" aka plasmids they give you for most of the game will only be using two maybe three tops all game. These two things can be sort of dismissed because the story line is very good *as always with bioshock series* and lends to itself through out the game and only throws more twists and turns at you the further you go. The \"heavy hitters\" are pretty awesome and come at you in unique ways making you switch your strategy up signifigantly. \n\nCons: Here we go, I am going to be pretty hard on this game since I was in love with the other two. For starters you absolutely need a high end PC for this game, even with high end PC's you will get this thing where Elizibeth will stutter, go choppy and then just bug the hell out. It happened to me and i have a bit over recommender specs and even playing on the lowest setting where my computer could handle it my FPS would drop to under 10 way too much. This is unnaceptable and needs to be looked at. Why is is that aside from Bioshock 1 you have to have some huge issue with all your games that either make them unplayable or totally annoying. Your fans love you and love your games, stop shitting on them with huge PC issues every single time you release the game. Its not good for your sales. In my opinion the game is kind of short 15-18 hours for a single play through and that is searching everywhere, and getting ever single possible thing you can find including all the backtracking and extras, and the occasional staring off into the beautiful word for a few minutes every once and a while. \n\nOverall: just buy this game, it has a great story line, beautiful graphics, about 18 hours a gameplay in a single runthrough, the problems with the game dont really come close to outweighing the pros. WARNING IF YOU HAVE A LOW END PC DONT BOTHER BUYING THIS GAME YOU WILL LITERALLY WASTE YOUR MONEY>>>>> SERIOUSLY DONT BOTHER. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.            8/10.\n\n","timestamp_created":1399825420,"timestamp_updated":1399825420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10084575","author":{"steamid":"76561198104948560","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":977,"last_played":1528646518},"language":"english","review":"10/10 would bang again any night of the week","timestamp_created":1399824760,"timestamp_updated":1399824760,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519841313362121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10084567","author":{"steamid":"76561198092187667","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6504,"playtime_last_two_weeks":9,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1660355358},"language":"english","review":"BEST GAME EVER, Graphics and story are amazing.","timestamp_created":1399824738,"timestamp_updated":1399824738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10084547","author":{"steamid":"76561198082021747","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":755,"last_played":1398238250},"language":"russian","review":"В сюжет  надо вникать долго! так норм игра!\n","timestamp_created":1399824566,"timestamp_updated":1399824566,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10084470","author":{"steamid":"76561198118756652","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":771,"last_played":1636905582},"language":"english","review":"Amazing experience, would play a 3rd time.","timestamp_created":1399824033,"timestamp_updated":1399824033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10084346","author":{"steamid":"76561197992450894","num_games_owned":206,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5002,"last_played":1657486631},"language":"english","review":"Perfect!","timestamp_created":1399823227,"timestamp_updated":1399823227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563071727752685547","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10084300","author":{"steamid":"76561198013915158","num_games_owned":721,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":1459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1488115165},"language":"english","review":"this game is racist just like barnaby sykes 10/10","timestamp_created":1399822944,"timestamp_updated":1399822944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516478121280670166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10084289","author":{"steamid":"76561198088934375","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1515093474},"language":"english","review":"*bleeding nose*","timestamp_created":1399822878,"timestamp_updated":1399822878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10084281","author":{"steamid":"76561198033076049","num_games_owned":367,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":888,"last_played":1364972400},"language":"english","review":"This game just didn't come together right.

But don't worry, this game delivers. \n\nThe graphics, oh, don't even get me started. They are gorgeous. The lighting effects make the experience even more better. Every step you take is marvelous. Also, the voice acting is very good.\nTroy Baker, the voice of Joel from the Last of Us and Harvey Dent from Arkham City, does an incredible job as Booker DeWitt. I really think he is one of the best video game voice actors out there. And I'm not even kidding. Go onto IMDb, look up Troy Baker, and you'll be shocked on how many great games he has voice acted in.\n\nNow the story. Booker DeWitt, who must retrieve a mysterious girl from the city of Columbia, to wipe away his debt, keeps you engaged nearly the entire time. Now notice NEARLY. I think that the middle of the game slows down a little bit story-wise and just becomes a few fetch quests like, go here and get this, oh wait, it's not there, it's actually over here, etc. But once you get to that twist man, oh, be ready. It.Is.Shocking.\n\nThe gameplay has changed actually quite a bit from the first two BioShock games. You do have plasmids, but they are renamed to vigors. They have similar effects to the plasmids in the first game. The gunplay is smooth and fun, with a nice new feature called the grappling hook, where you can claw enemies in the face or ride ziplines. Those are lots of fun. \n\nInfinte is a great game. It's a new, original, and fresh FPS that we don't get a lot nowadays. \n\nTraditional Rating - 9.75/10\nPersonal Rating - A must-buy","timestamp_created":1399770244,"timestamp_updated":1403404126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10078122","author":{"steamid":"76561198024877788","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":588,"last_played":1602553327},"language":"english","review":"This game taught me that everything must explode. \n9/11 would explode again - IGN allahu akbar.","timestamp_created":1399770161,"timestamp_updated":1399770161,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10078073","author":{"steamid":"76561198086279999","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2070,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":957,"last_played":1403662127},"language":"english","review":"i loved this game so much","timestamp_created":1399769740,"timestamp_updated":1399769740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520391941070556641","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10078027","author":{"steamid":"76561198107677007","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":578,"last_played":1438209418},"language":"english","review":"simple amazing","timestamp_created":1399769396,"timestamp_updated":1399769396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10077921","author":{"steamid":"76561198100152294","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":822,"last_played":1400363849},"language":"english","review":"it ez gud","timestamp_created":1399768700,"timestamp_updated":1399768700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10077885","author":{"steamid":"76561198023104534","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72,"last_played":1400316634},"language":"german","review":"Macht richtig spaß :)","timestamp_created":1399768310,"timestamp_updated":1399768310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10077851","author":{"steamid":"76561198084927621","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1424027376},"language":"english","review":"This review will be written / edited as I progress through the game. This way I can touch on all the bases, with nothing being left out. In any case, the very first thing I noticed was the lack of variation in the character models. When I reached the city I noticed there were plenty of NPCs. Out of all the NPCs, there were ~ 6 variants. Meaning, 6 identical sets of clothing and faces. Identical twins everywhere!!! Every cluster of NPCs magically start their conversation when the player is in very close proximity. Monotony anyone?\n\nAlso, you start out in a row boat, with no reason, no lore, no anything...

Es también, y a malas, hijo de su tiempo, ya que las mecánicas de los shooters actuales mandan en la jugabilidad y dicha herencia no le sienta demasiado bien. Sí, el ritmo es frenético, las peleas muy dinámicas y las armas / vigorizadores son medianamte variados, pero eso no salva el tremendo contraste que resulta al comparar esta entrega con sus predecesoras (y en el que, a mi parecer, \"Infinite\" sale perdiendo). En \"Burial at Sea Ep.1\" estos aspectos se ven alterados, volviendo al ritmo y dificultades de Rapture, mientras que en \"Burial at Sea Ep.2\" se cambia completamente de ritmo y recursos  para centrarse en el sigilo (con una excusa narrativa muy adecuada). \n\nHasta aquí ha podido parecer que el juego no me ha convencido, pero nada más lejos de la realidad. Su ambiente, su trama, sus personajes y, sobre todo, Elizabeth, me han atrapado.\n\nSi algo nos quieren contar \"Bioshock Infinite\" y \"Burial at Sea\" es la historia de Elizabeth, no la de Booker/la nuestra. Booker/nosotros tan sólo la liberamos de su jaula, la acompañamos y la vemos cambiar para luego dejarnos ir. En cierto punto nos ponemos en su pellejo, pero la voz de Booker/nuestra voz sigue diciéndole qué hacer. Somos poco más que vehículos para su viaje. Uno que merece la pena hacer.","timestamp_created":1399766374,"timestamp_updated":1399766374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10077621","author":{"steamid":"76561198044948370","num_games_owned":402,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1923,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1335,"last_played":1624261682},"language":"english","review":"Very fun.","timestamp_created":1399765997,"timestamp_updated":1399765997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10077560","author":{"steamid":"76561198119350646","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":667,"last_played":1399932039},"language":"english","review":"Great game","timestamp_created":1399765430,"timestamp_updated":1399765430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10077352","author":{"steamid":"76561198039597814","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4780,"last_played":1603326135},"language":"english","review":"Graphics 7.5/10 <<< fair is fair, but this is compared to the best looking games out there\nGameplay 9/10 <<< Amazing, fluent gameplay with exelent feel of freedom and diversion\nStory 10/10 <<< the more anyone tells you about it, the more you're spoiled, but in my opinion the best game story ever\nMusic and SFX 8/10 <<< The music is good, but the SFX is amazing, defining the word immersion.\nComstocks beard 10/10 <<< it just is","timestamp_created":1399763809,"timestamp_updated":1399763809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485814213752746582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10077340","author":{"steamid":"76561198124186277","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":104,"last_played":1403747374},"language":"english","review":"i love the game man good work\n","timestamp_created":1399763697,"timestamp_updated":1399763697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41t+a9MUCfMm4Jg=="}
