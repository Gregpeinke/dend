Doesn't mean it's a bad game.\n\nRicochet's game mechanics revolves around simple movement. The player can move side to side, back and forth but can easily fall off the platform they are on. Players are meant to jump platform to platform, but are only able to by stepping on the arrows at the edge of the platform. The arrows then launch the player into the air and towards another platform. A player in the meantime, can jump at the same time you can and both of you can end up colliding, falling into an abyss of darkness. Or, one player can hit the right mouse button and kill the other guy with a Frisbee The player has the ability to shoot a disk to decapitate the opponent. Some of the maps I have played so far are quite intriguing, but don't offer any significant background to gaze at.\n\nIt's quite a simple game, and you basically are going to get what you pay for. Servers aren't always full, but I've been fortunate enough at the times that I do jump on (Saturday during the day) that they are.

The reason Ricochet cops it is because it was made by Valve, the Big Boys™ behind [i]Half-Life[/i] and [i]Counter-Strike[/i].

We all became absorbed by Valve’s catalogue (it was hit after hit for a while there) and developed an expectation that they have always and will always be the premier producer of digital entertainment. There are still die-hard Valve fans out there confident that [i]Half-Life 3[/i] will blow minds in an industry where fancy technology hasn’t been impressive for at least a decade.\n\nIt’s funny to look back at [i]Ricochet[/i] because it shows that your favourite game studio wasn’t always the top-notch example of polished, nuanced game design that they [strike]are today[/strike] were in 2011. All we need now is for something to come out that will tarnish the reputation of r/GamingCircleJerk’s dead idol for the present, too.
