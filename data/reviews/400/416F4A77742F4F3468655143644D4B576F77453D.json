Of course, these claims need evidence, and I have plenty. First off, the Portal Gun is such a great puzzle mechanic. Whether it's used for your own movement, or to move cubes, energy pellets, and other puzzle items. Moreover, the puzzles are the kind that you don't get stuck on for so long that you just give up and look it up online, but just enough to confuse you, but always have a some-what simple solution that needs to be uncovered. Next, I must talk about how this game is my favorite example of teaching with gameplay, not a long tutorial. In fact, this game basically has a tutorial in every chamber. Since you're learning about the game by playing it, it feels good when you figure everything out mostly on your own. Nextly, the story. This game has a VERY minimalist story, as it should for its short length. I feel like any more complicated or intricate of a story would have to be crammed into the game so tightly that it wouldn't feel like natural storytelling. Also, the music is very good, it has a great sci-fi feel to it throughout. Finally, (SPOILERS AHEAD) This game's twist is probably one of my favorite in gaming. The music is so fast paced and energetic, and it really strikes a feeling of fear and panic into you. Overall, this game is a monument in puzzle gaming. I give Portal a solid 8 / 10.\n","timestamp_created":1529531436,"timestamp_updated":1529531436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42885605","author":{"steamid":"76561198052688305","num_games_owned":485,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":133,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":133,"last_played":1498417609},"language":"english","review":"This is a game","timestamp_created":1529530476,"timestamp_updated":1529530476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":41,"votes_funny":31,"weighted_vote_score":"0.732523083686828613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42885148","author":{"steamid":"76561198362706693","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":16271,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1475,"last_played":1656028512},"language":"english","review":"---{Graphics}---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☑ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n☐ Addictive like heroin\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It‘s just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Starring at walls is better\n☐ Just don‘t\n\n---{Audio}---\n☐ Eargasm\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n---{Audience}---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☐ Average Solitare Players\n\n---{PC Requirements}---\n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☑ Decent\n☑ Fast\n☑ Rich boiiiiii\n☑ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n☐ Just press ‚A‘\n☐ Easy\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isnt necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You‘ll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{Story}---\n☐ If you want story, then go read a book.\n☐ Text or Audio floating around\n☐ Average depends an DLC\n☑ Good\n☐ Lovley\n☐ It‘ll replace your life \n\n---{Game Time}---\n☐ Long enough for a cup of tea\n☐ Short\n☑ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}---\n☐ There is no „price“\n☑ Worth the price\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money \n\n---{Bugs}---\n☐ Never heard of\n☑ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ Assassin‘s Creed: Unity\n☐ Get a bug spray.
