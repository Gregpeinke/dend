It gives you a sense of panic/anxiety the more they come closer, group play is pretty much the objective, but on certain maps, as long as you keep moving, you'll be ok.  As for the technicallities of the game, I used to play this on an old quad core from 2007 with a ATI 3xxx series card on high lol.  Pm me if you have any questions!  Looking forward to getting the second one once it goes on sale =)","timestamp_created":1482244328,"timestamp_updated":1482244328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50027763843536377","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28485828","author":{"steamid":"76561198186405309","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":42045,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3970,"last_played":1607710553},"language":"greek","review":"☺","timestamp_created":1482240129,"timestamp_updated":1482240129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492763817310333252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28482604","author":{"steamid":"76561198088201925","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3765,"last_played":1642251300},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра всех времен)","timestamp_created":1482223853,"timestamp_updated":1482223853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28480862","author":{"steamid":"76561198112213937","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":65,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65,"last_played":1482211662},"language":"english","review":"IVE HAD THE GAME EVER SINCE IT FIRST CAME OUT AND NOW THAT I WANT TO START PLAYING IT AGAIN IT WONT WORK EVEN THOUGH I OWN IT?.....

The mechanics are really great, and the weapons handle really nicely. Did not think I would actually get hooked to this game like I did. It's best played on a difficulty that's really hard for you like Hell on Earth. It really makes you think sometimes on how to not get surrounded or esacpe when everything starts falling apart around you quickly, and really improves your situational awareness of your entire surroundings.\n\nI love playing as Berserker the most since it's the most versitile perk I think. Plus having unlimited ammo is nice too. But all the Perks are pretty good if you are online and know how to play the perk correctly.\n\nAnyways I recommend this game to anyone looking for a simple, but very effective FPS game.\n\nP.S.

Why?  Primarily the really solid gameplay, and humungous variety of maps.\n\nThe gameplay is on point.  The team-based aspect of it works quite well, and I think it's a large part of why the community leans far more towards cooperative than the toxic that some other games gravitate towards.  There are key-based team commands that allow players to quickly give directions without losing their focus on the fight (this works better than the mouse-based team commands in Killing Floor 2, as there are more options and you don't lose your aim when talking with your teammates), and most players are interested in helping each other to win - fighting together, healing each other, recognizing when a player is falling back to reload and providing some extra fire in their direction.  The different classes also mean that each player has a different role to contribute - sharpshooters take out big, tough targets, support specialists can dominate small corridors and weld doors shut, medics excel at healing - and players tend to recognize their role and play it well.  Of course there are times that you'll have a bunch of experienced players on Normal difficulty who decide to go off in six different directions, but most of the time the team aspect works impressively well.\n\nThe enemy zeds and the weapons also work well.  Each zed has a different strategy, from the annoying crawlers who jump at you and are hard to hit, to the husks who launch fireballs at you from a distance, to the scrake who runs at you with a chainsaw, but can be stunned (or killed, depending on the difficulty level and weapon) with a shot to the head.  And the pacing is also very well done; you'll get a crowd of 10 - 20 zeds coming at you at once (and sometimes, if you have bad luck and poor planning, from multiple directions), but there also are times with a lull in the action, giving you a chance to reload and heal your teammates.  The pacing issue is an area that Killing Floor 2 has struggled with at times (though it's currently fairly good), but the original has it down.\n\nFrom a weapon standpoint, you have anything from the crossbow and its satisfying big hits, to the flamethrower to thin the crowd, to the Zed Eradiction Device, which microwaves zeds and includes a nice radar to detect where they're coming from.  With seven classes of weapons and six to ten weapons per class, there's plenty of variety, and they're distinguished enough to each contribute to a different style.  You'll have favorites within each class, but will switch up classes and weapons within the class some too.\n\nThere are over 800 community maps, and to this day I'm likely to find a server with one I haven't played when I go online, giving Killing Floor excellent longevity.  It's nearly always 10 waves plus a boss, but that I can play a totally new environment whenever I feel like it is a significant part of what keeps me coming back, even now that its successor is out.\n\nThe themed events also added some holiday spirit, and although KF is no longer updated to enable these globally, you'll still find servers with Christmas or Halloween zeds, and more often at the appropriate time of the year.  Although purely cosmetic, it does add some holiday flavor to see snowmen and reindeer-spiders fighting you in Evil Santa's Lair in December.\n\nKilling Floor 2 is out of Early Access now, which raises the question should you get KF1 or KF2?  As it stands today, I'd say it's close to a tie.  KF2 has prettier graphics, more varied zed tactics, and is where all the development will be going forward.  However, KF1 is still more refined at this point, and has far more maps.  Over time, both of these advantages for KF1 will narrow, but even then, there will be plenty of maps for KF1 that are unlikely to make it over to KF2.

I always like military-theme games, but they're almost all focus on pvp, and this co-op game is perfect for me. The core gameplay is simple, \"rules\" of the game and roles of the perks are easy to understand (yet difficult to master). My true has always been RPG, so the perk system is also a huge plus for me.\n\nI can't really judge the quality of the graphic, since I've only played on my laptop, but at least the graphic design is great. It's realistic and artistic at the same time, which isn't easy to make, and the character models (both player-characters and the Zeds) are interesting. And while this isn't a game full of comedic stuffs, I got addicted with a particular line and say it repeatedly in my real life (LOADSAMONEY...) I love most of the music, when it's loading I usually bang my head with the guitar riffs, looking forward to get the soundtrack. The weapons are also nicely balanced, there is no \"ultimate gun\" in this game, pretty much like the weapons in Team Fortress 2, and what gun to choose is actually depending on situations, including maps, waves and teammates.\n\nTalking about teammates, surprisingly there are still a lot of people playing this game, and I've read reviews about how this game is superior than the sequel (at least for the time being, I guess KF2 will get better and evolve in the future like its predecessor). Most players are friendly, while being silence, they would actively helping each other, as it supposedly a must and rule of thumb for such games. \n\nThe only downside for me is searching for servers. I guess this isn't a real issue, but sometimes searching for a good game is a difficult task (stable server, maps that won't take forever to download, friendly players). And there are times that you finally found that game and you got banned for unknown reason. Also while I love the game and the background setting, I'd love to get a little more story/lore from the game itself.\n\nWhen playing on good games as mentioned above, this is one of the most exciting, intense, blood boiling (and chilling) co-op FPS game. It's even better if you play with friends with mic for better communication.\n\nScore: 11/10 (Yeah, it's a homage to you, you mxxxxxxxxxing Patriarch)","timestamp_created":1481314201,"timestamp_updated":1481314648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28271884","author":{"steamid":"76561198340606469","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":10926,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4469,"last_played":1651996817},"language":"russian","review":"Залипательно, дево4ки!","timestamp_created":1481297800,"timestamp_updated":1604982521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28264956","author":{"steamid":"76561198098930812","num_games_owned":762,"num_reviews":255,"playtime_forever":30,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30,"last_played":1480226977},"language":"tchinese","review":"无法联机是什么鬼？！和盗版还有什么区别？！","timestamp_created":1481258644,"timestamp_updated":1481258644,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4086189866065979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28263563","author":{"steamid":"76561198002728071","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":105,"playtime_forever":219721,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":115398,"last_played":1623968261},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor is a hell of a zombie killer game, with cool soundtrack.\nHere some pros: \n                            + you can mod it\n                            + lots of zombies :-)\n                            + unbelievebale amount of maps \n                            + well designed\n                            + spooky atmosphere in some maps so far\n                            + lots of guns\n                            + still descent amount of servers considering that the game released back in \n                               2009\n                            + awesome gameplay\n                            + decent graphics\n                            + instant play\n                            + you can add servers to your favourite list in-game\n                            + may be the best co-op fps of all time                           \n                            + more difficult to level up in killing floor\n                            + the players are yellin' \"I'm reloadin\", which can be very helpful\n                            + this game is so much fun because of the glitches and the people\n     \nOf course i recommend the game and i'm gonna give an easily 11/10 for this one","timestamp_created":1481249464,"timestamp_updated":1605888779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60000002384185791","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28247272","author":{"steamid":"76561197999233767","num_games_owned":511,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":8142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7554,"last_played":1629106867},"language":"english","review":"The only game that I've managed to play hours of the same simple gameplay concept.
