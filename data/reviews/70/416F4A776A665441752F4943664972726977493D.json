Then again, I didn't even know what half-life was until a couple of years ago. I don't have any nostalgia towards the series, and any influence it might've had on the gaming industry won't be considered here. This game feels extremely dated. But if you can get past the outdated graphics and UI, the lack of variety in characters and voices, and the sometimes annoying ai when they won't do what they are supposed to, there's a lot more to this game than what I thought there was before I played it. A good variety of weapons, well designed maps with plenty of secret areas to search for. and a story that surprised me with how much depth it had by the end of the game, opening the door for future titles. \n\nI didn't like how default speed is super fast and you half to hold down a button to walk. Platforming felt unnecessarily difficult sometimes. I ended up making shift toggle between walk and run, which made things more managable for me, and, in my opinion, really helped the atmosphere of being inside an alien infested lab with things waiting to attack you from the dark the moment you turn a corner. \n\nAlso, anything involving having to push or pull objects is extremely buggy. Half-Life 2 improves on this significantly, but in this game, it's awful. \n\nThat aside, this game was a lot better than I thought it would be, and definitely recommend it.","timestamp_created":1591437949,"timestamp_updated":1591437949,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70378300","author":{"steamid":"76561198152950275","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":708,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":659,"last_played":1591438941},"language":"english","review":"endless level","timestamp_created":1591436054,"timestamp_updated":1591828815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70376252","author":{"steamid":"76561199012354382","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1060,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":774,"last_played":1595648685},"language":"english","review":"used half the game via walkthrough","timestamp_created":1591433583,"timestamp_updated":1591433583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70375267","author":{"steamid":"76561198119724927","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":598,"last_played":1607642870},"language":"english","review":"Very cool","timestamp_created":1591431958,"timestamp_updated":1591431958,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70374457","author":{"steamid":"76561198805640199","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1591735711},"language":"english","review":"Fucking Yeah","timestamp_created":1591430548,"timestamp_updated":1591430548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70368287","author":{"steamid":"76561198153621445","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":237,"last_played":1632845355},"language":"spanish","review":"bb","timestamp_created":1591419094,"timestamp_updated":1591419094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70365296","author":{"steamid":"76561197994818082","num_games_owned":808,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":551,"last_played":1616264342},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life is like a floppy drive.

Factor –\nHalf-Life is a fast paced first person shooter where you, Gordan Freeman, is tasked to escape the Black Mesa Facility, after conducting a failed science experiment, involving teleportation and intergalactic alien species. Half-Life captures the sense of danger, as the facility around you crumbles. You tread carefully through the rooms, and long hallways, never knowing what will confront you next. The only thing protecting you from various threats, is your hazardous environment suite, and the various weapons in your arsenal. If the story and setting was not enough to capture your attention, then fast paced action will.\n\n•\tLearning Curve –\nThose that are experienced with first person shooters on PC will find themselves very familiar with Half-Life’s systems. The game slowly introduces the player to the mechanics and weapons, with tasks and puzzles within the facility. For example, crouching to crawl through a hole in a locked door, or jumping across an electrical pit filled with water. It will even introduce you to enemies from a safe distance, to observe how they attack, before facing them yourself. With the different levels of difficulty, (Easy, Normal, and Hard), it serves as an excellent introduction to someone who is new to the first-person shooter genre, or to the veteran players, who are looking for a challenge. \n\n•\tGraphics – \nConsidering that Half-Life is nearing its 22nd birthday from its release back in 1998, its graphics are excellent for its time. It is easy to identify objects and materials in an environment. For example, there is a clear contrast between barrels and crates, or metal from wood. Intractable objects such as buttons, levers, and explosive barrels/crates are easily identifiable from the scenery. The setting is often decorated with lights, pillars, beams, and plenty of interactable objects. Enemies feel dangerous with zombies having long sharp claws, or the underside of a head-crab, (alien type within Half Life), having extensive detail on parts of the body that are not very visible to the player. Each area in the game has a unique setting that graphically looks different from others, which keeps the game feeling fresh. \n\n•\tAudio – \nThe game was paired with an upbeat techno soundtrack, that blends well with the fast-paced action. During the creepier horror segments, the game switches tone to a darker ambient chilling soundtrack. Metal, concrete, and wood have different sound effects, when the player hits or walks on the material. Enemies in the game will react with certain sounds or voice lines when attacking you. Zombies or aliens will give off a high-pitched sound, while the human enemies you face later in the game will announce their actions based on what is happening in the environment. For example, if they throw a grenade then they yell, “Grenade”! Other small details such as the enemy taunting when the player hides are also a nice addition. My one gripe about Half Life is that they use the same voice actor for each of the scientists in the facility, making it hard to have a deeper connection towards any of the characters you meet on  your adventure. Overall, the game has a very well thought out audio.\n\n•\tControls – \nThe controls in Half-Life are very easy to understand, especially if you are familiar with any first-person shooters on pc. Early on, the game teaches you all the movement controls during a lengthy introduction sequence, and later teaches you basic interactive and HUD controls, to progress in the story. The game is very flexible when it comes to editing controls, through the options menu if needed. A helpful addition that Half-Life adds that I wish more games would integrate, is alternative key binds for your controls. For example, if I wanted to bind the C-KEY and the spacebar both cause my character to jump. To sum up, Half-Life has very simple and easy to learn controls that coincide to other games of its genre. \n\n•\tStory – \nWithout spoiling the story for anyone that has not played, you play a scientist tasked, to escape the Black Mesa Facility, after conducting a failed science experiment, involving teleportation and intergalactic alien species. Something I admire about Valves story telling is that they never force you into cutscenes to spoon feed you the story. The story is told with all the actions and conversations that are happening around you. On top of that, the story avoids clichés of typically story telling at the time. Half Life’s story feels unique with its more than meets the eye lore. The world feels plausible, you are just a scientist that works in a secret facility, not a super soldier like most games related to this genre.\n\n•\tCharacters – \nThe main character of Half Life is Gordan Freeman, a theoretical physicist, MIT graduate that works at the Black Mesa Facility, doing subatomic and nuclear research. Gordan is an interesting character because he spends the entire game as a silent protagonist. As I said before, Valve’s story telling revolves around the people, and environment you interact with. Everything you learn about the main character is told to you externally. This helps you connect to the main character by putting you in his shoes. Another character that I feel is worth mentioning is an older individual that goes by the name G-Man. Although the character seems to be human, he presents himself like a god that can bend space and time at will. Throughout Half Life there is many moments where you can spot the G-Man observing you, as you traverse the Black Mesa Facility.\n\n•\tLevel Design – \nHalf Life’s Level design is built semi linear, with the occasional puzzles, and secrets mixed in with it. As you explore the Black Mesa Facility you run through many unique looking environments such as labs, sewers, the New Mexico desert, etc. Although all these areas are very different, they still feel like they are small parts of the whole Black Mesa Facility. Within these environments there are parts that are light or shaded and inside or outside the facility. This helps to keep variety within the environment, accompanied with planned enemy placement, and events as you explore. The level design in the game fits well with the story, and is on par, with the learning curve as you progress the narrative.\n\n•\tChanges – \nIf I were to make any changes to Half Life, it would be a rework of some of the physics. Puzzles that require pushing boxes feels odd with their directional movement. Ladders feel hard/ridged to get off, sometimes throwing you off in awkward direction. From time to time when you are swimming out of the deep water you will hop out of the water only to be thrown back in. Some other changes I would also like to see is more variety of voice actors for the scientists to make them more unique or personable. Lastly, an improvement I would like to see a rework of certain parts of the game. For example, there is a part early in the game where you are crawling through a labyrinth of air vents that mostly come to a dead end.\n\n•\tRecommendation – \nSo, who would I recommend this game to? I would suggest this game to anyone who is interested in the story of Half Life but have not played the older titles. Anyone who is interested in playing a retro first-person shooter game, or maybe if they are curious on how Valve started off. Considering that Half Life is the parent that defined games such as Counter-Strike or Team-Fortress. Another small benefit of Half Life is that it is accessible on any modern computer. If that was not enough Half Life is considered to be a hallmark of a good game and considered a must play for some. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1591247885,"timestamp_updated":1591247885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.702127695083618164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70266340","author":{"steamid":"76561198986204773","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1439,"last_played":1614129074},"language":"english","review":"it gud","timestamp_created":1591239878,"timestamp_updated":1591239878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70265856","author":{"steamid":"76561198263262934","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":433,"last_played":1608598902},"language":"english","review":"A quintessential epic game","timestamp_created":1591238681,"timestamp_updated":1591238681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70265539","author":{"steamid":"76561198360627664","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":232,"last_played":1651982078},"language":"english","review":"Still holds up after 21 years in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1591237948,"timestamp_updated":1600492750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70264809","author":{"steamid":"76561198007570150","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4,"playtime_at_review":536,"last_played":1660422157},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1591236354,"timestamp_updated":1591236354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70262945","author":{"steamid":"76561198977431429","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":20498,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":283,"last_played":1639784951},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1591231741,"timestamp_updated":1591231741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507575750350952148","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70261575","author":{"steamid":"76561198982581925","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":186,"last_played":1643218634},"language":"english","review":"Bão dimais","timestamp_created":1591228787,"timestamp_updated":1591228787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70259283","author":{"steamid":"76561198200901487","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1584704472},"language":"english","review":"The game is flowing even now, this demonstrates that this game is legend literally, there is a huge path on our way which is full of monsters and agents and we are amidst this complicating fighting.
