When it was released back in 2004 shortly before the sequel came out, it was misunderstood to be a full remake of the original game, to be redone completely in the Source Engine, which isn't the reason why Valve rereleased it in the first place. HL:S is meant for those who were new players for HL2,  to give them with HL:S the first game fitted with the tone of its sequel. And because the Add-Ons Opposing Force and Blue Shift weren't relevant with HL2s and E1&2s lore, it gives a reason more why to prefer HL:S over the original.","timestamp_created":1542403949,"timestamp_updated":1584202395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45842438","author":{"steamid":"76561197998754519","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":153,"last_played":1616343429},"language":"english","review":"The original is better. There's no real benefit from using the source engine here. Sure, a few higher poly models for NPCs and weapons, but the environments are the same. \n\nThe downsides to this version of the game are many:\n\nGame breaking bugs: \n- You can't even start playing the game before you get stuck. The second security guard that's supposed to let you though an airlock just stares straight into space and does nothing. It's not until you start debuggig the game in your mind that you might realize that perhaps the default running speed is too high and that a scripted event fails to trigger because of sloppy tolerances in the code. But I don't want to play a game developer simulator, I want to play Half-Life...\nAnnoying bugs: \n- If you bump into a security guard he starts moaning and never stops.\n- The shotgun basically makes no sound at all. Bubble wrap makes more noise. It feels as though you're shooting water balloons through the barrel. \n- You know the deafening clang the crowbar makes when hitting metal? It now does that sound for practically every material, including wooden boxes. I think glass and enemies are the only exceptions. Super annoying.\n- The movement seems to have more inertia than the original game. It's Half-Life on ice. You'll needlessly fall to your death numerous times because of it.\n- The hand grenades look miniscule and out of place on your screen when you're wielding them.\n\nI stopped playing, because the shotgun is supposed to be loud. I think I'll just start over with the original instead which is much more enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1542380574,"timestamp_updated":1542380574,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626815319061279297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45826362","author":{"steamid":"76561198295129723","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1630455985},"language":"russian","review":"МОЙ ГЛАЗ ПОЙМАЛ МАСЛИНУ ОТ ЭТО ПРЕКРАСНОЙ ВОДЫ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1542293914,"timestamp_updated":1542293914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.637188732624053955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45817565","author":{"steamid":"76561198057612089","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":475,"last_played":1575308841},"language":"latam","review":"Half Life: Source es una remasterización del Half Life original al motor Source, personalmente me gustó bastante porque estética y visualmente está muy bueno, plasmándose en algunos detalles como los reflejos del agua, los diseños de las armas, así como también en el diseño de los personajes y enemigos. Aún cuando haya dicho esto, debo advertirte que esta versión de HL tiene varios bugs; en los capítulos del inicio y del medio del juego (que se desarrollan íntegramente en las instalaciones de Black Mesa) no se notan demasiados problemas, la verdadera cuestión (o el verdadero dolor de cabeza, podría decirse) se da en la fase final, es decir cuando entrás a Xen, hay cuadrados o \"agujeros\" oscuros por todos los lugares (en el cielo, los paisajes, el suelo...), además noté que algunos de estos paisajes de fondo no están bien pulidos porque no tienen casi ninguna diferencia con los del HL original (se supone que al ser el motor Source mucho más avanzado, deberían verse mejor en esta versión supuestamente remasterizada que en el HL original, que usaba un motor más viejo como el GoldSrc), y por último el bug que más me puso nervioso: el Jefe final (Nihilanth) es inmortal, no importa qué le tires, tiene vida infinita, si bien es cierto que se le puede romper el campo de protección (los 3 cristalcitos amarillos), su cabeza Nunca se abre, por ende es invulnerable. Sin lugar a dudas, prefiero seguir jugando el Original mil veces aunque tenga gráficos más viejos. Resumiendo: Medianamente entretenido y vistoso, pero plagado de bugs en Xen. Aún así soy fan de toda la saga, así que banco esta versión porque tampoco está tan mal, para pasar el rato sirve; te recomiendo comprarlo en ofertas, cuando su precio son solo unos centavos (yo lo hice así).
