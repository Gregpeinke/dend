The gameplay is also weaker than the previous two Bioshock games by limiting the types of weapons you can have on you but there a lot of mediocre weapons. Skyhook is great though. You can't constantly use vigors like in the other Bioshock games or even really constantly recharge your health by finding med kits. The ending also didn't feel like a Bioshock ending. The Lutece twins are never really explained for why they are helping you. I love the DLCs though.
