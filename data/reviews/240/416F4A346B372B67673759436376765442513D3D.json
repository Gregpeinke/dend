Es gibt viele selbst gemachte Mods (Jail, Zombie, Gungame,...) und es gibt noch viele Leute, die dieses Spiel spielen. Es ist nicht wie bei Call of Duty, wo man nur durch die Massen geht und alles tötet. Hier braucht man übung. Ob man jetzt den standard Gamemode mit der Bombe spielt, oder andere von Fans gemachte Mods spielt. Die Source Engine fließt perfekt in das Spiel ein. Das Spiel ist für Strategen perfekt, aber auch für Zocker, die nur rumrennen und alles töten was sie sehen. Man muss aber schon etwas üben, damit man sich in diesem Spiel beweisen kann.

It's phenominal, really, this shooter is incredibly realistic in the fact that tactic, strategy, and skill are all equal members of the combat triangle. Your latency is the best tool you can have, but even then, its a test of skill, and a great one at that. Once you warm up to the system, learn the ways, and pick up your Assault Rifle, as long as your rig can stand it, this game is addicting.","timestamp_created":1334440392,"timestamp_updated":1334440392,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3106363","author":{"steamid":"76561198017541504","num_games_owned":322,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":10170,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9795,"last_played":1452358524},"language":"english","review":"Very competitive, difficult and fun.","timestamp_created":1334374720,"timestamp_updated":1334374720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2484894","author":{"steamid":"76561198008084810","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":10074,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7702,"last_played":1650440148},"language":"english","review":"This game is So Brave","timestamp_created":1334328986,"timestamp_updated":1334328986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"786263","author":{"steamid":"76561197978311131","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":23164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":20793,"last_played":1566448327},"language":"english","review":"Best Online Game","timestamp_created":1334304328,"timestamp_updated":1334304328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1264166","author":{"steamid":"76561197990307721","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":8784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7374,"last_played":1527184870},"language":"english","review":"This game is about countering strikes.","timestamp_created":1334265361,"timestamp_updated":1334265361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4266719","author":{"steamid":"76561198034758853","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1196,"last_played":1445132709},"language":"english","review":"It's a really good FPS, cinda hard at first, but once you warm up, nothing can stop you.","timestamp_created":1334263360,"timestamp_updated":1334263360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5304508","author":{"steamid":"76561198047676084","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9939,"last_played":1354521600},"language":"french","review":"Exellent Fps , qui demande beaucoup d'entrainement pour profiter pleinement du online , avec de nombreux mode disponible la durée de vie est imense !!!\n\nEt pour ce prix n'hésitez pas !!","timestamp_created":1334245605,"timestamp_updated":1334245605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2212763","author":{"steamid":"76561198004116512","num_games_owned":357,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":728,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":642,"last_played":1567914762},"language":"english","review":"tryin 2 hard 2 be halo\n\nu cant beat the king","timestamp_created":1334166266,"timestamp_updated":1334166266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":50,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577018916606903076","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5318199","author":{"steamid":"76561198047857567","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":58025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":35843,"last_played":1451354663},"language":"english","review":"If you like a fps with the following I highly recommend:\n\nGun games! : In the mode of Counter strikes you and other will compete to level through the list of guns set out for you.

But what I saw was a beautiful game of no regenerating health, lack of any cover whatsoever, the mechanic of buying weapons, fun mods and maps, etc.  Counter strike is a great experience that shows how good valve is at making online FPS and how much better they are at it in comparison to companies like EA and Activision.  My complaints with the game is the learning curve, the mind boggleing accuracy of the lowest pistol to headshot you can get annoying, how intence the game can get, the lack of hats, and the less newbie friendly system of matchmaking.  But other than those complaints, CSS is a great online shooter expirience that feels smooth as silk with controls and gameplay in comparison to COD or Halo.
