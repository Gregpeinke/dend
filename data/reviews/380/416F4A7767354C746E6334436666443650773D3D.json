Isso torna o jogo e a sua experiência ruim? Nem um pouco.\n\nO jogo continua do exato ponto onde acabou o game anterior (Half-Life 2), e agora que Alyx e Gordon impediram o Dr. Breen, eles percebem que devem fugir da Cidade 17 o mais rápido possível, já que o núcleo da cidade está prestes a entrar em colapso. A partir daqui, ambos os personagens tentam a sobrevivência nessa guerra, além de estarem à procura de uma maneira de abandonar a cidade em segurança.\n\nComo dito anteriormente, esse game tecnicamente é igual ao seu anterior.. seja na famosa narrativa em tempo real, a mecânica de jogo, o seu arsenal e seus inimigos. \n\nExiste 1 inimigo novo, que são os \"Zombines\", vulgo Combines com Headcrabs... e cuidado: eles são suicidas.\n\nA maior diferença deste jogo da franquia, é que a personagem Alyx será sua companheira (ou Sidekick) por todo o jogo. Ela é uma personagem muito viva e divertida, e consegue até dar um pouco de personalidade para o mudo protagonista Freeman. Constantemente ela lutará ao seu lado, o que diminuirá um pouco a dificuldade do game, já que ela possui armas com munição infnita, além de particularmente eu não ter visto ela morrendo durante o decorrer do jogo.\n\nA pior parte do jogo? A duração.\n\nHalf-Life 2:Episode One é um excelente jogo, mesmo repetindo a fórmula do seu antecessor, e com sua duração minúscula. A adição da Alyx como sidekick poderia ser um erro e frustrante, mas além dela realmente te ajudar, acaba dando uma dinâmica maior e mais interessante no transcorrer do game.","timestamp_created":1438824758,"timestamp_updated":1438824758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17396029","author":{"steamid":"76561197999143672","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":94,"playtime_forever":171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":171,"last_played":1409164466},"language":"english","review":"Remember HL2 ? \nJust continue the ride !\nFreakin' too short btw...","timestamp_created":1438763453,"timestamp_updated":1438763594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17376981","author":{"steamid":"76561198190059623","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":314,"last_played":1464571003},"language":"english","review":"This game is a great game along with the rest of the half life games, I love it","timestamp_created":1438657971,"timestamp_updated":1438657971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17371427","author":{"steamid":"76561198036063422","num_games_owned":781,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1438628861},"language":"english","review":"If you think HL 2 is good, just wait.

Il gioco è molto simile al suo predecessore e comincia proprio dove quello si conclude, consentendoci di vedere che effetto abbia avuto su Gordon e Alyx la conclusione di HL2.\nSostanzialmente, il titolo ricalca nel gameplay esattamente gioco precedente, mantenendo le stesse ambientazioni ma elaborando qualche sequenza di gameplay estremamente innovativa e gradevole, come [WARNING: SPOILERS] l'attesa dell'ascensore nel buio più totale subendo l'assalto di ondate di mostri, l'attacco al nucleo della città dei combine e il combattimento finale contro lo strider; da notare l'inserimento di un nuovo tipo di nemico, lo \"zombine\" o \"zombie-combine\" che rappresenta una versione particolarmente resistente dello zombie e capace di lanciare granate. Carina la presenza di alcune trappole ambientali molto ben fatte).\nIl titolo è divertente, bello e estremamente solido, ma pecca per innovazione (che pure non si poteva troppo pretendere, essendo una propaggine del titolo precedente) e per la longevità che si attesta fra le 4 e le 6 ore.\n\nVoto 9/10.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------FOR NON ITALIAN VIEWIERS---------------------------------------------------\nBasically, this game is the prosecution of HL2. There's not many innovations, but there's a new kind of enemy: the zombine, zombie+combine, that is more strong and hard then normal combines and zombies. Ambient is like HL2 with some nice news (likes some traps). Shooting is nice, platforming too but there are few platform sequences. Very solid game with a pair of ephical situations in the final.

You spend more time with Alyx, whether that's a good thing or not is subjective, but I personally like how they built her character. It also includes the commentary system Valve has been putting in their games ever since Lost Coast which gives cool insights in the development of the game. It gives more than just the satisfaction of knowing what happens after Half-Life 2, it really is worth buying just for the new gameplay as well.","timestamp_created":1437013981,"timestamp_updated":1437013981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571133017539978027","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17051187","author":{"steamid":"76561198129967099","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":148,"playtime_forever":1078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":390,"last_played":1618759160},"language":"english","review":"The sequel to the best game ever made.","timestamp_created":1436911297,"timestamp_updated":1436911297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501111626625061035","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17048813","author":{"steamid":"76561198072948177","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1502977610},"language":"russian","review":"ТАКАЯ Ж ОФИГЕННАЯ ЧАСТЬ КАК И ВСЕ ПРЕДЫДУЩИЕ МЕНЯ ЛИЧНО ПАРАЗИЛО.","timestamp_created":1436901352,"timestamp_updated":1436901352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489361703395843506","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17036227","author":{"steamid":"76561198187381137","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":533,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1454446740},"language":"spanish","review":"apesar de que el episodio sea corto distrae mucho","timestamp_created":1436834432,"timestamp_updated":1436834432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17034453","author":{"steamid":"76561197960281953","num_games_owned":274,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1436738311},"language":"german","review":"grossartig! .. and the story continues","timestamp_created":1436825063,"timestamp_updated":1436825063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17031913","author":{"steamid":"76561198194932642","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1602631172},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2: Episode One leaves off where Half-Life 2 ended, Gordon and Alyx now strive to rally up the remaining citizens and escape City 17 before sheer destruction occurs.
