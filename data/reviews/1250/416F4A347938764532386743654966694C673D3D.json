Spory dotyczą głównie coopa, wielu twierdzi, że w L4D wygrywa pod tym względem, a jest tak zazwyczaj dlatego, że widzieli/grali runde w KF na łatwym lub średnim poziomie trudności. Na tych poziomach rzeczywiście współpraca nie jest kluczem do wygranej - każdy może poradzić sobie sam. Na wyższych poziomach już tak nie jest - przeciwnicy są bardziej agresywni. mają więcej życia i zadawają więcej obrażeń, my zaś zarabiamy mniej kasy na fajniejsze zabawki. I tu KF pokazuje swoje pradziwe oblicze tzn. oddal się trochę, a zginiesz. W teamie dobrze jest mieć medyka, strzelca wyborowego do zdejmowania Scrake'ów i Fleshpound'ów, na resztę dobry jest komandos - pod warunkiem, że gramy na niższych falach. Później robi się zdecydwanie trudniej i przydaje się umiejętność penetracji specjalisty wsparcia do zabijania kilku wrogów na raz. Dobrą klasą jest także berserker - oszczędzamy mnóstwo kasy na amunicji.\nDla mnie zdecydowanie Killing Floor wygrywa. Ta gra posiada niesamowity poje**** klimat, szczególnie uwielbiam tą muzykę lecącą w tle. Może i jest to tylko zwykła napie*dalanka do mutantów, ale system leveli i perków sprawia, że ta gra nie znudziła mnie tak szybko jak L4D. Co prawda Left posiada sporo ciekawych rodzajów misji, ale satysfakcja ze zdobycia 6 levelu obojętnie jakiego perka, zebranie kasy na potężniejsze bronie lub wygranie rundy podczas gdy zostałeś sam na ok. 100 mutantów albo patriarchę, jest po prostu świetna.","timestamp_created":1412533438,"timestamp_updated":1412533438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.594657242298126221","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12376937","author":{"steamid":"76561198132119346","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":11987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2267,"last_played":1652624721},"language":"russian","review":"Игра отличная))\n\nОткладываю деньги на KF 2)","timestamp_created":1412521107,"timestamp_updated":1423395924,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12376539","author":{"steamid":"76561198061577012","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":10140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7192,"last_played":1643461869},"language":"english","review":"www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON-7v4qnHP8 Sums it up pretty well","timestamp_created":1412519059,"timestamp_updated":1424612058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12375311","author":{"steamid":"76561198114485006","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1461013408},"language":"russian","review":"Игра в принципе даже ничего , интересная , но она быстро надоедает !","timestamp_created":1412512927,"timestamp_updated":1412512927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12373970","author":{"steamid":"76561197996329566","num_games_owned":2809,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":441,"last_played":1412502888},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor is an FPS zombie Shooter.  It's generally a multiplayer game but the game let's you play solo by setting up a server where no other players can join, so effectively you get single player OR you can play with friends coop.  The game starts with you facing down the first wave of zombies.  During this wave, you must slowly find your way to the shop keeper so you can upgrade your gear (weapons, items, etc).  The shop keeper is somewhere on the map and there's an arrow in yur HUD pointing in the direction of the next shop.  If you clear a wave then a red trail appears showing you exactly where the shop is.  You can customize for more waves by selecting a longer game.  Each wave is kept track of in your HUD, with zombie and wave count.\n\nThere are items like guns and ammo available for pick up around the map.  The weapons available at the shop aren't bad but generally, if you've opted for the DLC then you have a bigger choice of weapons to use.  Weapons basically have a cumbersome/weight factor so you can't carry everything you want for each wave of zombies.  There are varrying zombies that do several things so depending on what you're facing might depend on what loadout you choose. When you have zombies firing missile launchers in your direction, you may opt for the body armor.\n\nThe graphics aren't bad for an old game... but it is an old game so you're dealing with an old graphics engine no matter how much DLC you add to your initial game.  There's several unique zombies and creatures that are pretty creative in their gore factor. Headshots have that slow motion action feel to them adding to the eye candy effect a bit.  There is quite a following of the game and there's even new DLC every so often that include maps and unique character sets with tons of achievements to farm for.  There's plenty of maps and the better you know the map, the better you play.  Incidentally, there's no mini-map so you REALLY have to know the map for longer survival and shop locations.  \n\nMy only real problem with the game is that you can't run.  If you're used to playing COD or some other FPS where you can just take up a sprint... not here.  The game will let you slow down to a walk though.  I'm assuming for better aim as you're moving and firing at the same time.  \n\nI'm a fan of Tripwire games so this is right in there as a classic fave.  It's an old game but I'd still recommend it ON SALE... with the DLC on sale.  You can get multiple DLC packages and the game itself super cheap when there's a sale.  Looking forward to Killing Floor 2 for sure.","timestamp_created":1412505242,"timestamp_updated":1412505763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12373573","author":{"steamid":"76561198094525149","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":3388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":850,"last_played":1575284391},"language":"russian","review":"Игра очень интересная) Как в плане атмосферы, так и в плане геймплея и музыкального сопровождения) Еще игра понравилась тем, что играть интересно не только с друзьями, но и с другими людьми.

Well thats becuase they have \n     a leveling system. Each level you gain is going to boost your stats, an example would be the Field medic: With each \n     level you will heal people for more or gain more movements speed all of wich will benefit you troughout the game.  \n     \n- The community: Killing Floor has one of the strongest and most productive communities out there, there are thousands        of videos on youtube that gives others information about varius things like \"How to stun a scrake\", \"Kill Flesh Pounds in seconds\" and top it of: There is always someone playing out there, wether its 2 am. or 9 pm. there is always someone playing\n\nThis review is already long enough so i will just sum it up:\nKilling Floor is one of the best and most addictive games out there and would recommend everybody to pick it up and try it","timestamp_created":1412107052,"timestamp_updated":1412107052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12303657","author":{"steamid":"76561198044980408","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":12021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11744,"last_played":1590142111},"language":"english","review":"A very nice shoot'em till they stop movin game.\n\nYou are a surviver who either works alone (very difficult) or in a team.\nYour mission; Kill everything they throw at you.\nA normal game consists of 10 waves of enemys, this becomes increasingly difficult with specials joining the fun at around the third wave.
