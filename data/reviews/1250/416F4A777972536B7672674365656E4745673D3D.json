Não é uma nota ruim, mas se eu tivesse que dar uma nota seria 90 por tudo o que esse jogo me proporcionou. E esse é o ponto de quão relativa pode ser essa nota e o quanto ela pode influenciar na compra ou não de um jogo. Killing Floor - ou simplesmente KF para os íntimos - se comparado a jogos novos , é um tanto limitado , tanto na jogabilidade quanto nos gráficos , mas nem por isso um jogo pior, pelo contrário: é melhor que muitos jogos AAA. Boa variedade de armas , inimigos desafiantes , muitos mapas e um suporte incrível do desenvolvedor. Acredito até que esse suporte frequente fez com que o jogo que inicialmente era cheio de limitações e alguns problemas ficasse mais variado e praticamente sem bugs. Demonstra o respeito que o desenvolvedor têm pelos fãs do jogo e mostra que é possível sim, uma empresa se dedicar a uma constante melhoria do jogo.Recomendo para aqueles que gostam de shooters que mesclam terror e ação com cooperatividade extrema, é diversão certa.
