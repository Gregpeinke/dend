È Portal, e ormai lo conosciamo tutti. 5 ore di puzzle a base di portali, in cui la protagonista deve superare le stanze di test a cui verrà sottoposta, con la guida di Glados, un'intelligenza artificiale nota a tutti come una delle migliori personalità in un videogioco. L'unica arma è una pistola che spara due tipi diversi di portali, consentendovi di riapparire da una parte all'altra del livello. Enigmi ingegnosi, mai troppo ostici e danno soddisfazione. Geniale.","timestamp_created":1316533576,"timestamp_updated":1316533576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4916212","author":{"steamid":"76561198043275438","num_games_owned":1217,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1318230000},"language":"english","review":"虽然我玩这游戏感觉晕晕的，但这是个很考人的好游戏\n","timestamp_created":1316521746,"timestamp_updated":1316521746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5362637","author":{"steamid":"76561198048542553","num_games_owned":964,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":139,"last_played":1590096791},"language":"english","review":"it is a great game for single player. and it is made out of cake!","timestamp_created":1316488563,"timestamp_updated":1316488563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4806331","author":{"steamid":"76561198042033974","num_games_owned":887,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":1013,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":509,"last_played":1644161701},"language":"koreana","review":"말이 필요없는 명작. 꼭 해라, 두 번 해라.","timestamp_created":1316418467,"timestamp_updated":1316418467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4067226","author":{"steamid":"76561198031556659","num_games_owned":710,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":536,"last_played":1316070000},"language":"koreana","review":"퍼즐게임의 묘미를 알려준 게임","timestamp_created":1316410835,"timestamp_updated":1316410835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2280343","author":{"steamid":"76561198005075896","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":795,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":790,"last_played":1640658846},"language":"english","review":"I find the controls a little spacey at times (or maybe because I'm getting nauseous as I'm hurtling through infinite space).
