Noticeably smooth gameplay, beautiful environment and surprisingly deep story and characters. \n\nMy favorite part about this game is not the cool weapons, powerful Vigors, or extremely likeable, if not somewhat gruff, protagonist, however. \n\nThe best part about this game in my eyes is your companion throughout much of the game, Elizabeth. Elizabeth is not what I expected when the plot led me towards a girl I was supposed to capture or save, of that I wasn't sure at the time. She is deep, she is smart, she is... helpful? She acts like I would probably act if I was to suddenly accompany Booker DeWitt to Columbia. She gets behind cover when the bullets start flying, she finds you ammo when you run out and coins when she wanders. Watching her in any given situation is always a delight because of the many actions she will perform in all different circumstances.

Аннабель во время подкидывающая патроны и аптечки, голософоны которые я слушал с неимоверным удовольствием, огромный железный соловей пищавший всю игру...

Also, vigors.  Why don't the cops use them?  Why don't the civilians use them?  In the original they were tightly interwoven with the world, in here they're only around because someone decided bioshock was about the combat. Well, for me at least, that's wrong it's about a thought-provoking story more than combat.  The story is very good, though you really HAVE to explore in order to get the lore of the city (also when you find the finks house go inside) and the lore's very well done and thought out, but it's not perfect.

At first glance it may seem to be a more bright and farely more colorful version of its counter part, but this isn't the truth for long. The gameplay is certainly more fast pased than the original BioShock, but don't let that aspect stear you away from an amazing game with an outstanding story to tell. I loved the game so much that I played it more than once and beat it on 1999 mode. Although you may think the game is over when credits roll, but there still is the Burial at Sea  DLC to experience; the DLC that wraps everything up giving a new point of view and a revisit of one of gamings favorite locations. I highly recommend this game and the Burial at Sea DLC to anyone who loved the original BioShock and is in the mood for a story and gameplay that will make you crave more.","timestamp_created":1400969714,"timestamp_updated":1400969714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10222847","author":{"steamid":"76561198089240393","num_games_owned":235,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":246,"last_played":1450175601},"language":"russian","review":"[10/10]\n\nПотрясающая история, удивительная атмосфера, харизматичные персонажи.\nЭта игра сравнима с очень красочной, непредсказуемой и захватывающей книгой, от прочтения которой действительно сложно оторваться.","timestamp_created":1400964659,"timestamp_updated":1400964659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482142865657806396","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10222785","author":{"steamid":"76561198035620307","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":3452,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1855,"last_played":1501097114},"language":"english","review":"A lot of fun but felt it was too short.","timestamp_created":1400964201,"timestamp_updated":1400964201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10222771","author":{"steamid":"76561197971115372","num_games_owned":417,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":788,"last_played":1501594650},"language":"german","review":"Klasse Game :)","timestamp_created":1400964127,"timestamp_updated":1400964127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10222228","author":{"steamid":"76561198087502846","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":872,"last_played":1400960498},"language":"russian","review":"Это просто шедевр.10 из 10","timestamp_created":1400960814,"timestamp_updated":1400960814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10221945","author":{"steamid":"76561197984481266","num_games_owned":429,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1284,"last_played":1506880273},"language":"english","review":"Although a bit of a later, I've decided to start and finish the game.

Для всех кому не интересен сюжет, можете полюбоваться красивой девушкой Элизабет, которая будет с нами на протяжении почти всей игры.\nИтак! После 7+ часов геймплея хочу сказать, что игра меня очень порадовала. Ведь все действия происходят не под водой, а на небе. Это что-то новенькое, не так ли? Атмосфера происходящего не отпускает на протяжении всей игры, что и остаётся обычным для серии BioShock. Суперспособности, оружия, крюк-пила, что ещё нужно для счастья? Постоянные баталии не дают нам ни на секунду расслабиться, что очень и очень даже радует.\n\nКак поклонник серии, могу сказать...11/10.\nMust have!

Fantastic gameplay, superb storyline, and a npc escort character that genuinely helps out. A very good game, but somehow is just missing something. I found the shooting mechanic clunky, the vigors a touch on the pointless side, and I really didn't like how Booker kept saying 'huh' or 'hmm' in the least interested way possible every two minutes. Unfortunately the plot suffered a bit in the middle - as soon as Elizabeth creates holes in alternate dimensions (not a spoiler there, this happens relatively early on) I saw how it was going to end. Maybe not exactly how, but that kinda ruined the game in my opinion.
