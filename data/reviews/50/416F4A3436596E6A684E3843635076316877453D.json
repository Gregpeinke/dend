FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME (DLC). You play as someone who rivals Gordons Freemans badassery, whats his name? It's Corpral Adrian fucking Shephard! This guy, if he was in Half Life 2, would tear through the combine easily and faster then Gordon ever can in his life. Anyway lets get back on track. The gameplay I would say is more diffcult, but is very fun and rewarding. Overall, in my personal opnion this game is much better then the orginal Half Life, and gives you the prospective of the HECU aka the Marines, which is intresting. Though this game is fun I'm very saddened that they haven't picked up on the Corpals story, I would love to see a follow up to Adrian. Anyway, I would rate this game a 10/10. The gameplay is fun, and a little diffcult but overall a great game. This is a must buy for any Half Life fan, but i would honestly suggest this to anyone who enjoys: fun little puzzels, first person shooters, Valve games, diffcult but rewarding gameplay, and a good story.","timestamp_created":1511429366,"timestamp_updated":1511429366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36980800","author":{"steamid":"76561198169227525","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":2762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2007,"last_played":1638345441},"language":"english","review":"One of my most favourite part of those legendary series","timestamp_created":1511425704,"timestamp_updated":1511425704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567454218864440918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36880832","author":{"steamid":"76561198253503481","num_games_owned":376,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":38,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1481993975},"language":"english","review":"S Q A U D, Q U I E T D O W N","timestamp_created":1511399154,"timestamp_updated":1511399154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494699656963348389","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36877737","author":{"steamid":"76561198039269193","num_games_owned":1321,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":384,"last_played":1520414459},"language":"spanish","review":"Expansion del año, todos los años","timestamp_created":1511398429,"timestamp_updated":1511398429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36784533","author":{"steamid":"76561198057546969","num_games_owned":288,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":456,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":456,"last_played":1606008674},"language":"polish","review":"Działa","timestamp_created":1511382300,"timestamp_updated":1511382300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506040573120117188","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36730408","author":{"steamid":"76561197980723474","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":394,"last_played":1512849960},"language":"russian","review":"Эх, настальджи =)","timestamp_created":1511376896,"timestamp_updated":1511376896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36638537","author":{"steamid":"76561198062861198","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":442,"last_played":1511141794},"language":"russian","review":"Отличное дополнение для ХЛ1,история рассказана с другой стороны,очень много нового оружия","timestamp_created":1511150440,"timestamp_updated":1511150440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57105720043182373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36629945","author":{"steamid":"76561198159757203","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":340,"last_played":1560196711},"language":"english","review":"To be honest, I quite frankly favor this game more than I do the original Half-Life (But I still hold the original game and entire franchise itself close to my heart despite how late I am getting into the series)\n\nFor starters, I'd say the game was definitely worth my 5 dollars, and it's such a treat to see a gem like this still thrive to this day. \n\nYeah, I died /a lot/ in this game, and that's most likely because I suck at video games in the first place.

J'évalue le jeu tel qu'il était à sa sortie, et je dirais dans le dernier paragraphe ce que j'en pense aujourd'hui, si l'achat vaut encore le coup. A noter que vous pouvez voir les screens que j'ai pris au fur et à mesure de ma progression dans le jeu (75) pour vous faire une idée plus précise, surtout qu'ils sont souvent commentés. Classés/postés dans un ordre chronologique.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Animal_Rights/screenshots/?appid=50&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=grid\n\nGraphismes & effets : 17/20. Identiques en tout point à H-L, ca avait à peine vieilli, mais restait très bien, un soin ayant été apporté aux nouvelles armes et surtout Aliens.\n\nGameplay/IA : 16/20.  Là encore peu de changements, notamment cette fâcheuse tendance qu'a le personnage à faire le pas de trop, provoquant chutes (des échelles en particulier) et imprécisions. De l'interactivité toujours, et un peu de réflexion pour progresser dans l'aventure, mais de l'imprécision également dans le contrôle de vos frères d'armes Marines, qui ont beaucoup de difficulté parfois à vous suivre, dans les dédales de couloirs et de containers en particulier. L'IA donc dans son ensemble n'a visiblement pas progressé, je pense même qu'elle a un peu régressé à en juger par les quelques hara-kiris des Black Ops quand ils essaient de vous lancer une grenade et se gênent mutuellement, même si ca existait aussi dans H-L. Ca reste plutôt bon cependant, ces derniers se mettant à couvert pour recharger par exemple, et faisant beaucoup de \"hit and run\". Les nouvelles armes sont très plaisantes, et fort utiles vu ce à quoi vous allez devoir faire face. Quasi aucun bug à signaler, même à l'époque de mémoire.\n\nDurée de vie: 14/20. A peine plus de 7 heures en difficulté difficile (donc avec des passages à recommencer), c'est peu mais en même temps il s'agit d'un add-on... Je ne sais pas à combien était vendu le jeu à sa sortie, mais à 20-30 euros c'était honnête je dirais, au-dessus beaucoup moins. La difficulté est très bien gérée en hard en tout cas, on manque beaucoup de vie/d'armure et même de munitions, il faut être prudent et utiliser les bonnes armes pour survivre. Un bémol pour le \"boss\" de fin, très décevant.\n\nSon : 17/20. Musiques toujours sans intérêt, mais quelle ambiance ! Les bruitages sont encore au top et ajoutent à ce sentiment d'oppression et de danger durant le jeu.\n\nScénario : 7/20. Bon euh, frayez-vous un chemin dans ce monde hostile en tuant (quasi) tout ce qui bouge, un peu comme H-L certes mais sans la surprise de l'histoire et sans une progression vraiment logique. Quelques clins d'oeil au jeu originel mais c'est tout, même pas de monde Alien...\n\n\nAu final : 16/20. Le jeu reste très bien fait et on lui pardonne ses quelques défauts, vu le fun que l'on a à avancer dans ses niveaux.\n\n\nEt aujourd'hui ? Pareil que pour Half-Life, \"difficile si vous avez moins de 25 ans et êtes habitués aux jeux modernes\" : le jeu à pas mal vieilli techniquement et c'est normal. En prenant en compte sa date de sortie (fin 99) et son prix actuel, il vaudrait peut-être 10/20 maintenant, car on s'y amuse toujours, la difficulté de certains passages y aidant.\nIndispensable pour les nostalgiques qui ont aimé H-L, il est proposé à 5€ sur steam, donc pas beaucoup même si pour un jeu de 18 ans 3€ serait encore mieux ; et le pack HL + ses deux expansions à 8 ou 10 euros hors soldes. Le mieux étant là encore de les attendre et d'acheter le Valve pack en entier à une trentaine d'euros.","timestamp_created":1509488443,"timestamp_updated":1510985834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36124991","author":{"steamid":"76561198399045383","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75,"last_played":1502595034},"language":"english","review":"an awful side story","timestamp_created":1509313782,"timestamp_updated":1509313782,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.400089472532272339","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36108983","author":{"steamid":"76561198196296755","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":395,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":372,"last_played":1479006887},"language":"koreana","review":"렌치로 외계인 머가리 후려칠때의 쾌감ㅗㅜㅑ","timestamp_created":1509278810,"timestamp_updated":1509278810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601492226123809814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36094362","author":{"steamid":"76561198286912881","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":955,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":261,"last_played":1645845794},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情革新（不管半条命的剧情），武器独特（黑科技），官方资料片，给好评","timestamp_created":1509236759,"timestamp_updated":1509236759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36091850","author":{"steamid":"76561198306201572","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":437,"last_played":1540068772},"language":"english","review":"The Paul Blart Mall Cop of Half life","timestamp_created":1509228985,"timestamp_updated":1509228985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36035367","author":{"steamid":"76561198371220160","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":1535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1636213983},"language":"koreana","review":"10/9","timestamp_created":1509089368,"timestamp_updated":1591580981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546239137649536133","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"36010199","author":{"steamid":"76561198027267313","num_games_owned":1809,"num_reviews":4461,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1574872449},"language":"english","review":"Tags: 1PS - First Person Shooter\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Screen is locked into place and cannot be panned.

As expected, things go awry and you are alone facing the good-old aliens.\n\nThis is the best add on to Half-Life in my opinion. There are new weapons and not a single crowbar. You can also create a time paradox. Race X creatures are really good enemies and the gene worm is a lot more threatening than a gargantua and a PCV suit instead of an HEV suit or an armour vest. You get to interact with other soldiers and maybe even create a small group. I really have nothing negative to say about this, everything works well.
