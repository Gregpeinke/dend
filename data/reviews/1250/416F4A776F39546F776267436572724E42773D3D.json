(fun fact: Alien Swarm was also an UT 2004 mod before)\nThe current KF is now a full game released by Tripwire Interactive, and is using the Unreal engine. Even the menu system looks similar to UT 2004's.\n\nThis is a survival FPS game, in which the goal is, to survive all the waves of the attacking specimen. Yeah, I don't want to call them zombies, even if they look like them. They are the leftovers of a failed genetics-experiment, in which they wanted to clone monster soldiers. These leftover specimens are also behave much more different than zombies in other games.\nYou will earn money for killing these specimen (the harder kind will give you more dosh), and will get some extra for surviving the wave. Now, inbetween the waves, you will have to find the Trader (a red indicator will show you the shortest way, just like in UT2004's indicators when playing a team-based gamemode). At the Trader, you can buy weapons, armor, and refill your ammo. In beginner difficulty, you will have 1:30 to complete everything, and getting healed (there are no health pack on the maps, but everyone have got a medical syringe to be able healing themselves or their teammates). In normal and above, you will have only 1 minute. Take out a melee weapon, to run faster (this is a but funny, because wou will even run faster carrying a claymore sword, than a 9mm pistol). In the last wave, you will face the Big One, who you must kill to complete the map.\n\nWhen a player begins a game, they must select a Perk, which will determine their preferred weapons and equipments, as well as giving extra stats for them. The selectable perks:\n\nField Medic: Mainly focused on healing teammates, and keeping them alive. They have increased movement speed, more potent healing, and discounts for medic guns, and kevlar armor. Their grenades are different than other perks': they will cast a smoke that heals the players, and harms enemies inside it. You can level this perk by healing teammates.\n\nSupport Specialist: Mainly focused on using shotguns. Has increased weight, that can carry with. Deals increased damage with shotguns, and can weld doors faster. Can carry more grenades than the majority of the other perks. They get discounts for shotguns. You can level this perk by welding doors and dealing damage with shotguns.\n\nCommando: Mainly focused on using machine guns. Can see enemy health, and Stalkers (will talk about them later on) from more distant. They get discounts for assault rifles. You can level this perk by killing Stalkers with assault rifles, and dealing damage with the same kind of weapons.\n\nSharpshooter: Mainly focused on using sniping weapons. They do more damage with weapons that are designed for headshots. They get discounts for pistols and sniper rifles. You can level this perk by getting headshot-kills against enemies with pistols and/or sniper rifles.\n\nBerzerker: Mainly focused on using melee weapons. They do more damage/attack speed with melee weapons, have increased melee-movement speed, increased resistance against all kinds of damage. They get discounts for melee weapons. They can't be grabbed by Clots (will also talk about them later). You can level this perk by dealing damage with melee weapons.\n\nFirebug: Mainly focused on using flame-based weapons. They do more damage with flame weapons, and has a major increasement of fire damage-resistance (they are totally invulnerable against Husk fireballs at lv 5), can reload the Flamethrower much faster. They have discounts for flame weapons. Their grenades set enemies on fire. You can level this perk by dealing damage with flame weapons.\n\nDemolitions: Mainly focused on using explosives. They do more damage with grenade/rocket launchers as well as grenades. Can carry the most number of grenades. They have increased resistance against explosive-damage. Have discounts for weapons, that can demolish. Even have a separated discount for remote-explosives, and can carry much more of them, than the other perk-users. You can level this perk by dealing damage by demolishing enemies.\n\nNow, that you already know the basics of the playable perks, it's time to get your brief of the enemies you encounter:\n\nClot: The most basic enemy, with slow speed, and weak damage, and low hp. They can still distract you: if you let them too close to yourself, they will grab you, and will not let you getting away (excluding if you are a Berzerker).\n\nGorefast: A single-handed enemy: well, they don't have a left hand, and their right hand turned into a big knife-thingy. They aren't hard to kill, but can run towards you pretty fast.\n\nBloat: A big, fat specimen, who will womit on you a poisonous bile, that will make your vision bad. If you are killing then by headshots, you will be fine. If not, you should take a distance, because on non-headshot death, they will explode in a shower of acidic bile.\n\nCrawler: Well, I just call these things \"spidermen\", because they are an attemt to merge human and arachnid genes. They are short, their base movement is faster, and they are jumping. You will hate them, especially since you will be flooded by them.\n\nStalker: A women, who can cloak herself, making very hard to see her. If they harm you, your vision will be very blurry for a short time. Try to avoid them.\n\nHusk: A specimen, carrying a flameball launcher. They will charge it, and shoot, sometimes harming your enemies too. If you catch fire, don't worry: it'll be over fast, and won't do that much damage. However, try to avoid getting hit directly by that cannon, becuse it will do a lot of damage. If you are close to them, they won't shoot, but instead of it, will hit you with that gun.\n\nSiren: A very ugly women, who will scream very loudly when you are close enough. Beware of her screams: They will ignore the kevlar armor, and will harm directly your HP. Don't use explosive weapons when they are screaming: these screams will also destroy grenades and rockets in mid-air.\n\nScrake: Now, we are beginning the tougher enemies. This one is a chainsaw-carrying enemy, firstly showing up around the beginning of the second half of the waves. They do a lot of damage with their chainsaw, and can also run towards you like the Gorefast. They have increased HP.\n\nFleshpound: This one is a brutal one. They appears only during the last few waves. Their hands are meat-grinders, and can do a huge amount of damage. Harming them will make them mad, and their yellow glowing thingies will turn to red, charging towards a player, destroying any specimen, who will be unfortunate enough, to be between the FP, and the players. Has tons of HP, and is pretty hard to kill.\n\nThe Patriarch: This is the Big One. Basically, he is the boss, who must be killed to complete the maps. He is the most badass \"zombie\" (I still don't like to call them like this) of all time. He is able to do in a few seconds, what the other waves of attacking specimen couldn't do during 10 waves: to wipe the whole squad of the players out.\nHe has the following abilities/equipment: Chain Gun. Rockets. A tentacle thingie in his chest, which will hit you away for several meters. Is able to cloak. Is able to run very-very fast to a safe place, where he can heal himself.\nGuaranteed, if you are the only one left, because he killed all of your teammates, and you manage to kill him on your own, the other players on the server will treat you as a hero.\n(quick note: he can easily be soloed on beginner difficulty, but from normal, and above, he will be an absolute freak)\n\nPros:\n+Satisfying gameplay\n+Awesome soundracks\n+Lot of weapons\n+Lot of maps\n\nCons:\n-Sometimes buggy enemies\n-Way too much DLCs (some are also superfluous, because do you really need a gold reskin for some of your weapons?)\n-Repetative voices (when you kill many stalkers, you will understand what I mean)","timestamp_created":1342295915,"timestamp_updated":1408811436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1341407","author":{"steamid":"76561197991735463","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":4636,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4374,"last_played":1374026003},"language":"english","review":"spray and pray....","timestamp_created":1342295894,"timestamp_updated":1342295894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"94953","author":{"steamid":"76561197961662234","num_games_owned":356,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":31878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28777,"last_played":1653778513},"language":"english","review":"Got Skillz?","timestamp_created":1342295071,"timestamp_updated":1342295071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3322600","author":{"steamid":"76561198020804264","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":5414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4987,"last_played":1425073779},"language":"english","review":"Really \"epic\" game with all the available weapons and upgrades ! never gets boring","timestamp_created":1342294583,"timestamp_updated":1386332709,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"684984","author":{"steamid":"76561197975423892","num_games_owned":3923,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":516,"last_played":1350630000},"language":"english","review":"great game at a great price","timestamp_created":1342293996,"timestamp_updated":1342293996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5180984","author":{"steamid":"76561198046044358","num_games_owned":440,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":3777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1521,"last_played":1428938369},"language":"english","review":"kill things with gore, do you need any other reason???

With multiple classes and weapons each playthrough is a game in itself. Also, the various difficulties give it plenty of replay value. And did I mention you get to kill zombies?\n\n*Edit: 4/2/2016\n\nSo after Purchasing this game in January of 2012. I became addicted to KF.\nPrevious addictions: Wolfenstein Enemy Territory 1,000+ Hours,  Battlefield 2 1,000 + Hours, BFBC2 500+ Hours, and various other FPS and Multiplayer games.\n\nSo what is it that makes KF so good? Simply Put: Easy to learn Difficult to Master.\n\n-Multiple levels of difficulty- Once you think your good crank it up to the next level and find out you are DeadMeat.\n\n-Multiple Perks to Level & Master- Each perk has its own unique personality within a Co-op team. Some perks are Mob control. While other perks specilaize in ranged damage. And some perks focus on heavy DPS. Each perk has its pros and cons with almost no perk being the elite class compared to the others.\n\n-Good Level Progression- Games make people grind a lot. The perk progression in KF is set to where you do level but it doesn't come so easy that you CAP all your perks in a few weeks. Each perk level increase actually affects your strategy in the game.\n\n-Multiple Classes of Enemies & Random Spawns- Just like perks the Zeds have unique types. Each with its own annoying talents. And each requiring you to learn how to defeat them. But then they come at you in groups and never in the exact same amount, order, or location.\n\n Killed by a Siren that came around a corner all of a sudden? You must learn Son....\"Sirens are Everywhere!\"\n\n-Solid weapons and animations- The gun play is tight. Each weapon feels unique. Does damage in its specalized way. And the reloads look good. Hip fire and Iron Sights are here too. Oh and Spray and Pray....probably not on Hell on Earth. Ammo conservation is important along with accuracy. Full Auto may be fun but Headshots work better in Semi-Auto mode.\n\n-Good level design & variety- There's only so many times you can play West London. Lots of Maps and Mod Support for Maps. Oh and maps you hate in the beginning because you get lost and die become your favorite. I'm Talking about you: Bedlam, Hospital of Horrors, and Stronghold---The French Whore of a Map that I love.\n\n-Sound Effects- Veteran Players kill more by sound than what they see. It's not the Force. You just hear the Source. And kill it dead. *stalker death yell*\n\n\n-Overall Gameplay- Multiple variants of gamplay such as Survival and Objective are good. Survival has Short, Medium, and Long games. Long it the Standard to Strive for in completion. 10 waves and a boss.\n\n-Community- Good community with plenty of good folks to play a game with. \n\nDo: Ask Questions when playing on beginner.\nDo: Read the Game Guides.\nDo: Read the KF wiki for gameplay tips.\nDo: Get a mic and learn how to use it.\nDo: Listen to veteran players and Spectate them when you get killed. YOU WILL LEARN A LOT!\nDo: Have patience for those few a-holes that grief new players and don't stop playing because of them.\nDo: Learn from your teammates.\n\nDon't: Jump into a Hell on Earth Server the moment you enter the game.\nDon't: Scream on your mic that the game sucks when you have less than 10 hours playing.\nDon't: Attack and Rage every Fleshpound and Scrake on the map and then complain about the medic not keeping you alive.\nDon't: Buy all the DLC until you've played the base game for a while.\nDon't: Compare this to KF2.\nDon't: Yell at your team because you all died. It's Killing Floor not Living Floor.\n\nFinally: Not all Perk 6 (Gold Icon) Players are of the same Skill level. Some folks grind perks without the teamplay. You can Perk 6 without ever playing on Suicidal or HOE. Suicidal and HOE require greater tactics and practice. HOE is well Hell on Earth...you will die. Occasionally you will live. And some folks let their kid brother play thier account too.\n\nThe Elite Perk 6's are out there. You can tell because they don't die as often. Watch them and learn.
