You get to enjoy a robot getting pecked by a bird (wait, a bird's this far underground?).\n\nHere's a couple of the things I liked the most about it.\n\n[h1]Hillarious.[/h1] Wheatly (one of the main characters, new in Portal 2) is really funny, make sure you stay still long enough to hear his whole dialog. It's totally worth it. So is Glados (sorry, no amazing capitals, I can't remember exactly how the name goes ;) ), another main character whom you'll probably remember from Portal.\n\n[h1]The music is great.[/h1] Alright, for any \"hackers\" / folder readers - there's no .mp3 files, no .wav's, no audio at all in there. [b]The music is hand [i]coded[/i].[/b] The best part is, the music [b]creates itself[/b] as you go - whoops, got hit by that bomb, let's crank the music up to make it more exciting. Oh boy, nearly at the exit, etc, etc, etc. It's awesome.\n\n[h1]The gameplay makes this worth playing over and over.[/h1] This game has so many new features added on to the ability to use portals to get around. Be it lasers, bounce pads, magic speed increasing gels, it's all awesome. [spoiler](Note: a few features from trailers weren't included such as the pipes that suck things up, or purple/white gel. But there's a bunch of other new things you'll love.) [/spoiler]\n\n[h1]The story is amplified a bunch in this sequel.[/h1] Hmm, the first left you confused at the end? Don't worry - this game answers everything. [i]Portal 2[/i] also has a few new characters that, if I talked about here, I'd ruin the story. But they're awesome and the story adds on to how amazing the game is.\n\n[b]Laugh rating:[/b] 10 / 10. This was really funny, and play [i]Portal 2[/i] the second time to find more funny jokes you missed on the first go.\n[b]Music rating:[/b] 10 / 10. Make sure you get the soundtrack (it's free). But you might not recognize the musics in the soundtrack - some are hard to find in the game, and some are in completely different versions (remember, the game makes the music as it goes).\n[b]Gameplay rating:[/b] 9 / 10. Like I said - awesome! [spoiler](That 1/10 is left for the lack of a couple features they didn't put in, but it wasn't there for good reasons so.. :P)[/spoiler]\n[b]Story rating:[/b] 9 / 10. The new characters make this game so worth playing.\n\n[b]Overall rating:[/b] [big]~95%[/big] Get it!

I've heard so much about Portal and Portal 2, and after snagging both in the sale last week I was excited to finally see what all the praise is about.\n\nPortal 2 does an excellent job of continuing and expanding on the revolutionary gameplay of Portal. The traditional portal mechanics find new, innovative applications through the addition of all sorts of new features - lasers, tractor beams, gels, Faith Plates, etc - and the game does a good job of introducing players to these new mechanics while still maintaining a challenging learning curve. After beating the first game in just under three hours, I was very pleased to see that Portal 2 also had much more content in terms of playable levels. It took me about 6 hours to get through the singleplayer story. Coop mode and the Steam Workshop integration will definitely provide hours more of enjoyment.\n\nVisually, this game is stunning. My laptop uses a GeForce GT 750M, and I am able to run Portal 2 very smoothly at near-max settings.\n\nAudially, the music is a welcome addition to the series. The eerie ambience of the first game was a good mood-setter, but I enjoyed the added dynamics that Portal 2 brought with its massive tracklist.\n\nThe story was fantastically written, and the humor in the dialogue made each new level entertaining as I solved puzzles while listening to the ramblings of my robot companions.\n\nOverall, Portal 2 is a fantastic game, and is an essential buy for those who already have Portal. Keep an eye out for sales though - they come around more often than you'd think!","timestamp_created":1423299320,"timestamp_updated":1423299320,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14364557","author":{"steamid":"76561198176735983","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1870,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":385,"last_played":1527064064},"language":"german","review":"Es macht immer wieder Spaß, dieses Spiel zu spielen.

Original intention was to play it with my friend, but after completing a few rooms I began to love this game and went to explore it alone during my free time. \n\nNow, this game has a tag of \"puzzle\" on itself, but it wasn't really hard for me. Actually, almost every challenge is completed under the same pattern or, let us say, a way of thinking. Thus sometimes it can get monotonical. Nevertheless, the puzzles are really original, interesting to play in and sometimes even surprising. The other content is unique, the atmosphere is fascinating, great job with the soundtrack. \n\nBasically, you'll get an approximately 7 hour journey in a huge factory/laboratory that is filled with good/interesting/funny stuff that can be found all around. The only drawback I found was the lack of a choice in this game. For example there could me more ways to complete levels (though I admit that this could make the game even more easy). Or, what would be more interesting, there could a few alternative endings to the game. Or paths leading to the same ending. But this does not make the experience any worse.\n\nVerdict: interesting/unique/intrigueging/easy/a bit too short for it's price tag.\n\nBuy this game of you like linear (but interesting) games with funny/sarcastical plot features.","timestamp_created":1423171225,"timestamp_updated":1423171225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515151500701904297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14343448","author":{"steamid":"76561197986021387","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":7824,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6382,"last_played":1638577523},"language":"english","review":"game can become addicting","timestamp_created":1423170089,"timestamp_updated":1423170089,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14343088","author":{"steamid":"76561198087312427","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":719,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":119,"last_played":1505245915},"language":"czech","review":"To isté ako pri Portal 1.
