Read on Gamespot about some new-fangled \"Steam\" platform for gaming, that houses games from many different developers under one central community. It was coming to Mac as well. As soon as I heard that \"Cake is a Lie: The Game\" was free, I decided to hop on and give it a download. I quickly became obsessed, and showed it to a bunch of friends, who all joined Steam and loved Portal. In February, all 4 of us ordered Portal 2 to finally upgrade our Steam accounts. In short, had it not been for Portal, neither I nor any of my friends would ever have discovered Valve and Steam. If not for TF2 in the summer, we'd never have found the perfect game for simultaneous co-op between all of us to keep us coming back to Valve. And if not for that same summer sale, we'd never have come to know the magic of the ever-compelling Steam sales and given indie gaming a chance.
