Those that are bigger, were the first in line for armament. Nothing like this - just a chainsaw or a blade. To start. They were just beginning to give machine guns and rockets, when the government tried quietly to close its secret program.\n\nBut, as it usually happens, the program did not want to close. Subjects broke free. Scientists could not turn off the cloning unit, and now the victims of the experiment rush outside the laboratory in anger. Well, some are in anger, others are weaving, others are jumping in it.\n\nThe police was sent to the laboratory, but it did not even become a problem for the guinea pigs. The first detachment of the military, who arrived on the spot, did not know what to expect. Shouts of \"his chainsaw!\" On the radio, apparently, damaged the mood, and the whole group was shattered. Well, some ...\nAnd now here you are. And, probably, friends. Several surviving police and military. Of course, you should not tell anyone about this incident, because this would violate the provisions of 1911, 1920 and 1989 from the Secrecy Act, which entail disciplinary liability.

looks ugly and watching anyone play this in spectate mode is pretty boring, that said...being in the drivers seat and having to make on the run desperate decisions is what this game is all about. You'll get clenched buttcheeks at least twice every game and come back for more. The controls are simply amazing as well as the unique feel for weapons(apart from some melee they can be pretty bland...apart from prochete).\n\nThe gore is top notch having brains explode in nice detail with good aiming to the head or the gibplets that go flying when you launch a rocket into a crowd of zombies...can't really ever find that nice fulfillment in any game or none that i have played(i have a lot of games in my steam library but i constantly come back to this one).\n\nUnlocking weapons/skins helps alleviate the monotony that is normal after long periods of play when they come available during timed exclusive events, but the real meat of the game is honing your playstyle and using it in a team environment. Nothing really beats playing as a non zerker soloing out the hardest difficult after five others have fallen and then to finish out the game with a pipe hat...that's just class praise be to allah.\n\n[list]\n[*]I've goomba stomped(timed a jump to land on the patriachs head) with pipe bombs on my head(pipe hat) and chainsaw as beserker\n[*]I've goomba stomped patty with flamethrower as firebug(much more difficult than berserker/chainsaw) and won(they've patched goomba out)\n[*]I've stacked 48-60 pipe bombs on my head successfully in one playthrough and went deaf to the beeping\n[*]I've stacked pipebombs on my head and killed my entire group with one rocket from the patriarch(also patched out will only kill the owner of pipes not team mates)\n[*]I've trolled greenhorns in low difficulty by throwing 1 pound bills(they thought they were 50 pounds each but you can edit the amount in .ini file) out a 3 story window...which the greed got the better of them and they jumped willingly to their deaths\n[*]I've thrown 1 pound bills into a crowd of zombies with the Fleshpound incoming to watch my team mates throw caution to the wind for that sweet sweet dosh\n[*]I've saved countless players lives with the law/AA12 support setup\n[*]I've been banned from a pro server for closing a door in an admins face\n[*]I've cleared over a 1000 zombies in one playthrough quite a few times on Hell On Earth difficulty\n[*]I've unlocked every weapon and character skin that's been connected to any event released\n[*]I've tricked players into thinking it was the patriarch wave with the traders voice, only for them to get smashed in wave 10\n[*]I've finished the hardest maps by going demolition with a law and prochete on full server(like hellride map)\n[*]I've finished the hardest maps by going commando with flare/zed MK II/rising storm tommy gun, and yes i've played as a lvl 6 berserker like everyone who has ever played this game because of the immune to clot grapples/60% damage immunity to everything and significent running speed - but i choose not to play as one because A) they are made for bad players and B) are boring because over powered.\n[/list]\nI have mastered this game by successfully making symbols with my dosh before they disappear like - $ - =) - ^_^ - ----> - :3 and my favourite 8===>(i am known as pablo picashio for this talent), have made fierce rivals, comical friendships, and still have the desire to return for more.
