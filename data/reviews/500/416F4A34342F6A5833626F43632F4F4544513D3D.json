Left 4 Dead - культовый кооперативный Survival Horror, повествующий о судьбе четырёх выживших, спасающихся бегством от невиданной доселе эпидемии, породившая толпы инфицированных зомби.\n\nКогда она вышла в свет, мне попался диск с пиратской версией, и я сумел-таки опробовать эту годноту на своём ржавом тогда ещё корыте 2005-го года. И я был просто в восторге, когда поиграл в эту игру, пусть даже и в синглплеер (немного позже мне удалось юзать и мультиплеер по локалке). С того момента, тематика зомби меня стала притягивать как никогда раньше.\n\nПочему же стоит брать эту игру:\n\n- Отличная интерпретация голливудского блокбастера в стиле фильмов ужасов, с воистину эпичными трейлерами и отличным веянием канонов классики жанра\n- Разнообразные диалоги, которые возникают в самых разнообразных ситуациях\n- Креативные персонажи, каждый имеет свою историю и свои взгляды на происходящее\n- Разнообразные враги\n- Режиссёр AI\n- Атмосфера\n- 6 кампаний, каждый со своим \"постером\"\n- Превосходное звуковое сопровождение, запоминающаяся музыка\n- Годная графа\n- Кооператив \\ режим выживания \\ сражение\n- Рейтинги Steam \\ достижения\n\nСейчас многим подавай мультиплеер, крутой графон, многа пушек и т.д. В Left 4 Dead ключевыми особенностями являются атмосфера и слаженная работа команды. От действий каждого члена команды зависит исход прохождения игры. На низких сложностях это малозаметно. Всё меняется, когда в дело вступает Режиссёр AI уровня \"Эксперт\" и его неожиданное влияние на игровой процесс. Поэтому, вся прелесть игры раскрывается как минимум на сложности \"Мастер\", и именно поэтому, это игра для \"встречи старых друзей\" - коротайте свои часы, проводя время со своими лучшими друзьями-товарищами, сидя за этой годнотой и получая массу тонн удовольствия от игры.\n\nДаже несмотря на выход Left 4 Dead 2 и появившуюся поддержку в ней мастерской Steam, Left 4 Dead останется примером такого направления игростроя. Он, можно сказать, создал новое поколение игр такого жанра, тем самым, установив планку игр жанра Coop Survival Horror, и тому подтверждение - звание GOTY, которое он получил заслуженно.

Left 4 Dead was the flagship of the zombie apocalypse genre. With a fairly interesting story-line, as interesting as it can get when zombies are trying to eat you. The game is split up into episodes, or movies, where the four protagonists make their way through all imaginable zombie infested areas.\n\nI think Left 4 Dead didn't start the zombie culture, as there were books much earlier, but the game obviously did a great part of magnifying the genre, not only for games but for movies and TV-shows as well. The game has a lot of gore and darkness flowing through it, and I remember being terrified in my first play-through of the game. Looking back - this game didn't have a long lifetime, not as it's \"competitor\" Killing Floor, that is still kicking.\n\nValve kind of screwed Left 4 Dead over with Left 4 Dead 2 being released only a year after the original. The sequel wasn't even close to having the same atmosphere as it's predecessor, with all that darkness and grain film filter. Valve later ported over the whole Left 4 Dead into the sequel, which gives no reason to play the first game at all, which is very saddening, indeed.","timestamp_created":1354466512,"timestamp_updated":1385407883,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612386643886566162","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4231037","author":{"steamid":"76561198034237887","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":543,"last_played":1397254036},"language":"spanish","review":"No te aburres si se juega con gente, 100 % recomendado","timestamp_created":1354214475,"timestamp_updated":1354214475,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6212929","author":{"steamid":"76561198061345306","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":559,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":509,"last_played":1520126663},"language":"english","review":"Run for your life....but do not disturb the zombies","timestamp_created":1354067943,"timestamp_updated":1354067943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6424817","author":{"steamid":"76561198066015413","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1096,"last_played":1431700481},"language":"english","review":"Guys and girls its awesome!!","timestamp_created":1354045639,"timestamp_updated":1354045639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5441769","author":{"steamid":"76561198049822671","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1023,"last_played":1557667031},"language":"english","review":"Hedgekopins says: Freaking Awesome \nNorsk:  vis du liker zombie shooter spill er dette noe du må prøve\nEnglish: If you like zombie shooter, this is a must-try\n","timestamp_created":1353920164,"timestamp_updated":1353920164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2626784","author":{"steamid":"76561198010208142","num_games_owned":847,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":864,"last_played":1480744064},"language":"english","review":"The best of first person shooter zombie games.

You play through a series of maps fighting common infected as well as various special infected that provide a greater challenge. As you go through the maps, from saferoom to saferoom you pick up consumable items and get better and better weapons. Although the lower difficulties are so easy a child could complete them the higher ones provide a great level of challenge and are nearly unachievable without a team of good players.\n\nIn the second game mode, versus, you play a four vs. four matchup where teams take turns at playing survivors as well as infected. As the infected team you spawn as one of the various special infected and try to inflict as much damage as possible before the survivors reach the saferoom.\n\nWhile campaign is mostly a smooth play, provided you have friends to play with, versus has a number of problems that make it hard to enjoy in the long one. Chiefly is that the game was never balanced in any meaningful way so the survivors can quite easily complete every map taking a minimum of damage. Without imposing some sort of house rules on what the survivors are allowed to do any organized versus game quickly becomes a rather boring affair.\n\nAnother rather large problem is the number of bugs still in the game, despite Valve doing almost weekly patches for several years the tank, the infected's only real game changer, will still occasionally spawn outside the map and instantly die or spawn on top of a burning barrel which works much the same.\n\nAlthough underneath the horrific balance and game ending bugs is a rather solid game it is also a game that requires organized team play. You can't simply jump on a random server without expecting to get disappointed. I was lucky enough to have a number of great friends to play with yet whenever I booted the game up by myself I always found it to be a frustrating and bland affair trying to get any sense of game going with randoms. It's a game that can only really be enjoyed in gathers.\n\nGraphically the game is quite good despite being on the now aging Source engine. Various poor design decisions mark the experience though, most notably the unusually low skyboxes on certain maps.\n\nThe sound is fairly functional, each breed of infected carrying with it a number of distinct sounds that'll always keep you on your toes.\n\nLeft 4 Dead is a good game but it does have some problems, the most important of which is that it isn't a game you can just buy for yourself, you have to have friends to play with and while I enjoy playing coop with people I know not having to option to occasionally jump on and play a quick session without planning it beforehand really hurts the game in the long run.\n\nAlso, any review of Left 4 Dead would be incomplete without a mention of Left 4 Dead 2 because that's what killed this game. These days you'll only find a few games going at any given time and for a Valve game to have such a short lifespan is just atrocious.","timestamp_created":1353030241,"timestamp_updated":1385410649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575163364410400391","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1700710","author":{"steamid":"76561197996667250","num_games_owned":495,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":1236,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1236,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"dum","timestamp_created":1352985977,"timestamp_updated":1352985977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2928368","author":{"steamid":"76561198014720761","num_games_owned":550,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":424,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":424,"last_played":1351321200},"language":"brazilian","review":"Divertido e viciante!

Always a players core on L4D servers.","timestamp_created":1351964192,"timestamp_updated":1351964192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496758162975311279","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5941488","author":{"steamid":"76561198056127140","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1176,"last_played":1500523370},"language":"english","review":"Очень хороший экшин советую.","timestamp_created":1351866012,"timestamp_updated":1351866012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1999952","author":{"steamid":"76561198000775221","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":42,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":39,"last_played":1375096136},"language":"english","review":"really nice","timestamp_created":1351806369,"timestamp_updated":1351806369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6519735","author":{"steamid":"76561198068028895","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":241,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1363330800},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito Bom Pessoal, jogo de exelentíssima qualidade, para aqueles que odeiam a humanidade como eu e que possuem o desejo de estermina-los, então peguem vossas armas e vamos a caçada !","timestamp_created":1351776489,"timestamp_updated":1351776489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5616376","author":{"steamid":"76561198052944902","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1011,"last_played":1629189556},"language":"english","review":"人很少啊","timestamp_created":1351770857,"timestamp_updated":1351770857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6541144","author":{"steamid":"76561198068566544","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":845,"last_played":1354348800},"language":"german","review":"Für alle zu empfehlen die gerne irgendwas zermetzeln :D","timestamp_created":1351767532,"timestamp_updated":1351767532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3417907","author":{"steamid":"76561198022346060","num_games_owned":842,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":247,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1403962142},"language":"english","review":"Great game, but after playing the sequel first, and being used to sliving a zombie up with melee weapons for 2 years, this was slightly dissappointing, although I new about there being no melee.
