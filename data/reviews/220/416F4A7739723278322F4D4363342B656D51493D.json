Я вырос на этой легендарной серии. Не могу отозваться о первой хл, поскольку в стиме её ещё не запускал, а диск с \"Полураспадом\" от Фаргуса с ним несовместим. Повторюсь, я вырос с этой легендарной серией моей любимой научной фантастики, где сюжет впервые и окончательно постигается по мере прохождения, а не вступительным словом и синематографичными роликами.\nЧто тут еще сказать? Относительно недавно, после прохождения финалки Black Mesa - замечательного ремейка первой Халф-Лайв, разрабатываемого группой энтузиастов со всего света аж с 2005 года и, наконец, окончательно завершенного этой весной (теперь прекрасный путь юного геймера, которого бы отпугнули полигоны Half-Life 1998 года, но который желает познакомиться в сюжетом всей серии от начала и целиком, может начинаться именно с отличного продукта от Crowbar Studios), я решил пройти путь сюжета до победного.. неконца, в который душевная часть моего сознания всё ещё верит впрочем.\nИ поразился, насколько всё это действо 16-ти(а-а-а)летней давности не отстало от нынешних стандартов синглов. Да, бедные текстуры, да, слишком много пустынных мест.. НО увлекательность событий, последовательность геймплея, анимация лиц, ФИЗИКА объектов, которая стала стандартом для качественных игр и ничуть не устарела - валить комбайнов разными способами остается сплошным удовольствием! Больше у меня нет слов, одни приятные эмоции, пойду и дальше заново спасать человечество в Сити-17, а всем остальным несопричастным рекомендую присоединяться к этому благородному делу!

The gameplay is fun with better shooting mechanics and challenging puzzles. The gravity gun is a cool addition to the game and allows for interesting solutions to puzzles and combat. My big complaint is that it doesn't have any kind of objectives screen which left me wondering what to do many times. The storyline overall is confusing because there really isn't much backstory. I thought some questions from the previous game would be answered, but I was left with more questions.","timestamp_created":1596574735,"timestamp_updated":1596574735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73772445","author":{"steamid":"76561199058443382","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":784,"last_played":1594743655},"language":"russian","review":"Сайдётъ","timestamp_created":1596572968,"timestamp_updated":1596572968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73771310","author":{"steamid":"76561198271192298","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":952,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":715,"last_played":1608253630},"language":"english","review":"havent really finished the game yet but its pretty good so far","timestamp_created":1596571752,"timestamp_updated":1596571752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73770561","author":{"steamid":"76561199018045306","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":701,"last_played":1618851110},"language":"russian","review":"12 хедкрабов из 10","timestamp_created":1596570944,"timestamp_updated":1596570944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73766889","author":{"steamid":"76561199041257392","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":618,"last_played":1613647587},"language":"russian","review":"игра хорошая мне 12 ЛЕТ и я  играю в hl2 и в hl1 со мной всё впорядке?","timestamp_created":1596567389,"timestamp_updated":1596567389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73765201","author":{"steamid":"76561198134035909","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1553,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":277,"last_played":1656951258},"language":"hungarian","review":"Nagyon szeretem.","timestamp_created":1596565741,"timestamp_updated":1596565741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73760905","author":{"steamid":"76561198204550653","num_games_owned":584,"num_reviews":91,"playtime_forever":1300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1614520497},"language":"english","review":"I have playing games literally since 2015 .

The Source engine was so realistic that the graphics still look good seventeen years after its premiere, and the facial animation of the characters is still compelling. It's so well done that you can feel what the other characters are feeling at certain moments in the story. It all goes to show how revolutionary Valve was with their games back in the day. And it's actually weird because they manage to make a genre-breaking game almost every time. First Half-Life with its upheaval of the FPS genre and graphics. And the second Half-Life, which did the exact same thing and even more. Half-Life 2 went way beyond what we knew about physics in games. And now, finally, Half-Life has once again changed the course of gaming history with the newly released title Alyx. Half Life Alyx, on the other hand, changed the way we look at vr games, especially in terms of graphics, sound design, and shooting mechanics. At the end of the day, Half Life 2 managed to surpass its predecessor in every aspect but one, replayability. And that's the only thing I have against it, I wish I could play it more than once in a row.","timestamp_created":1596551842,"timestamp_updated":1641913962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73753324","author":{"steamid":"76561198329385881","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1904,"last_played":1596551677},"language":"english","review":"AHHH MY EYES THEY BURN","timestamp_created":1596551715,"timestamp_updated":1596551715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73750316","author":{"steamid":"76561198987506696","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":778,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1605019859},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel ist mega nice, selbst 2020.

Enemy AI is also much more reasonable.  They're not quite the borderline perfect shots they were in the first entry(s), and you can handle getting hit much better as well.\n\nOne of the biggest improvement is the newer physics engine.

Thankfully it can lend to a great many awesome moments.  From using it to hold a cart or filing cabinet in front of you to block sniper fire to using doors and pallets as stepping stones to cross dangerous terrain to using it to fling saw blades and engine blocks at zombies.
