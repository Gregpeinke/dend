I want to see those teammates survive, I feel sadness when they perish and a true sense that my own chance of survival has just been drastically reduced. With that in mind this game can be a tad difficult until you get a few rounds under your belt.

In general, I hate zombie related franchises from films to games to everything in between. Killing Floor changed my opinion on all of that. This game, while simple, doesn't pretend to be something its not. It doesn't juke you with a hinting at a story like Dead Island and it doesn't think that lame archetypes and uninspired level design are the keys to success like Left 4 Dead. It is simple, brutal carnage. Characters rely on one another because of the overwhelming power of the specimens, not on individual limitations. Character classes let you play the way you want, and all classes can be leveled while playing a different class entirely. Levels are hugely varied and require on the spot thinking in most situations. The graphics showcase every gruesome decapitation in detail without slowing down your framerate.

Some background on is that your a british military team sent to destroy this disease. This takes place in Europe around different parts centered around the UK. Some ups and downs of this game is the controls are natural and easy to work with. It is a great game to play with your friends. In the game it makes it easy to find the trader who is selling you weapons to survive. Also there is perks that allow people to do certain things in better ways. Also the survival asspect of it is amazing. You have to make choices to decide the fait of your team like if I weld this door will it save us from getting over run also if you go down a hallway will it trap you are save your team. Some downs of this game is it can get really repetitive at points. Also the price is a little iffey. Also when you die you loose all your weapons except the defaults and dont get as much money in the end of the round but it makes it more challenging this way. Over all Killing floor is a great game but still isnt perfect well if there is ever a steam sale And this is at a low price its worth it welll there you have it.","timestamp_created":1365797651,"timestamp_updated":1385585766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1401728","author":{"steamid":"76561197992789621","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":26393,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23428,"last_played":1507645828},"language":"english","review":"best game eva","timestamp_created":1365786493,"timestamp_updated":1365786493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6510594","author":{"steamid":"76561198067824631","num_games_owned":540,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":15,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15,"last_played":1365836400},"language":"english","review":"Multiplayer fun with lots of weapons","timestamp_created":1365779824,"timestamp_updated":1365779824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3257232","author":{"steamid":"76561198019654978","num_games_owned":169,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":13322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8038,"last_played":1504903849},"language":"english","review":"I want drugs now!!","timestamp_created":1365754651,"timestamp_updated":1365754651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2778258","author":{"steamid":"76561198012484114","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":414,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":289,"last_played":1478133694},"language":"english","review":"Although there are a lot of games that do what Killing Floor does better, this still provides a very solid experience.

I mean, what is there that is better than decapitating zombie-like monsters with a crappy pistol that lasts you all the way until the End-of-Match boss?\n\nNothing. That's what.\n\nThe game is great. With pubs being able to work effectively in a team without even communicating and just sensing when someone is in trouble. I mean, of course you need to give them a hint every now and then, but most of the time it's like Spidey Sense. They just know. And so do you. Like magic...\n\nCombat is fun but can get repetetive after a while and because of that I might recommend some people to take breaks from this game. After all it is just shooting things, blowing things up and slicing things. It can get boring after a little while, but not so boring that it would make you want to get a refund.\n\nThe game runs pretty well on an Nvidia GTX 560ti which is pretty outdated (but heck, I can run The Witcher 3 on high setting with this) but it can run well on max settings due to the game also being outdated.\n\nCommunity is great with a massive variety of custom maps and mods for those maps that offer a large variety of gameplay.

In the beginning, the game makes everything to alienate new players (a.k.a. Fresh Meat), so only the chosen ones stay. But once you fall in love with the game, the bond lasts forever. I'm playing KF1 for 12 years, 4000 gameplay hours, and the game still rocks. During these years, I tried many different coop games or/and zombie shooters, and none of them were as good as this time-proven title, even its sequel.\n\n[h1]Hard to Learn, Easy to Master[/h1]\nNope, you didn't misread, as I didn't mistype. KF1 is an upside-down of common practice. It is super unfriendly to newcomers. I came to KF from Left 4 Dead, having 15 years of experience in FPS gaming. It took me [b]3 attempts[/b] to get familiar and start enjoying the game. I rage-quit for the first two tries, even left a negative review. Don't even try a difficulty harder than Normal until you learn the roots. Even on Normal difficulty, your very first experience will be like this: get trapped by Clots, puked over by a Bloat => gg.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/1250/discussions/0/2592234299538128315/]Reading this guide helps beginners a lot.[/url]\n\nHowever, once you've learned the basics, it is quite easy to become a good player and a valid team member even on the hardest difficulty (Hell on Earth). Most likely, you will be spending hundreds or even thousands of hours simply because you enjoy playing the game rather than mastering superior skills. Because this is a coop game where teamwork plays a major role, and no need for heroes when everybody is doing their job. However, becoming a \"hero\" is also an option if you don't want to rely on your team but solely survive the outbreak of the specimen (a.k.a. zeds or zombies).\n\n[h1]Fantastic Gunplay[/h1]\nWhile it may seem outdated in 2021, gunplay in Killing Floor is still perfect. Gunplay is the reason I kept returning to KF1 after rage-quitting. Popping heads with Handcannon (a.k.a. Desert Eagle) never gets old. Same as unleashing the Boomstick double-shot at the point-blank and seeing zeds tearing apart and flying ten meters away. Pistols, Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, Grenade/Rocket Launchers, Flamethrowers, etc. - KF1 has a wide arsenal to choose from. Most weapons feel solid and quite realistic, especially for an arcade shooter.\nThose who say that Back 4 Blood has decent gunplay have never played Killing Floor. B4B's guns feel like plastic toys in comparison to KF.\n\n[h1]Teamwork: Encouraged but Optional[/h1]\nPlaying as a team where everybody does their job according to the chosen role (perk) is much easier than surviving alone. However, teamwork is not mandatory. There are no arbitrary limitations that force you to play as a team, e.g., getting incapacitated and requiring a teammate's help, where the latter usually is nothing but QTE. There is no such thing in KF. You stick with the team because you [i]want to[/i], not because you [i]have to[/i]. Surviving in society is easier and safer, like in real life. However, you can play \"Rambo\" if you have the skills and \"balls\" to do so. Or if your teammates suck. Or if you are alone.\n\nOptional teamwork has yet another upside - no need to fill the team with bots or randoms. You can play solo or play with a friend - just two of you. Unlike L4D and its clones, KF scales perfectly for a different number of players. Moreover, a different player count may offer various play styles. Playing solo is not the same as playing with a friend, which, in turn, is different from playing in a 6-player team.\n\n[h1]Extreme Replayability[/h1]\nWhile Back 4 Blood uses this term for marketing purposes to cover the lack of content in such an overpriced game, Killing Floor truly offers extreme replayability.\n[list]\n[*] 36 official maps + Workshop support, where you can find at least a few dozens of good-quality community-made maps.\n[*] Seven official perks with more than fifty weapons. Each perk and weapon loadout offers a different, unique playstyle.\n[*] Full modding support offers custom perks, weapons, enemies, etc. There are mods and modded servers with more than ten perks and hundreds of weapons.\n[*] At the moment of writing, I have 4000 gameplay hours in KF1 and still didn't get bored. And I'm not the only one - there are thousands of KF players having thousands of gameplay hours each.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Getting Started[/h1]\nIf you are still reading this text, it means that you've passed the general requirement to start playing KF - the ability to read and process information longer than a tweet. Let's get started then.\n[list]\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/1250/discussions/0/2592234299538128315/]Read this guide[/url] first. It explains weird KF mechanics and design choices that might frustrate new players in the beginning. I wish I had that guide back when I started playing...\n[*] In the beginning, I encourage you to skip the vanilla game and jump straight to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ScrNBalance/discussions/2/483368526570475472/]ScrN Brutal KF Bundle[/url] mod. The mod offers tons of bug fixes, balance adjustments, QoL improvements and modernizes the game to fit more in 2021. The most important - it keeps [i]the core gameplay close to vanilla[/i]. The experience (skills) you get while playing the mod is also valid for the vanilla game - if you decide to earn Steam achievements, for example.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Solid Community; Time-Proven Game[/h1]\nKF1 has a small but solid and consistent community. There are 300-500 concurrent KF1 players every day on Steam. There is no problem finding a server to play on, especially in Europe or North America. Moreover, teammates are not a must-have since the game can be played solo too. If you have a friend to play with, it is enough to enjoy the beauty of KF teamwork.\nIf you enjoy playing on crowded servers, I suggest joining some KF communities to organize/schedule games.
