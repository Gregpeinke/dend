After I don't know how many hours and minutes of going through a gloomy looking swamp-like canal on a hovercraft thing I began to suspect the game wasn't going to live up to it's hype, so I decided to return it. Alas Steam said I'd played it for five hours and was not thus entitled to a refund. I had thought that one was entitled to a refund on anything one purchased online within a certain time period, this however is not the case with Steam, since I have found multiple reviewers complaining that Steam wouldn't refund them - even in cases where people couldn't even get the game to run. This experience has given me a sharp reminder of the pre-internet days when the customer was always wrong and hadn't a hope of getting refunded on any kind of purchase.
