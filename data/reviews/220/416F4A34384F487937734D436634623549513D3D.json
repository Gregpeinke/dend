There's a reason VALVe is known for this game.  It is truly amazing!  Many features of the Portal series, including sounds and objects, got their start here and helped define Portal.  The graphics are amazing for 2004, and nowadays will look sweet without melting your computer.  As for the story, it blew me away.  It starts some time after Half-Life, and uses the same style of storytelling they invented there and utilized through the rest of the Half-Life series and in both Portal games.  It is immersive, has lots of action in all the right places, includes puzzles made from the environment that really make you think creatively, and doesn't use cutscenes, but keeps you in the game at all times.  After playing Half-Life, I wanted Half-Life 2 right then!  The same goes for when I beat HL2, my first thought was: \"When I can I get the next game!?\"  The story is that good.  On top of all that, Half-Life 2 features some great instrumental music, which was designed like a movie score: The music starts where the action does and fits the mood perfectly.  I would say the music got me more excited and \"in the zone\" than seeing the hordes of CPs, Walkers, or even Headcrab Zombies.  That said, there is some blood, more gore than I expected (you can kill zombies by decapitation and slicing in half using saw blades and the gravity gun, and you discover burned and/or mutilated bodies from past battles and alien attacks) and some strong language.  Overall, a great game for a great price.","timestamp_created":1391218650,"timestamp_updated":1391218650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8927583","author":{"steamid":"76561198098404164","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":4178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1607,"last_played":1569176349},"language":"english","review":"good action game but weres 3","timestamp_created":1391215343,"timestamp_updated":1391215343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8926567","author":{"steamid":"76561198087686493","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":600,"last_played":1582149226},"language":"english","review":"Totaly amazing story line.","timestamp_created":1391209168,"timestamp_updated":1391209168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8926495","author":{"steamid":"76561198085530453","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2092,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1776,"last_played":1548441720},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegaso\n","timestamp_created":1391208825,"timestamp_updated":1391208825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8926310","author":{"steamid":"76561198110947827","num_games_owned":705,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1567,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":629,"last_played":1659344710},"language":"english","review":"Beautiful and seamless storyline, Valve is a god among videogame companies.","timestamp_created":1391207756,"timestamp_updated":1391207756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8926214","author":{"steamid":"76561198058902962","num_games_owned":576,"num_reviews":124,"playtime_forever":2602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1246,"last_played":1629377788},"language":"english","review":"The fact that this game was released in 2004 boggles my mind.

Love. This. Game. It is a really good game and have an immersive Story that you can understand. However, the game does kind of feel like it is guiding you away from the objective with its most Combat Storyline, and with puzzles. The feature of having no Quest Marker gives the game its own unique feeling, where you have to use your brain to its full capacity to get to the end of the game. It's not just an action game, its about the desperate struggle of the Human Race. The only downside to Half Life games is that your almost alone all throughout the game, but there are parts where you venture with allies like Rebels, Aliens, and even a Priest. BUt the times where you do get to Allied places, you spend about a minute or two there before your stuck to find a way out. Personally, I found that Half Life 2 was a lot less fun than Half Life 2 Episodes 1 & 2. If you want to buy the game for the storyline, I suggest buying the Half Life pack. It has all the Half Lifes to date ( Apart from Steam Greenlight ones ) including mini games like Team Fortress Classic ( Which I will never play ) and Half Life 2 ( Which is boring! ) If you dont want to play the game for the action, I suggest just buying the Orange Box, but I highly recommend watching some timeline videos or go onto the internet and research about the Half Life Storyline, so you can get your head around what is happening half of the time ( See what I did there? ;) )\n\nAll in all, I think this game deserved every Award it recieved. It's too bad GabeN can't count to 3.\n\n1000000/10","timestamp_created":1391031642,"timestamp_updated":1391031642,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8903960","author":{"steamid":"76561197973223005","num_games_owned":733,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":508,"last_played":86400},"language":"finnish","review":"Who doesn't like the good old HL2?","timestamp_created":1391029779,"timestamp_updated":1391029779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8902213","author":{"steamid":"76561198092295520","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":867,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":781,"last_played":1410637866},"language":"english","review":"Amazing, Can't Wait for the Half-Life 3!","timestamp_created":1391019352,"timestamp_updated":1391019352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8900319","author":{"steamid":"76561198043264130","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1966,"last_played":1514149049},"language":"english","review":"Well...
