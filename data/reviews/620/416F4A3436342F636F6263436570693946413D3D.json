It is amazing how they made it so perfect, that I'm still scratching my head about what kind of a magic spell they used. If the portal mechanic wasn't flawless, the world would not have been as emersive as it is, and I feel sadness for even thinking of a reality where the young me was playing Portal 2 for the first time, trying to figure out how the portals worked, and even sort of understand how they were made, just by looking at them.\n\nIt is the most immersive level-based game of all time, and I am truly happy to have this game as a reference for when designing my own games.\n\nPS: This review was published in 2012, but the review was re-written on 2017-12-22.
