The dialogue, the tone, the subject matter. You can't help but wonder and even see, how much truth is actually depicted here. The veiled disdain for the life of the common person; the masked mockery. Testing people as if they are no different than animals.\n\nThe game is fun, but very short. I beat it in 3.4 hours, and I'm not someone who rushes through games whatsoever.\nI see there is more replayability through special challenge maps, and there's still achievements to unlock, if one desires.\n\nTo me this game it what it presents itself to be. A study of people whom the occult have no cares for, and the presentation of programming via display of technologies and realities they are working to manifest.\n\nNot sure if I'll pickup Portal 2. I'm interested to see what the program is in it, and if there's new revelation of their inner workings. Of course more, and enhanced gameplay will be fun too.\n\nI certainly am glad I got this game for such a cheap price.","timestamp_created":1467212284,"timestamp_updated":1467212284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23924514","author":{"steamid":"76561198040792210","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":317,"last_played":1582466023},"language":"french","review":"Meilleur jeu de Puzzle-Platforme de tous les temps","timestamp_created":1467206714,"timestamp_updated":1467206714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23922010","author":{"steamid":"76561198115779812","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":975,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":156,"last_played":1657396233},"language":"french","review":"Ce jeu est génial, mais vraiment court.","timestamp_created":1467199950,"timestamp_updated":1467199950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23920081","author":{"steamid":"76561198148775821","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":144,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":144,"last_played":1467194137},"language":"tchinese","review":"Creative game","timestamp_created":1467194205,"timestamp_updated":1467194205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23919862","author":{"steamid":"76561198291280131","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":396,"last_played":1534600161},"language":"schinese","review":"帮朋友买完礼物后，还剩下7块多，于是选了半条命2。\n[h1] 这个游戏真的赞[/h1]\n我玩的时候是断断续续的玩的，遇到不会的就退完其他游戏，过一会再打开耍一耍。游戏难度不高，稍稍一想就能解决麻烦。关卡的设定也十分优秀，后面的关卡有点细思恐极。\n虽然关卡很快就玩完了，没有什么重玩的价值，但我觉得这款游戏就对要入！！！！！\n[spoiler] 家里电脑差，玩游戏的话40帧就觉得流畅。可这个游戏我玩竟然是100多帧。玩过之后玩其他游戏觉得没有个60帧都卡的要死。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1467193481,"timestamp_updated":1467193481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543859660625457764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23918457","author":{"steamid":"76561198265254708","num_games_owned":321,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":314,"last_played":1467389412},"language":"english","review":"I have a notoriously low tolerance for 3D motion games.\nFFX-2 gave me migraine and nausea.\n\nI don't know whether Portal isn't as bad with the 3D motion, or it was enjoyable enough for me to not notice, but I managed to finish it despite my disadvantage (and I think that's saying a lot considering how disorienting Portal can be).

Je tiens à préciser que je n'ai joué que le mode histoire.\n\n[u] Mon ressenti [/u]\n\nLe jeu vidéo est un art, et Portal en est un parfait exemple.\nEn effet, ce jeu reprenant le moteur Source de Half Life (comme quoi, ce moteur fait vraiment tout et n'importe quoi) est plus une oeuvre d'art qu'un jeu \"passe temps\" comme son titre le sous-entend. Il ne s'agit pas que de mini-jeux s'enchaînant mathématiquement et sans aucune âme.\n\nLe jeu m'a surpris par son scénario (dont je vais dire quelques mots plus bas), simple mais captivant (et surtout riche en suspens).\nEnsuite, le gameplay basique mais innovant du jeu donne réellement un sentiment de fraicheur.\n\nMais trève de fioritures, passons au vif du sujet.\n\n[u] Le gameplay [/u]\n\nComme son nom l'indique, le jeu consiste à traverser des portails inter-dimensionnels (ça a l'air chaud dit comme ça, mais en fait c'est étonnament simple).\nTrès vite dans le jeu, on récupère un générateur de portails qui permet de tirer ... des portails.\nTraverser un portail nous fait atterir dans un autre portail et il faut jouer sur l'inertie et la gravité afin de résoudre des puzzles et parcours (parfois très ardus, le jeu est assez difficile et une soluce peut-être le bienvenue sur certains passages).\n\nLe jeu est plutôt évolutif sur la gestion de ce gameplay hors du commun, ce qui permet au joueur de ne pas trop se perdre. Au début le jeu nous laisse se familiariser avec les portails ; puis il nous permet de tirer un portail avant de nous donner le générateur double portail.\n\nMais le meilleur moyen de comprendre ce gameplay, c'est de l'expérimenter.\n\n[u] Le scénario [/u]\n\nComme je l'ai dit plus haut, le jeu m'a surpris par son scénario.\nEn effet, ce scénario est l'exemple parfait de ce que j'appelerais le scénario \"iceberg\".\n\nLe plus simple pour vous de comprendre et d'apprécier ce scénario reste de jouer au jeu. Mais si vous n'avez pas l'intention d'y jouer (ou que vous n'avez pas peur de tout vous faire spoiler), je vous ai préparé un résumé argumenté de ce scénario magnifique.\n\n[spoiler]\nAu début, le jeu nous lache sans explication dans un environnement futuriste tout blanc et propre avec une voix off très serviable qui nous explique ce qu'il faut faire.\nAu comprends vaguement que nous sommes dans un laboratoire et que nous sommes le sujet d'une expérience qui consiste à nous faire passer des tests.\n\nAu fur et à mesure, les salles s'enchaînent avec toujours la même ambiance sérieuse, mais on sent que quelque chose cloche quand la voix off (que l'on devine être une intelligence artificielle) nous impose des conditions assez ... spéciales.\n\nVers le quart du jeu, on remarque des failles dans les murs, qui cachent les débris de locaux rouillés, presque en ruines mais le matériel Aperture Science (le laboratoire où vous êtes testé) est intact.\nOn suspecte alors que quelque chose ne va pas, que notre présence ici a quelque chose d'anormal.\nDe plus, les locaux sont vides, il n'y a aucun scientifique, ni même de cadavre ; c'est comme si le lieu avait été déserté (ou bien \"vidé\").\n\nFinalement, la fin du test dévoile le pot au roses : la voix de l'on entend depuis le début a pour intention de nous tuer (ou plutôt d'organiser une grande fête où il y aura du gâteau #TheCakeIsALie).\nHeureusement que nous parvenons à nous échaper pour finalement affronter GlaDos (c'est le nom de cette intelligence artificielle) en lui supprimant peu à peu sa personalité.\n\nMais le jeu se termine sur une petite chanson de GlaDos, qui est fière de nous car nous l'avons battue (on peut supposer que sa vie artificielle n'avait plus de sens, d'où son obsession pour le test). Mais elle précise qu'il y en aura d'autres, et qu'elle sera toujours là, toujours vivante (cette chanson s'apelle d'ailleurs \"Still Alive\").\n\n[/spoiler]\n\nJe vais maintenant essayer de délibérer pour tenter de noter ce jeu. Je sais que donner une note n'est pas le meilleur moyen d'évaluer un jeu mais c'est la meilleure façon d'avoir un aperçu fidèle de la \"valeur\" du jeu.\n\n[u] Points positifs [/u]\n\n-Le gameplay est très innovant pour l'époque (2007, il ne faut pas l'oublier).\n-Les graphismes simples et \"artificiels\" représentent bien l'ambiance globale.\n-Ces mêmes graphiques et les choix artistiques font bien ressortir le contraste entre les salles de test et les ruines du laboratoire, ce qui contribue fortement à l'immersion dans l'histoire.\n-Le scénario de ce jeu relève du génie\n-La bande originale et les bruitages choisis collent très bien à l'ambiance du jeu.\n-Cette chanson de fin est magique.\n\n[u] Points négatifs [/u]\n\n-Une durée de vie très faible fait que l'on reste un peu sur sa fin (j'ai finit le jeu en une après-midi, un peu décevant surtout au vu de la richesse du scénario).\n-Les bruitages sont parfois un peu lourds (le cube qui se cogne partout sans aucun sens nuit beaucoup à l'expérience de jeu)\n-Le manque d'indications dans certaines salles rend le jeu ridiculement dur (un véritable bonheur de rester coincé au même endroit pendant 10min parce qu'on avait pas vu le petit mur blanc de 5 pixels de largeur au bout de la salle)\n\n[b] [u] La note [/u] [/b]\n\n[b] Gameplay : 14/20 [/b]\nLe gameplay a beau être très innovant, certaines mécaniques restent répétitives et auraient pu être un peu plus creusées (certains passages vous obligent à exploiter des mécaniques plus proches du bug qu'autre chose).\n\n[b] Graphismes : 16/20 [/b]\nPas grand chose à dire, Valve nous recycle son moteur Source qui donne vite une impression de vide. Pour une fois, cette impression a servi l'ambiance du jeu (quoi de mieux pour un laboratoire) mais il y avait moyen de faire mieux sur d'autres moteurs de l'époque.\n\n[b] Scénario : 18/20  [/b]\nBien que le scénario de Portal soit un chef d'oeuvre, la durée de vie du mode histoire est plutôt décevante (entre 3h et 5h, alors que le scénario aurait pu être développé sur 12h vu son potentiel).\nL'avantage de cette durée de vie est la possibilité de speed run le jeu, ou bien de se refaire l'histoire si on s'ennuit une après-midi.\n\n[b] Note globale : 16/20 [/b]\n\nCe jeu est un incontournable, il est devenu un classique du jeu vidéo et des références à Portal se retrouvent un peu partout aujourd'hui. Mais beaucoup utilisent ces références sans connaître le matériau de base. C'est pour cela que je vous conseille de jouer à Portal ; qui est vraiment une expérience incontournable pour quelques euros qu'il vaut largement.","timestamp_created":1467109967,"timestamp_updated":1589300472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23888194","author":{"steamid":"76561198138334558","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":306,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1467098526},"language":"schinese","review":"很不错的游戏，简直是思维的火花~哈哈~","timestamp_created":1467106998,"timestamp_updated":1467106998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23886794","author":{"steamid":"76561198006559466","num_games_owned":527,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":13,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":13,"last_played":1422608546},"language":"english","review":"great game!","timestamp_created":1467102711,"timestamp_updated":1467102711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23885761","author":{"steamid":"76561198065228154","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1432083690},"language":"english","review":"everythin is dead","timestamp_created":1467099265,"timestamp_updated":1467099265,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.31027597188949585","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23885759","author":{"steamid":"76561198123929707","num_games_owned":514,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1515754578},"language":"english","review":"Fairly short but exactly as long as it needs to be for what it is.

The Dev's commentary is worth a look as well. I do reccomend that, if playing with a gamepad, looking into the settings and tweaking it.

Jedoch lohnt es sich allein für den Soundtrack und besonders für \"Still Allive\" das Spiel zu kaufen. \nDaher erhält dieses Spiel eine wertung von 9,5/10.","timestamp_created":1467057692,"timestamp_updated":1467057692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23871719","author":{"steamid":"76561198110143895","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1434437501},"language":"english","review":"Nice!","timestamp_created":1467056779,"timestamp_updated":1467056779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23871349","author":{"steamid":"76561198260938644","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":96,"playtime_forever":444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":444,"last_played":1467040654},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1467055985,"timestamp_updated":1467055985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23871314","author":{"steamid":"76561198086613528","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1351,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1608951610},"language":"english","review":"Soon you'll be thinking with Portals, too.","timestamp_created":1467055895,"timestamp_updated":1467055895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469443857669830322","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23870206","author":{"steamid":"76561198131185259","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":222,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":55,"last_played":1498667199},"language":"french","review":"★ Note : 11/20 (*)\n\n❤ Public conseillé : (**)\n\n☐ Je ne conseillerai pas ce jeu même à mon pire ennemi\n☐ Les enfants\n☑ Les fans du genre \n☐ Les casual gamers\n☐ Tout public \n☐ Les hardcore gamers \n☐ Les PGM sud-coréens \n\n☼ Graphismes :\n\n☐ À vomir par terre\n☐ Très mauvais\n☐ Mauvais\n☑ Corrects \n☐ Bons \n☐ Très bons \n☐ Beaux à en chialer\n\n€ Qualité/prix : (***) \n\n☐ Il faudrait me payer pour y jouer\n☑ Attendez une promo \n☐ Abordable\n☐ Pas cher \n☐ À ce prix là c'est cadeau \n\n€ Configuration PC recommandée :\n\n☑ L'ordi à ma grand mère\n☐ Entrée de gamme \n☐ Milieu de gamme \n☐ Haut de gamme\n☐ Un PC de la NASA\n\nBon jeu !","timestamp_created":1467053536,"timestamp_updated":1467053536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476377934217453003","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23869340","author":{"steamid":"76561197998084594","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":132,"last_played":1467051539},"language":"english","review":"Puzzles are too easy and could be solved by a toddler.
