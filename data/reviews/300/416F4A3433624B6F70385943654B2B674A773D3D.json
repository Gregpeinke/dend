I really like how the guns play in the game, they are very balanced between the teams. The maps are also very well made and it really feels  like your in the midst of a Nazi/Yanks confrontation. \n     There are plenty of classes to choose from depending on your play style. Do you like rushing enemy positions gunning them down? Use the assault class. Do you like covering, supporting and precision shooting? Use the support class or the rifle class.\nAdditionally there's the machine gunner, sniper and rocketeer. All the classes also wield different guns and secondaries. \n     Smooth controls and they're easily changed for the player's preference. The graphics aren't that good, but they'll do and it isn't something you'll notice during gameplay. \n     Using tactics, different firing techniques and grenades are necessary to win matches.\n\nI recommend this game to hardcore FPS players who likes a WW2 challenge.","timestamp_created":1403704012,"timestamp_updated":1403704012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10788818","author":{"steamid":"76561197982844154","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":15066,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10786,"last_played":1628879311},"language":"spanish","review":"Por mucho tiempo que pase sigo jugando y me lo sigo pasando igual de bien como el primer día y continuará siendo así, no requiere de mucha potencia del ordenador y a cambio da horas y horas de diversión.
