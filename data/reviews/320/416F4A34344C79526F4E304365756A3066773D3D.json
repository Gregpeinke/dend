Its striking chequered floors, incongruous Escher-like architecture, and concrete walls adorned with chipped paintwork and bullet holes lend the space an unlikely degree of charm. Besides the light echo of peripheral footfall and HEV suit-charging it's eerily quiet. That is, until the Rebels step out against the Combine: barrel-chested, leather-skinned and bloodthirsty—an inevitable eruption of gunfire, pulse orbs and exploding frag grenades follows.  \n\nSince its arrival two weeks after Half-Life 2's mid-November 2004 launch, Lockdown has been one of Half-Life 2: Deathmatch's most popular 2v2 maps. Top players have came and went since, however TheRealQuAz and Maxtasy are long-serving veterans who've occupied its online multiplayer wargrounds since 2008. \n\nObserving in god-like spectator mode, I look on in awe as these experts exchange blows with two lesser players; dancing around the map and executing fatal maneuvers with a level of precision that's owed to years of experience. Each dash, bunnyhop and meticulously-placed gravity gun-fired grenade is measured and is the result of refined strategy—it seems fitting the monochrome floor mirrors that of a chess board. Within mere minutes the commanding duo is fifteen points to the good.\n\nNowadays, casual matches are as good as it gets for HL2DM's most serious devotees. Of the 300 or so active daily players, around half are preoccupied with the game's Roleplay mode—a temperamental server which while hosting a huge map that lets players work, rent houses, commit crimes, and go to prison, isn't nearly as sophisticated—nor as fun—as it may sound. \n\n\"You have a bank account and earn money just for being on the server, and you can buy items with that money,\" explains Maxtasy. \"A lot of people just stay idle on the server to farm cash. That's why these servers are usually at the top of the server browser and new players to the game usually join the most populated servers and get a weird first impression of the game, sadly.\"\n\nOf the remaining 150 or so folk who tend towards the game's default modes, the chances of finding players fit to challenge the likes of Maxtasy and TheRealQuaz are few and far between. Of course this wasn't always the case. \n\nIn 2006, two years after the multiplayer's inception, HL2DM was a regular in Steam's top ten most played games, pulling in upwards of 20,000 players per day. For competitive players, Clans United was established as the game's central European community website and over a six year period hosted 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 leagues which, at its peak, spanned five divisions with eight teams in each field. A hefty waiting list was perpetually on standby, whereby new teams would only replace outfits relegated from the lowest leagues. \n\nAt the same time, less significant forums such as HL2DM University were chartered, and a US ESL community ran a semi-successful 1v1 ladder. After players failed to shift Serino—no longer active but widely considered one of the best HL2DM players of all time—from the top spot after several months, though, the latter was eventually dissolved and absorbed by Clans United.         \n\n\"Division one had some of the most skilled teams and players ever seen in the game,\" says Quaz. \"It's strange to me that HL2DM was overlooked by the wider community considering the elite level of the top pros is so impressive to watch. But although host to some of the greatest matches ever played, the league and community always had some drama or scandal going on, whether it be cheating accusations, admin abuse or mismanagement.\" \n\nIn September 2010 Valve upgraded HL2DM to utilise the Orange Box version of the Source Engine—a move which disabled a well-used crouch bug that in turn vastly altered the game's bunny hop mechanic. For many players this meant relearning the game from scratch and compromised six years-worth of practice. As such, a number of teams withdrew from competitive play and by 2012 just two divisions remained. \n\nIt was then Quaz formed his first clan with two similarly prolific players of the time, Lancelot and Bangelo, who went on to win their debut season outright without dropping a single map. Normal procedure dictated that the top team would thereafter progress to the next league—in this case from division four into division three—however a coinciding league restructure levied by the game's admins saw the introduction of a new lower division, and thus saw Quaz and his team were forced to stay put. This didn't sit well with Bangelo and after several formal protests fell on deaf ears he quit the competitive scene entirely, causing Quaz and Lancelot to carry on in a separate 2v2 league. \n\nIn late 2012, Quaz gained admin rights to one of the remaining divisions, yet he himself was becoming increasingly disillusioned with the community due to several ongoing spats regarding team allegiance and admin disputes. Quaz describes the HL2DM scene as \"stagnant\" around this time and, having shared the gossip with Bangelo, passed over his admin details to allow his ex-teammate to browse the acrimony for himself. \n\n\"I gave the admin forum password to my teammate Bangelo with no malicious intent, just so he could have a chance to troll around on the private admin forums,\" Quaz explains. \"Somehow he managed to delete the entire database of the site, much of which had not been backed up. Only an incomplete series of hall of fame pictures survived. This is pretty much how Clans United went down. I guess I owe it to the community to tell the whole story as they deserve to know and might not already.\"\n\nFrom the outside looking in, it's difficult to view Bangelo's actions as anything but intentional. \"To be honest, I don't remember all the details,\" Quaz adds. \"I'm not sure exactly what happened internally but it had mixed reactions from the community—some people were obviously annoyed, including me, that much of the history of the game was lost. Others praised Bangelo for deleting Clans United as many players resented the management and felt its time had finally come. People just didn't care as much, despite Clans United being a cornerstone of Half-Life 2: Deathmatch for many great years, which is how it should be remembered.\" \n\nIn the wake of Clans United, the Old School Community was formed in 2013 which aimed to replicate and replace its predecessor. It's still live today however the same level of interest has never been achieved, and the OSC in its most modern guise instead caters for whichever 'top' players can be bothered stopping by. With other Valve franchises still hugely popular—not least Counter-Strike and Team Fortress 2—one might wonder why HL2DM has failed to garner the same long-term support. \n\nMaxtasy describes his multiplayer of choice as \"Valve's forgotten child\", while Quaz points to the perceived steep learning curve of hitting top rank in HL2DM coupled with the advent of esports as possible reasons it got left behind—this and the fact Valve makes a killing from CS:GO's skin economy.\n \n=VERDICT=\nLike the demise of any community, it's sad to see something once so active fade. But with Half-Life 2: Deathmatch it seems so many variables have worked against it for some time. It's trapped by the advent and ever-growing popularity of esports, and trapped by the Half-Life brand itself and the fact Half-Life 3 might never happen. It's almost ironic that HL2DM's most iconic map is set in a prison.

Тогда гравипушка, альтернативная атака импульсной винтовки и медленный баллистический арбалет были новшеством. Это было необычно, красиво, увлекательно. А потом я пару лет играл в первый hldm. И вот сейчас, мне довелось взять игру в Стиме... \n\nБоже, как у меня горит с гравипушек... Как полыхает с крошечных боекомплектов... Как приходится напрягаться чтобы считать траекторию и упреждение для арбалета... А как мало оружия на картах... А какие убогие и несбалансированные карты сделанные игроками... Я уже молчу про спринт. Раньше был только один способ эффективного передвижения -- распрыжка! А теперь любой нуб носится как сайгак, правда с распрыжкой спринт превращается в аналог термоса, но... Он же ж не бесконечный! \n\nОтдельно надо сказать про движок, который малость сопротивляется активному движению, особенно КУЧЕЙ МУСОРА, КОТОРЫМ ТЕБЯ ЗАКИДЫВАЮТ ПО КД! КАК ПРЕКРАСНО СДОХНУТЬ НА ЛЕСТНИЦЕ ОТ СВАЛИВШЕГОСЯ НА ТЕБЯ АВТОМОБИЛЯ, КОТОРЫЙ КАКИЕ-ТО ОБОРВАНЦЫ ЗАТОЛКАЛИ В ПРОХОД. КАК ПРЕКРАСНО ВЛЕТАТЬ В МИННОЕ ПОЛЕ ИЗ ВИСЯЩИХ В ВОЗДУХЕ SLAM. И отдельно надо выделить застревания в объектах. ПОТОМУ ЧТО ПЕРЕВЁРНУТЫЙ СТОЛ ЗАЧАСТУЮ МОЖНО ТОЛЬКО ПЕРЕПРЫГНУТЬ, А В ПЫЛУ БОЯ ЛЮБАЯ ГОВЁШКА ПОД НОГАМИ ОСТАНОВИТ ТЕБЯ ПРОСТО ПОТОМУ ЧТО МОЖЕТ! А УЧИТЫВАЯ ЗАСИЛЬЕ ГРАВИПУШЕК, ТЕБЯ ЕЩЁ И УБЬЮТ ЭТИМ ХЛАМОМ, КОТОРЫЙ МЕШАЕТСЯ ПОД НОГАМИ. \n\nС револьвера стрелять прикольно, дамаг какой никакой есть. А ВСЁ ОСТАЛЬНОЕ ЗАЧАСТУЮ НЕИГРАБЕЛЬНО. Разве что импульсная винтовка ДО ТОГО МОМЕНТА, ПОКА КАКОЙ-НИБУДЬ ЧУДАК НА БУКВУ М НЕ ВСПОМНИТ, ЧТО У НЕГО 3 ЯДРА ЛЕЖАТ БЕЗ ДЕЛА. Вы когда-нибудь дважды умирали от одной и той же атаки одного игрока? А Я ПАРУ РАЗ ЗА 2 ЧАСА, КАК МАРИНОВАННАЯ КУРОЧКА, ДВАЖДЫ НА ОДИН ШАМПУР. И всё бы хорошо, но МОЖНО ТАСКАТЬ С СОБОЙ 3 ЭТИХ ШАРА. Боже, что происходит, когда это залетает в толпу... \n\nОтдельного внимания заслуживает невыключаемый лазер у пусковой установки. Но учитывая малое количество оружия на картах -- горит от него меньше всего.\n\nНу и видимо за кириллический никнейм в Стиме, тебя всячески насилуют админы иностранных (неинтернациональных) серверов. Хотя в правилах сервера у них нет пунктов, запрещающих какие-либо никнеймы. Мелочь, которую наверняка можно исправить, но всё равно неприятно.
