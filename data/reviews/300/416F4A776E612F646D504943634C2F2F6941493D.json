The game perfectly captures WW2 fighting but with a more fast paced arena feel. If you enjoy WW2 shooters but wish they were more simple this game is certainly for you, I myself prefer it over original DoD. The game does have some issues though.. This game never got much attention even after its release, it still has some bugs in it but they aren't major, it also isn't too popular either, it only has about 370 active servers and about 70 are private ones, this game is old and is played by middle aged men who have been playing since 2005 or the 90's. As they have been playing for so long they're all masters which slightly ruins it. If you join a server you will probably find middle aged men talking about alcohol and their marriage. One other great thing about the simplicity is its tiny learning curve. All you really need to play this game is quick thinking and good aim. If you like fast paced and featurefull arena type shooters you will like this game.

Czytając recenzje kierowałem się głównie tym, że nie ma rusków i cheaterów (po tym chyba każdy może wywnioskować w co grałem, teraz już w to nie gram). Spotkałem naprawdę fajną społeczność, społeczność zarówno śmieszną, jak i naprawdę dobrą. Poznałem wielu znajomych, niestety tylko niewielka cząstka z nich to są Polacy. O dziwo w tą grę nie gra za wielu naszych rodaków, może to lepiej. Nie ma pewnego „toksycznego” jadu podczas rozgrywki. \n\nJeżeli już o rozgrywce mowa, jest kilka trybów rozgrywki - od przejmowania punktów, po podkładanie/rozbrajanie bomb na celach. Niektóre serwery oferują również rozgrywkę w trybie „Realism”. Polega on na tym, że dwóch liderów drużyn wybiera swoich kompanów. Po wybraniu zespołów zaczyna się rozgrywka. Przeprowadzone zostają 4 mecze na jednej mapie (2 mecze po każdej stronie konfliktu, każdy 1 mecz to odpowiednio atak/defensywa). Wygrywa ta drużyna, która osiągnie wynik 3 wygranych potyczek, jeżeli dojdzie do remisu, to jest rozgrywana 5 runda, która polega na graniu klasą z karabinem automatycznym StG44 zarazem nie kampiąc. Taki tryb zauważyłem tylko na serwerze 3te Panzer Grenadier Division.\n\nSpołeczność jak wspomniałem wcześniej jest świetna. Myślę, że przez szeroki wachlarz drużyn i zespołów głównie skupiających się na aspektach historycznych trafi do wszystkich zainteresowanych II Wojną Światową osób. Osobiście polecam niemiecką grupę 3te Panzer Grenadier Division (3te PGD). \n\nWydaje mi się, że porównanie „Szeregowca Ryana” do tej gry jest jak najbardziej trafne. Gra jest stylizowana na okres lądowania Amerykanów we Włoszech, w Normandii. Można to zauważyć po szacie, którymi zdobione są mapy. Nazewnictwo map również nawiązuje do nazw francuskich, tj. Colmar, Avalanche, czy też do nazw włoskich, tj. Anzio.\n\nPodsumowując - śmiało mogę stwierdzić, że pomimo swojego niemłodego wieku gra NADAL cieszy się sporą popularnością, szczególnie w krajach zachodnich. Dla osób lubiących TF2 oraz klimat WW2, a chcących odpocząć czy tez poddać się abstynencji od CS’a jest to pozycja obowiązkowa! :)","timestamp_created":1591344640,"timestamp_updated":1648653834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70262219","author":{"steamid":"76561198157549132","num_games_owned":1045,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":7546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7546,"last_played":1588693120},"language":"german","review":"noice","timestamp_created":1591230107,"timestamp_updated":1591230107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70244290","author":{"steamid":"76561198243675216","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":770,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":540,"last_played":1644909648},"language":"english","review":"a true classic. just got back into dod after a 6 year break and im totally addicted again.

Even though the game is nearing 15 years old, its gameplay still holds up today. The graphics, eh, not too much, but they are good for 2005 technology.\n\nI really like how the class system is set up, with examples such as being a regular infantryman, a sniper, or a support gunner. This variety really can be useful when figuring out your playstyle - you can be a nervous wreck of a private or an insane lunatic with a machine gun.\n\nSome of the mechanics (most notably, aiming down sights) do tend to be a bit wonky - furthermore, the speed at which you move when scoped in with the Sniper Rifle (Kar98k or Springfield) is ridiculously low: I'm aware that it's probably a balancing feature, but it still is hard to work with. \n\nBut what I really think shines through is the communication that you see in most Valve multiplayers. I especially like the audio callouts you can do, where your soldier will shout it out after pressing the key. It's certainly a useful feature. \n\nAt the end of the day, though, the core gameplay, capturing objectives, and getting some frags are what makes this game worth it.\n\nSYNOPSIS\nGameplay: 8/10\nGraphics: 5/10\nReplayability: 9/10\nMap Design: varies, overall 8/10\nFunctionality: 9/10","timestamp_created":1590635636,"timestamp_updated":1590691188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653796911239624023","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69914121","author":{"steamid":"76561198162580957","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1074,"last_played":1645015678},"language":"russian","review":"Ну шо,стояли мы между Вьетнамом и Черниговым...","timestamp_created":1590621598,"timestamp_updated":1590621598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69905660","author":{"steamid":"76561198109495540","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":388,"last_played":1604179045},"language":"english","review":"“You don’t want to sell me death sticks.”","timestamp_created":1590607975,"timestamp_updated":1590607975,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475308656692504883","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69882026","author":{"steamid":"76561198104452860","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12416,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8644,"last_played":1657657939},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая игра","timestamp_created":1590573358,"timestamp_updated":1590573358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69878399","author":{"steamid":"76561198064169501","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":1763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1223,"last_played":1608048212},"language":"english","review":"Counter-Strike about World War II) With physics and achievements)","timestamp_created":1590566661,"timestamp_updated":1590566661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549248099327087402","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69859487","author":{"steamid":"76561198323229224","num_games_owned":6,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":671,"last_played":1595431905},"language":"french","review":"Lourd\n","timestamp_created":1590529745,"timestamp_updated":1590529745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69844927","author":{"steamid":"76561198345579821","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1650801761},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun Fena Değil İndirim Olunca Alın Derim","timestamp_created":1590509486,"timestamp_updated":1590509486,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69832749","author":{"steamid":"76561198239865012","num_games_owned":889,"num_reviews":337,"playtime_forever":349,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":349,"last_played":1545685856},"language":"spanish","review":"Vale la pena, es un juego que marco un antes y un despues.

Der Shooter war eigentlich - wie Counter-Strike - eine \"Half Life\" Mod, von Fans erstellt und dann von Valve verbessert und gepublished. \n\nWir sind im Zweiten Weltkrieg und spielen entweder auf Seiten der Alliierten oder der Achsenmächte. Wir suchen uns eine Klasse aus - vom normalen Infanteristen über den MG Schützen bis zum Scharfschützen und Kommandanten ist alles notwendige vorhanden - und kämpfen auf verschiedenen Maps darum, die Oberhand zu gewinnen und Flaggen einzunehmen. \n\nDas Spiel ist direkt, schnörkellos und relativ schnell. Dennoch sind gute Kartenkenntnis und ein gemeinsames Vorgehen hilfreich für eine erfolgreiche Partie. Sicher ist es aber kein Hardcore-Shooter. Es geht weniger um Realismus als um das kompetitive Spielerlebnis. Und das kann der Shooter auch heute immer noch vermitteln. Es gibt auch noch Server, die besucht werden. Auch einige von Usern erstellte Karten mit eigenen Skins und Sounds. So findet man - zumindest zu den üblichen Spielzeiten - eigentlich immer eine Partie. \n\nDie Grafik ist natürlich - auch trotz Source Engine - nicht mehr aktuell, aber sie funktioniert noch richtig gut. Ebenso ist der Sound nach wie vor gut und auf Zweckmäßigkeit ausgelegt. Alles was wir hören, gibt uns sinnvolle Informationen über die Bewegungen der Mitspieler. Eine Partie \"Day of Defeat\" macht einfach Spaß und mir - das ist sicher Geschmackssache - auch mehr Spaß als \"Counter Strike\" und sicher mehr als eine Partie eines modernen \"Battlefield\" oder \"Call of Duty\". Denn bei \"Day of Defeat\" kommt es primär wirklich noch auf Skill an. Jede Klasse ist sinnvoll und hat ihre Stärken und Schwächen. Und auch als Neuling hat man dasselbe Equipment wie die Veteranen. \n\n[h1]Wertung:[/h1]\n8/10 Atmosphäre\n-/10 Story\n7/10 Grafik\n7/10 Sound\n8/10 Spielmechanik\n8/10 Balancing\n7/10 Spielspass\n\n[h1]Fazit:[/h1]\nOld-School Spielspaß im Source Gewand.\n\n[h1][b]7/10 Gesamtwertung","timestamp_created":1590252644,"timestamp_updated":1590252697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.686328470706939697","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69663448","author":{"steamid":"76561198113703279","num_games_owned":558,"num_reviews":319,"playtime_forever":14,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":14,"last_played":1590238056},"language":"russian","review":"Улучшенная версия классической игры","timestamp_created":1590238093,"timestamp_updated":1590238093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69643105","author":{"steamid":"76561198074046459","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":726,"last_played":1618284286},"language":"english","review":"Day of Defeat: Source has some great, tactical gunplay which is historically accurate.

A diversão não fica para trás: apesar do jogo estar ambientado na 2ª GM, o que o faz acontecer são os jogadores, e no server supracitado isso não está ausente em momento algum. \n\n  Para os novatos: adquira-o se você curte jogar jogos em primeira pessoa, se já possui experiência com jogos da Valve, sobretudo CS Source e 1.6; você não irá se decepcionar. O preço vale a pena pela diversão. Além do player não precisar estar preocupado em se divertir tendo uma mega máquina, é um jogo que oferece um ótimo custo-benefício, principalmente pelo seu tempo ativo. \n\n  Mas atenção: tudo o que disse foi me baseando em uma jogatina online, no multiplayer. Para partidas off, não acho que compense. Particularmente, eu jogo pela diversão, pela oportunidade de me reunir com a galera, que acaba sendo querida pelo tempo presente em nossas partidas.","timestamp_created":1590168424,"timestamp_updated":1590168424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69584221","author":{"steamid":"76561198161550497","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1669,"last_played":1560962220},"language":"english","review":"Abandoned and unbalanced.\nI'm sorry, DoD.","timestamp_created":1590124537,"timestamp_updated":1590124537,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69583161","author":{"steamid":"76561198927097694","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1006,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1006,"last_played":1594240565},"language":"brazilian","review":"[h1]Como o original um excelente fps, mas sofre com os mesmos problemas.[/h1]\n[i]Lembro de jogar em 2010, e desda quela época o jogo não tinha o suporte da valve, e hoje em dia quase 12 anos depois o jogo continua assim, parece até uma maldição, sendo bizarro ou não todos os jogos da valve tem o mesmo destino.(Ser abandonado pela empresa e os servers cheios de download lists)\nTirando isso ainda acho um game excelente, bem pelo menos melhor que os ultimos cods e bfs, com boas game mecanics, replayability e dependendo do servers boas comunidades(especialmente nos servers dos eua), recomendo mas acredito que você vai joga uma vez e depois esquecer dele.[/i]","timestamp_created":1590122614,"timestamp_updated":1641849637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69539087","author":{"steamid":"76561198122741073","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":142,"last_played":1635984661},"language":"english","review":"get it it's cool","timestamp_created":1590063271,"timestamp_updated":1590063271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69538074","author":{"steamid":"76561197999753283","num_games_owned":3,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":43,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1370246624},"language":"spanish","review":".","timestamp_created":1590061928,"timestamp_updated":1590061928,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69534758","author":{"steamid":"76561198136062685","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":74,"last_played":1595949982},"language":"russian","review":"ЗИГ ХАЙЛ факин русиш","timestamp_created":1590057014,"timestamp_updated":1590057014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69523248","author":{"steamid":"76561198066049968","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":16909,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16125,"last_played":1594085276},"language":"english","review":"Plays on cheap laptops and always people playing.
