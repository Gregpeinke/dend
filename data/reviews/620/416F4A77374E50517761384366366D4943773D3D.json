The game is very short and while it does shine like a diamond for the 6+ hours in its single player campaign (the co-op campaign is also very promising) those with only a casual interest will likely feel a little robbed by the $50 price tag.\n\nHowever, if you don't own the first Portal (in which case I'm amazed you exist) then the deal for both games is well worth it as both games are easily worth the $25 dollars between them.\n\nOverall?
