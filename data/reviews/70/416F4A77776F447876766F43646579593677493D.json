Like for a game 1998 it has aged gracefully if you ask me, almost everything holds up really well except the sound quality is not all that great a lot of the times but for the rest i really did enjoy myself a lot.\nIf you want to know what my pros and cons are for most of the game then keep on reading buddy.\n\nFor my pros:\n+ The entire game is a grand adventure that keeps on getting better (till you hit Xen) wich is really fun to kinda start small and you notice how big of a problem it is actually becoming.\n+ Graphics still look kinda decent honestly (I was running it on OpenGL).\n+ It's very atmospheric, I found myself getting sucked up into the world and not knowing how much time has actually passed.\n+ All levels look and feel different wich is kinda incredible for such an old game that is 10 hours long.\n+ The sewer/factory level was really fun honestly. Also the level where you have to ride a little train cart was made me feel like a little kid on a theme park ride.\n+ All weapons also feel and sound unique from one another. Maybe my only complaint with the weapons might be the shotgun wich feels kinda weird to use since it has a smaller effective range than i'm used to but it after a while i got used to it and it also more than makes up for it with that earshattering noise.\n+ The story is told through visual storytelling, there are no moments (except maybe 2 or 3 times) where the plot and what is happening or what you should do is told through dialogue. \n\nOne neutral point that i have is that the combat is really basic but the sounds of the guns make it feel impactfull.\n\nNow to the cons:\n- Sound quality is not all that good, mostly the voices sound like they were recorded with some crappy mic.\n- Gordon feels clunky to control in the platforming sections.\n- When i quit the game it doesn't close properly and keeps running in the background, either i had to end it in  task manager or when it didn't show up i had to end steam.\n- There's a real lack of music to be honest, it could also be that it was glitched on my end and that certain tracks wouldn't play because of it.\n- I got stuck on terrain more than a few times so i had to reload a previous save.\n- Sometimes the enemies are placed just around a corner with a shotgun wich you can have no idea that he's there.\n- While we are talking about shotguns, the enemies with shotguns can shoot it way faster than you ever could wich is kinda bullshit.\n- As last, this is probably something everyone already knows and that is that the final levels in Xen are just horrendous to play through, there's nothing fun about it whats however. Even made me enable noclip at certain parts because i got so done with platforming certain parts.\n\nSummary:\nOverall this is a great game and i would recommend everyone to play through it at least once on the hardest difficulty because then you have to manage ammo sometimes. I think it's priced pretty good but for the most people i'd recommend to wait for a sale. So an amazing game with a few bullsh*t parts but that's okay because the rest is f*cking superb.\n\nRating:\n8.5/10","timestamp_created":1625701302,"timestamp_updated":1625701552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95290420","author":{"steamid":"76561198409126060","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1462,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1462,"last_played":1610490585},"language":"spanish","review":"Half

Бессмертная классика, которая в своё время определило направление развития игровой индустрии. Когда ещё в 1993 Джон Кармак (один из главных разработчиков оригинального Doom) говорил, что сюжет в играх – это всё равно что сюжет в порно, то он точно не ожидал, что всего через 5 его слова обесценит и обратит в пыль Гейб Ньюел и его команда, создав один из самый выдающихся шутеров за всё время, который в свою очередь опирался на сюжет и атмосферу. \nСложно что-то новое сказать в своём обзоре, все знают, что первый Халф-лайф предвосхитил своё время, был как я уже сказал первооткрывателем жанра сюжетных шутеров и инновационным во множестве других аспектов. А именно, игра великолепно исполняет свои повествовательные функции через геймплей в течении всей истории. Как хорошая книга рассказывает историю, как хороший фильм показывает историю, так Халф-лайф отлично повествует через геймплей. Обучение ведётся с помощью окружение, элементы истории, начальное обучение, ничего не пичкается игроку в лицо, игроку не дают никаких маркеров, с помощью талантливого гейм и левелдизайна игрок интуитивно понимает какие действия от него требуются.\nПомимо сюжета также первая часть Халф-Лайф вобрала в себя ещё несколько ранее не использованных в шутерах элементов. Помимо отличного сюжетного шутера игра ещё и является очень бодрым платформером, в меру сложным и отлично компонирующий с другими элементами. Единственным его неудобством могу назвать скорость ходьбы главного героя Гордона Фримена, из-за которой иногда просто невозможно остановиться, но без этого игра бы сильно сбавила в своём темпе, поэтому это нельзя однозначно назвать проблемой. Также игровая механика, которая разнообразит игровой процесс – загадки, встречающиеся на протяжении всего прохождения.\nКак по мне, то шутер больше всего выигрывает за счёт сбалансированного сочетания всех этих геймплейных особенностей, что держит всю игру тебя в тонусе и не даёт отвлечься ни на минуту.\nПомимо интересной вселенной, необычной истории, классного геймплея, отличного оформления локаций, интересных противников заставляющих попотеть, хочу отметить очень запоминающийся саундтрек и звуковой дизайн в целом, ведь все звуки первой части стали сами по себе культовыми, перекочёвывая из проекта в проект, от Half-Life 2 до Dota 2.\nЧто ещё добавить, безусловно 10/10, эта игра просто была обречена на успех)\n","timestamp_created":1625668527,"timestamp_updated":1625668527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95258937","author":{"steamid":"76561198100112667","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":442,"last_played":1616009245},"language":"english","review":"I haven't played this game in weeks, and I can't get myself to. So now I'm writing a review, and I'm just going to honestly try to figure out [i]why[/i] I don't want to play it.\n\nI just [i]could[/i] not enjoy this game, and [i]trust me[/i] I tried. A lot of the elements are surprising, nostalgic, recognizeable if you're familiar with the \"Half-Life Expanded Universe\", but there were so many times where I just scratched my head and thought \"Man, this would really not hold up in today's game industry\". Call me an entitled Gen-Z gamer who can't appreciate 'true art', but I did not have fun with this one, and I couldn't even finish it because of how tedious the fucking Gonarch is. I'll take the fact that I'm shit at this game and that I need more handholding to my ego, and go back to Team Fortress like the impatient endorphin-addicted pleb I am.\n\nIf you like playing this game, a sincere 'good for you'! I'm honestly happy you could have fun with something I don't see the value in. But if you're looking to get this game because you want the \"full Valve experience\" like I did, don't keep your expectations high. I don't think this game either A. is as 'timeless' as the community makes it out to be, nor B. holds a candle to newer games. \nIf you're gonna do it for the lore, there are countless videos on YouTube going into more detail in a shorter time than playing through the full 25 hours-or-so of Half-Life games. If you're doing it for the gameplay, sure, why the fuck not, it's like half a cent - but  don't let yourself be disappointed if it's not for you, and go play Factorio or Titanfall 2 instead","timestamp_created":1625668489,"timestamp_updated":1642964702,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457446813583374023","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"95258228","author":{"steamid":"76561199001069119","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1288,"playtime_last_two_weeks":273,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1660557710},"language":"russian","review":"Легенда , которую не забыть. лучшая серия игр.

И именно из-за этого я дропал игру очень много раз как на пиратке так и в стиме. Но наконец совершилось и я прошел эту игру и сейчас вы будете читать мое мнение об этой игре.\nЯ бы хотел начать с хорошей стороны. \n\nДовольно интересно наблюдать за историей, можно уничтожить танк с помощью монтировки, банихопить по карте(хотя у меня плохо получалось но я старался), можно размясить трупы(да мне этого не хватает во многих играх), с начала игры противники будут разнообразны но потом к концу они вас заебут и вы будете проклинать эту игру это плюс и минус одновременно, выйти за карту, почувствовать себя долбанным рембо в навороченном костюме, атмосфера. \n\nНо как бы эту игру не боготворили здесь тоже есть минусы. \nГрафон устарел для 2021(но это можно легко исправить просто играть в ni g ga мезу или как там она называется), Траектория и геометрия движений(если так можно выразиться) она плоха но хочу похвалить и это довольно странно но в Counter-Strike Condition Zero Deleted Scenes передвижения и их траектория намного хуже чем в хл 1, если делать Double Duck во время движения в лифте то вы в нем благополучно застрянете, и странная отдача на автомате, последние 2 босса хуйня(этот залупенчик с волдырем на брюхе не интересный нихуя а второго хуй пройдешь) \n\nЕстественно я проходил на последнем уровне сложности и я просто не смог пройти последнего босса без god мода слишком сложный для меня оказался((((\n\nПоиграл я чуть мультиплеер и мне понравилось но игроков мало меньше 100 точно и если пинг 50 и более то это лаги.
