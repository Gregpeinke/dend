To complete the campaign will take approximately two hours, but there's so much to explore in the game. The achievements pushed me to explore the campaign further, complete the advanced stages, and attempt the challenge missions. I found the advanced stages tough but doable. The challenge missions are a little too difficult for me to ultimately complete after all these years. I also really enjoyed going through the developer quotes in the stages and hearing their experiences. If you're still reading this review and not putting your purchase information into Steam, you're taking way too long to make a simple decision. Buy it! Highly recommended! Get the sequel while you're at it.
