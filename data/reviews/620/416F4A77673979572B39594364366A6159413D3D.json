If you can't put in the time, don't bother. Each level and test requires you to remember past skills and events, and a lot of heavy thinking. \n\nSome attributes of this game will require some memory of the original Portal game, but it is playable even if you have never played or heard of the Portal series before. Although, it does help to have knowledge of the original game. It always helps.\n\nThe game itself is super fun! Even if you don't play the optional cooperative mode, even singleplayer is a heap of work. Don't feel bad if you need to look up some walkthroughs on how to finish a level, but try not to, it ruins the fun, most of the time (being stuck on a level for a few hours because it requires some super hard trick to do is always an exception).\n\nAll in all I highly recommend everyone to play this game. Is it worth the 20$ US Price tag however, is a different story. I would buy it at full price, but I do recommend you buy it either on sale or through 3rd party websites (such as G2A) in a package with Portal 1. Either way, this valve game will always remain a classic, just like the Half Life series.","timestamp_created":1473376517,"timestamp_updated":1473376517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25417129","author":{"steamid":"76561198039102553","num_games_owned":308,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":2223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2223,"last_played":1473371043},"language":"spanish","review":"Simplemente magnífico.","timestamp_created":1473371379,"timestamp_updated":1473371379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25416748","author":{"steamid":"76561198120171874","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1019,"last_played":1558989629},"language":"english","review":"Okay, look: We both said a lot of things that you're going to regret, but I think we can put our differences behind us; for science... you monster. — GLaDOS","timestamp_created":1473369290,"timestamp_updated":1473369290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25414978","author":{"steamid":"76561198042912761","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":3880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2935,"last_played":1618981849},"language":"english","review":"No steam library is complete without this masterpeice","timestamp_created":1473360931,"timestamp_updated":1473360931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":112,"votes_funny":17,"weighted_vote_score":"0.884661018848419189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25413743","author":{"steamid":"76561198203368346","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1503862879},"language":"english","review":"This was an utter meme and i lav it","timestamp_created":1473355480,"timestamp_updated":1473355480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506172835826873779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25413436","author":{"steamid":"76561198121925336","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1335,"last_played":1546278340},"language":"english","review":"YOU NEED TO GET THIS.

I'm often fantasizing about how different our society would be, if such quantum physics-bending technology like this actually existed - how the wheel would not only have been re-invented, but ultimately made obsolete. Obviously this premise was wonderfully imagined by Valve's writing and design teams, since the  [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narbacular_Drop]Narbacular Drop[/url] recruits joined Valve after their inspiring project was discovered by Valve, leading to the development of Portal 1.\n\nPortal 2 brilliantly and slowly introduces all new puzzle solving tools and mechanisms, like gel and light-bridges, as the player winds their way through the humorous and increasingly bizarre science-fiction tale, set quite some time after Portal 1's climax. [url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0580351/?ref_=tt_cl_t2]Stephen Merchant[/url] absolutely steals the show voice-acting \"Wheatley\", a rogue computer personality core who guides the player-controlled \"Chell\" through an overgrown, time-deprecated Aperture Science underground facility, after she's been sleeping soundly for \"999999\" days.\n\nThrough the first part of story there are unfolding elements and occasional clues that lead to an almost predictable yet entertaining plot twist, during the inevitable confrontation between Chell and \"GLaDOS\", the nasty facility controlling [spoiler](and destroying)[/spoiler] antagonist from the first game, again perfectly voiced by [url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1655889/?ref_=tt_cl_t1]Ellen McLain[/url]. The twist takes Chell into VERY deep unexplored undergrounds, forgotten by time perhaps for centuries, where both Aperture's and key characters' backstories and history are revealed.\n\nBy this point I absolutely knew Valve had another masterpiece on their hands. Portal 2 represents a perfect mesh of game elements, design in both visual and audio areas, and story. It will remain on my hard drive for many, many years as I love going back to this story. I muck around with the built in puzzle creator (a simplistic, community-driven test chamber editor that's easy and fun to explore in itself), and while I cannot in this review encompass the co-op gameply asthetics of Portal 2, since I'm not a big multiplayer gamer and have not attempted it, from what other sources say this can be even much more fun than the single-player campaign.\n\nPortal 2 is a classic. Period. JJ Abrams has even announced work on a Portal film (for which both Merchant and McLean must DEFINITELY sign on for) - let's hope anyway....\n\n10/10.\n\np1anoman","timestamp_created":1473042488,"timestamp_updated":1537644967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25357177","author":{"steamid":"76561198230281368","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":715,"last_played":1479947517},"language":"schinese","review":" 很强，很好玩。","timestamp_created":1473041087,"timestamp_updated":1473041087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25357155","author":{"steamid":"76561198056588310","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1704,"last_played":1447565717},"language":"english","review":"10/10 Masterpiece\n\nGlado's Writing As An Attempt Of Humour Hits Home Flawlessly.
