Feels like it tried to approach the topics of racism and classism while targeting a steampunk FPS audience, ultimately failing at both.\nThe game itself has no redeeming value and could be finished by a blind quadriplegic before the return period expires. Unfinished, poorly made, unnecessary.\nYou aren't missing anything. Forget this game exists. Let Bioshock die in peace. Don't have this mess tacked onto its good name.\n\n0/10 - Terrible price.

third installment of the \"Bioshock\" Franchise: \"Bioshock Infinite.\" This time, we're in the majestic floating city of Columbia. There are new mechanics to learn; there are more enemies to kill. No, it isn't the underwater city of Rapture we're used to, but this one takes us on a journey that is not like the others -- this has a special new story to be remembered.","timestamp_created":1514613363,"timestamp_updated":1514613363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38847627","author":{"steamid":"76561198018773849","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1030,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":667,"last_played":1531109427},"language":"russian","review":"Играешь в игру и как-будто смотришь фильм.Очень занимательная вещь.Советую всем!","timestamp_created":1514612857,"timestamp_updated":1514612857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38846782","author":{"steamid":"76561198280389931","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":470,"last_played":1514633762},"language":"schinese","review":"超级好玩","timestamp_created":1514610772,"timestamp_updated":1514610772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38846290","author":{"steamid":"76561198108366268","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":677,"last_played":1514609100},"language":"english","review":"this damn games ending confused the balls out of me","timestamp_created":1514609423,"timestamp_updated":1514609423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38845218","author":{"steamid":"76561198164300436","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":214,"last_played":1576015405},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego que te va a enganchar con su gran historia y mecanicas \n9/10","timestamp_created":1514606471,"timestamp_updated":1514606471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38844557","author":{"steamid":"76561198119758459","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":733,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":703,"last_played":1492533997},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego hermoso, te lleva a una ciudad unica aparte la historia te atrapa y los personaes son muy carismaticos, simplemente juega este gran juego si te gustaron los bioshocks anteriores, este no te desepcionara!","timestamp_created":1514604792,"timestamp_updated":1514604792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38843711","author":{"steamid":"76561198265770463","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1522759688},"language":"schinese","review":"第九艺术","timestamp_created":1514602538,"timestamp_updated":1514602538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38843296","author":{"steamid":"76561198053106386","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1588,"last_played":1511313092},"language":"english","review":"Phenomenal game in a phenomenal series.
