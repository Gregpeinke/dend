Infinite trás a promessa de combates aéreos, muitos tiros e armas diferentes, além do uso de vigores, os antigos plasmídeos, além de uma boa história. Ele cumpre o que promete e ainda dá mais.\n   Infinite possui uma história envolvente, com personagens extremamente carismáticos. Boker é um cara armagurado, cuja passado vai se revelando pouco a pouco e Elizabeth é linda, cheia de vida, um contraste muito grande com Boker. Sem falar nas reviravoltas na história, que te deixam louco para continuar jogando e ver o que acontece. E nada te prepara para o final, sério, nada mesmo. Você assiste o vídeo final e depois que ele acaba continua olhando para a tela, boquiaberto. E sabe que vai ter que jogar de novo.\n   Os combates são intensos, com o uso de armas de grande poder de fogo associado as vigores, que só deixam a batalha mais divertida. Jogar inimigos para o alto e deixa-los sem ação, puxa-los e arremesa-los no céu, sem falar em incinerar e eletrocutar. E muitos outros. \n   BioShock infinite é um excelente jogo AAA, que deve ser jogados por todos os fãs de FPS, boa história ou pela série BioShock. Não existem arrependimentos quando se trata desse jogo.\n","timestamp_created":1419333408,"timestamp_updated":1419333408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13542885","author":{"steamid":"76561198132270114","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":672,"last_played":1419924213},"language":"english","review":"you kill racist people\n10/10","timestamp_created":1419332853,"timestamp_updated":1419332853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13542132","author":{"steamid":"76561198032400607","num_games_owned":2303,"num_reviews":99,"playtime_forever":743,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":743,"last_played":1418639148},"language":"thai","review":"Epic Story + Fantastic gameplay = Bioshock Infinite","timestamp_created":1419329564,"timestamp_updated":1419329564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13540583","author":{"steamid":"76561198070080593","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1406,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1355,"last_played":1438209290},"language":"spanish","review":"1000000000000000000000000000/10","timestamp_created":1419321146,"timestamp_updated":1542855877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13540392","author":{"steamid":"76561198047455977","num_games_owned":546,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":1258,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1213,"last_played":1419319806},"language":"english","review":"Great game, and the DLC is better than the original bioshock infinite (and that's saying a lot)","timestamp_created":1419320050,"timestamp_updated":1419320117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13539281","author":{"steamid":"76561198101362124","num_games_owned":660,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":1012,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1422140666},"language":"english","review":"Give us the girl and wipe away the debt.","timestamp_created":1419313672,"timestamp_updated":1419313672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13538595","author":{"steamid":"76561198048494033","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":702,"last_played":1563841520},"language":"english","review":"No Sin Shall Escape my Gaze:\n\nBiosShock Infinite was a good game, but I cannot call it it a great game. I have 2 reasons for this. Reason 1. the storyline and reason 2. the level design. The story in my opinion was interesting and would have been possibly one of the best video game stories, if it was not for the ending. The ending felt rushed and lacked a solid conclusion leaving you more of a cliff hanger than a solution. This frustrated me because the game will take you around 12 hours if you search every nook and cranny of Columbia, compared to other Bioshock titles whose game would take around 20-30 hours depending on exploration and skill. The other reason was the level design of the game. Irrational Games gives you great combat mechanics, gear, fun and unique weapons, and amazing vigors, but throughout the game I hardly used the vigors except for the Bucking Bronco vigor. Their were only two senarios in the game that I had to use other vigors, the rest of the game I could use only guns and get through the level just fine. Also, Irrational added the Clash in the Clouds DLC whcihc tries to make up for the lack of complexity to the combat. Overall Bioshock Infinite is a good game, but I felt it cut out vital parts of the story and could have had more complex battles.","timestamp_created":1419309978,"timestamp_updated":1419309978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13538158","author":{"steamid":"76561198053979636","num_games_owned":347,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1930,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1930,"last_played":1467777441},"language":"english","review":"[h1]BioShock Infinite Review[/h1]\nIn BioShock Infinite you play as Booker Dewitt, veteran of the U.S. Cavalry whom is now in debt to the wrong people. You are given the cryptic words \"bring us the girl and wipe away the debt\" and sent on your merry way. Your merry way being a city in the sky called Columbia which is a city like none you have seen before. BioShock Infinite explores many themes from Religion to race inequality as set in a wonderfully realized early 20th century. I must stress how important  the narrative is in this game, it is like no other and the narrative is the main reason to be playing BioShock Infinite. As a result I can tell you little about the story without spoiling it. The gameplay on the other hand is solid and does its job as a first person shooter; maybe all the enemies were the same but this is only a minor niggle. One of the complaints I hear about BioShock Infinite is the two weapon system but you know what I actually thought it added to gamplay, although I will admit to using the hand cannon and machine gun for most of the game! Like stated previously the gameplay is not the important thing here it's the narrative. I read a comment recently by Ken Levine (Lead Writer & Creative Director of BioShock Infinite) where he said the only way games like BioShock Infinite could be made is if they are a shooter as that's what people buy at the moment. BioShock Infinite is a fantastic game which lives up as both a solid FPS and has an amazing narrative. If you like FPS's and story driven games then this is a game for you.\n\nPlease note: It would be advisable to play the first BioShock game before this as it an excellent game too.","timestamp_created":1419307804,"timestamp_updated":1480229643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13536939","author":{"steamid":"76561198062105894","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":910,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":894,"last_played":1430689191},"language":"english","review":"9/10 too much shooting, would have played it just for the story and enjoyed it just as much.\n","timestamp_created":1419302092,"timestamp_updated":1419302092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13536365","author":{"steamid":"76561198062422062","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1037,"last_played":1389762068},"language":"english","review":"ITSA MASTAPIECE","timestamp_created":1419299788,"timestamp_updated":1419299788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13536048","author":{"steamid":"76561197961847495","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":207,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1449216067},"language":"english","review":"Can't kill kids.\n\n2/10.","timestamp_created":1419298537,"timestamp_updated":1419298537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13535456","author":{"steamid":"76561198083892487","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":585,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":585,"last_played":1416103098},"language":"ukrainian","review":"В попередні частини майже не грав, а тут історія прям захопила.

After hearing all the good things about it, I thought it might be great, maybe even as great as Bioshock 1, at least as good as 2. And I think it fell short, and this is what I will be discussing here. This review is heavily built around comparisons to the original 2 games and I hope you will forgive me for sounding like that guy who things sequels will never beat the original. But Bioshock 1 was my favorite game of the past generation not without good reason and 2 was up there was well. If Infinite is going to borrow the Bioshock name it is only natural for me to make comparisons, ultimately see where it came up short in my opinion. These will be mostly comparisons to Bioshock 1, but I will include some elements of 2. I ultimately tried to avoid spoilers in both games, but just to make it clear THERE WILL BE SPOILERS. I SAID IT. SPOILERS. So without further ado, I’m going to discuss the combat system.\n\nI admit the combat more polished than the one seen in Bioshock 1, which shouldn’t be a surprise given the fact Bioshock released 6 years before Infinite. However I feel like it took a step down from Bioshock 1 and 2 in a number of ways, obvious enough differences that it bothered me somewhat. The first is the weapons in the game, in particular the limitation to two weapons at any given time. Despite the fact that most games of this type have a 2 weapon limitation I found it to be less fun to have to walk around with only 2 weapons. My problem with it stems with the fact that it makes combat less interesting and inherently reduces a players versatility in new situations. Ultimately I think it was a poor design choice, and it was incredibly annoying realizing you have the wrong set of weapons for a certain segment in the game. The game would circumvent this issue by often holding your hand and giving you the appropriate weapon nearby, either on the ground or in a tear. I wish I was more eloquent to describe why exactly I dislike the fact that most of your arsenal was unavailable (as most games do it anyway) but it really bothered me and made some combat segments less enjoyable than they could have been. \n\nThis issue becomes even more apparent when certain weapons will be rare in certain segments of the game, making it feel like you have a limited options when dealing with an enemy because you didn’t happen to have the set of weapons most suited towards the job. In addition, maximum ammo capacity is alarmingly low in my opinion. I thought I was just imagining things, but for example the crossbow (the Bioshock equivalent to a sniper rifle) has a maximum capacity of 48 AND additional 28 incendiary bolts. The sniper rifle in comparison only has 27 WITH the ammo advantage and all upgrades (and you are only able to hold 2 weapon at once as opposed to all of them in Bioshock). Ultimately I felt frustrated by these limitations. One example would be fighting my first handyman with a sniper rifle and pistol, with no access to any other weapons (there was probably a tear somewhere conveniently with a volley gun though). But moving on, I need to mention one last problem I had with the combat system which was the lack of variable ammunition. \nAnd on the whole it makes gameplay less fun when you can’t access all your weapons at once. In addition weapon upgrades are stale. In addition lack of multiple ammo types. In addition lack of ammo you can hold. In Infinite you have the bullet. That’s it. But in the original Bioshock game each weapon would have different ammo types. What’s more, the different ammo types would add certain depth to your weapon builds depending on what you wanted. In Infinite the pistol becomes all but worthless late game (I fully upgraded it, didn’t do jack). But in the original you had the Armor-piercing and anti-personal rounds that would make it viable near the end of the game. Infinite lacks this aspect of the combat system, and overall with these flaws to the weapons it makes them feel underwhelming and uninteresting. If this was all I found bothersome about the combat system, that would have been fine but…\n\nVigors and gears. My hopes were crushed when I thought these would be interesting and fun to use. They were not. Lets talk about gears and gene tonics. You can only use 4 gears vs. 6 gene tonics, inherently limiting the number of possible builds you could use. Each of these 4 gears slots can only be occupied by certain clothes. So you can’t wear two hats. In Bioshock, nobody cared if you filled all these slots with engineering tonics. That alone makes it less interesting, even more by the fact that as an ammo monger I was REQUIRED to use Ammo Advantage in the hat slot. I also felt the variety of gene tonics was greater than the gears in Infinite. You could have a hacker build or a melee build, both that were perfectly viable due to the gene tonics and plasmid combinations.\nAnd vigors. The less fascinating and less useful cousin to the plasmids. I don’t want to go in depth on what I found disappointing about the vigors but ultimately I felt they were useful as a whole, with the only one I used being Shock Jockey and Return to Sender. For me, I felt like they didn’t synergize well with the weapons we had available, and most people would probably disagree with me. I’m just going to say I didn’t feel the vigors and my eve supply was usually maxed.\nAnother few aspects I wanted to just touch upon is the removal of the hacking mechanic and research camera aspect. While some may applaud these design changes, I myself am against them because although the “minigames” were kind of annoying they added extra layers to combat in which you could hack cameras/turrets and have to take pictures of a splicer as he ran at you (even if it was silly).\n\nAll this time on the wrongs of combat so I should probably mention what I liked about it. Ultimately the gameplay lent itself to a “run and gun” approach. I didn’t play 1999 mode, but on hard there was nothing to do to run and gun it. But minus all I said above it was pretty fun. I enjoyed the level design present in Columbia and the AI was more punishing than I from Bioshock 1 and 2. The addition of skyhooks was also an interesting and fun concept and it’s pretty satisfying getting kills on the skyhook with a sniper rifle (don’t ask me why I was using a sniper rifle on the rails…) Enemies had more variety than in the previous games and tears added an extra layer to the strategy involved in defeating a mob of enemies. They did a good job in that aspect and it was what kept me going through the game most of the time. Shooting mechanics are also solid, never felt like something was wrong with the system itself. \n\nSo, there you have it. I had written my opinions of the world building and characters in Infinite vs Rapture but there is apparently a character limit so this is all i can do. It is enough for me to have sorted out how I feel about this game, on which I had hoped could have been as good as the first game. This review was pretty much me putting Bioshock 1 up on a pedestal, but I am not ignorant of its flaws. It’s just that I felt disappointed by the time the credits rolled around. And it might be completely unfair of me to put my enjoyment of this game vs. Bioshock 1 just because they share the same developer and name, nut ultimately looking back on Infinite it did not live up to the hype of the original. Is it a good game? Sure. Is it as good as Bioshock 1? Not even close. You should still play it, parts of the game are done very well and is in line with what a lot of games do these days. But when you compare it to greats like Bioshock 1 or Dishonored ( the second game I compared its combat to, not in this review) it just doesn’t feel to me like the complete package. Of course, this is my opinion so I still recommend checking it out. Well, this is good enough to me. Time to try Dark Souls II d('-'d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1419283782,"timestamp_updated":1419283782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13531327","author":{"steamid":"76561197981136494","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":981,"last_played":1478922093},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores jogos que já joguei!","timestamp_created":1419282286,"timestamp_updated":1419282286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13531074","author":{"steamid":"76561197962596123","num_games_owned":190,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1445,"last_played":1415156128},"language":"english","review":"One of the most complex an visually stunning games I have ever played.

The tonics don't really help here as you will quickly find the one or two that you like and then stick with them - further adding to the feeling that this game just doesn't have enough variety in its combat.","timestamp_created":1419237179,"timestamp_updated":1419237179,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13517613","author":{"steamid":"76561197974919392","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1548,"last_played":1405800292},"language":"english","review":"Nice graphics, engaging gameplay and an interesting setting but, could the plot be more contrived?

Делает это Букер, конечно не просто так, а для того, чтобы расплатиться с карточными долгами (Вывод - не играйте в карты...Хотя я сам просто так играю). Правда он ещё не знает, что его ждёт...\n\nСюжет\n\nК Букеру обращается некий человек, который обещает большую сумму денег, за девушку \"Из Колумбии\". Он рассказывает ДеВитту, что девушка обладает сверхъестественными способностями. Но просто пойти и взять её, Букер не может! Элизабет находиться в башне, под охраной огромной механической птицы \"Соловья\". Сможет ли Букер забрать её и выбраться из Колумбии? Кто на самом деле Элизабет? Это вы узнаете, пройдя игру.\n\nГеймплей\n\nС точки зрения, Геймплея, тоже всё хорошо. Бои, как правило, проходят на открытой местности, где мы можем спокойно перемещаться по специальным рельсам. С рельс, мы можем в любой момент спрыгнуть, и атаковать врага, так сказать, с воздуха. Не менее важную роль, играет и Элизабет (Та самая девушка со сверхъестественными способностями). Она в нужный момент, кидает нам и эликсир здоровья и эликсир маны, ну и пушку, если патроны кончатся. Элизабет, кстати, можем сама постоять за себя. Поэтому бежать за ней с криком \"СТОЙ, ТАМ ЗЛОЙ МОПСИК\", не придётся.\n\nГрафика\n\nС графикой, в BioShock Infinite, тоже всё хорошо! Картинка радует глаз, а от некоторых видов города... Прямо дух захватывает! В принципе, я даже не знаю, что ещё сказать? 5 Ванамасов из 5 Бобров.\n\nЗвук\n\nЯ играл в наушниках с виртуальным звуком \"7.1\". На протяжении всей игры, звук был очень хороший. Как и графика \"радовала глаз\", звук, радует уши.\n\nИтог\n\nВ итоге, мы получаем отличную игру, с прекрасным сюжетом, отличным Геймплеем, хорошей графикой и звуком. Рекомендую всем любителям Шутеров, а также тем, кто хочет к ним приобщиться.\n","timestamp_created":1419166828,"timestamp_updated":1419166828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13496454","author":{"steamid":"76561198088153149","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":961,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":709,"last_played":1420137446},"language":"russian","review":"очень интересная игра, а концовка просто убьет ваш мозг!","timestamp_created":1419164660,"timestamp_updated":1419164660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13496274","author":{"steamid":"76561198157464056","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1590776547},"language":"english","review":"Graphics 10/10 on full ;}\nStory 10/10\nFPS 9/10","timestamp_created":1419164017,"timestamp_updated":1419164017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13494166","author":{"steamid":"76561198070738897","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":918,"last_played":1625591670},"language":"russian","review":"игра - шедевр,особенно если перед этим не начитался спойлеров ,то она прекрасна.","timestamp_created":1419159455,"timestamp_updated":1419159455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13494141","author":{"steamid":"76561198138883459","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1993,"last_played":1527335026},"language":"spanish","review":"Ta bien","timestamp_created":1419159378,"timestamp_updated":1605444569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13494110","author":{"steamid":"76561198081552194","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":708,"last_played":1419425396},"language":"russian","review":"Это просто 10 из 10\nСпасибо создателям и разработчикам.\nИграть и покупать 100 процентов.\n","timestamp_created":1419159283,"timestamp_updated":1419159283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13493540","author":{"steamid":"76561197984500121","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":203,"last_played":1396328080},"language":"english","review":"Get this game. I'd advise against playing the second Burial at Sea DLC, because it craps all over the awesomeness that is the Infinite story, and cheapens it by linking it, rather unnecessarily, to the first BioShock game.

It's got beautiful scenes all throughout, an amazing story line, character development that is practically like you're really experiencing it all and I really can't wait to see what happens next! \n\nThe story slowly lets you into the world from knowing absolutely nothing about yourself into slowing getting to know who you are and what type of person you are. I really don't want to spoil any details because solving the mystery is really an amazing experience and really adds a lot to this game and you have no idea what's going to happen next.\n\nOne technical detail I would like to draw some attention to without spoilers.. is that the AI for following and prediction is really spot on and it just blows my mind to how they've accomplished it so perfectly that not once have I been frustrated by it like so many games before that make you just want to kill the [AI in question].
