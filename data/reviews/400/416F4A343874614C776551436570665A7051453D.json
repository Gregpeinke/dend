If you didn't know, Portal is a game where you are given a devices that shoots portals onto surfaces, and you must make your way through a sci-fi laboratory, finishing test courses and getting past deadly obstacles as the AI gets progressively homicidal.\n\nThe gameplay is exceptional, once again the only puzzle game I even really care about, which is amazing in this day and age of most genres and shooters. They've not only made a shooter puzzle game, but made it better than most other shooters on the market anyways. The game has lots of good brainteasers, and in the midst of it all, has some of the best script in the background you'll hear for some time. Seriously, they somehow make an entertaining, engaging, and dark villian in a puzzle game. It's awe-inspiring.\n\nPortal's graphics... aren't so bad. They're late 2000's source, so while not amazing, they've aged well enough. Portal doesn't have music. Except the credits, and it's excellent.\n\nPortal is an amazing puzzle game made by Valve in its prime, and it earns every title it was given. The gameplay is excellent and full of creative and tricky puzzles, while the script carries you along and is somehow mind-bogglingly good for, again, a puzzle game. The game had no right to be as good as it is... and yet to this day it has done exceptionally in every way. And I agree. 9/10.","timestamp_created":1531280824,"timestamp_updated":1531280824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43456875","author":{"steamid":"76561198209736533","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1533098758},"language":"schinese","review":"先玩了传送门2，当时立即被惊艳得不要不要的，玩完后马上买了传送门1，依然很满意，3个小时内通关这种感觉真是太棒了。","timestamp_created":1531279853,"timestamp_updated":1531279853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43456832","author":{"steamid":"76561198215842984","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1518880373},"language":"russian","review":"отличная головоломка жаль токо короткая( но на то есть вторая чать) вобщем всем советую 10клёвых песенек из 10","timestamp_created":1531279601,"timestamp_updated":1531279601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510638296604156494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43456068","author":{"steamid":"76561198334087121","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1514085522},"language":"thai","review":"เกมนี้จะได้เจอกับการศึกษาของคุณ\n","timestamp_created":1531275367,"timestamp_updated":1531275367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43454529","author":{"steamid":"76561198315388134","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1514846405},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buena historia y excelente saga, 10/10 de mis mejores compras, lo recomiendo al 100%","timestamp_created":1531267446,"timestamp_updated":1531267446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43454278","author":{"steamid":"76561198175871119","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":359,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":70,"last_played":1599850958},"language":"french","review":"Un de mes jeu favorie, quoi que un peu court","timestamp_created":1531266127,"timestamp_updated":1531266127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43449525","author":{"steamid":"76561198028308528","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":89,"last_played":1656607773},"language":"spanish","review":"The cake is a lie :D","timestamp_created":1531246489,"timestamp_updated":1531246489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43449439","author":{"steamid":"76561197960373660","num_games_owned":2091,"num_reviews":4137,"playtime_forever":66,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65,"last_played":1539861657},"language":"english","review":"󠀡","timestamp_created":1531246198,"timestamp_updated":1531246198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597237110137939453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43448627","author":{"steamid":"76561198274095159","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":223,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1509137884},"language":"turkish","review":"Genel Değerlendirme: %62\nFiyat :30\nEder :5","timestamp_created":1531243285,"timestamp_updated":1531243285,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43448524","author":{"steamid":"76561198280498438","num_games_owned":361,"num_reviews":138,"playtime_forever":200,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":200,"last_played":1531242803},"language":"german","review":"Bis zur letzten Sekunde absolut geil.
