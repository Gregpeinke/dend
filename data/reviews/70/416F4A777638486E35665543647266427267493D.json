I did not played this game at launch, but even several years later I feel that the immersion of the story is present, and the originality and greatness of the gameplay for that era makes this game certainly valuable. The story is solid and it makes for an incredible foundation for what would be the next release in the saga, Half-Life 2. The dialogues between characters generally contain useful information that is necessary throughout story, but even with it, certain puzzles and scenarios can often feel confusing and sometimes daunting.\n\nThe gameplay is rather solid and even though many things have changed in modern games regarding player movement, this title standardize most of the keybinds that are still used to this date. Player movement, as I said, can feel slippery and you might even have the feeling that Gordon is extremely light. Even though this is no longer common in new titles and can feel somewhat weird, you get use to this fairly easily and even though it is noticeable, it is generally not going to feel like a limitation when playing. Furthermore, you might also encounter with situations where you are glitched and you need noclip in order to continue with the story. This happened to me a couple of times but it does not make the game unplayable.\n\nI find no point on criticizing the graphics of this game from a modern point of view, they are obviously dated and this is totally understandable of a game this old, but back in the day I know that they where outstanding. However, there is an option in-game to enable \"High Definition Models\", which increase the number of polygons in many models, and replaces some textures for higher resolution ones. This significantly improves the visual aspect of many items.\n\nThere are a lot of weapons to try throughout the story. Since you unlock them progressively, you will probably have the change of trying many weapons before beating the game, and since it is very common to run out of ammo,  sometimes you will also be forced to use weapons you do not necessarily like.\n\nThe soundtrack is impressive. Not only the soundtrack itself, but the moments in which some tracks are played. You will often find a good-timed track starting to play in precise moments creating memorable scenes. Personally, one of my favorite scene/soundtrack piece is in the Chapter 12 \"Surface Tension\", when you get into a drain hatch and when you start seeing the end of the tunnel, the classic Valve theme starts playing.\n\nI totally recommend this game; regardless of the clear limitations due to the game's age I think that this game deserves an shot if you have not played it yet. It will make you understand how far we have come in every single aspect: Artificial intelligence, gameplay, graphics, level design, etc. It is also able to exhibit the the beginnings of this game genre and you will quickly understand why was this game that influential and important to trace a path of how will many games be made from that moment on.","timestamp_created":1605690574,"timestamp_updated":1610698858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":42,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.763957381248474121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79450628","author":{"steamid":"76561198380799323","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":458,"last_played":1634389920},"language":"english","review":"video

deserves all the praise it has gotten (and still gets). However, if you just glance at most of the reviews here, I doubt some of them can explain why. The vast majority are either high on nostalgia or blindly hate modern games and subscribe to the \"old but gold\" belief (which isn't always true as some old games didn't age well or weren't good to begin with).\n\nSo I'll be one of the few reviewers that will attempt to explain in detail why Half-Life 1 is so freaking awesome.\n\nFirst, let's look at the story. A top secret military facility named Black Mesa conducts an experiment that results in the teleportation of aliens to Earth (and a consequent invasion). The US government, trying to hide the truth, sends the military to wipe out not only the aliens, but also all the employees of Black Mesa. You play as Gordon Freeman, one of those scientists trying to survive. I don't know; some people loved the story but to me, it wasn't anything special (and it's not why HL1 is loved anyway). But whatever your views on the story, you should appreciate the fact that IT DOES NOT TAKE CONTROL FROM YOU TO TELL IT. The story was written to fit the gameplay, whereas modern games do the opposite. I dread playing some modern games today because you have to listen to or sit through a scripted event before you regain control (and their stories aren't that good anyway). HL1 does have a couple scripted events you need to watch, but they are few, don't overstay their welcome and actually tell you \"Well s**t is about to get real\". So if you don't care about the story, then rest assured you don't have to.\n\nNow on to the gameplay. Remember when I said the story does not take over control from you? Well you can play HL1 at your own pace. Level design is linear, but not the \"tight corridor\" linear. It give you enough room to move about and it encourages and rewards exploration. Regards the latter, modern games don't give the incentive to explore for the so-called \"secret collectibles\", you get nothing more than an achievement. In HL1, when you find a secret area, it rewards you with health, power, ammo and weapons. Now that's an incentive.\n\nThe game also does not treat you like an idiot. You have the general idea of trying to escape and trying to repair the damage done but you also have to listen to the dialogue from the scientists and security guards as to what you're to do next, and even if you don't listen, there are hints in the environment telling you where to go and what's your next move (like signs and printed warnings). No objective list, no map markers, nothing. Just go there or shoot something and see what happens. I like it. And usually when I got stuck somewhere and saw a walkthrough telling me what to do next, I genuinely feel like I ruined the experience of figuring out, like I thought \"How did I not see that?\" So please, if you get stuck somewhere, resist the temptation of looking up a walkthrough of where to go and what to do. Trust me, YOU WILL KNOW. Modern games, on the other hand, started bringing \"to-do lists\". Fine. Then it started bringing up maps with the objective mark. Eh, I can live with it. Then compasses telling you where to go. Okay, okay I'll figure it out. Now the marker is on the center of the screen. Great, there's no incentive to explore or use your head. And you no longer take the time to appreciate the environment because your eyes are fixated on the objective. Thanks a lot modern gaming! If 10 year olds could beat the game back in 1998, then why do we need all those crap telling us where to go?\n\nNow on to the AI and difficulty. This is the one of the most well-coded AI and difficulties I have even seen. Do you want to know how good AI and difficulty is in a game? Ask yourself this: will quick-saving break it? Because in HL1, though you can quick-save, that still will not address the enemies and obstacles you need to overcome. In other words, there is no artificial difficulty like in modern games. You see, modern games try to rely on checkpoint placement to try and make the game more difficult. What it does is just make things more frustrating because it's really just relying on your endurance for difficulty rather than their own ability to try and kill you. Not so with HL1. HL1 is like, \"Oh you're gonna save there? LMAO, we're still here buddy. That ain't gonna help you.\" All enemies require certain tactics to defeat them, even on the Easy difficulty. And if you think quick-saving makes the game too easy (which IMO it doesn't), then you don't have to save. So to developers, let us quick-save where we want. And if you think that will ruin the game, then you just need to code it better.\n\nAnd the gunplay. Every weapon has it's use. I think this solidifies the idea that less=better. HL1 doesn't have a lot of weapons by modern standards, but they all have a purpose. I rather have a game that has less weapons but all have a purpose than a game that has 100 weapons but you use only 5 at most. And this is coming from a gun-nut who appreciates weapon variety in games, as long as all (or most) have a use.\n\nNow on to the bad. Obviously, graphics have aged poorly even with HD models enabled. Speaking of the HD pack, I don't see the hate around them. It makes the models a little more pleasant to look at. My problem is that it replaces the MP5 with an M4 carbine AND IT STILL USES THE PISTOL ROUNDS FROM THE PISTOL. With the MP5, I understand as it uses 9mm bullets, but not with a rifle.\n\nAs for the human enemies (i.e. the Marines), they are one of the strongest enemies in the game (even stronger than most aliens). They require a lot of bullets to take down (though this can be attributed to their body armor). But remember when I said all enemies require tactics and the AI is well-coded? You will see this with the Marines. They won't stand out in the middle of the open with no sense of self-preservation. No, they will act and co-ordinate like a team. It's almost as if they're like the military (oh wait). If you are in cover, they will flush you out with grenades. If you do enough damage, they will retreat. If you run away to recuperate, they won't blindly chase you (though they sometimes will), they will wait in ambush for you when you come back. I know I was going to talk about the bad, but the bad thing about the Marines is that added to all these, they are bullet sponges. Even shotguns sometimes make them tickle. But for some strange reason, firefights with them are some of the best parts of the game.\n\nI spoke a lot about this game and I'm sure I missed some (or even a lot) of other good things, but I just wanted to explain why this game is so awesome to me, and how modern games still struggle to reach even close to HL1. This game is a masterpiece. After playing this, you will never look at other shooters the same again.","timestamp_created":1605668057,"timestamp_updated":1605668552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79441545","author":{"steamid":"76561198403820569","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":123,"last_played":1593569228},"language":"koreana","review":"앙대! 죽꼬싶찌 아나!","timestamp_created":1605666733,"timestamp_updated":1605666733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79440355","author":{"steamid":"76561198994651135","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":123,"playtime_at_review":535,"last_played":1660543717},"language":"english","review":"9.6/10 \nGreat combat, Great soundtrack, Great level design, Good story, Superb environmental design, Excellent sound effects.
