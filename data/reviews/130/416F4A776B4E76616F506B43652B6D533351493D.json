Whilst Valve were busy conceptualising the next generation of Half-Life – a vision of the entire planet occupied by a sinister alien force, with a journey that went from an ice-locked research ship, to an underwater base and even to a massive factory altering the atmosphere – Gearbox were hard at work taking players back to Black Mesa for one final go around.\n\nBlue Shift, originally titled Guard Duty (yawn), was conceived as part of an upcoming Half-Life port to the short-lived Dreamcast, complete with visually enhanced models and textures. This port was eventually cancelled, leaving Blue Shift to debut on PC alone.\n\nGiven the game was intended as a supplement to Dreamcast players’ experience of the far meatier Half-Life itself, Gearbox’s comparatively tiny (I breezed through it in 3 hours this evening) expansion pack didn’t receive the warmest reception. Black Mesa's final hurrah is now largely considered to be the weakest entry in the Half-Life series.\n\nAnd the final hurrah of that incarnation of Half-Life, which revolutionised the genre – and the medium – just a few years prior but was by now showing signs of age. The novelty was wearing off.\n\nPerhaps it already had.\n\nBut all that said...I think I’m still willing to go to bat for Blue Shift as being the better of Gearbox’s two expansion packs.\n\nYeah, yeah – I can already hear the boos and the jeers. But I promise I don’t mean for this to be some ‘hot take’ or sarky contrarian opinion: I genuinely believe the game’s construction is significantly better than that of Opposing Force’s.\n\nWhere Opposing Force introduced a cast of generic, poorly conceived new enemies – the risible Race-X – Blue Shift is content to work with what Half-Life gave it, and in doing so it actually inches a fraction closer to where Valve were taking the series themselves.\n\nSimilarly, Blue Shift snubs the convention that FPS expansion packs ought to include a host of new weaponry – a convention Opposing Force wholeheartedly embraced (some, like the sniper rifle, were useful and satisfying; others, like the barnacle gun and displacer cannon, felt thrown into the game with little thought as to how they might enhance gameplay). Forget the wrench and desert eagle – it’s back to the crowbar and the glock.\n\nWhere Blue Shift shines is in its tight structure, which propels you through the facility’s familiar environs with a surprisingly focused narrative. Objectives are clearly explained, and it rarely feels like you’re just aimlessly wandering the steel corridors of old, waiting for the next enemy to pop up.\n\nSure, there’s some weak sequences: an unimaginative – if even outright bad – return to Xen and a few trivial treks through industrial tunnels populated with little more than the occasional headcrab. Warning signs, I think, that we’d seen enough of this setting, and the designers were struggling to concoct new areas to explore.\n\nFortunately, the best of Blue Shift involves set-pieces driven by unique NPC’s – a clear and successful evolution of one of Half-Life’s key innovations. It’s where Half-Life was about to go in a big, big way just a few years later.\n\nFor the first time in the series (up until this point): we have scientists with names. Now, that might not seem like a big deal, and no, they aren’t exactly brimming with personality, but it goes a long way towards defining the purpose of your mini-adventure, leading to a tense and inventive finale. Who’d have thought that the simple act of pressing a button at the right time would prove more interesting than firing blindly at a giant bilious baby monster or whatever the terrible-looking alien boss at the end of Opposing Force is?\n\nSo whilst Blue Shift may not end up being all that memorable or ambitious, it deserves a reappraisal of its evident strengths: namely its objective-based gameplay and strong narrative propulsion. As a tiny piece of Half-Life, it works, and I don’t think any amount of new weapons or enemies would improve it: it does just fine with what it has.\n\nI’m glad the ‘official’ or ‘canonical’ Black Mesa adventures ended here, though – Valve had no desire to return (they had insisted on nuking BM in OP4) and by the time the finale comes around it’s pretty clear Gearbox had reached the end of the line creatively.\n\nBut should you desire more Black Mesa / Xen / GoldSrc, there’s a wealth of brilliant and creative mods out there, and they’re still coming in even now.\n\nA few of them even manage to stand tall against Blue Shift and Opposing Force themselves, but we can at least thank both expansion packs - products of their time - for showing just how much potential the Black Mesa setting had.","timestamp_created":1621964542,"timestamp_updated":1621964542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92564667","author":{"steamid":"76561198415104234","num_games_owned":416,"num_reviews":166,"playtime_forever":226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":226,"last_played":1621939280},"language":"schinese","review":"巴尼能逃出黑山是真的运气加实力啊\n3部曲里流程最短了的吧，都是长线解密，战斗相对简单，但一样的NICE","timestamp_created":1621939408,"timestamp_updated":1621939408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546391785144805908","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92544234","author":{"steamid":"76561198294172648","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":756,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":756,"last_played":1617068801},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life Blue Shift is not a good game but we also need to keep in mind that this was meant to be a Half-Life expansion for the dreamcast port of Half-Life which was never released to the public.

Opposing Force'u çok keyif alarak bitirdikten sonra hemen bu eklentiyi de oynamak istedim fakat hevesim kursağımda kaldı. Bu eklenti oyuna kısa ve sıkıcı bir hikaye eklemekten başka hiçbir şey yapmıyor. Hiçbir şey yapmadığı gibi önceki eklentide oyuna eklenen yeni silah ve düşman çeşitlerini kaldırıyor, hatta Half-Life'ta bulunan bazı küçük yaratıkları silah olarak kullanma özelliği bile çıkarılmış. Hikayeden kısaca bahsetmek gerekirse; Black Mesa'da güvenlik görevlisi olarak çalışan Barney Calhoun her zamanki gibi işe gelir ve göreve koyulur. Her şey sıradan ilerlerken Black Mesa faciası gerçekleşir ve Barney diğer güvenlik görevlileri ve bilim adamları gibi Black Mesa'da mahsur kalır. Kaçmak için uzaylılarla savaşan Barney'nin önündeki engellerden biri de Black Mesa'ya oradaki tüm görgü tanıklarını ortadan kaldırmaya gelen HECU askerleridir. Barney kaçmaya çalışırken rastladığı bir bilim adamı, onu buradan ancak Dr. Rosenberg'ün çıkarabileceğini ve onu bulması gerektiğini söyler. Çok geçmeden Barney, Rosenberg'ü bulur. Rosenberg, Barney'ye onları dışarı ışınlayabilecek bir makinenin olduğunu ve eğer bu makineyi çalıştırabilecek malzemeleri bulabilirlerse kurtulabileceklerini söyler. Barney gerekli malzemeleri bulur ve Rosenberg makineyi çalıştırır. Açılan portala önce Rosenberg sonra da Barney girer. Ardından Barney kendini Black Mesa'nın dışında Rosenberg ve diğer iki bilim adamının yanında bulur. Ancak Barney birden Xen gezegenine ışınlanır. Xen gezegeninde biraz yürüdükten sonra tekrar Rosenberg'ün yanına ışınlanır ve hikaye bu şekilde biter. Hikaye Half-Life ve Opposing Force'ta da detaylı değildi ancak Blue Shift'in hikayesi bana tamamı ile baştan savma geldi. Ayrıca Opposing Force'ta geliştirilen hikaye sunumu bu oyunda yerini tekrar zayıf ve özensiz hikaye sunumuna bırakmış. Half-Life ve Opposing Force'un aksine Blue Shift'te G-Man yalnızca 1-2 defa görünüyor ve hikayeye hiçbir etkisi bulunmuyor, ayrıca yine Half-Life ve Opposing Force'un aksine Blue Shift'te bölüm sonu canavarı yok. En azından hikayenin sonunda bölüm sonu canavarı ile karşılaşsak güzel olabilirdi fakat maalesef oyuna koyulmamış. Oynanış kısmında daha önce de bahsettiğim gibi silah ve düşman çeşitliliği azaltılmış. Half-Life'ta ve Opposing Force'ta bulunan özel eğitimli infazcılar bu eklentide kaldırılmış, Opposing Force'ta bulunan yeni uzaylı düşman çeşitleri de Blue Shift'te bulunmuyor. Eklenti boyunca yalnızca birkaç çeşit uzaylı ve HECU askerleri ile savaşıyoruz, bu da tahmin edilebileceği üzere bir yerden sonra çok sıkıcı oluyor çünkü çeşitlilik yok. Silah çeşitliliği konusunda da önceden söylediğim gibi eksiklikler var, Opposing Force'ta bulunan ağır makineli tüfek, portal atan silah ve keskin nişancı tüfeği bu eklentide bulunmuyor. Hem Half-Life hem de Opposing Force'ta bulunan uzaylı ve enerji silahları da bu eklentide yok. Ancak Half-Life'ta bulunup Opposing Force'ta olmayan altıpatlar Blue Shift'e eklenmiş. Bölüm tasarımı olarak Blue Shift kendini zaman zaman tekrar ediyor, ancak güzel tasarlanmış bölümler de var. Half-Life'ta bulunan ve oynarken çok sıkıldığım, oynanışı yavaşlatan dizaynı ile kötü tasarlanmış platformdan platforma zıplama kısımlarının bulunduğu Xen gezegeninde geçen bir bölüm Blue Shift'te de bulunuyor, neyse ki çok uzun değil ve beni oyundan soğutmadı. Yani bölüm tasarımı ne iyi ne de kötü denilebilir, ortalama düzeyde. Grafiksel olarak bir iyileştirme yapılmamış, performans konusunda ise Half-Life ve Opposing Force'ta olduğu gibi Blue Shift de oldukça stabil. Oyunu oynarken bir hata ile karşılaştım, oyunun sonunda Rosenberg'ün yanından Xen gezegenine ışınlandığımda oyunu kayıt etmek istedim fakat oyun çöktü, tekrar tekrar kayıt etmeyi denememe rağmen her defasında oyun çökmeye devam etti. O bölüm çok kısa sürdüğü için bu hata bana büyük bir problem yaşatmadı ancak 20 senelik bir eklentide bu hatanın çoktan düzeltilmesi gerekirdi.

Blue Shift plays off his events along with some of the struggles the Black Mesa personal had to deal with in order to survive against both the threats of the aliens and soldiers.\n\nWeapons in this expansion are fairly limited and you have no access to the HEV recharge stations, but considering that you're just a regular security guard, that's to be expected. This game is also much shorter than Opposing Force and the original Half-Life, but then again, there's only so much that can be added to Barney's story.\n\nOverall, the game is still fun and worth playing, especially if you want to get more out of the lore of the game.

It's not to say that what is here isn't very good, but it's just that there's not a lot of it. When I was saying earlier that this felt like a community mod, it's because it does. Most Half Life mods usually have some very obtuse puzzling going on, and this game has quite a few \"big brain\" moments. Some of them seem to make logical real-life sense, but some of them are just so \"...okay...what's the big brain move here, Gearbox?\" None of them were so bad that I had to pull out a guide, but they can be pretty unclear on what you need to do.
