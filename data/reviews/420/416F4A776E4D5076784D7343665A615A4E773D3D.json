If you don't know already, which is hard because it's been a meme for 10 years, it leaves on a Cliffhanger for Episode 3 which will never be a thing except through Marc Laidlaw's summery he placed online. To be honest, I liked the narrative, but it concludes to something that is not worth it. - 5/10. Only props for trying to make it interesting. \n\nGameplay: The gameplay is great, simular to Half Life 2, actually recycled, but not terrible. Nothing really new except the theme, new enemies and missions. Although it's pretty fun nontheless. - 8/10.\n\nGraphics : The Graphics are nice. The updated engine makes up for it. It looks nice with the new visuals and Cutscenes, being pretty sweet. Especially the D0G vs Strider fight. - 9/10. \n\nOptimization - Runs very well. I don't know what to say. - 10/10. \n\n\nFinal verdict : 7/10\nEpisode 2 really delivers, but is disappointing in the process. I only recommend it if you want a continuation of the story but your going to feel left down by it's length, along with all of it not being worth it in the end, but surprised by how well it holds up gameplay wise. Everything else about it is great though, my main criticism is how the game leads up to disappointment.","timestamp_created":1426927676,"timestamp_updated":1521962912,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533125638961791992","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14979368","author":{"steamid":"76561198120642113","num_games_owned":356,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":402,"last_played":1632102885},"language":"english","review":"They're probably still trying to find out what comes after two...

It's brilliantly exciting, fun and scary. This game combines puzzle and action together so smoothly you can barely tell them apart. The setting and themes of the game are extremely interesting, and throughout they provide a great atmosphere which is very enjoyable.

It is not a big deal, but to say partial controller support is spinning the truth. You cannot celect all of your weapons with a controller. This seems like something that could have been fixed with a patch.\n\nAll said and done I did play this with a keyboard and mouse.
