I tip my hat to Valve for creating something that was not only mentally envigorating, but also downright hilarious at the same time. I had played the first portal game beforehand at a friend's house, and I found the game to be great, but lacking a few things to make it wholly enjoyable. The sequal made all of my wishes come true and more. With the introduction of the comical Wheatley, a dynamic turn towards the history of Aperture Science, and multiplayer puzzles that had my mind boggling at some points, Portal 2 is a must play. I would indeed get stuck on some of the puzzles, but the way the story kept me intrigued drove me not to stop testing and solving.

Wheatley e sua personalidade também surpreendem bastante no jogo. Temos também grandes revelações a respeito da empresa Aperture e sua comovente história... Portal 2 também conta com o modo Co-op em que é possível passar por salas de testes tendo controle de dois robôs bem... exóticos!\n\nÉ claro, tudo isso com aquele grande toque de humor que só a série Portal tem!","timestamp_created":1391625303,"timestamp_updated":1391625303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4909038245677948","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8985667","author":{"steamid":"76561198118883025","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1566967227},"language":"english","review":"Multiplayer is awesome... love both portals","timestamp_created":1391621430,"timestamp_updated":1391621430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8985525","author":{"steamid":"76561198033189978","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":606,"last_played":1550086808},"language":"russian","review":"Обойдемся без лишних слов) Я не стану спойлерить события игры, прохождения, общую атмосферу, всю красоту этой игры, а лишь пожелаю всем без исключения пройти этот шедевр. После прохождения остаются лишь положительные эмоции, от которых я не отойду ближайшие 2-3 дня. Не важно любишь ли ты стратегические жанры, гонки, либо симуляторы, но эту игру обязан пройти каждый. Буду рекомендовать её всем своим друзьям, тем кто её еще не прошел, т.к. словами всю происходящую атмосферу не передать) 10/10","timestamp_created":1391620565,"timestamp_updated":1391620565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8985503","author":{"steamid":"76561198084536311","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1052,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1391875204},"language":"english","review":"ok","timestamp_created":1391620409,"timestamp_updated":1391620409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8984637","author":{"steamid":"76561198115623306","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":631,"last_played":1485552367},"language":"german","review":"Super Spiel gut spielbar auch auf niedriger Grafik","timestamp_created":1391615032,"timestamp_updated":1391615032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrIeugcQCfYOjIg=="}
