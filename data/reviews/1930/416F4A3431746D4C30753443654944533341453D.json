Netrvalo dlouho a než jsem druhý díl dohrál rozehrál jsem díl první abych plně porozuměl světu a příběhu. Musím říct že hned od začátku jsem byl udiven že první díl je v pár klíčových věcech, které mě na této hře ohromili velmi odlišný i přesto mě první díl také okouzlil. Bohužel poznačen druhým dílem se neubráním pár srovnání a nechci zde popisovat co je ve druhém díle lepší a proto za nějaké poznatky a výtky přidám pouze značku (2), která naznačuje že ve druhém díle je odlišnost.\n\nHned samotný začátek hry a tím myslím menu hry je velmi odlišné od druhého dílu a musím říct že k lepšímu druhý díl má menu poněkud … zvláštní nesedící ke stylizaci celé hry takže zde první díl vede. Druhá a velmi příjemná zpráva je že oba díly jsou s plnou podporou češtiny v textové podobě. Celé menu dialogy a titulky k cut scénám je v češtině a to velmi potěší. Do třetice hned v úvodním menu zní krásná vážná (operní) hudba. Do které se zaposloucháte a po delší době při kochání se výhledem na krajinu se najednou hudba promění do metalu  v podobě kapely Witch Temple a to opravdu já ocením.\n\nPo dlouhé editaci postavy, která je stejně jedno protože v cut scénách je default postava a po celou dobu hry máte stejně přilbu, takže vyhožený čas nad vytvářením postavy stejně jak v ostatních hrách kde můžete svou postavu editovat až příliš.\n\nJste vhozeni do obrovského světa jehož hranice od počátku znáte (2). Myslím tím že víte kudy vede cesta kde je jaký město atd..  ale objevit kde je jaký portál jeskyně kupec nebo úkol musíte dojít sami a mapa se postupně mění ze zašedlé na jasnou na místech kde jste již byli. Máte absolutní volnost můžete se sbalit a přejít na druhý konec mapy a do jakékoliv města. Pochybuji že se vám to povede protože celá země je pokryta nepřáteli lupiči, zvířata, mystické bytosti, nemrtví atd… Takže myšlenka že by jste došli dál než do vedlejší vesnice je docela úsměvná ale je to správně jak budete objevovat a plnit mise po mapě bude vaše postava sílit a tím se budete moct probojovat na další části mapy. Musím říct že síla je poměrně dobře rozložena tím je vaše cestování přirozeně omezeno ale můžete jako já zamířit zrovna do místa kde jsou ty nejsilnější zlé bytosti a pokusit se nějakou porazit a po hodině odskakování a ubírání života po milimetru prásk jednou ranou odpálen přes půl mapy od golema, který je dvakrát tak vysoký a asi dvacetkrát silnější než vy. Takže pokud tuto hru ne chcete hrát století se stejně na vrátíte do míst kde jsou vám plus mínus sobě rovni.\n\nTrochu k příběhu ten by se ve výsledku dal shrnout asi pěti větami to ale nevadí jelikož zde jde hlavně o cestu která vede ke konci příběhu a ta cesta je opravdu dlooooooháááááá. Jste potomek z urozené rodiny avšak celé svého dědictví a moci jste se vzdali z jistých důvodu a to především z toho že chcete být vlastním pánem svého osudu a nebýt loutkou bohů a rodu starších. Hledáte místo kde byste se mohli se svou sestrou usadit a žít spokojený život a však vaše sestra byla unesena. Únosci po vás vyžadují aby jste objevili a získali pro ně starověké magické relikty. Jenom vy to můžete dokázat protože jste právě potomky rodu jenž je určen k velkým věcem a nikdo jiný než vy to nedokáže jelikož sestru drží jako rukojmí. Tato zápletka vás donutí projít prakticky celou mapu křížem krážem a plnit úkoly aby jste získali informace kde se tito relikty ukrývají. Po cestách potkáte spoustu zajímavých stvoření a postav, které vás seznámí s celou historií vašeho národu a všech ostatních národů a stvoření. Dost mi to připomíná Gothic 3 s tím že zde ale víte od začátku co je váš hlavní cíl.\n\nSoubojový systém je prakticky složen ze dvou tlačítek útok a úskok. Celý boj je kostrbaty takže nečekejte žádné složitosti i zda mi to dost připomíná Gothic. Můžete zvolit z několika bojových stylů kde se to dá rozdělit na tři hlavní boj se zbraní, s lukem, s magií. Tady začíná rozdíl mezi jedničkou a dvojkou očividný. V této sérii jsem se rozhodl hrát s lukem bohužel v tomto dílu je to utrpení. Než natáhnu luk jsem mrtví (2+), když budete sledovat jak střílí vaší nepřátelé tak se jedná o sérii uteč co nejdál pak zaměřuj půl hodiny a doufej že se trefíš to není pro mě. Druhý je magie (2+), která hraje v této sérii velkou roli ale nedostal jsem se do stavu kdy bych pomocí bojových kouzel ubral nepříteli výrazné množství zdraví. Tím pádem jsem skončil u mečů a pak kvůli lepšímu brnění jsem byl donucen přejít na meč se štítem. Ale stále jsem byl velmi magicky založený.\n\nVelkým zklamáním je vyvoláváním uznávám že mám slabost pro zakázané kouzla nekromancie ale když jsem se dočetl že můžu vyvolat vlastního satana a dokonce Pána Pekel tak jsem vše investoval do magie ohně. Bohužel Pán Pekel netrefí ani stodolu. Zkoušel jsem to jako velmistr nekromancie můžu zadržet pomocí hrobní magie protivníka na místě dokud neutrží poranění velmi užitečné v boji proti mnohem silnějšímu protivníkovy. Takže tam ten Golem velký jak stodola stojí a Pán Pekel se nemůže trefit. To není problém jen této postavy většina vyvolaných stvoření má stejný problém jediný, který se mi osvědčil byl škorpión a stvoření s lukem.\n\nMagie je tvořena kartami ty můžete různě kombinovat s kartami vylepšení a docílit silného kouzla delší doba vyvolání, nižší spotřeba many, silnější poškození atd… Čím víc karet daného kouzla máte tím silnější kouzlo je. To platí i u předmětů pokud naleznete více stejných mečů nebo vybavení vytvoříte z nich jeden předmět a ten je patřičně silný tento mechanismus shromažďování se mi velmi líbí. Víc tu popisovat nebudu protože už teď povykládám manuál.\n\nMohu prozradit že hlavní příběh [spoiler]je lineární a jak naznačuje název i zde jsou dva konce naštěstí se konec rozhoduje jen poslední misí, kterou jste schopni dohrát cca do 10 minut. To vše opravdu nevadí protože celá hra je tvořena právě poutí, která vede ke konci hry a během cest můžete svými činy opravdu ovlivnit chod ve světě  a vývoj událostí i když většinou jen okrajově. [/spoiler]\n\n[b]TIP[/b] Pokud vás v boji odzbrojí prvně zvedněte tyto předměty ze země než použijete protože tyto předměty po teleportu zmizí jako jediný.\n\n[b]+[/b] Systém vylepšování předmětů.\n[b]+[/b] Magie a systém karet (2+).\n[b]+[/b] Semi lineární příběh.

Zřejmě zato mohly auto savi. Kompletně zápis na disk hru zasekl na pár sekund.\n[b]#[/b] Některé mise se mi podařilo zablokovat že nešli dokončit ja úspěchem nebo neúspěchem. Nebo se mi zamkla možnost dohrát tuto misi neutrálně.\n[b]#[/b] Hudba je opravdu zajímavá. Mám rád že se snaží být jiná než ostatní hry. Velkou část tvoří klasická hudba, která má zakomponovanou metal žánr ale je tu i motiv z 80. let a to trochu kazí za mě dojem jinak velmi povedený.\n\n[b]-[/b] Boj s lukem mi připadá velmi špatný.\n[b]-[/b] Pouze dvě kouzla v medailon mohou využít bonusové karty ke kouzlu.

Jeśli jednak szukasz gry życia a najważniejsza jest historia to lepiej omiń ją szerokim łukiem.","timestamp_created":1586804299,"timestamp_updated":1586804299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67220220","author":{"steamid":"76561197962301234","num_games_owned":606,"num_reviews":157,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1586773949},"language":"english","review":"YUCK!","timestamp_created":1586773979,"timestamp_updated":1586773979,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469724863767623901","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67195687","author":{"steamid":"76561198273774102","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":850,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":495,"last_played":1649637137},"language":"spanish","review":"Muuuy entretenido","timestamp_created":1586736818,"timestamp_updated":1586736818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66655497","author":{"steamid":"76561197977001950","num_games_owned":993,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1607,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1284,"last_played":1639887730},"language":"english","review":"Euro jank at it's finest.

All'epoca già sembrò, giustamente, a moltissimi un'occasione persa di fare un giocone con delle ottime premesse che poi, come spesso accade, vennero disattese con grande dispiacere degli appassionati del genere GDR action. Però i suoi lati positivi li aveva come la grafica, il loot, il crafting, la possibilità d'incantare armi e armature, scegliere cosa diventare sviluppando comunque anche tutte le abilità volendo, missioni secondarie, ciclo giorno/notte con relative difficoltà, reputazioni con alcune fazioni, combattimenti a cavallo. Ma se partiamo da questo è facile capire perchè Two Worlds sia rimasto un'opera incompiuta: dialoghi assolutamente inespressivi (a volte gli NPC manco aprono la bocca) ed inutili, movimenti del protagonista ai limiti dell'umana comprensione, trama che non trascina, grafica bella si ma dando l'impressione di essere in un mondo finto (bellino da vicino ma nullo in lontananza), combattimenti ridicoli, nessuna indicazione chiara di dove andare per fare le quest secondarie (fondamentale in un RPG), il fatto dello sviluppo anche per console si vede tantissimo, ciclo giorno/notte solo apparente perchè poi le differenze sono quasi nulle (tranne che per alcuni fantasmi che s'incontrano per la via...). \nIn conclusione l'amarezza fu tanta. Se vi aspettate un GDR action stile primo Gothic assolutamente no; se vi accontentate di un clone riuscito male di Gothic 3 allora si.

It is older, it is not top notch AAA modern looking RPG but it is still good imho. \n\nFirst 2 to 4 hours are slow. You are nothing and everything can kill you easily. Even a single wolf! I believe that most players stop playing during these first 4 hours. But when you overcome the beginning you propably will like the game if you like open world RPGs.\n\nPros:\n\n+ The game world is huge and open. You can go wherever you want.\n+ You can build your character freely. But there is some more stronger and weaker builds.\n+ Many very good looking armors and weapons.\n+ Music mix is very good.\n+ Character progression and combination of armors and weapons to make them better is fantastic.\n+ Incredible amount of stuff you can loot from your enemies.\n\nNeutral:\n\n+/- Quests and the main storyline is just mediocre.\n+/- I liked the combat system but it can be clunky and I can imagine that many players are not going to like it.\n+/- Magic looks amazing. Spells are good but not well balanced. Some are very weak, some are overpowered.\n+/- I find the voice acting in some ways good and funny but the quality was sometimes bad. I know that many players have criticized the voice acting in the game but in my opinion it was not so bad. Compare it to the TES IV which is a game with much bigger budget and the voice acting in this game was made by only a couple actors (5 or so?). Remember, this is not a multimillion AAA game.\n\nCons:\n\n- Weaker optimalization (I got some fps drops when many npcs where around)\n- The end of the main story was rushed for sure.\n- Cutscenes are very low quality.\n- Horses! OMG, Riding was okish, but I kept loosing my horse. They kept dying or just disapearing. The function to call a horse has never been functional. \n\nIt is an older game which is in some ways similar to the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion. It looks like a cheaper version of that game.

It has a lifeless, unengaging opening, (ooh, those awful Groms!) the characters are hardly engaging, the world is flat and boring, the combat terribly dry - it is the antithesis, I find, of a good RPG. When searching for an RPG, I find the opening hours to be make or break, especially in a genre that is so demanding of one's time. If the opening is not sufficiently written or well-paced to make you care about the tasks you will be performing for the next fifty hours, then the game feels like an exercise in futility. In [i]The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion[/i], one is made to care about the fate of the world because the survival of the Empire hinges on you. Or the exploration of that ruin - it hinges on you. \nWhereas in [i]Two Worlds[/i], the world didn't give a crap about me. And not in a good, Pathologic-esque way. [i]Two Worlds[/i] just didn't seem to care what I did, what I chose, where I went. I decided to go for a run in the game you see, on my third and final attempt to crack what others have described as a worthwhile endeavour. So, off I went, my oddly proportioned He-Man character sauntering through the wilderness. I stopped to fight some local mooks, but my health was drawing low. I figured I should probably try to run, as I didn't want to reload an earlier save. It turns out that my character was many times faster than any enemy. So off I ran - I was like some hapless version of The Flash, attracting boars, wolves and local orcs to try wallop me, but none could catch me. For a time, it was strangely entertaining, I must admit. It's one of those moments that is self-generated, and the moments that so many developers hinge the success of their game on. \"It's a Radiant world,\" claimed Bethesda Softworks about [i]Skyrim[/i]. Like hell it was, really. But at least it was better than Two Worlds' effort. Bethesda are famously restrictive when it comes to this: their NPCs being essential so you can't go off their predesignated rails. Two Worlds seemed even more restrictive. I tried to cause a little mayhem - as you do in medieval fantasy RPGs, having saved - and found that a humble peasant was able to curbstomp me in a single pithy slap. Down I went, a sack of potatoes in the mud, and I thought: does this game value me as a player? Does [i]Two Worlds[/i] care that I am putting in effort?\n[i]Pathologic[/i] beats the hell out of you. It beats you until you are a bloody stain on the sidewalk and still it tries to wash you away with a hose. But in spite of all of that, [i]Pathologic[/i] respects you. You invest in [i]Pathologic[/i] and [i]Pathologic[/i] invests in you. \nI have tried three separate times in as many years to crack the elusive appeal of [i]Two Worlds[/i]. And once again, perhaps, it has beaten me. Perhaps I am just not the person for whom this game was made.

A lot of people rag on the game, but pay attention to who's doing the ragging -- generally young or new gamers who haven't played many RPGs and whose expectations for games are based on the AAA fashions of the last 5-10 years. Anyone serious about RPGs or adventure games or open world games would do well to play this one through. \n\nIt isn't as polished as the better-known games that came out when it did, but its only real flaws are technical and superficial -- lower quality graphics than others from 2007, clunky controls, mediocre voice acting (which is irrelevant, and not the kind of thing anyone should care about, but people piss and moan about this like it's a game-breaker), and some bugs that were either never fixed, or are due to playing the game on modern OS, such as all the cut scenes being absent from the game. But there are no issues with gameplay or performance, or bugs that impact progression or the overall experience. \n\nThese problems aside, it's worth looking at everything that's good about the game.  \n\nThe story is a decent if somewhat generic one, but it only serves to give purpose and background to what is a pretty outstanding adventure, a very good open world, quality character progression, and dozens of enjoyable side quests that will take you all across the fantasy world of Antaloor. Where the game really shines is in its openness and nonlinearity, its freedom, its RPG mechanics and gameplay. The player is free to explore a vast and diverse world as they wish, at whatever pace they wish, and to visit locales in any order they wish, giving plenty of room to approach quests in any order and to pursue any outcome that seems relevant. \n\nTeleporters and horses make travel easier, but it's good to veer off the beaten path to see what mysteries and dangers lurk in the woods or out in the desert or beneath some ruins or atop a tower, or within the walls of a city. World design is thought out and feels alive. The map's fog of war is well done, in that it only clears the space directly around the character, giving you a better idea of where you have and haven't been. After hours in the game, instead of having large chunks of the map cleared of the fog, you'll only see your path cleared, showing you precisely where you have and haven't been, not just a general idea. To have areas revealed in detail will require you to physically go there, and the path you take will also become unveiled as you travel it.\n\n Many secrets await in those undiscovered regions. The dangers one will encounter cover all sorts of high fantasy staples, from bandits and warriors and assassins and mages to skeletons and undead and golems and dragons and necromancers and orcs and various types of demons, populating all sorts of locations that are also staples of high fantasy: deep, hilly forests, grasslands, deserts, dungeons and caves, temples, ruins. \n\nLeveling and skills and items allow one to make their character unique, with a great variety of attributes and abilities to learn or master, a classless leveling system open to any mish-mash of abilities one wishes, customizable weapons and armor, alchemy to perform, locks to pick, traps to set, seemingly endless spells from 5 or 6 different schools of magic, and six factions across the world with whom to build reputations and undertake work for. \n\nCombat is mechanically simple, but with the variety of weapons and spells it's always full of action and a sense of excitement. The way you approach a fight is up to you. Even the summoning spells are full of variety, with something like 10 different creatures to summon to your aid. The list of offensive and buff spells is too long to mention. The cool thing about the spells is that they work through magical cards you discover through the world. And the more cards of the same spell you find, the higher you stack that deck and the more powerful and effective that spell becomes. This is one of many ways that exploration directly benefits the player. \n\nThere are a lot of items to use and potions or other helpful things to craft through alchemy, treasures and other valuables to steal or hunt down, and a whole bunch of immersion-creating factors that go into Two Worlds to make it consistently interesting.\n\nThink of it as an Oblivion-esque game on a lower budget and a less focused main quest. Despite the inferior technology and the worse voice acting and simpler gameplay, many of the defining factors of good RPG design are here.","timestamp_created":1579911989,"timestamp_updated":1582389977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62258045","author":{"steamid":"76561198202264776","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":362,"last_played":1581805799},"language":"english","review":"oddly addicting game, very fun too level up and increase your weapon and armor stats as you combine them together, i mean the animations/voice acting and even quest programming are kinda shit, but the games still pretty fun... once you unlock fast travel at least.","timestamp_created":1579748614,"timestamp_updated":1579748614,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62080998","author":{"steamid":"76561197996731286","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1507,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":783,"last_played":1580509882},"language":"english","review":"^^","timestamp_created":1579433752,"timestamp_updated":1579433752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495277732610702515","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62017983","author":{"steamid":"76561197993233833","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2863,"last_played":1583538301},"language":"english","review":"Entertainment for hours on end.","timestamp_created":1579335922,"timestamp_updated":1579335922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61952824","author":{"steamid":"76561198065877448","num_games_owned":3342,"num_reviews":225,"playtime_forever":1304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1304,"last_played":1579213194},"language":"english","review":"Wow. I own the physical Collector's Edition of this game way back from its release, but never got past the opening few hours. As a young lad I suppose it was just a bit too challenging for me initially. I came back to it on steam a few years ago and had a grand old time, about until I had to cross the river dividing the map when I bounced off it again. Now I've come back to it, and finally completed this game that's followed me for over ten years. I... don't recommend it.\n\nThere's a lot to like about this game at first glance; there is a fleshed-out magic system, with five separate elemental schools and spells that can be altered with additional effects. Spells or their modifiers can be stacked for effect, with three spells in your bar at one time and three modifications per spell. The downside is that spells are found as quest rewards or as loot; I finished the game without finding every spell. Unfortunately, the magic isn't very useful beyond healing spells, buffing spells, the defensive shield spells, and the summon spells. I dumped over a hundred points into willpower and it was never as good as dumping those points into the other stats; the magic spells just didn't keep up in damage with close combat. I recommend getting a decent summon and getting however many points are required to use it and your shield spell of choice, then ditching the willpower stat entirely. \n\nEach weapon type has an associated active skill (or in the case of the bow, multiple active skills) and there are a number of toggleable passive skills including a defensive mode, sneak mode and berserk mode. Bows are pretty garbage until late game and are expensive to train for, and finding a bludgeoning arrow is pure luck so the average player will probably go with the close combat. Melee combat is mostly an affair of backsteps and mashing the left mouse button. Enemies have different resistances, so a piercing or slashing weapon won't do much to skeletons. Attacking from horseback yields a damage bonus, and the horses shy away from enemies or cliffs which is a neat touch. There's a decent variety of traps, and a weapon upgrade system involving application of elemental stones and combination of duplicate weapons for significant damage bonuses. There's also a robust alchemy system which allows you to combine reagants to give your character temporary and permanent stat boosts, also giving you something to do while traversing the world by harvesting herbs. Overall the game's systems appear sufficiently deep and complex to sustain a joyous romp across the mostly generic fantasy world. They don't.\n\nThe problems with the game aren't immediately apparent; the northern half of the map introduces the player to all of the game's main factions (There is a faction reputation system; no, it doesn't matter. I had maximum reputation with all the factions at the end of the game except the initial two karga/noble factions) and there are a good number of quests in all the towns as you ride around slaying orcs and running errands. This top portion of the map seems to be where most of the development time went, because after completing a quest to get some orc disguise armor and heading south over the river things began to fall apart. Each main area you arrive at from now until the end of the game will have a handful of quests, and that's it. Each area with quests is clearly visible on the map, so there's no reason to explore the wilderness. There are interesting biomes in this southern section, but no reason to really linger or explore in any of them. By now you should already have some of the best weapons and armor in the game if you have been the least bit diligent, and you should already have bought all the skills you need, so you don't even need money anymore. At least you can ignore the slow, painful process of plopping down a teleporter, grabbing everything you can carry, teleporting to town, selling it all, and teleporting back to do it all again. Which, by the way, is the process you are expected to undergo with every encounter throughout the game. For reference, from the time I crossed the river to the end of the game took me six hours. All you do is go to each main area, do your main/side quests, then enter the final quest string where you get a sharp difficulty spike and make your ending choice.\n\nTo cap everything off, the game did not run well for me. I found a lot of bugs during my playtime and had some very unfortunately timed crashes. Quests didn't update, world states didn't refresh, and neither ending cutscene would play for me when I finished the game; I just got booted to the main menu. So I watched them on youtube. They were short and really not worth it. I liked the first 10 hours of this game in spite of the jank; there's a lot of good ideas in here.

If you haven't played it and you like classic RPG's - you're missing out on a true gem - just don't expect Gothic or Skyrim.","timestamp_created":1575662669,"timestamp_updated":1575662669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524682462215423584","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59279515","author":{"steamid":"76561198275306733","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":3818,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2510,"last_played":1636917272},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um jogo que joguei muito durante minha infância e agora que consegui ter outra experiencia com ele pois baixei a tradução, este jogo tem seus defeitos mas se você gosta de em RPG meio antiguinho e um pouquinho mal feitinho mas é por causa da idade do jogo é claro (ou não mal feito mesmo) mas tirando isso ksksks é bom.","timestamp_created":1575552292,"timestamp_updated":1575552292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59276250","author":{"steamid":"76561198026233607","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4867,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4867,"last_played":1575548034},"language":"english","review":"Fun to play, have some bugs and problems but when you spend some time its fun.","timestamp_created":1575548201,"timestamp_updated":1575548201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488170862197875977","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59203213","author":{"steamid":"76561198348374860","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":168,"last_played":1597060849},"language":"russian","review":"я ваш рот распидорасил бы еслиб мог уроды вы недоебанные почему купив оффициальную игру я еще 20 часов сижу решая проблему почему нет подключения к сети и вообще почему в настройках нет настроек сети!!!!!!!! и даже проделав кучу монипуляций проебав такаюже кучу времени ничего не добился и помощи никакой !!!! извините за мат и неграмотное написание просто я всю ноч пытался решить проблему прочитал море информации  и все к черту!!!!! игра классная но только если играть апсалютли без сети  здесь нет ни сетевой ни многопользовательской наебалово!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!кстати все время проведенное в игре эта попытки что то сделать!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1575449842,"timestamp_updated":1575449842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481518596410751343","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"59095613","author":{"steamid":"76561198080680813","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1583,"last_played":1575346898},"language":"english","review":"This game is legendary for couple of good reasons. One, it is incredibly easy to speed run. Two, the voice acting is subpar. Three, the AI is a joke and very easy to exploit. But other than those three reasons. It's a very fun and broken game to play. It's like a low budget version of Skyrim, but still very entertaining to play.","timestamp_created":1575346763,"timestamp_updated":1575346763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549305915832519531","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58368604","author":{"steamid":"76561198154996780","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":10620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10620,"last_played":1574928208},"language":"russian","review":"Всё ещё может","timestamp_created":1574928328,"timestamp_updated":1574928328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"58126704","author":{"steamid":"76561198263344983","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3431,"last_played":1574848161},"language":"russian","review":"Шикарная игра в которой я провёл достаточно времени (в своё время), к сожалению многими проигнорирована но всё же достойна внимания.
