Und ich kann diesem spiel auch jede Menge positive Aspekte abgewinnen aber im Endeffekt hat es einfach nicht gereicht.\n\nBioshock Infinte war nachdem ich Bioshock 1 und 2 durch hatte ein absolut heiß ersehntes Spiel. Bioshock 1  zeigte wie gut man  Story und eine wirklich fesselnde Atmosphäre vereinen kann. Auch Spielerisch war es seiner Zeit weit voraus. Bioshock 2 versuchte etwas Neues nach Rapture zu bringen. Die meisten Leute fanden es nicht so gut, ich war froh wieder in Rapture zu sein\n\nBioshock Infinte versuchte jetzt etwas vollkommen Neues. Ein neues Setting , ein fast völlig überarbeitetes Kampf/Resourcen system. \n\nNatürlich, ist die Story gut und natürlich kann man in die Spielatmosphäre wunderbar eintauchen. Aber leider lange nicht so gut wie in Bioshock 1. Die Welt von Colombia erinnert an Alice im Wunderland gepaart mit einer gründerzeitlichen Kulisse. Nicht schlecht, und an jeder Ecke sieht man den Charm von Irrational Games, den eigentlich jeder lieben muss. Für meinen Geschmack ist diese Welt aber viel zu schön und unzerstört als das gefallene Rapture. Aber das ist schließlich Geschmackssache. Die Story an sich, ist allerdings wunderbar, ich glaube es gibt auch wenig Spiele die das besser machen.\n\nNun allerdings zu den Punkten die ich kritisiere. Ich fange zunächst mal mit dem Kampfsystem an. Das Spiel orientiert eindeutig an Call of Duty, was vielleicht für einige Menschen nicht schlecht klingt, in meinen Augen aber der Ausdruck absoluter Inovationslosigkeit ist. Man trägt maximal 2 Waffen bei sich (die meines Erachtens auch total langweilig und nüchtern aussehen. In Bioshock 1 sahen diese mehr aus wie umgebaute Werkzeuge und nicht so simpel), und erschießt die Gegner mit etwa 2-3 Schuss... Erinnert mich sehr stark an CoD. Die Plasmide sind dann nettes Beiwerk aber kaum notwendig... Habe das Spiel durchgespielt und nur in den seltensten Fällen brauchte ich wirklich ein Plasmid. (An dieser Stelle möchte ich daran erinnern wie schwer es war einen Gegner in Bioshock 1 zu erledigen:  Mit kaum Munition hat man hier wirklich darauf geachtet seine Plasmide richtig zu benutzen)\nWährend diese Kämpfe absolut Anspruchslos wirken sind stärkere Gegner eine absolute Hürde... Ich würde ja gerne sagen sie wären wirklich fordernd, aber das sind sie nicht. Eher nervig... Man stirbt, man schießt weiter, stirbt schießt weiter. Dabei verliert man jede Menge Geld. Da man direkt wieder  in den Kampf reinspawnt kann man auch nicht seine Taktik ändern... echt schlau gemacht Irrational Games. Im Endeffekt war ich froh, wenn diese Kämpfe vorbei waren.\n\nKommen wir zum Zweiten Punkt: Savegames und die sogenannten Schlüssel.\nWas war cooler bei Bioshock 1 als zwischen den Kämpfen in Kisten und Regalen zu wühlen um sich etwas dazu zu verdienen oder nützliche Materialien für seine Waffen zu finden? Dabei fand man  sich auch meist irgendwo an einem Ort wieder an dem man nicht fragte \"Was ist denn hier passiert?\". Fehlanzeige bei Infinite. Hier wird zwar hier und da ein wenig gewühlt, aber wirklich nützliche Gegenstände findet man auch nicht. Diese findet man hinter verschlossenen Türen die man mit sogenannten Schlüsseln öffnet. \nIch weiß nicht was sich Irrational Games dabei gedacht hat. Ich hatte mal gemutmaßt ein nicht zu ende gedachtes FreetoPlay- Schlüssel kauf-feature. Aber selbst die lassen sich nicht erwerben. Stattdessen muss man extrem sparsam  sein,  und sich bei jeder Tür überlegen ob man seine Kostbaren Dietriche opfert oder auf eine größere Tür wartet. Da ich bei Bioshock 1 es geliebt habe herum zu schnüffeln und zu wühlen, ist dies einer der meist gehassten Aspekten von Infinte. Man hat keine Freiheit mehr sondern muss unglaublich aufpassen dass man seine Dietriche nicht für die Falsche Tür opfert.\n\"Dann speicher ich eben vorher einfach und lad neu\" ... Falsch! Savegames gibt es nämlich nicht. Nur ein völlig verkorkstes Autosave-System. Du wirst niemals erfahren was sich hinter der Tür befindet. Zu dem macht es das kämpfen nicht gerade angenehm. Autosaves können wie jeder weiß extrem gemein gesetzt werden. Cod lässt auch hier gerne grüßen\n\nEs gibt keine Tonikums mehr sondern weniger nützliche Kleidungsobjekte, die gewisse Verbesserungen gewähren (Feuerschläge, schnellere Regeneration). Allerdings stellten diese  einen jedes mal wieder vor die selbe Frage stellen, welchen Bonus man lieber behalten sollte. Da diese Kleidungsobjekte keine Rüstungswerte oder dergleichen haben, ist es für mich extrem schwer die richtigen Objekte zu wählen. Da die erbeuteten Gegenstände auch zufällig verteilt werden(zumindest hatte ich irgendwie das Gefühl) wird auch hier wieder eine unberechenbare Glückskomponente hinzugefügt die  das Spiel nur schlimmer macht als die Vorgänger. In Bioshock 2 fand ich das Tonikums System am besten. Hieran hätte man sich vielleicht orientieren sollen.\n\nEs sind diese ganzen Kleinigkeiten, die mein lang ersehntes Spiel kaputt gemacht haben. Man hat sich von den falschen Leuten beraten lassen. Mir wäre ein Spiel wie Bioshock 1 lieber gewesen, als dieser CoD-Klon. Ich kann dieses Spiel jedem empfehlen der eine gute Story liebt, aber spielerisch ist es für mich lange nicht dort, wo ich es gerne hätte. Leider für mich eine schwere Enttäuschung. Meines Erachtens ist der Hype für dieses Spiel nicht verdient.","timestamp_created":1387996528,"timestamp_updated":1459930015,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":78,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596813857555389404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8279785","author":{"steamid":"76561197969290613","num_games_owned":248,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":752,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1419376771},"language":"english","review":"The story is the best one I've experienced in a video game.

The creept atmosphere from the first two games is different, but not gone. The isolation you felt at the bottom of Rapture is the same as you'll feel at the top of Columbia!\n\nThis game will carry you to a place of sheer beauty and yet hostility, a world of faith where everybody is without hope.
