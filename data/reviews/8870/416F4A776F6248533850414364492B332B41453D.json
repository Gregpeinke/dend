so when this game went on sale I didn't miss the change to pick it up. I have to say although the game's been out for a few years (since 2013), the graphics, gameplay and story are still top notch. It's not going to topple my all-time recommeneded solo RPG series (The Witcher) but it is still a fantastic game to add to your collection. \n\nPlaying this game on \"Hard\" was just challenging enough to not make this into a keyboard smashing frustrating ordeal. But the overall character and story developement is where I really enjoyed the most. I definately would recommend this to anyone who can catch the sale, but even if you can't I think it's still worth it to buy this game at it's full price.","timestamp_created":1584393152,"timestamp_updated":1584393152,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65169266","author":{"steamid":"76561198350932797","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":920,"last_played":1584638343},"language":"russian","review":"браво, супер мир, суупер игра, стрельбу бы только лучше реализовать, а в остальном просто шик","timestamp_created":1584391697,"timestamp_updated":1584391697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65168924","author":{"steamid":"76561198267210006","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":694,"last_played":1628005514},"language":"english","review":"Overall, I really loved the game. \n\nThe gunplay was fun and involved lots of mobility, however an effort could've been made to encourage players to use more weapons. There are only two weapon slots meaning that most people go through using only two types of guns (for me it was the carbine and the machine gun) except for one or two parts near the end where the player is forced to use different weapons because of the lack of ammo. Switching weapons late game can be frustrating since players usually only care about upgrading the two or three weapons they actually use and disregard the rest. These situations aren't game breaking though and, for me at least, didn't take away from the gameplay.\n\nPlasmids are here too, but they've been renamed vigors. They are very fun.\n\nFor many the story is a highlight of their experience with BioShock. The overarching plot does get a bit confusing near the end, but the game still manages to pull them all together. I particularly enjoyed the characters and the chemistry between Elizabeth and Booker, both of their archs are interesting and well written. I also loved seeing the atmosphere of the city change and devolve over time with the characters.\n\nThat's really all I have to say, I'll probably be getting Burial at Sea later on. BioShock Infinite varies greatly from the first two games not just in setting but in themes and gameplay and many have criticized Infinite for doing so or at least calling itself a BioShock game while \"not being one\". i can't say since I haven't played the first two if Infinite should call itself BioShock. Personally, I don't really care for this. It doesn't matter what the game calls itself, it's still good and what little links it has to the originals (disregarding Burial at Sea of course) doesn't take away from gameplay or story.\n\nGood game, go get it.","timestamp_created":1584391216,"timestamp_updated":1584391216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65167775","author":{"steamid":"76561198069673494","num_games_owned":247,"num_reviews":129,"playtime_forever":714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1539353779},"language":"english","review":"this game somehow manages to say \"we cant let black people liberate themselves from  a cruel and unjust system cause theyll murder the children!!! think of the children!! anyway im going to stab this black lady with a pair of scissors :)\" this games ass and its politics are worse it somehow manages to \"both sides were wrong\" slavery of all things its a wonder that this still has the bioshock name on it","timestamp_created":1584389614,"timestamp_updated":1584389614,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65167355","author":{"steamid":"76561198274949987","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":78,"playtime_forever":5020,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":682,"last_played":1597501780},"language":"english","review":"nice physics\nnice graphics\nstory offends me but that's the point so eh\nweapons are trash\nnpcs are easy kills except in 1999 mode\nfinal boss is just a bunch of enemies\nanimations are janky","timestamp_created":1584389005,"timestamp_updated":1584389005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65166615","author":{"steamid":"76561197972376048","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1748,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110,"last_played":1613241819},"language":"english","review":"I loved the first two Bioshock games.
