However, I'd say the Gearbox expansion packs are less regarded as part of the core Half-Life experience because they aren't really that important in the story. Despite this, I'd say Gearbox did a damn good job with these games. Blue Shift is very cool because it offers you a different perspective of Black Mesa from security guard Barney's eyes. You get to see the security offices and explore around different areas than you would as Gordon. There are some cute ties to Half-Life too. The gameplay is largely the same but without the HEV suit. You can't charge your vest using the HEV chargers but they are still around for some reason. I guess it adds cohesion. The overall story is pretty short but fun. There are some cool puzzles and interactions. The levels are designed pretty well. The combat encounters are fun. Overall what you'd expect from a Half-Life game.","timestamp_created":1653117358,"timestamp_updated":1653117358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115754029","author":{"steamid":"76561199125669741","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1653081776},"language":"english","review":"I

of Half-Life: Blue Shift[/h1] \nThe second official expansion to the original Half-Life, developed by Gearbox Software, putting you in the shoes of Barney Calhoun. A Black Mesa security guard, who's ready for another long & uneventful day on the job. I'm certain nothing at all would happen here at the Black Mesa Research Facility that could cause some kind of catastrophic emergency... Right? \n\nOriginally a Sega Dreamcast exclusive chapter, was turned into a standalone PC experience after that console's short lifespan came to an end prior to Blue Shift's release. \n\n[i]I highly recommend you read my previous review first, on Half-Life, for greater context to my discussion.[/i]\n\n[h1]Security Shift[/h1]\nWhile Blue Shift was released after Opposing Force, like it & the original game, the events of the story canonically play out alongside each other. So there's no harm in playing this one before Opposing Force or even Half-Life. The references to said game, can be experienced both as someone jumping from this one to that one, or vice versa. Personally, I choose to play Blue Shift immediately after the original Half-Life. Due to its smaller content amount and shorter length in comparison.\n\nIt's quite enjoyable to be running parallel to the events of Half-Life. While still utilizing the same methods of story telling & world building. In-fact, you'll start your journey on a tram ride not unlike Gordon does. It's also quite interesting for it to be themed after the Black Mesa security branch. Instead of an HEV suit & its power, you rely on body armor. Instead of the classic orange HUD, you have a stylish and superior blue HUD (Don't @ me). Simultaneously giving us a different perspective of the Resonance Cascade event. It's exciting, not knowing when it's going to occur, but knowing it's coming. Then watching just how much chaos was unleashed across the facility first hand. There are multiple direct references to Half-Life, such as seeing Gordon more than once, Half-Life: Decay, at the time an upcoming PlayStation 2 exclusive co-op chapter, and Half-Life: Opposing Force, the first expansion. More importantly, as far as narrative is concerned, you'll learn just a tad more about what Black Mesa was up to that lead to the events of the original game. \n\nBarney Calhoun, an important character to the franchise's story, isn't just sitting around waiting for the whole thing to blow over. Like everyone, your main goal is the get the Hell out. Running through entirely new areas of Black Mesa, visiting the border world of Xen once more, and hopefully escaping with your skin still attached. However, the pacing of Blue Shift is quite a bit.. off, feeling. Of course, you cannot parallel one to one as each player's experience is going to be slightly different per game. Here though, events that you'd expect to come later in the original game, occur almost immediately in the story here, or after roughly an hour of play (Including an important Gordon scene). This isn't a complaint mind you, and I'm sure there's some sort of explanation to be given, just something I noticed. \n\nIn regards to the pacing, if you were hoping for another Opposing Force style expansion, you're unfortunately going to be disappointed. The narrative additions and handful of new areas, are really the only 'new' content you can expect in Blue Shift. You'll not fight any new Xen creatures, or HECU, nor will you acquire any weapons/gadgets unique to this expansion. On the contrary, there's actually way less than the original game here. Only a handful of core weapons will be at your disposal. Not bad, but a let down if you were hoping for more like Opposing Force gave. I'd say overall, Blue Shift is mainly just about introducing Barney Calhoun, and how his journey leads to the next installment. With that being said, if feels as though areas are a bit more detailed than the Half-Life.\n|\nThe length of an entire playthrough is also drastically shorter than the original game + Opposing Force. Coming in at a staggeringly low 1-2 hours. Leaning more towards the 2~ hour range for a first playthrough, perhaps. You can practically blink, and the game is over. As an add-on to your Half-Life experience, that's just an extra bit of playtime, but if you're treating this as it can be treated, a standalone experience, you may be underwhelmed. On top of that, the difficulty is far lower than previous titles. Ammunition also never really becoming an issue like it can in Half-Life. \n\nAcross my short playthrough, I experienced a handful of bugs that did not occur in the original game (For me, at least). None of these were game breaking, but could be slightly annoying depending on your level of tolerance. The most common one I was experiencing was when dying from gibs, I would reload firing my gun continuously until I clicked to cancel out the firing. Even if I wasn't shooting upon death. Another I experienced was this strange... almost rubber banding effect where my mouse would snap around and I'd seemingly teleport a few feet. I was able to fix this issue with an online thread post. During the Xen portion, I managed to get stuck in mid air, but was able to free myself. \n\n[u]HD Pack[/u]\nReleased with Blue Shift was a high definition upgrade pack that covered the original game and its two expansions. It focused up upgrading weapon models, a handful of props/interactive objects, as well as some NPC's & creatures. The actual reception of this pack seems to be hit or miss among fans. I didn't mention it in my review of Half-Life, but you have the option to manually turn the HD pack on or off (It's on by default). I tend to keep it off, with the exception of Blue Shift, as it was released with it. \n\nSome of the new models look great in my opinion, while others completely rework the visuals of weapons, and can feel a bit out of place with the rest of the game's visuals. Weapons like the shotgun look great with the upgrade, but changing the classic Glock-17 to a Baretta isn't to my liking. I'm indifferent on the MP5 submachine change.\n\nUnfortunately, no changes were made to the game's flashlight, as it doesn't mess with the engine's lighting mechanics. The flashlight being a bit of a difficult tool to use in the original game as well. \n\n[h1]Conclusion (Pros & Cons)[/h1] \nThe best way I can describe Blue Shift is a bonus spurt of original Half-Life story, that sets up a character for the events that'll follow in the sequels. It is a downgrade in regards to playable content though, so take that as you will. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+More story context\n+Barney Calhoun's introduction\n+Atmospheric storytelling\n+Blue HUD\n\n[b]Neutral:[/b]\n~Insanely short (1-2 hours)\n~Handful of none-game breaking bugs\n~Vacant OST(?)\n~HD Pack\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Large drop in difficulty\n\n[h1]Disclaimer[/h1]\nThank you for taking the time to read my review. Please remember, that this is just my opinion. We don't have to agree, one thing I love you may hate, and one thing I hate you may love. Hopefully this gave you an idea of what to expect. \n\n[b]Review lengths have been greatly compressed due to the character limit.[/b]\n\n5/16/2022\n","timestamp_created":1652762104,"timestamp_updated":1652762104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.599255204200744629","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"115576821","author":{"steamid":"76561197970509330","num_games_owned":980,"num_reviews":202,"playtime_forever":411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":411,"last_played":1652758806},"language":"english","review":"Short but sweet.

I love the Half Life universe, I like how it doesn't take center stage, but rather supports and connects the already established storylines. It's not reinventing the wheel, but that means it's quintessentially true to the original game. Play Blue Shift, you get Half Life. And I think that's decent. And in a way it tweaks the formula, carefully, but there are changes. I for once do appreciate the increase in story and voice acting. That specially aged fairly well, the pick up armor, ocerall the lower level of equipment is also very considerate and it are details like these that make me enjoy Half Life story telling so much where everything makes sense, way more than in other series. The levels are good, in addition to the quality plot and worldbuilding, the puzzles are good, the gameplay is good, it's all just very on par.
