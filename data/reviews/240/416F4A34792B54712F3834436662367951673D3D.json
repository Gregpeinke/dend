The game needs no introduction to someone with even cursory knowledge of computer gaming. There's a reason for its popularity and its gushing reviews. Everything about the game is simply very well-executed. It looks attractive while being easy on system requirements, matches are intense and give great shooting action, and the game is so well polished at this point that (as far as I am aware) there simply are no bugs. It comes with plenty of content to keep you playing for quite a while, and even decent bots for people who want to practice offline or just prefer them.\n\nI do, however, have two personal gripes. One, the fact that the weapons will soon become bland and some of them look silly, can be rectified by installing new weapon skins, which are very easy to find and install. Seemingly countless player skins and maps are also available. The second gripe is that while there is reason to not have aiming-down-the-sights, as this would obstruct some of your view, I wish the game at least gave the option for ADS. It always feels like your shooting from the hip like an idiot, after you've played games like CoD and others that have ADS. The punchy,fun-to-shoot guns of CSS just scream for the immersion of an ADS system.\n\nDespit my personal issues. If you like fps games at all, or just want to have something to scratch the fps itch with once in a while, I cannot recommend CSS more strongly. Just buy it and play it.
