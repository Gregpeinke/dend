A LOT! First off, if you love Sci-Fi and adventure/action games, then this game is right for you! This game tells the story of a scientist who has to save the world from a cataclysmic event triggering a dark energy portal being used by a man named Dr. Breene. You meet many frineds and enemies along the way as you travel throughout the post-apocalyptic looking earth. This game is also a very detailed puzzle game as it helps you to think and use your brain on how to do stuff on certain levels. Overall, this game is rated 10/10. I would buy it as soon as you have enough money and once you start playing it you'll realize how fun it is.

Half Life 2 has many likable characters, not including the protagonist Gordan Freeman who never utters a word. \n\nThis game has great graphics, an enjoyable story, good physics and good GUI. \n\nThe only cons to this game are some puzzles and combat scenes are repetitive and there is very little new things introduced after the first several hours. After those two hours you play with the same weapons and enemies for most of the game.\nOverall, I would reccomend this game and believe it is definitely worth the price.\n8/10","timestamp_created":1403486372,"timestamp_updated":1449969072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925311326980591","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10688918","author":{"steamid":"76561198047077674","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":447,"last_played":1417061225},"language":"english","review":"Even in today, I mean even compare to COD or BF of some sort of other games.\nHalf-Life 2 still seem so damn good \nWhich refered the idea that \"Classic will never be outdated","timestamp_created":1403482735,"timestamp_updated":1403482735,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10688832","author":{"steamid":"76561198077860680","num_games_owned":406,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":834,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":834,"last_played":1403466941},"language":"english","review":"A nice blend of puzzle solving and fps.","timestamp_created":1403482535,"timestamp_updated":1403482535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10687564","author":{"steamid":"76561198019602480","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2230,"last_played":1403395546},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2 is considered to be the quintessence of classic video games, but I consider it to be more than that.","timestamp_created":1403479640,"timestamp_updated":1403479640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10687057","author":{"steamid":"76561198089494290","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":316,"last_played":1422254189},"language":"spanish","review":"Exelente! muy recomendado","timestamp_created":1403478620,"timestamp_updated":1403478620,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10686626","author":{"steamid":"76561197960867074","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":127,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"The original.
