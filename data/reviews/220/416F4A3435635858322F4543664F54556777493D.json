Is it that time again? ːgmanː\n\nHello again! I got Half-Life 2! Sooo that means I am going to make a review!\nNow hear me out, This is the best sequel ever. (In my opinion) And theres plenty of good things about this game! The story is good, The weapons are pretty awesome. But it has a lot of flaws like most games.\n\nBut I can say this, The graphics are so good now! It looks much better than HL1. But I can say this, I almost never got bored of playing the game (Same with Half-Life 1). But I did feel like dying IN REAL LIFE. Hah Just kidding but I felt like I was being beat to hell for some of the parts. Im not saying its bad that its hard not at all, Im just really bad at the game. And its my fault  for not changing the difficulty to easy or medium.\n\nLets talk weapons. There is 11 weapons in the game and I'll be talking about them.\n1. Crowbar, It has not changed from Half-Life 1.\n\n2. Pistol. Its basically the same from Half-Life 1 but looks much better.\n\n3. Another weapon that hasn't changed from Half-Life 1 is the SMG. But it looks better.\n\n4. Fragmented grenade. Its a grenade.\n\n5. Colt Python. Its the same from Half-Life 1 just looks better.\n\n6. Here are new weapons! The gravity gun! With the alt fire you can pick up objects with RELATIVE EASE! And with the main fire shoots the object you picked up!\nLater in the\ngame it turns into a MEGA gravity gun! You can pick up combine and orbs with it to kill your enemies!\n\n7. Shotgun. Basically the same as HL1s SHotgun.\n\n8. Pulse rifle! A really good weapon wich (For me) is really good against combine. It shoots lazer pellets really fast. And the alt fire is a orb that Thanos snaps enemies and bounces off wall till it explodes.\n\n9. Rocket launcher. Again has almost no change from HL1s one BUT the lazer guiding is better.\n\n10. Crossbow. Almost nothing changed.\n\n11. Pheropod. It has pheromones (Hence the name) that a new enemy is attracted to. It will also make the enemy which is now your companion go to a specific spot. And if there is an enemy it will kill it.\n\nWell speaking of enemies lets talk enemies.\n\nTHE COMBINE OVERWATCH.\n\nThere are 3 combine overwatch that I know of. They are the basic enemy in the game and are very close to the Marines in HL1. The first one is Civil watch, Which is the basic enemy but you only see them a couple of times. Combine soldier, The other basic enemy which you see much more of and that have basic guns and pulse rifles. And the BIG DADDY of them all! The Combine Elite, The strongest combine (That I know of) that have pulse rifles and near perfect aiming! And they also shoot the alt fire for the Pulse Rifle!  Now there are a couple alien enemies like the headcrabs striders antlions, But it would have been really cool to have houndeyes bullsquids or just more alien enemies in general. But I love this game but those things just bug me.\n\nThe story is pretty cool butttt..... I really don't know how to explain it. Sorry I'm not good at that stuff. The game is awesome. It's (In my opinion) just a teeny bit better that HL1. The voice acting sounds better and most of the NPCs have original voices. I love the weapons but I would've liked if they had more alien tech like the first game. And alot of the weapons are the same from the first game.\n\nFinal thoughts? Barney Calhoun/10 nearly perfect.","timestamp_created":1588051814,"timestamp_updated":1588450338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68156021","author":{"steamid":"76561198145601810","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1078,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":742,"last_played":1588217030},"language":"english","review":"nice game","timestamp_created":1588046728,"timestamp_updated":1588046728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68155197","author":{"steamid":"76561198391320577","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1636,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":339,"last_played":1643833928},"language":"english","review":"It's a game where Gordon Freeman becomes a revolutionary militant.

Когда она вышла, я катал в игры только на консолях PS2 и PS1, и там меня эта серия игр обошла стороной. Однако, пройдя эту игру только в 2020 году, я не почувствовал, что эта игра старая, и что через 4 года ей будет уже 20 лет. Но обо всем по порядку.\n1. Сюжет\nЯ не знаю, кто может не знать сюжет этой игры. Но если вдруг есть такие, то спойлерить его не буду. Скажу лишь только что история подается не через катсцены или записки, а через саму игру, то есть то, что происходит в игре по факту и диктует сюжет. Тут не будет того, что сюжет игры требует поступать так, а игрок делает не так и при этом все равно двигается по сюжету. Здесь действия игрока и есть сюжет этой игры.\n2. Геймплей\nИграть с физикой в этой игре и получать удовольствие - вот геймплей этой игры. Движок Сурс позволят творить в этой игре то, что не каждая современная игра позволит творить. Кидать во врагов всякие предметы, взаимодействовать с окружением - все это можно и нужно делать в этой игре.\n3. Графика\nМожет, она и устарела, но она не выглядит ужасной, даже спустя такое количество времени. Все текстуры выглядят четко, модели персонажей с большим количеством полигонов, иные графические эффекты до сих пор ярки и пестры.\n4. Эмбиент\nХороший и не занудный эмбиент дает большую прибавку к атмосфере в этой игре. Если начинается жесткий экшон, то выброс адреналина будет обеспечен и благодаря хорошо составленному звуковому сопровождению, а если вокруг мрак и тьма, то готовьтесь к гнетущей, но не менее мелодичной музыке.\n\nЧто же мы имеем по итогу? Валве постарались на славу. Не только повторить, но и переплюнуть успех первой части заслуживает достойной 9/10. Почему все-же не 10? Потому что игра хорошая, но не отличная. Собственно, лучше самому сыграть и оценить, что я настоятельно рекомендую сделать, если Вы, те кто читает этот отзыв, еще не сделали. \nВсем спасибо и...

исчезаю;)","timestamp_created":1587957932,"timestamp_updated":1588047057,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68096035","author":{"steamid":"76561198329346809","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":905,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":800,"last_played":1653803126},"language":"schinese","review":"别来看评测，给我买就完事了","timestamp_created":1587957699,"timestamp_updated":1587957699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68095677","author":{"steamid":"76561198240685082","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":620,"last_played":1587957107},"language":"english","review":"good

nice that the game was received so well at the time of its release, but when the spectacle is gone you're left with a confused game that's nowhere near as tight or focused as its original.\n\nHalf-Life's core gameplay loop boiled down to platforming, valve and physics puzzles, and average-to-mediocre gunplay. This was aided by a sleeper hit story with a good twist and exciting climax. [b]It surpassed expectations, of which there were none, and redefined narrative in video games. More importantly, it's still fun to run and gun your way through the facilities of Black Mesa in 2020.[/b]\n\nHalf-Life 2 muddies this effective formula.

Valve did an amazing job taking the FPS genre to the next level by including advanced physics, graphics, animation and improving upon so much more. This game definitely raised the bar for the FPS genre as well as video games as a whole.\n\nThe story was amazing while also confusing as all hell since you pretty much wake up 20 years later after the events of the first game and have no idea what is going on except that aliens owning the humans are a thing and your no longer killing the three armed aliens you were wiping out in the first game because now they are your allies (I literally had to go google a bunch of stuff surrounding things like that just to understand how it happened). The first game to introduce a gravity gun did it right, it is incredibly fun to use and I like that kind of cartoonish edge the game has to it. Valve just seems to keep out doing itself when it comes to their Half-Life games. Half-Life 1 was very well done and then Half-Life 2 just took a huge jump in about every category and now here we are with Half-Life: Alyx which took yet another huge jump and the entire series is just so well done. Only thing I wished was different was the AR2 gun having more ammo capacity, I found I blew through that stuff too quickly and it was by far my favorite gun in the entire game, not sure why but it just felt amazing to use and I loved how it reloaded and felt.\n\n9.9/10","timestamp_created":1587944237,"timestamp_updated":1587944237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68087589","author":{"steamid":"76561198114959516","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1870,"last_played":1653941286},"language":"english","review":"guys dont let valve know but if you press ~ amd then type sv_cheats 1 and then type noclip you can actually cheat and skip the whole game doknt tell them tho","timestamp_created":1587943807,"timestamp_updated":1587943807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68087503","author":{"steamid":"76561198197870511","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":799,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":777,"last_played":1588056927},"language":"english","review":"ben is a ni","timestamp_created":1587943666,"timestamp_updated":1587943666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68085868","author":{"steamid":"76561198255856092","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":793,"last_played":1587939317},"language":"turkish","review":"Sene 2020 karantina günlerinde kütüphanemde gezerken gözüme takıldı ulan neden oynamıyorum dedim girdim. 2004 yılında çıkmış bir şaheserdir.

Но объективно говоря , она ничем не выделяется . Её любят потому что для многих она была игрой детства как для меня Гта сан андреас .
