It is a great squeal that adds more story and is different enough to keep you engaged. It has much more things to do than the first game and adds onto the story. There are more characters in this game than the first one and it uses that to its advantage. The plot is interesting and kept me motivated with plenty of action, interesting dialogue, and of course puzzles. Now there are spoilers ahead Be warned. \n\nThe story starts off with an introduction to the lovable Wheatley, a core like the ones on Glados in the first game. Only this one is a partner to you. He wants to help you escape. Later on he betrays you for power. Overall, his character is well written and if you like him enough, the ending will make you sad. Next in the story, we are introduced to Cave Johnson, the founder of Aperture and Caroline, his assistant. Cave is a hilarious person to listen to (via pre recorded massage) and well thought out. Caroline is not developed much, but that can be excused for the thing you find out later in the story.\nGlados gets some major development in this story and it made me love her character even more.\n\nThe story overall was entertaining, engaging, and fun to play. The gameplay is pretty much the same with a few changes so It is not like the first. Examples include the gels, the lack of energy pellets, the addition of lasers, faith plates, light bridges and  gravity things (I forget the name)\n\nI strongly recommend this game","timestamp_created":1461891409,"timestamp_updated":1461891409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22695553","author":{"steamid":"76561198230354200","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1147,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":926,"last_played":1568495569},"language":"english","review":"lol make portals in secund game xdddddddd","timestamp_created":1461881908,"timestamp_updated":1461882093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22695108","author":{"steamid":"76561198147975280","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1521,"last_played":1584452604},"language":"english","review":"*beats game*\n\n*passes month*\n\n\"why this is over????????\"\n\n10/10, stop reading reviews and buy this game","timestamp_created":1461879680,"timestamp_updated":1461879680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22694920","author":{"steamid":"76561198073730534","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":307,"last_played":1496091082},"language":"dutch","review":"GONE PLAY IT MORE :)","timestamp_created":1461878739,"timestamp_updated":1461878739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22694465","author":{"steamid":"76561198075059877","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2471,"last_played":1622156983},"language":"english","review":"The part where he kills you!\nWheatly tells me to jump\n\nI refuse\n\nHe says there are boys and horses \n\nI refuse\n\nHe says there is a farm\n\nCant see it, refuse\n\nThen he begs\n\nI feel bad for him so I jump\n\nRate 11/10 \n\n\"Would jump again\"","timestamp_created":1461876693,"timestamp_updated":1461876693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22693309","author":{"steamid":"76561198135205083","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":4569,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1694,"last_played":1595154875},"language":"spanish","review":"El mejor de Valve y uno de los mejores de Steam. Un juego que empieza como aventura pero poco después se convierte en un puzzle más o menos como los de Portal 1. En realidad, los dos juegos se parecen bastante. Los principales cambios son que ahora hay workshop y un modo cooperativo, aunque también hay nuevas mecánicas en los puzzles. Sin embargo, no todos los cambios son buenos: aunque la historia, que continúa desde el final de Portal, va a mejor, las pantallas de carga se vuelven mucho más largas.\n\nEn resumen: combina aventura, puzzle y habilidad. Tiene unas mecánicas muy útiles e iteresantes, y una historia que se hizo bastante famosa. La fama de GLaDOS, la frase de The Cake is a Lie, las torretas y la pistola de portales. Uno de los mejores juegos de la historia, con un buen doblaje, algo poco común. Un final alegre y (al igual que la precuela) con un texto al final que aunque sea un poco largo, deja la historia abierta, pero no tanto.","timestamp_created":1461871655,"timestamp_updated":1461871655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22692778","author":{"steamid":"76561197975742201","num_games_owned":270,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":557,"last_played":1461869364},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegazo !!
