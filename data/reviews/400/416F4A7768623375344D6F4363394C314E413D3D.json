Nach einem kurzen Tutorial bekommt man direkt die Hauptwaffe des Spiels ausgehändigt: Die Portal Gun. Mit dieser Waffe ist es möglich, Portale in Wände und Böden zu schießen und sich so zu ''teleportieren''. In den insgesamt 19 Leveln des Spiels muss man mithilfe dieser Portal- Gun teils sehr komplizierte Rätselareale lösen. Durch die Level wird man von einer künstlichen Intelligenz namens GlaDOS begleitet, welche im Verlauf des Spiels eine tragende Rolle einnimmt und ab etwa der Mitte des Spiels kristallisiert sich ein gewaltiger Plot-Twist heraus.\n\nDas Spiel bietet sehr abwechslungsreiche Aufgaben in Form von Knobelaufgaben, bei denen man mit den Portalen tödliche Fallen überwinden muss, schnell reagieren muss um Laserstrahlen richtig zu lenken und kleinen Geschicklichkeitseinlagen. Das Ganze ist sehr spaßig gestaltet und bei den späteren Levels ist wirklich Denken angesagt. \n\nDesweiteren bietet das Spiel eine wirklich sehr gelungene Story, welche jedoch erst ab Mitte des Spiels an Fahrt aufnimmt. Leider bietet Portal nur eine geringe Spielzeit, jedoch wurde hier mit Bonuskarten und Challenge-Modi Abhilfe geschafft.\n\nTop:\n- Gut umgesetztes und durchdachtes Spielprinzip\n- Fordernd\n- Gute Story\n- Man muss wirklich das Hirn einschalten um manche Level lösen zu können\n- Bonusmaps und Challenge-Modi\n\nFlop:\n- Geringe Spielzeit\n\nFazit:\nPortal ist mittlerweile ein echter Klassiker. Die Idee mit der Portal-Gun ist sehr gut und der Umgang mit selbiger ist astrein umgesetzt. Der Spieler wird hier vor eine wirkliche Herausforderung gestellt und es ist auch einfach mal etwas Anderes im Vergleich zum Gaming Einheitsbrei. Leider bietet Portal nur eine geringe Spielzeit und wer noch nicht genug davon hat, sollte sich unbedingt den Nachfolger Portal 2 ansehen. Klare Kaufempfehlung.","timestamp_created":1421190188,"timestamp_updated":1421190188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13975378","author":{"steamid":"76561198011639700","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1009,"last_played":1417669806},"language":"english","review":"The first time I played this...like many others..i thought I was doing all these damn chambers to play the game when in fact that IS THE GAME.\n\n9/10!","timestamp_created":1421188656,"timestamp_updated":1421188656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13972714","author":{"steamid":"76561198152319980","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":315,"last_played":1432314278},"language":"english","review":"so u have a gun which u can shoot no 1 with (cause there's no one)\n\ncant go in a face to face fight with the (0 self esteem) sentries \n\nnothing to kill\n\nthe way this game was made is very smart cause they made something out of nothing \nthe main of the game is that u have a gun(u will acquire during the early stages) which enables ya to open doorways between anywhere and everywhere \n\ngood game to try tho \n\nwould give it a 8/10 rating","timestamp_created":1421174019,"timestamp_updated":1421174019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13972692","author":{"steamid":"76561198125469710","num_games_owned":768,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1049,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1049,"last_played":1421173201},"language":"polish","review":"Zrobienie gry na 100%=20h grania...\nPolecam..","timestamp_created":1421173942,"timestamp_updated":1421173942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13972144","author":{"steamid":"76561197980437099","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3982,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1472,"last_played":1645383046},"language":"english","review":"one of the best games allbeit short, that there ever was.","timestamp_created":1421171137,"timestamp_updated":1421171137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13970996","author":{"steamid":"76561198075180857","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":74,"playtime_forever":113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1420062345},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom eu consegui jogar Half-Life 2 nele com a Portal gun e foi bem massa mesmo tendo bugs como as pessoas não falarem e algumas coisas sem som e também a portal gun ficou meu bugada mesmo, no fim é um jogaço.","timestamp_created":1421165237,"timestamp_updated":1421165237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458715617656707764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13969785","author":{"steamid":"76561198085535784","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":166,"last_played":1441491221},"language":"english","review":"good game but very short","timestamp_created":1421158418,"timestamp_updated":1421158418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13968655","author":{"steamid":"76561198161044848","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":345,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1419888482},"language":"italian","review":"questo gioco mi è stato consigliato da diverse persone e devo dire che non ha deluso affatto.

I  came in wanting to try and find everything wrong with it I could and try to tear it apart like I do most games.  But I played through it in about two hours non stop and was left incredibly satisfied.  At two, possibly three hours long it is definitely one of the shortest games I have ever played but that does not detract from it at all.  The central core mechanic, the Portal gun, is one of the most fun game mechanics ever made.  The puzzles were challenging and innovative, the humor was sardonic and dark, above all, I could not find anything I didn't like about it.  I have since played through it a couple more times trying to complete different challenges and Steam achievements but it's still super fun! I am someone who tends to play a lot of FPS and sandbox type games but I have to say Portal is by far my favorite game.  Good mechanics, no QTEs (quick time events), interesting and contemplative puzzles, and above all, the best sense of humor I have ever seen/heard in a video game. I highly recommend it for the humor and incredible central mechanics as well as it being a short and sweet change of pace from the FPS QTE filled mainstream garbage most games have become.  I rate 100/100 for no faults and the most sardonic antagonist I have ever heard.","timestamp_created":1421109848,"timestamp_updated":1430608651,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13963970","author":{"steamid":"76561198164355104","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":551,"last_played":1566925262},"language":"english","review":"This is one of those games where you sometimes rage at but you still love it at the same time.

Characterization and story is very well done, unexpected for a puzzle-based FPS. \nThe difficulty is fair; while not overly difficult, it requires you to use a lot of mental acuity and quick reflexes at the same time. There's only a few hours of gameplay, but there's no filler; a great example of a game that's short but sweet.\nThe main hook in Portal, the gameplay, is one of the most innovative things ever done in an first-person game. It's about 8 years old at this point, but instead of becoming outdated, I think it's just become more apparent that this game is a classic.

It's Portal, a game you've likely already heard about by now. With it's clever level design that rewards you for thinking outside the box, it's charming (yet limited cast) of characters, to it's wonderfully atmosphereic soundtrack, it's well worth the price of admission at just 10 dollars! If you get for anything less on sale, it's practically a steal!\n\nThe game stars you, Chell, a test subjection at Aperture Science, trying to go through a bunch of test chambers in order to reach the end, where you're promised some cake! Aperture Science isn't the safest facility though, so don't expect to breeze through these chambers without a little trouble here...and there...\n\nYour only line of defense against these chambers and their hazards? Your trusty Portal Gun. You can shoot Portals like you would with pretty much any other gun, but Portals can only form on certain surfaces. After you place two down, you can freely travel between the two and go just about anywhere with some careful Portal placement.\n\nWhile the game IS pretty short, there are a couple of challenges you can play that are likely to test how good your Portal skills REALLY are. In addition, there are also some really good fan-made Portal map packs out there, such as Portal: The Flash Version Mappack, that you can attempt if you're craving some more action.\n\nIt's kind of hard to say if this game or it's sequel is superior. Portal 2 is a much longer game with some more gimmicks added to allow for more possibilities when it comes to solving a test chamber for a solution, but had a much less rememerable soundtrack.However, I would strongly urge you to play (and complete!) Portal 1 first before attempting the latter. That way you get the full experience.\n\nPros:\n- A game with a wonderful, yet very dark, sense of humor.\n- Easily one of the most unique FPSes I've ever played (and still one of my favorites).\n- A beautiful atmospheric soundtrack with a very catchy credits song.\n- An incredibly charming cast of characters.\n- Pretty cheap.\n- Very entertaining and insightful developer's commentary.\n- The Challenge Maps and the \"Least Amount of Steps\", \"Least Amount of Portals\" and \"Fastest Time\" challenges offer a bit more to the game after you've completed all of the test chambers.\n\nCons:\n- The game not including the bonus challenges is a bit short. You'll likely complete this game in under a few hours of on and off play.\n- The sequel has a much better user-friendly map editor, so you'll likely find more new content for that game. Despite this, there are still some good map packs out there.\n\nOverall, a fantastic game. Don't judge my amount of play time (I've pumped more time into this game then what it's telling you), as I have played this game before on an older Steam account of mine that I no longer have access to, and on The Orange Box for the Xbox 360. Of course, I'd recommend playing the PC release simply because most PCs can probably run this game just fine now, and the additional maps you can download online.","timestamp_created":1420746736,"timestamp_updated":1420747048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13897361","author":{"steamid":"76561198062830976","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1551579264},"language":"brazilian","review":"Eu achei melhor q o Portal 2","timestamp_created":1420741527,"timestamp_updated":1420741527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13897186","author":{"steamid":"76561198095574798","num_games_owned":438,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":3357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":636,"last_played":1643123572},"language":"french","review":"après avoir finis le jeux 5 fois je na m'en lasse pas ce jeux a de plus excelament bien veilli\nje le recommende a tous ceux qui n'ont pas l'argent pour acheter le deux et je le recommende d'ailleurs a tous","timestamp_created":1420740747,"timestamp_updated":1420740747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13891669","author":{"steamid":"76561198086902576","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":149,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":149,"last_played":1419772463},"language":"english","review":"Ive played the 2nd Portal.
