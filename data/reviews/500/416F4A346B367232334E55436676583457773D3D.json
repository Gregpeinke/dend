Был 2015 год, я восстановил стим и вспомнил что купил the orange box, я закачал эту игру из-за того что 2 часть не шла (из-за ошибки с файлами).Я этого не жалею! Первое ощущение что ты реально в центре событий игра: очень сильная атмосфера(я очень испугался когда увидел ведьму), красивая(на 8 год) графика и конечно же ощущение того что тебя прикроют напарники дает уверенности. Если вы хотите купить эту игру, то она это заслуживает.\nПлюсы:\n+Атмосфера\n+Хорошая графика\n+Отличные компании\n+Возможность загрузки доп. контента\n+Неплохие напарники\n+Хороший ИИ\n+В игра есть Режиссёр(ИИ) он расставляет вещи и зараженных в зависимости от игры, можно перепроходить ходить компании бесконечно.\n+Особые заражённые\nМинусы: \n-Если вы играете на эксперте, то нубы (обычно они имеют ники пиратов: by Pioneer,I am noob, noob_(И двухзначное число любое), noSTEAM.ro) начинают мешать( френдли фаер, тим килл и т.д.)\n-Игра уже старая поэтому в неё уже меньше играют(но всё равно игроков много).\nИтого: эта игра заслуживает чтобы её купить(не пиратить!!!)! Уверен, она надолго останется в ваших сердцах( она лучше 2 части).Спасибо за внимание!\nEU To be honest, I played it compulsively! Was 2015, I repaired steam and remembered that I bought the orange box, I've downloaded this game due to the fact that part 2 was not (because of an error with the files).I do not regret it! The first impression that you're really in the center of events the game a very strong atmosphere(I was very scared when I saw the witch), beautiful(8 year) graphics and of course the feeling that your back gives teammates confidence. If you want to buy this game, it deserves it.\nPros:\n+Atmosphere\n+Good graphics\n+Great company\n+The ability to download additional content\n+Good companions\n+Good AI\n+The game has a Directed(s) he puts belongings and infected, depending on the game, you can replay go to the company indefinitely.\n+Special infected\nCons: \n-If you play on expert, then noobs (they usually have nicknames pirate by Pioneer,I am a noob, noob_(And any two-digit number), noSTEAM.ro) get in the way( friendly fire, team kill, etc.)\n-The game is old, so it has less play(but still a lot of players).\nTotal: this game deserves to buy it(not pirate!!!)! I'm sure it will long remain in your hearts( it is better than the 2 parts).Thank you for your attention!","timestamp_created":1468435789,"timestamp_updated":1477220133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24293459","author":{"steamid":"76561198064091849","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1541,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":755,"last_played":1593110444},"language":"brazilian","review":"Otimo jogo para jogas com os amigos,\ne conheçe novos amigos.\nSuper recomendado\no Left 4 Dead 2 e mais recomendado","timestamp_created":1468408175,"timestamp_updated":1468408175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24293055","author":{"steamid":"76561197990041510","num_games_owned":706,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1688,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":365,"last_played":1657396550},"language":"french","review":"Excellent jeu, à la fois en mode campagne (seul ou à plusieurs) et en mode versus (la possibilité de jouer les zombies change vraiment la donne).\nJeu tellement bon que j'ai profité des soldes de Noël pour acheter un 4-pack et offrir les exemplaires additionnels à mes amis, pour pouvoir ensuite lancer des parties endiablées.","timestamp_created":1468406363,"timestamp_updated":1468406363,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24287772","author":{"steamid":"76561198058635054","num_games_owned":2359,"num_reviews":277,"playtime_forever":275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1565112191},"language":"english","review":"High adrenaline horror!

Its my favorite zombie game, but that doesnt mean theres not flaws...... because there are. For example your kills will be stolen very easily when playing online with people, this can become very frustrating. Another flaw is other players can shoot you and it will take health points away, i guess its for realism but its hard to take that seriously when your hanging on a cliff for an hour waiting for someone to revive you. Also storywise theres not too much to offer, grinding through countless maps with little variety can get kind of boring, but every cloud  has a silver lining. One of those silver linings is the exhilarating moments, the ones where your rescue arrives and hundreds of zombies start chasing after you, its a race for your life and if you do its upsetting but can actually be quite funny with you and your group. To sum this up Left 4 Dead can be played by pretty much anyone, its a fun experience especially with friends and i would certainley recommend it. \n\n7/10\nwould get thrown off a cliff by a tank again","timestamp_created":1467818265,"timestamp_updated":1467818265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534024715423583984","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24135072","author":{"steamid":"76561198257067146","num_games_owned":13,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3246,"last_played":1629657415},"language":"spanish","review":"Es muy entretenido :D Lo recomiendo mucho.\nVale la pena pagar por este juego :D","timestamp_created":1467814911,"timestamp_updated":1467814911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24134985","author":{"steamid":"76561197964088651","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":6036,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6036,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Get you 3 closest freinds and arm up to kill some zombie hords that are fast and just plenty to kill.

I was gone over 4th of July weekend and was without internet, but I must have unlocked half the achievements, but didn't receive credit because I had to play in offline mode. After I got back and could log on online, it still didn't register so now I have to do all those achievements all over again. I completed the Cr0wnd achievement on the PC version and can't even get that on a console, but I didn't get the achievement because it was done offline.
