This game completely revamped the discflinger genre, a timeless classic! To this day, this game is by far the best spooky frisbee death battle simulator I have ever played.\n\nRicohet may appear rudimentary to the untrained eye, but once you peel back the layers one can see the full picture: a harsh socio-political commentary on the horrors of the second Palaiologan civil war. It showed me how hard life for a soldier really is, doing as best as he could to get a positive K/D, avoiding discs left right and centre, only to eventually get hit and fall into the spinny vortex thing. This will only take 10 hours of your life, but believe me when I say it is worth every second (if you can find a server).","timestamp_created":1561827933,"timestamp_updated":1561827933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.665568768978118896","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52072690","author":{"steamid":"76561198416103987","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1561827276},"language":"english","review":"controls are stuck you can move around proparly haah is this game of the year dont buy it very por made","timestamp_created":1561827400,"timestamp_updated":1561827400,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52071763","author":{"steamid":"76561198128090776","num_games_owned":613,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1561827279},"language":"english","review":"i am never launching this game again","timestamp_created":1561827303,"timestamp_updated":1561827303,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490196079015731812","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"52050830","author":{"steamid":"76561198136617066","num_games_owned":1075,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1561824942},"language":"spanish","review":"We don't need Half Life 3.

The gameplay is incredible, it rivals modern day triple A title like no other game has ever done. The gunplay is amazing, I am astounded that they could fit all those physical calculations into their game today let alone decades ago. The graphics are outstanding, you would think you would need a modern gaming pc that cost 2000 dollars to run it but no it runs on a laptop from 2006 with 500 frames per second. This games soundtrack rivals Doom 2016's bombastic song choice while also having very calming songs during moments of downtime. It also has songs for everyone with an amazing selection of music on the ingame radio stations, from modern pop to classic country songs and everything in between.\n\nBut alas ever masterpiece is with its fair share of flaws, \n\nOne con is that there are to many players on at all times causing the servers to lag just enough to be noticeable and annoying. Another problem with so many players is that there is bound to be a few bad apples that ruin the whole batch, it is very sad that streamers have to play on white-listed servers just so they can play this amazing game. \n\nBut all things considered the pros outweigh the cons a million times over.

Incredibly easy to learn. Relatively difficult to master. It doesn't have the largest range to it's gameplay, it's graphics are not great, and it has got literally no soundtrack. But it's fun, and with a friend it can be hilarious.\n\n[u] My tips to you: [/u]\n\n1. Buy it on sale. It's 90% off on every major steam sale. Or better yet, buy it as part of the Valve Complete Pack Bundle, which includes Portal 2 and Half-Life 2, two of the best games ever made.\n\n2. Get friends to play it. If you can guarantee you can find another player, it's a lot more fun then just hoping for a stranger.\n\n3. Enable Raw Mouse Input. This is really for all of Valve's GoldSrc games, the mouse is often messed up if this is disabled.\n\n4. Practise and get good at timing so you can destroy your friends. If you and a friend are both relatively good, you can have a far more challenging experience, which is generally more fun and certainly more engaging.\n\nI hope this helps with any concerns or issues
