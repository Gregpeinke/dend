The combat, teamwork and 9 classes have their own unique weapons, personalities and styles of play. If you enjoy wacky, cartoony violence with postive sterotypes of the characters, then this game is right for you! The microtransactions may turn some of you off, but you can still play the game without paying for a single thing. The only downside is the random drops don't give you special items and you have to pay in order to trade with other players.  There's some crazy servers where the gameplay gets a twist and frankly, I guarentee that you will not be bored with this game. GET IT! INSTALL IT!

I adore its characters, its incredibly fun (if you know what you're doing) and fast-paced gameplay, its community, the ridiculous or serious videos made about it using Source Film Maker or Gmod, the goodhearted players who enjoy it just as much as you and want to help newcomers along, and long time veterans who still come back to play. Now, I have heard many a complaint about the recent updates and how they are said to have ruined what TF2 as a unique multiplayer FPS is. That Valve in its total disregard for the game's players gave them as many middle fingers as there were developers. And I have done some reseacrh (mainly on Youtube) trying to figure out why there was such an outcry, and several of those arguments are undoubtedly understandable, from the replacement of quickplay to a slower entry screen (which Valve has fixed the time on) to the removal of autobalance, to a strange and new XP system (which I like) to the undelivered new weapons, and so on and so forth. Thing is since I'm as new as I am, this hasn't affected me much at all. Heck, as I said before I adore the game even when it looks as if Valve has careleesy tossed Team Fortress aside. \n\nAnd it may surprise you, but Valve really is trying to make this game fun for people and think they're trying to do it so that it's more newcomer friendly. I guess Overwatch really was a bit of a scare for the time, and maybe they thought they had to do something big to not lose players, but that big thing would take time to make. So the best they could do was MyM and then use it as an incentive for a future update. And as it may surprise some of ou, Valve really is trying, and even though I've not been here since the beginning and been able to experience all the past greatness of the game, (I have always said about myself that I came a generation too late), I intend to come back to the game and play it many a time over. I mean, how can you not love Team Fortress 2? Here are two videos (they're a little outdated) that I found escpecially helpful in understanding this.

It's not just a game, it's an economy, and a community!\n\nTeam Fortress 2 is a game that isn't easy to \"just pick up\" when you first start. It takes practice, but that's what makes it so incredible: The feeling of a killstreak or a hard-to-get achievement. It's very satisfying. And you can play from different characters, each with their own unique kind of personality and abilities.\n\nBut more than just the gameplay or fighting, this game has an impressive economy. It is awesome to see the trading and market value of the in game items, such as unusuals. \n\nOn top of that, this game has such a diverse and interesting community. There are tons of SFMs, videos, and so forth about this game. So many servers, including community, each with their own purposes. You can literally go to a server to have a casual fight, then turn around and be trading in another!\n\nNow, this game isn't perfect, and neither is the community. There are scammers, mic-spammers, and trolls that play this game. That's just a part of anything this big. But they are the ones that are giving this game such a bad reputation, and it's not true. There are tons of amazing and kind people I have met within this game, who are always there to help out and lend a hand.\n\nBe prepared to eventually start spending at least some money on this game.

partida.\n(Aparte del riesgo de encontrar jugadores toxicos)\n-Las partidas que juego (y acabo) en competitivo no me las cuenta, es decir no me figura en las estadísticas y tampoco me da experiencia.\n(Incluso ganando la partida)\n-Algunas armas están demasiado nerfeadas\n\nAhora lo bueno:\n-El juego tiene un montón de armas y te llevará tiempo decidir cual escoger\n-No es un pay to win\n-Es muy importante la colaboración en equipo en este juego\n-Hay nueve clases con un montón de historia detrás de ellos\n-Recibe actualizaciones constantemente (El juego es de 2007)\n-Es gratis\n-Te regala cosas por obtener logros y también por no hacer nada\n-Tiene mucho sentido del humor\n-No se toma en serio a si mismo\n-Tienes un montón de taunts para hacer cuando mates a alguien\n-Puedes bailar la conga\n-Tiene mucha variedad de modos\n-He dicho que era gratis?\n-Puedes cambiar objetos con gente (Imprescindible saber inglés)\n-El juego pide poco al PC.\n\nAhora los argumentos definitivos:\n-Un ruso con una minigun que se come un bocata para apagar el fuego\n-Un escocés borracho que vuela en pedazos todo a su alrededor y que se lanza a estampidas a por los enemigos con su katana\n-Un soldado que se dispara a los pies con su bazooka para volar\n-Un médico alemán que puede volver invencible (durante unos segundos) a quien le de la gana\n(Aparte de a si mismo)\n-Un joven que corre como jamaicano con problemas de agresividad que aparece a tu lado con una escopeta que te mata en dos segundos\n-Un ingeniero tejano que construye cosas que matan cosas que podrían provocar una guerra\n-Un señor que destroza las construcciones del anterior con zapadores que acaba con tus rachas apuñalandote por la espalda\n-Un francotirador australiano que apaga a la gente con su orina mientras vuela cabezas con su francotirador\n-Un tío raro que vive en su mundo homosexual mientras comete atrocidades quemado gente con su lanzallamas\n\nDefinitivamente el mejor
