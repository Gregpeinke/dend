What about the first Half-Life game then? It would stand to reason that such a creature existed, so there could be a sequel to it, yet it has been overshadowed by its successor to the point at which the first game became almost obscure. Frankly, it’s a shame because back in the 1998, when Half-Life was released, it had almost single-handedly shown the world that FPS genre can have a story to tell. The notion is almost absurd nowadays but back when the genre was synonymous with Doom and Quake, FPS stood for raw gameplay and a text panel at the end to sum up your exploits. Using it as a fundament for presenting a complete narrative which on top of that was integrated into the gameplay seemed almost daring. Coupled with innovations in graphics and AI, it had created a formula that many games strode towards in years to come. Today, the graphics are obviously dated and the level design is confusing but otherwise the game still holds up surprisingly well.\n\nIt came from outer reality\nHalf-Life tells a story of Gordon Freeman, a prospering physicist working at Black Mesa – a top-secret research facility capable of using sci-fi literature as schematics for their next project. The player takes control of the mute protagonist and soon steps into the iconic Hazardous EnVironment suit (abbreviated HEV) to join fellow scientists for work on the faithful day. The day when a single experiment gone horribly wrong made a tear in reality sizable enough to allow for an alien invasion. Alas, the quest begins amidst chaos and alien life forms rampaging through the facility. Most of you are well aware what that struggle had ultimately lead up to. Until then, Freeman’s chosen field of expertise had just become the ballistics and there will be dozens of test subjects just dying to further your research.\n\nThe extraterrestrial menace that player is about to face comes in many shapes and sizes, all equally deadly. Even the cat-sized headcrab is capable of turning their unfortunate victim into a zombified monstrosity. Much larger, acid-spewing bullsquid or water-faring ichthyosaur aren’t any more docile. Then there are deliberate invaders of Earth, the Vortigaunts capable of conjuring a lightning and their massive armoured counterparts, harassing the player with literal swarms of hornets. Then there are far more mundane enemies. Black Mesa survivors soon realise that the military relief force has arrived with orders to purge all life from the facility, alien or otherwise. This not only makes for a wide selection of enemies but also leads to encounters, where the player enters the middle of a fight between the two enemy factions, allowing for all kinds of tactical play.\n\nCrowbars per second\nHalf-life’s wide selection of enemies is matched by equally diverse arsenal at the player’s disposal. Chief among them – Gordon’s trademark crowbar. This rather exotic choice for “mandatory weak melee weapon”, as the nickname implies is only useful in early stages of the game. That said, it’s far more practical than most melee weapons in FPS games. Freeman is simply ludicrously agile with it, being fully capable of bashing with the thing 2 times per second – according to the HL wikia. The noise it makes while doing so just adds in on the absurdity, making whacking stuff with crowbar a go-to downtime activity between fights. Jokes aside, HL means of murder do start off easy with, FPS standard-issue buckshot and bullets but then just keep on adding. Soon there is a scoped crossbow, trip-mines, lasers and entirely unique armaments – Gluon gun, which produces a blue beam that vaporizes targets after short period of contact or Hivehand, an organic artifice capable of firing infinite swarm of hornets. It’s not called sci-fi for nothing. If that wasn’t enough, many weapons have some form of secondary fire mode for a good measure.\n\nPhysicists on ice\nDespite the game’s multiple strengths Half-Life is not all milk and honey. Title’s most glaring flaw is confusing level design. Half-Life is a mostly linear game, though it does allow a degree of exploration. That being said, perhaps “enforces” would be a more applicable word, as time and time again I was simply lost. Now, I would like to emphasise that I am not trying to criticise the game for not being linear. The issue is more complex and perhaps an example will picture it best. If you come across the door there are 3 options: it’s an obvious way forward, it’s a shortcut and the door opens from the other side or it’s a prop with no function at all. Except there is no text pan to tell these apart. Instead the game provides an immersive sensation of wandering around aimlessly. From this, parallels can be drawn to entire sections of the game – at times you can side-track to find extra supplies, and the other time you are supposed to side track, in order to turn a valve that clears an obstacle from the main road. The gnawing uncertainty soon sets in, since you could’ve missed an interactive key element at any point by simply not stepping off the beaten path.\n\nThen there are smaller things, such as Gordon being permanently on skates. The movement in HL is mind-bogglingly fast, to the point where the character keeps some of the momentum even after the player takes their hands off the keyboard, creating a “sliding” effect. While such rapid movement is very useful in combat, the game also has arcade-like platformer sections, where sliding is no longer welcome. Finally, there is a matter of bugs. Admittedly, whether they appear or not is a game of chance but Half-Life can get wonky when played on modern hardware. And I definitely lost that game. Every Ichthyosaur was going through a roid-rage, moving at double the usual speed and clipping through the environment – to the point when during the final battle it “jumped” out of the water and got stuck on the jumping pad. During the fight with Gonarch, the boss couldn’t be asked to transition to the last arena so I could end the fight. I had to literally breach the floor myself by stacking the explosives. Those are just the “highlights” of my HL run but the bugs truly inflated the feeling of confusion. There was no way of telling if it was me doing something wrong or the game.\n\nAll in all, Half-life has to be taken with a grain of salt. It was a fun ride and when the game worked as intended, it has done so really well. The title is extremely playable for its venerable age. Half-Life may be at its core a simple story about the otherworldly invaders but it created a framework that allowed to implement all of the best qualities that FPS genre had to offer and more. Diverse cast of enemies, wide variety of weapons, visually distinct environments, all falling into one coherent whole. Valve even went a step further and had given many elements of the game’s convention a logical explanation from in-universe perspective. The enemies spawn out of nowhere – because of the resonance cascade. The supplies are lying around – because Black Mesa fulfilled military contracts and required armed personnel to man expeditions into another universe. The devil is in the details and Half-Life sure has those covered. The expedition to Xen makes for a tremendous final act and even the aged, edgy look does not make a dent in how strange and utterly alien it appears. I highly recommend the game to anyone who enjoys the FPS genre. Half-Life is as forthcoming as a 20-year old game can possibly be and if you can’t stomach the game being a little rough around the edges, there is a Source port or modern reimaging in the form Black Mesa as perfect alternatives.","timestamp_created":1588348408,"timestamp_updated":1588348408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68371825","author":{"steamid":"76561198151699169","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":53,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1660491745},"language":"russian","review":"*Это классика, это знать надо!*\n\nХоть я и зумер, выросший на современных играх, эта игра мне очень зашла.

let the Steam stats fool you; I still own my copy of the Half-Life adrenaline pack, and that is how I regularly play the game and mods. I have the Steam version so I can play Echoes, the best Half-Life mod.\n\n22 years later, I can still remember downloading the Half-Life Uplink demo. Releasing an unused map is still the best approach to game demos I've ever seen. I booted the game up, and was blown away by the lighting, sound, and scripted effects that confronted me in the first 10 seconds. I had a world of NPCs engaging in complex tasks and dialogue alongside me. I had terrifying encounters with zombies and headcrabs in corridors, followed by combat with military grunts that constantly varied itself, from solving physics puzzles to lobbing grenades to using fixed gun positions. By the time I got to the end of Uplink, I knew there was nothing else as a kid I wanted more than Half-Life.\n\nIt really is the best game ever. All these years later the game, on OpenGL with max resolution and HD models, looks fantastic. The gameplay variation across chapters is incredible. The escaltion of difficulty and story immersion unparalleled. And I am proudly in the camp of people who found the Xen levels at the end an incredibly satisfying finish. I mean, I spent the whole game wondering, \"Who are these aliens? Where have they come from?\" And now I finally get my answer. The build-up is perfect and non-traditional: a gentle platformer to introduce alien physics mechanics, followed by a surprise boss battle (super fun), folllowed by a massive chapter full of strange alien culture and geography. The final boss battle is complex and very different from anything else I had played at the time.\n\nPlay Half-Life, and play Opposing Force. While Half-Life Source is nice, it's too glitching to be a proper successor, and while Black Mesa is incredibly fun, its gameplay is too different to be a replacement for Half-Life.

I would say not my type of game although I do see why people love this so much. It was way ahead of its time. Kind of reminds me of the first Serious Sam, which I liked a lot. I would be playing the second part to learn more about the mysterious organisation that hired the G-Man, and how do they posses such a power which many of the monsters don't. I think it is the mysteriousness of the story-line and the characters, along with the revolutionary game mechanics and Valve's source engine, (which lead to the creation of Counter Strike) that this game has flourished for so many years.","timestamp_created":1588270124,"timestamp_updated":1588270124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvtmR5vECcInNhAI="}
