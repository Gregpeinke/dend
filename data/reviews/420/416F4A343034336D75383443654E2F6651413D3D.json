E sim, é altamente recomendável que você tenha jogado todos os jogos da série anteriormente.\n\nNeste episódio, Alyx e Gordon conseguem fugir em segurança da Cidade 17, porém com a destruição da cidade, os Combines perderam o controle direto na humanidade, mas ao mesmo tempo, estão preparando um contra-ataque que poderá significar o fim de qualquer esperança. O jogo continua trazendo ótimas interações com a sidekick Alyx, além de alguns outros personagens que te acompanharão co mais frequência nessa jornada. O jogo é maior do que o episódio anterior, mas ainda assim, menor do que os jogos HL e HL2, porém, há algo aqui que não houve em nenhum outro jogo da série: Sendo este dividido em 7 capítulos, a cada transição acontece um grande evento que te deixará com os olhos grudados na tela e paralisado. Mas no fim das contas, o game termina com mais perguntas do que respostas, infelizmente.\n\nNo que diz respeito à qualidade técnica, não tem muito que adicionar além dos games anteriores: mesmas armas, um pequeno aperfeiçoamento nos gráficos, ótima trilha sonora que sobe nos momentos mais empolgantes, e os mesmos inimigos.\n\nNa verdade, existem novos cenários como minas, cavernas subterrâneas e florestas, além do retorno do carro. Além disso, há alguns poucos novos inimigos: Antilions cuspidores de ácido, e os terríveis Hunters. O jogo é repleto de ação do começo ao fim, e, diga-se de passagem, que a batalha final é simplesmente frenética e um tanto desafiadora.\n\nSendo assim, Half-Life 2: Episode 2 é um excelente game, e particularmente o meu favorito. A duração ainda meio curta e as repetições de inimigos e armas até podem ser desvantagens, mas ao olhar o saldo final, o que temos é mais um game no jogo do gênero imortalizado pela Valve.\n\nAgora é esperar pelo Gaben criar vergonha na cara e lançar o Episódio 3, ou o que muitos especulam, Half-Life 3.","timestamp_created":1438824903,"timestamp_updated":1438824903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.631627857685089111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17404986","author":{"steamid":"76561198003615799","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":244,"last_played":1377875274},"language":"english","review":"Half Life 3 is 100% Confirmed , don't worry guys!","timestamp_created":1438808746,"timestamp_updated":1438808746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17398465","author":{"steamid":"76561198055926820","num_games_owned":1401,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":615,"last_played":1558814990},"language":"czech","review":"(85% Hodnocení)\n\nHalf Life 2: Episode Two je docela rozdílná hra oproti předchozímu dílu (nečekaně episode one).\nZatímco první episoda byla taková krátká dvouhodinková záležitost, episoda 2 je skoro nová hra.\nSource engine byl vylepšen takže hra vypadá lépe (btw... na téhle verzi Source enginu běží většina novějších her od Valve), hratelnost odpovídá zhruba 10 hodinám (což je na fps hru dneska docela slušné), obsah úrovní je rozmanější takže se nebudete nudit a především super příběh, který tu nehodlám moc rozebírat ale když opomeneme jednu geografickou anomálii tak začíná v okamžik kdy končí episode one.\n\n+ solidní grafické zpracování\n+ kvalitní příběh\n+ vcelku dlouhá hratelnost bez stereotypu\n+ dobré OST\n+ velká změna v prostředí (z depresivního city 17 se přemístíte do přírody)\n= stále stejné zbraně jako minule\n- v autě chybí držák na kafé/trpajzlíka :)\n- otevřený konec... \n\nKdyž to shrneme...

As a note, I played the entirety of Half-Life 2 through from the beginning and am reviewing the entirety of the series here, not just Episode 2.\n\nRight out of the gate, you're on guard duty. I hate escort missions. You spend the whole game with Alyx Vance three feet behind you, causing me to wish I could shoot her, and whenever you try, you end up with much the same results as Resident Evil 4. Mainly my annoyance with Alyx came whenever I tried to move a bunch of barrels and crates to create make-shift barriers. She just gets in the way and constantly knocks the object you're holding out of your hands. At least in Resident Evil 4 you could tell Ashley Graham to get out of your face and go hide in a steel trunk. Next, I don't understand first-person shooters that end in a final challenge which involves DRIVING (I.E. Halo & Halo 3). Finally, if you actually manage to make it past the last driving segment, you're treated to an even more poorly written end-game scenario than Blue-Shift, made even worse by the fact that it doesn't look like we'll ever get Half-Life 3, or even Episode 3. And no, I don't mean the cliff-hanger ending; all Half-Life entries end on a cliff-hanger. I could see that coming from a parallel universe away. No, the game-play ITSELF is unsatisfying in the final level.

If you look at the store page: Half-Life® 2: Episode Two is the second in a trilogy of new games created by Valve that extends the award-winning and best-selling Half-Life® adventure. Yet 8 years after its release, neither HL2:E3 nor HL3 was announced and this just leaves us at a cliffhanger..... forever. There were things mentioned in HL2:E2 which were meant to be the main objective in the next installment and also characters who were undeveloped, such as G-man. And now, after a few hours, I'm actually sad. I enjoyed the Half Life series too much to let it end like this.\n\nAs for the review proper, HL2:E2 continues shortly after the series of events in E1. Its gameplay is nearly the same as in E1 but with a much more interesting finale. It has the same, awesome voice acting, weapons, and also addressed the one negative I had for E1: Freeman gets his crowbar much earlier in the game! :)\n\nThe game length is roughly 5 hours, where as HL, HL2 and HL2:E1 took me 14, 14 and 4 hours respectively. This is rather pricey and I definitely recommend getting The Orange Box for a better deal.\n\n3/3.

The game is alot shorter than any other I THINK. Not sure if it is though. But it's as long as it needs to be. It makes you do things not to slap on an hour of gameplay but to progress the story. So yeah, you can beat it in an hour, but thats all the time it needs. The enviroment is refreshing after 5 games taking place either in black mesa, city 17 or a beach. It's my favorite so it's gotta be 9/10.","timestamp_created":1436797000,"timestamp_updated":1436797000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17022839","author":{"steamid":"76561198087878951","num_games_owned":806,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":1192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1192,"last_played":1436358854},"language":"tchinese","review":"本作都玩了，續作沒道理不玩w","timestamp_created":1436771216,"timestamp_updated":1436771216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17007914","author":{"steamid":"76561198138699188","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1435860773},"language":"english","review":"Lord Gaben, why do you leave us with this cliffhanger","timestamp_created":1436699962,"timestamp_updated":1436699962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17007460","author":{"steamid":"76561198015904962","num_games_owned":1523,"num_reviews":85,"playtime_forever":284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1436601585},"language":"russian","review":"Half-Life 2: Episode Two\n\nВторой эпизод заканчивает Half-Life 2, но не серию.
