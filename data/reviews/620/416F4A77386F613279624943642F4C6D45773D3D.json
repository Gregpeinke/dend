Absolutely a MUST. I didn't enjoy a game like this one for a very long time.

Dialogs are funny, sometimes you feel yourself like beeing inside a Pixar's film. Music is awesome (don't miss the ending piece). A very pleasant experience. If you are fed up of killing zombies or whatever else boring game, you deserve yourself a good time.
