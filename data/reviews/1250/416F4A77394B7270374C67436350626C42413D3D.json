В основе обеих игр лежит одна и та же идея: борьба команды вооруженных людей с напирающими отовсюду зомби. Правда, по сравнению с хитом от Valve детище Tripwire выглядит неряшливым и потасканным, зато в нем есть прокачка персонажей, зомби-невидимки и товарно-денежные отношения.  \nКак все начиналось?\n\nKilling Floor выросла из любительской модификации Unreal Tournament 2004. Поэтому говорить о заимствовании идей у Left 4 Dead не приходится – концепцию командного зомби-шутера создатели игры выработали сами. В прошлом году они обратились в студию Tripwire Interactive с предложением включить их творение в качестве мода в шутер Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45. Однако руководство компании сочло Killing Floor достаточно перспективным для превращения в самостоятельную игру. \nО чем это?\n\nИ успей эта игра появиться до Left 4 Dead, отзывы могли бы быть куда восторженнее. Просто сейчас нам есть с чем сравнивать. Суть Killing Floor заключается в борьбе группы из шести человек против монстров-зомби, которые заполонили улицы Лондона в результате неудачного правительственного эксперимента. Для истребления нежити солдаты используют огнестрельное оружие и бензопилы, причем со временем каждый боец приобретает определенную специализацию. Правда, сами герои совершенно безлики – до колоритной команды Left 4 Dead им бесконечно далеко. \nКак играется?\n\nВпрочем, в разгар яростной схватки, когда уши закладывает от рева и визга, о характерных чертах персонажей думаешь в последнюю очередь. Голову, как правило, занимают куда более простые мысли: как пробиться через стену наседающей кровожадной плоти и где, черт возьми, друзья-напарники! Довести страсти до точки кипения помогают два в общем-то простых решения. Авторы убрали прицел, а перезарядку сделали нарочито неторопливой. В итоге – пока виртуальный герой мучительно долго возится с новой обоймой на той стороне экрана, холодный пот и дрожь начинают пробирать игрока на этой.\n\nКроме огнестрельного оружия в арсенале бойцов есть старая добрая бензопила. Тот, кто пользуется ею достаточно часто, со временем становится настоящим берсеркером. А вот самый меткий стрелок приобретает звание снайпера. По такому принципу – чем больше практики, тем лучше результат – развиваются все шесть видов способностей, дающих преимущества при использовании того или иного оружия.  \nКак выглядит?\n\nВыглядят разборки с мертвечиной, мягко говоря, неоднозначно. Видно, что авторы старались придать игре пристойный вид, но движок Unreal Engine 2.5 все равно не дотягивает до современных стандартов. Ну а раздражающе красный уродливый интерфейс вкупе с отталкивающими задниками и вовсе оправдать ничем нельзя – здесь разработчики допустили явный и грубый просчет. Вдобавок игра умудряется периодически подвисать, запуская тем самым своеобразную лотерею: если вам повезет, вы продолжите бой, если нет – отправитесь изучать детали рабочего стола Windows.\nЧто еще любопытного?\n\nКроме оружия ближнего и дальнего боя, у каждого игрока имеется портативный сварочный аппарат. С его помощью наглухо блокируются двери, хотя это, конечно, не панацея. Тем не менее сварочные работы дают дополнительный повод для слаженной работы отряда. Пока один игрок возится с дверьми, другие его прикрывают. Стандартные правила командных шутеров тоже никто не отменял. Держаться ближе к товарищам, занимать круговую оборону – без всего этого просто не выжить в Killing Floor. К тому же нужно делиться деньгами и лечить друг друга.\n\nТаким образом, в своем жанре проект занимает далеко не последнее место. Однако оригинальность концепции, когда-то казавшаяся благом, обернулась для Killing Floor проклятьем. Чрезмерная близость с вышедшей ранее Left 4 Dead навсегда усадила проект Tripwire на скамью запасных.\n\nПлюсы\n\n    Хорошо реализованы принципы командной игры\n    Интересная задумка с прокачкой и специализацией персонажей\n    Попадаются любопытные разновидности зомби\n\nМинусы\n\n    Устаревшая графика и жуткий интерфейс\n    Нельзя играть за зомби\n    Killing Floor – это не Left 4 Dead","timestamp_created":1344978986,"timestamp_updated":1420682652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1970652","author":{"steamid":"76561198000428010","num_games_owned":478,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":1167,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1167,"last_played":1324886400},"language":"english","review":"It was something new and interesting at the time of the L4D craze so I guess the zombie connection was what drew most people it to.

A Hell popluated by yourself, your team mates, a cold hearted Bitch who will sell you guns, The Zeds ( no zombies here my friends, these are Mad experiments ) and The Patriarch ( who is the madman behind this whole thing ). This game is glorious fun if you like blowing the shit out of creative and intimidating enemies, but remember, TEAM WORK is key! I personally love this game, and if you have some patience, a love of First Person Shooters, and nerves of diamond, then pick up a gun and shoot yourself some Zeds! You'll love it too.","timestamp_created":1343754142,"timestamp_updated":1343754142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517045438289642334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2275050","author":{"steamid":"76561198004996464","num_games_owned":483,"num_reviews":107,"playtime_forever":1437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1055,"last_played":1373733588},"language":"russian","review":"Довольно интересный ко-оп шутер, хотя не без недостатков.
