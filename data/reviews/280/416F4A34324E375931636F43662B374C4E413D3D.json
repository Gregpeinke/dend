The A.I. is really good and the enemies are challenging to defeat, especially the marines. Black Mesa is a delightful post-apocolayptic base that is a lot larger than initially expected. The voice acting is a little hoakey but it gives the game a more narritve feeling that was unique at the time. The sound effects are impressive and the enemies are well-designed.

The classic base game is the same and nothing from the original has been left out. Half-Life: Source just makes use of Valve's newer proprietary Source engine since the original Half-Life was built on and ran on the Goldsrc engine.\n\nThere are some noticeable differences in the game being ported over to use the Source engine and most of the improvements are to the graphics, textures and effects. Most areas do not have a significant and obvious amount of refurbishing but I observed the following areas of improvement.\n\nFirstly, the weapons appear more slick such as a more smooth edged and shiny crowbar which is a nice touch but nothing radical. The next graphical improvements that are noticeable would be things like the water effects which make the water ripples and flow look and feel a lot more realistic. The overall texture of everything in the game has been slightly or greatly improved on. Since the game is using the Source engine you will find the title menu has been changed to reflect the new engine which feels like Half-Life 2's main title menu.\n\nThe whole point of this version of Half-Life is to showcase the original classic in its glorious transition from the original Goldsrc engine to the newer Source engine. This is the reason why the original Half-Life's multiplayer component is left out because if you want to play the multiplayer aspect of the game then the original is what it's intended for.\n\nOne area of Half-Life: Source which appears to mildly hinder the experience are the loading screens. There are frequent, and sometimes considerably long loading screens. The original Half-Life had some loading screens which were very short but Half-Life: Source seems to have them at regular intervals and with quite a delay. I'm guessing this issue is mainly to do with the new engine adopted for the game. However, if you can put up with this then the game is still brilliant and this will not really be anything of significant concern.\n\nI've noticed quite a few negative comments for this version of Half-Life and they state that things in the game are broken such as helicopter hit boxes. This is actually incorrect because I haven't had any difficulties with taking down helicopters in the Dam level and other levels. You just need to be aware of the right tactics.\n\nOverall, the game is essentially the same as the original with a nice polish and I have also reviewed the original Half-Life on Steam so checking that review out will provide complementary views on this game as well. If you've played Half-Life (original) on Steam or elsewhere then playing Half-Life: Source isn't really necessary. The only reason you would play it is out of curiosity like me and because it is a fairly short game.
