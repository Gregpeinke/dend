It's not a \"bad\" game, it just isn't an investement. It's a throw-away.\n\nAs far as the game is concerned there's nothing really fundamentally flawed about it. It's not broken in any technical sense. It does provide entertainment. It does looks nice. So on and so on.\n\nUnfortunately, I completed it in one sitting of ~82 minutes, playing casually. So yes it's short. But short games can still be great. This however isn't one of those because, there is no replay value (short of hunting a grand total of 15 achievements). Really there's only one way to finish a level; so once the puzzle is solved, it's solved. There aren't really any easter eggs, no multiplayer, no alternate endings, nothing to make me want to come back to it.\n\nEven among all the positive reviews for Portal, the average game time is much LESS than 10 hours.\n\nMy recommendation: find a friend who has it, play it and be done with it. Alternatively, Steam has so many sales on many other games that provide much better bang for buck in terms of value, all the time. You won't miss much having this curious but forgettable item in your library.\n\n---EDIT--- I would like to state that at the time I wrote this, the full price was USD$20, which was the point of my review. It's a game everyone should experience, but it wasn't worth the full price considering the amount of, or lack of content that the average player would experience (which you can see from all the other reviews is only a few hours with the exception of some who managed almost 30).\n\nThe game is now 10$ which is better, but even then I would wait for a sale. It's not a reflection of the games technical quality, but rather the value of entertainment to cost when compared to other games availabe which provide much better ratio.\n\nEither way, thanks for reading!\n---/EDIT---","timestamp_created":1415929437,"timestamp_updated":1474770548,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.461381405591964722","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12931314","author":{"steamid":"76561198095310040","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":687,"last_played":1631991338},"language":"english","review":"Somewhat difficult, lovable character.

Pobaví vás jejím černým humorem, i její zajímavé úrovně, s kterýma vás bude doprovázet hlas Super-Počítačo-Robota GLaDOS. Začneme příběhem. Probutíte se v \"Aperture Science Enrichment Center\", kde vám hlas GLaDOS říká, co budete dělat, co tu děláte, a proč tu jste. Protože GLaDOS miluje testy, tak vám jich dá 19.\n\nSamozřejmě by jste to nezvládli, kdyby vám GLaDOS nedala zařízení s názvem \"Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\", které spousta lidí zná jako Portal Gun. Co s ním můžete dělat? Jak už název napověděl, Portál! A dokonce dva. V prvních testech máte možnost střílet pouze modrý, ale pak vám GLaDOS dá těžší testy, ve kterém budete muset používat i oranžový.\n\nProč ale děláte ty testy? GLaDOS vám totiž slibuje dort. Takže jakmile budete u posledního testu, tak vám slibuje, že vám ho dá. Což nakonec nebyla pravda, a chce vás zabít! Co teď dělat? Snažte se utéct z této laboratoře, a doufat, že to přežijete.\n\nVe hře nenajdete žádného jiného člověka, tím pádem jste tam jenom vy. Jste sám, v jedné velké laboratoři. Atmosféra je perfektní, a to nejen díky skvělému soundtracku, který se stal jeden z mých nejoblíbenějších, ale i díky tomu, že jedinou věc kterou ve hře potkáte, jsou věžičky a kostky. Pak zde najdete vašeho jediného přítele, Companion Cube.\n\nCelková hra je krátká, což nevadí, protože vás určitě zabaví. Černý humor GLaDOS, atmosféra hry, logické úrovně, a různé bonusy typu: těžší úrovně, dohraj úroveň pod 1 minutu nebo vystřel co nejméne portálů, vám poskytnou jednu z nejlepších logických her na světě.\n\nProstě, a jednodušše...\nVýborná logická hra, s nejlepšími hláškami v herní historii, a povedenými logickými úrovněmi.\n\n[b] [u] Klady [/u] [/b]\n◘ Soundtrack\n◘ Hratelnost\n◘ Příběh\n◘ Komunita\n◘ Jednoduchá mechanika, která neomrzí\n\n[b] [u] Zápory [/u] [/b]\n◘ Poměrně krátká dějová linie\n\n[b] [u] Hodnocení [/u] [/b]\nZa větu: \"Udělám ještě jednu místnost a končím.\" 95/100\n\n[i] Cake is a LIE![/i]","timestamp_created":1415439734,"timestamp_updated":1492297108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505358576774597168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12839462","author":{"steamid":"76561198025459565","num_games_owned":1092,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3472,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game.

If there's one complaint about Portal it's that, yes, it's a bit short even if for $10 but it's not like you aren't gettiing your entertainment/experience value and its chock full of special features for further insight if that's your sorta thing (it is to me!)\n\nOne complaint that might not bother others but sorta bothered me - again because I'm comparing it to 2 instead of vice versa - is that the game wastes no time piling complexity at you versus in #2 how it could often blend world building and exploration more frequently. It's a case of tight budgeting vs. free property reign but I feel it should be addressed.\n\nAll in all, Portal again cements Valve's rep at never offering inept neurally challenged games.
