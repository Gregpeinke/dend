No matter how many remakes or engine updates it gets, this is how the original fans experienced it for the first time.\n2. I have never played the original. I've only ever played Half-Life 2 and it's respective (sequels/expansions/addons/dlc/part of Half-Life 3/Half-Life 4 beta)\n\nI beat Half-Life in a night, within in roughly 6 hours. Here is my Stance:\n\nAs an already late fan into the series with Half-Life 2, it of course is odd to backtrack 6 years in engines and graphics. Although I like good games, so this did not bother me. TL:DR, the game is incredible. For a game almost 20 years old, it truly stands the test of time. \n\nIt does have some faults that can be easily overlooked. First being is being an old FPS, it's difficult even on \"Normal\" difficulty. I found about 2 bugs in the game. 1 being where I would be stuck in place and \"noclip\" wouldn't even work. So I would have to reload my save, this happened twice. But if you're a longtime pc FPS player, you shouldn't have problems doing that if you quicksave like a fat kid on cake. And the other being right before you *SPOILER* encounter covert ops, the game would crash, this was just trial and error, again twice, by just reloading. \n\nThe game is a masterpiece, buy it for sure as this summer sale is going on. Buy it if the summer sale isn't. It's truly a piece of history and art that should be experienced.","timestamp_created":1434187944,"timestamp_updated":1434187944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16351657","author":{"steamid":"76561198031966169","num_games_owned":879,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":569,"last_played":1468652479},"language":"english","review":"Without any doubt in my mind, I can recommend this game to anyone.\nIt is simply amazing.

Все вымерено насколько тонко и идеально,что прям хорошо. \n\nСюжет\nДа он есть, и самое прекрасное, что вы и есть сюжет. Тут нет киношных вставок (кроме одной), все остальное вы сами путешествуете и воссоздаете сюжет.  Если коротко, мы играем за молчаливого физика Гордона Фримана, который на научной станции Черная Меза участвует в эксперименте, как вы понимаете неудачно. Потусторонний мир прорывается к нам, и тут начинается экшен.\n\nГрафика\nДаже сейчас, не смотря на угловатость, несмотря на старую морально графику, в игре можно провести и залипнуть не один вечер и перепройти её пару тройку раз. Она обладает атмосферой и это круто.\n\nГеймплей\nНе так уж прост, тут есть интересные механики. Но по сути это шутер, но эталонный.\n\nЗвук\nМне везде понравился.

But it shouldn't be a big deal.\n\nOther than that. If you want to play the game that started it all. Get. This. Game. I highly recommend it!","timestamp_created":1434135905,"timestamp_updated":1434135905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":117,"votes_funny":24,"weighted_vote_score":"0.871695280075073242","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16336294","author":{"steamid":"76561198067156604","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":102,"last_played":1617235154},"language":"english","review":"I heard of this game far and wide. Great gameplay, they said. Gripping story, they said. A truly outstanding masterpiece of a game. Finally, during the early days of the 2015 summer sale, I bought the entire series. Then, to my dismay, the game gave me a black screen. \"Surely,\" I thought, \"this must just be loading. After all, my laptop isn't that powerful.\" But the minutes ticked away, and eventually I hit ctrl+alt+del to see if it was working. Alas, \"HL is not responding.\" I closed the program. \"A bit of bad luck,\" I assured myself. \"THIS time, it will work.\" Despite my hopes, I was again confronted with a black screen, and again I was forced to manually close it. Again and again, I tried to open this game, and each time I failed. I could not believe that the centerpiece of my favorite game company could not even properly load itself.

This game also added a bit of realism to shooters compared to the previous games of the 90s, no more floating guns, a more realistic progression rather than level by level and hunting for keys to open doors. The gameplay also shifts and changes throughout the game, at the beginning you only have a crowbar and a handgun and you’ll mostly be fighting monsters in a horror-ish style, later you get your hands on more weapons being; a shotgun, a machinegun, a magnum and some grenades as the game becomes more action oriented as the soldiers show up, and the game changes again as the alien soldiers show up and you get your hands on more weapons; a rocket launcher, and some original weapons in the game (being energy weapons)  it changes yet again as you go onto the alien planet. The game also changes pace quite a fair bit since the game will sometimes throw a platforming section or a puzzle at you after gunfights. \n\nThough being a so called great game of all time Half-life does have a number of issues: \n\nThe melee combat: all gold source engine games have terrible melee combat since you have to be so close to hit anything but this is a shooter so this isn’t a big deal unlike some other gold source engine games. \n\nThe shooting isn't very good since enemies don't react to getting shot at all, so there's no stunning them when shooting at them, and you can also peek around coners so you can see the enemy's hands, and then just shoot their hands until they die, which is pretty stupid and just cheating. To me this is kind of weird, since the gold source engine is basically the quake 1 engine, and in quake 1, all of the enemies get stunned when shot apart from the wampa/yeti things which are meant to be bullet sponges.\n\nAlso the fall damage is very over exaggerated and this is really annoying during some of the platforming sections, and the ladders, the ladders in this game are very clunky, because you feel like a magnet stuck to them and you usually detach from them and fall right down to the bottom. \n\nThe game does also get boring for two reasons: \n\nReason no1: there is no music for the most part which was to add to the emersion, however it does get boring after while listening to nothing but your own footsteps. \n\nReason no2: Some of the sections in this game drag on, and on, and on.\n\nThere are also some game breaking bugs, thank god for the existance of NOCLIP.\n\nAt the time this was groundbreaking but today it's an ok game but it just hasn't aged very well, to the point where I sometimes call it half-S H I T E. Still better than half life 2 though.","timestamp_created":1433707488,"timestamp_updated":1512139430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16243366","author":{"steamid":"76561198116470953","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1515,"last_played":1630335667},"language":"hungarian","review":"Ajálom mindenkinek a \"HALF-LIFE\" egy ojan játék ami végulis jó :) el voltam vele grafika nagyon jó az évéhez sok jo pillanat volt bene néhol viccesis nekem meg fogot ez a szkifis története nagyon Jó volt köszönöm a játékok Valve-nak","timestamp_created":1433689023,"timestamp_updated":1433689023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16241283","author":{"steamid":"76561198024246523","num_games_owned":383,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":710,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":610,"last_played":1448591943},"language":"english","review":"An absolute classic.","timestamp_created":1433681229,"timestamp_updated":1433681229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16236965","author":{"steamid":"76561198033516173","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1435146768},"language":"english","review":"I remember playing this gem when it was on console.

did not grow up with this game or FPS's from this era; the only problem I have with it are Freeman's unreasonably fast and imprecise movements. They were annoying and frustrating to someone like me who's used to more accuracy. Very good game game otherwise though. I especially enjoyed the amount of strategy involved. You can't just run-and-gun your way through it like a lot of shooters.\n\n9/10\n\n[b]For those of you who have not played Half-Life[/b]\nIf you're like me you've heard a lot of things about this game. Primarily, how great it is and how the community has been waiting over a decade for the third instalment. Both are very true. After playing through the series I have this to say: if you are willing to join the rest of us in this agonizing wait, play this game. If not, know that it is worth all the hype and leave it alone.
