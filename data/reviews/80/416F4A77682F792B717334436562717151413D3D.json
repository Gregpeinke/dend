No doubt it has given me fun. I played pirated version for years and I feel shame playing pirated version so I have bought it. The original CS is already fun and addictive enough, making me stuck to the computer and play with players overseas and of course with my friends. That's how I think about CS.\n\nHowever, CZ presented a mission mode which make it differs from the original CS. The official mission pack Tour of Duty is boring to me, really boring. Deleted Scenes is great for its content however. The graphics in CZ have really improved, even I don't like the improvements.\n\nI would still recommend this, as this improved graphics compared to the original CS.","timestamp_created":1439214541,"timestamp_updated":1439214541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17472507","author":{"steamid":"76561198146478487","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":853,"last_played":1428424302},"language":"russian","review":"Даже несмотря на сильно устаревшую даже на момент выхода графическую составляющую и отсутствие связующей сюжетной линии между миссиями, CS:CZ Deleted Scenes благодаря портированной прямо из оригинального Counter-Strike шутерной механике и скопированным из самого первого Half-Life паттернам поведения бойцов играется гораздо бодрее своего прямого конкурента из 2015 года -

Deleted Scenes plays more like a conventional single-player FPS while Tour of Duty retains most of the multiplayer experience. It is worth noting that Condition Zero does come with multiplayer matchmaking as well.\n\nTour of Duty has you play traditional Counter Strike matches on each of the 1.6 maps. To win, you must win at least 3 rounds with a 2 round lead, and complete certain \"challenges\" including stuff like \"Get X kills with [certain weapon]\" and \"Rescue 4 hostages\". Each map you complete gets you a \"reputation point\" that you can use to choose which bots you want on your team. Each has differing stats (Skill, Co-op, and Bravery), and a different preferred weapon. This creates some fun decision making even before entering a match. Do you make a team with only a few strong, but expensive bots? Or do you get a full team of weaker ones? There are also plenty of tradeoff bots with high stats or weapons, but have notable weaknesses. For example: the \"Maverick\" bot is the cheapest one with high skill and high bravery, but he also has low co-op, meaning that he'll generally ignore you and do his own thing. Another example is \"Alex\", who has an AWP, and good skill and co-op, but bad bravery. This means that he will run away from certain situations like 1v1s. While the core that makes 1.6 so beloved is already here, the team-building that Tour of Duty introduces makes this game surprisingly fun for solo play.\n\nSince this runs on CS 1.6, all of the jankiness comes with it. The hostage maps were particularly annoying since you have to somehow get all 4 to follow you back to your spawn without getting stuck on anything for a round win (besides just killing the enemy team, but usually for a map completion one of the challenges will be to rescue 4 total hostages). You also better make sure to buy a defusal kit on defuse maps because your bots won't.\n\nThe deleted scenes portion of the game doesn't hold up as well IMO. It plays more like custom Half-Life maps than CS, as you're fighting through linear levels instead of CS matches. There's no overarching story, instead each mission has it's own self-contained \"story\". Story is a strong word though because for the most part it's just an excuse for you to go somewhere exotic and shoot terrorists in the face. Any sense of grounded realism that the regular CS games portray is completely gone here. The premises of these missions feel much more like B movies with all the cheese that entails. People who enjoy those will likely get a kick out of these missions, but others will be disappointed. \n\nAnother note, playing hard mode isn't fun at all in deleted scenes. Due to your limited health and the unnatural reflexes of the bots, it feels more like a memorization game than anything remotely resembling fair. Also making matters worse is that the second mission is a major difficulty spike for no good reason (the next few levels aren't nearly as bad). I'd only recommend picking hard if A: You want to get really good at CS 1.6 (aiming and reflexes), or B: You're a masochist.\n\nIf you're interested in playing CS 1.6, but don't want to deal with people who have been playing 1.6 since 2000, or want to play maps that aren't Dust II, then I recommend this game. I would buy it for the Tour of Duty, but not the Deleted Scenes. You can get an arguably better experience just playing custom Half-Life maps (free downloads online or Sven Coop). Both of Condition Zero's offerings aren't too long, but the bundled CS 1.6 should give you a lot of bang for your buck if you're looking for retro CS.","timestamp_created":1437611464,"timestamp_updated":1638919013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17171228","author":{"steamid":"76561198165256294","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1434976920},"language":"russian","review":"Nice game","timestamp_created":1437564764,"timestamp_updated":1437564764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17166148","author":{"steamid":"76561198170652094","num_games_owned":406,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":1032,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":23,"last_played":1505077788},"language":"english","review":"Better than 1.6, lower than GO, this game is fucking awesome! :)","timestamp_created":1437530791,"timestamp_updated":1437530791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17156784","author":{"steamid":"76561198168850130","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":98,"last_played":1441298835},"language":"russian","review":"Игра - Легенда\n10/10","timestamp_created":1437486987,"timestamp_updated":1437486987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17144639","author":{"steamid":"76561198001365451","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Awesome game!
