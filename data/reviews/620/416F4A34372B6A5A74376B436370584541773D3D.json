El multijudador cooperativo añade unas cuantas horas de campaña y con el editor puedes desatar toda tu creatividad para compartirla con la comunidad.","timestamp_created":1346620045,"timestamp_updated":1346620045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6542730","author":{"steamid":"76561198068607246","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":2063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":268,"last_played":1643568130},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom o work shop","timestamp_created":1346617036,"timestamp_updated":1346617036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5512507","author":{"steamid":"76561198051067041","num_games_owned":670,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1103,"last_played":1414704794},"language":"english","review":"Get this game, it's awesome!","timestamp_created":1346612791,"timestamp_updated":1346612791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6333243","author":{"steamid":"76561198064001533","num_games_owned":416,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":878,"last_played":1346655600},"language":"english","review":"It's the best logical game I have ever played.","timestamp_created":1346610896,"timestamp_updated":1346610896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2620722","author":{"steamid":"76561198010146696","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1986,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1236,"last_played":1644840778},"language":"english","review":"A game for any valve fan","timestamp_created":1346596247,"timestamp_updated":1346596247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5515331","author":{"steamid":"76561198051120683","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1979,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1554,"last_played":1502552083},"language":"german","review":"sehr, wirklich SEHR gut.","timestamp_created":1346552930,"timestamp_updated":1346552930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4469678","author":{"steamid":"76561198037655103","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1147,"last_played":1425424070},"language":"brazilian","review":"Eu diria que o primeiro jogo da série é mais uma versão beta desta perfeita sequência, mas com certeza eu recomendaria que fosse jogado antes deste.

The storyline of Portal 2 is one which will keep you playing, as during the middle of the game, a huge shock happens which I wont spoil, but I just had to see what happens next. The singleplayer isn't the only part of Portal 2 however, the all new Co Op mode lasted around 10 hours itself, which lacked storyline but was still alot of more than the Singleplayer as you had to work with someone else, which worked really slick and smoothly (especially the ping tool, that was just great), the Co Op mode also comes equipped with the Robot Enrichment micro transactions store, kind of like the Man Co Store in TF2, this adds purely costmic customizations for your Co Op character, whch I think is a really good addition to the game for those people who have spare money to spend.","timestamp_created":1346474785,"timestamp_updated":1398060708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5225059","author":{"steamid":"76561198046637993","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":11782,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11562,"last_played":1659303575},"language":"english","review":"it has hats","timestamp_created":1346458484,"timestamp_updated":1635922575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"688575","author":{"steamid":"76561197975538232","num_games_owned":401,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1943,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1348,"last_played":1653143221},"language":"english","review":"Thinking with portals is always the rule, never the exception!","timestamp_created":1346454380,"timestamp_updated":1346454380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5356203","author":{"steamid":"76561198048433527","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":5500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5277,"last_played":1577187571},"language":"russian","review":"Все ломаем голову также, как и я!!","timestamp_created":1346418366,"timestamp_updated":1346418366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499972552061080933","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6588578","author":{"steamid":"76561198069785458","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3356,"last_played":1645377309},"language":"german","review":"Das Spiel ist der HAMMER!!!","timestamp_created":1346408311,"timestamp_updated":1346408311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6243473","author":{"steamid":"76561198061984399","num_games_owned":627,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":505,"last_played":1467062376},"language":"english","review":"Коператив на высоте","timestamp_created":1346397968,"timestamp_updated":1346397968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.647880375385284424","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6381389","author":{"steamid":"76561198065057583","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1346655600},"language":"english","review":"Okay, for those who haven't played Portal?
