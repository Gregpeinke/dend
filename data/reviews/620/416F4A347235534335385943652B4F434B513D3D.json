Gráficos excelentes, animaciones espectaculares y diálogos ''hermosos''. Te compenetras con la historia, es muy atrapante, o por lo menos para mi gusto lo es. También es muy gracioso, GLaDOS es una de las mejores cosas del juego, sus repetidos intentos de matarte hacen aún mas atrapante la historia, aunque no lo crean. El extra que termina de completar el juego es la canción de los títulos cuando lo terminás. Es simplemente genial escuchar a un personaje (que no quiero nombrar por no hacer spoiler) diciéndote todas esas cosas en una canción.\n\nRESUMEN:\n\nGráficos: Excelentes (Incluyendo animaciones y el ''diseño'')\nHistoria: PERFECTA y ATRAPANTE\nPuzzles: Muy difíciles y entretenidos. MUY BUENOS\n''Narración'': Para mi una de las cosas que le da esa ''esencia'' al juego es la ''narración'' de GLaDOS\nCO-OP: Excelente, muchas herramientas para ''comunicarse'' con el compañero. Puzzles MUY complicados, que es otro PRO e incluye modo pantalla dividida.\nEditor de Mapas: Bueno. Es un poco complicado hacer mapas, si bien no tiene herramientas complicadas de usar no es nada fácil hacer mapas, pero si uno se toma el tiempo suficiente y se esfuerza se logran mapas hasta mejores que los que incluye el juego, eso lo pueden comprobar en el workshop.\n\nNota: 9.50 - 10\n(Mi Opinión)","timestamp_created":1403649895,"timestamp_updated":1403649895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10773460","author":{"steamid":"76561198103525554","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1428,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":455,"last_played":1428619741},"language":"english","review":"Great game.

One of the best games I've ever played. Takes the brilliance and innovation of the original Portal and expands on it into a fully-fledged title. Maintains an extremely high standard of writing from start to finish. Characters are hilarious. Gameplay is original. Fantastic atmosphere. Puzzles are challenging but not frustatingly so. Valve never fails to impress and Portal 2 is no exception.","timestamp_created":1403642206,"timestamp_updated":1480157973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580152690410614014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10768193","author":{"steamid":"76561198015290928","num_games_owned":192,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":314,"last_played":1623181951},"language":"russian","review":"Просто шедевр!","timestamp_created":1403640110,"timestamp_updated":1403640110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10767946","author":{"steamid":"76561198095369817","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":34,"last_played":1506057867},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely amazing game, one of the best I've ever played.","timestamp_created":1403639656,"timestamp_updated":1403639656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10767840","author":{"steamid":"76561197992439954","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1051,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":906,"last_played":1447543876},"language":"english","review":"One of the best made games on Steam!","timestamp_created":1403639482,"timestamp_updated":1403639482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10767837","author":{"steamid":"76561197995773186","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1027,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1027,"last_played":1402002299},"language":"dutch","review":"Deze co-op is goud!","timestamp_created":1403639474,"timestamp_updated":1403639474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10767677","author":{"steamid":"76561198111129204","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":4516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2409,"last_played":1529164991},"language":"dutch","review":"One of the best games ive ever played the story line is very deep if you have played still alive (the first one) and the humor is absolutley brilliant its awesome how they made a game so serious and funny at the same time this is one of those games that you can keep replaying without ever getting bored of it","timestamp_created":1403639211,"timestamp_updated":1403639211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10766815","author":{"steamid":"76561198053652124","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":548,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":545,"last_played":1412638067},"language":"spanish","review":"El juego se define en solo una palabra, Excelente.
