Almost everything is a step up from the original in this long awaited sequel, although it can be said that the game has a much different feel to it. That said, mechanically the game is far improved, especially with the gunplay. In fact, I would go as far as saying that Half-Life 2 has some of the best gunplay in any single player story driven FPS game ever. While games like BioShock Infinite have great stories and decent gameplay, Half-Life 2 has a fantastic story with gameplay of the same quality. \n\nTwo things that makes Half-Life 2 stand out above all games of its type is the excellent attention to detail and carefully designed gameplay. While I would definitely call Half-Life 2 an action packed game, there are certainly many quiet moments where you will be exploring new environments or solving a puzzle. These moments break up the action sequences and make the pacing amazing. Valve also does a great job of making each chapter unique, with every one introducing a new mechanic or a twist on an old one. All of this means that the player will never be bored; whether they are controlling an army of ant lions in an abandoned prison or cruising along a highway, Half-Life 2 is always a good time.\n\nDespite its age, Half-Life 2 is still a pinnacle of game design and offers some of the best moments in the modern gaming industry. You must experience Half-Life 2 and its two episodes in order to call yourself a true PC gamer, they are some of the best games that money can buy.","timestamp_created":1453337222,"timestamp_updated":1455920560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565920114517211914","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20651176","author":{"steamid":"76561198117421001","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":3815,"playtime_last_two_weeks":129,"playtime_at_review":2362,"last_played":1659754554},"language":"english","review":"This game was pretty good.

Dr. Gordon Freeman, G-Man tarafından Şehir 17'deki tren durağına gönderilir. Combine güçlerine karşı Freeman, Black Mesa'daki bilim adamları ve bazı arkadaşları tarafından organize edilen Barney Calhoun, Alyx Vance ve Dr.Kleiner'ın da bulunduğu yeraltı direniş örgütüne katılır. Gordon, Dr.Eli Vance'in laboratuvarı Black Mesa Doğu'ya ışınlanmak istenirken başarısız olur. Laboratuvara eski şehir kanallarını kullanarak ulaşır. Black Mesa Doğu'ya vardığında Alyx'in robot hayvanı Dog ile tanışır ve burada yer çekimi silahını alır. Daha sonra laboratuvar Combine saldırısına uğrar ve Dr. Eli Vance, eskiden üst düzey bir hapishane olan Nova Prospekt'e götürülür. Mossman ise sözde kaçırılmıştır. Gordon terkedilmiş ve zombiler ile dolu olan Ravenholm Kasabasından gider. Papaz Grigori'nin yardımıyla otoyol 17 ye ulaşır ve Tau topu isimli silahla donamlı olan arazi aracıyla Deniz feneri'ne ulaşır ve orayı Combine'a karşı savunur. Arazi aracını orada bırakarak yola yürüyerek devam eder. Antlionlar ile dolu olan bir sahili geçer ve bir antlion guard ile savaşır. Yakındaki kamptan gelen Vortigaunt Gordon'a antlion guardların antlionları kontrol etmek için kullandığı Pheropodlar diğer adıyla Bugbaitler verir. Gordon bugbaitleri kullanarak Nova Prospekt'e ulaşır ve Alyx ile buluşur.\n\nEli'nin yerini tespit ederler ve Mossman'ın bir Combine casusu olduğunu öğrenirler fakat Mossman Alyx ve Gordon onu durduramadan kendini ve Eli'ı Citadel'e ışınlar.Ardından Alyx ile birlikte Dr.Kleiner'ın Laboratuvarına ışınlanırlar ve bu sırada Nova Prospekt patlar. Işınlanma bir hafta sürmüştür.Direniş Nova Prospekt'in patlamasını Combine'a ayaklanma başlatmak için bir sinyal olarak görmüştür. Gordon ile Citadel'a ulaşmaya çalışan Alyx kaçırılır ve Citadel'a götürülür. Gordon Direniş üyeleriyle beraber, Combine ve striderlar ile savaşır ve Gordon Barney ve Dog'un yanına ulaşır. Barney ve Dog, Gordon'ın Citadel'a girmesine yardım ederler.\n\nGordon, Citadel'a girmiştir. Citadel'da ilerlerken Breen'in El Koyma odasına giriş yapar ve Yerçekimi silahı hariç her silahı yok olur. Yer çekimi silahına gelen enerji sayesinde silah daha güçlü olur ve Gordon onu Combine'a karşı kullanır . İlerleyen kısımlarda Gordon da Dr. Breen tarafından yakalanır. Dr. Breen burada insanlar ve Combine ile ilgili planlarını anlatır ve anlattıkları Mossman'ın söylediklerine zıttır. Sinirlenen Dr. Mossman, Gordon, Alyx ve Eli'yi serbest bırakır. Dr. Breen, Kara Enerji Geçidine girer ancak Gordon, Dr.Breen'i Alyx'in yardımıyla durdurur. Reaktörün patlamasıyla G-Man zamanı durdurur. Gordon'ı yaptıkları için tebrik eder ve ona \"Gordon'ın hizmetleri için gelen teklifler\"den bahseder. Gordon'ın görevi bitmiştir ve G-Man Gordon'ı zamansız bir boyuta koyar.\n\n(SPOİLER ALARMI,SPOİLER ALARMI,SPOİLER ALARMI,SPOİLER ALARMI,SPOİLER ALARMI,SPOİLER ALARMI,)\n\nİşte Half-Lİfe 2'nin Senaryosu Bu Şekilde.Asla Bıktırmayan ve Sonrasında Olacaklarını Bilemediğiniz İçin Heyecanı Hiç Bitmeyen,''SOURCE'' Motoruyla Fizikleri Harika Olan (2004 yılına göre) Bir Başyapıt.Neyse İsterseniz Oynanışla Devam Edelim...\n\nHalf-Life 2, bir birinci tekil şahıs oyunudur. Olaylar oyuncunun gözünden anlatılmaktadır. Tüm olaylar ilk oyun olan Half-Life'ta ki konunun üzerine kuruludur. Ekranın altında oyuncunun sağlığını, cephanesini; üstte ise silahların olduğu listeyi gösteren bir monitör bulunur. Oyuncu sağlığını ve enerjisini ilk yardım paketlerinden, enerji pillerinden veya duvara entegre edilmiş ilk yardım panellerinden yükseltebilir. Oyuncuya gitmesi gereken hikâye içindeki seviyeye göre üstündeki zorluğu değişen tek bir yol bulunur. Bu yolda işgâlci Combine polisi veya askerleri, zombiler, kafa yengeçleri, vortigaunt'lar ve daha birçok çeşit uzaylı bulunabilir.\n\nOyuncu, gitmesi gereken yolda birçok engel ve çözmesi gereken bulmacalarla karşılaşır. Örneğin, önüne kilitli bir kapı çıktığında çok daha uzun başka bir yol kullanarak bu kapının arkasına geçmesi gerekebilir. Bir barikat çıktığında bu barikatı aşmak için patlayıcı kullanması gerekebilir.\n\nOyuncu, düşmana karşı bilim kurgusal veya gerçek birçok silah kullanır. Bu silahlar arasında 9 mm'lik bir tabanca, hafif makineli tüfek, el bombası, roket atar, arbalet, pompalı tüfek bulunur. Ayrıca oyun motoru'na dahil edilen fizik motorunun sayesinde Sıfır noktası enerji alanı yönlendiricisi ya da diğer adıyla Yerçekimi silahı kullanır. Bu silah, cisimleri oyuncuya doğru çeker ve çok büyük bir kuvvetle başka bir alana doğru fırlatabilir.[6] Yerçekimi silahı oyunun bazı kısımlarında bulmacaları çözmek için de kullanılır. Örneğin asla kumlara basılmaması gereken bir bölümde oyuncu, etrafındaki nesneleri kullanarak kendine yol yapar. Diğer bir örnek ise oyuncu otoyolda ilerlerken önüne arabalardan bir engel çıktığında yer çekimi silahı ile arabaları itebilir.\n\nBu Kadarlada Sınırlı Değil...\n\n*Game Reactor Magazine (Sweden)\n*Guardian UK Reader's Choice Awards\n*SpikeTV's Video Game Awards\n*Gamebiz.com.au\n*Filefront.com\n*Eurogamer\n*Shacknews.com Reader's Choice Awards\n*Gamespy.com\n*Edge Magazine\n*Voodoo Extreme.com\n*IGN.com\n*Mediacritic.com\n*Playboy.com\n*\"Here\" Magazine (Canada)\n*Play Magazine (USA)\n*JIVE Magazine\n*OCModShop.com\n*VG.no\n*Driverheaven.net\n*Gamearena.com.au\n \t\n*FZ.se\n*Associated Press\n*Sydney Morning Herald\n*PC Guru\n*PC Zone UK (Editor and Reader's Choice)\n*PopSoft (China)\n*PC Gamer (US)\n*Academy of Arts and Interactive Sciences\n*Xbitlabs.com\n*CPU Magazine\n*BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts)\n*Animation Magazine\n*PC Games (Australia)\n*Game Developer's Choice\n*MeriStation.com (Spain)\n*ComputerSweden\n*PC Games Reader's Choice Awards (Germany)\n*PC World magazine\n*Future Media's 2005 Golden Joystick\n\nBunlarda VALVE'nin Dibine Kadar Hak Ettiği Ödülleri...\n\nİyi Günler,İyi Oyunlar...","timestamp_created":1453320548,"timestamp_updated":1453320548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20648182","author":{"steamid":"76561198051941580","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":960,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":960,"last_played":1453143745},"language":"turkish","review":"ilk oyunun yeri her zaman farklıdır, en iyisidir deriz ama bence bu oyun birinciden daha iyi. oynanış olarak daha üstün. çok güçlü düşmanlarımız karşısında saklanacak yerlerimiz var, bir silahımızın kurşunu bittiğinde bulduğumuz ilk kutudan onun cephanesi çıkması çok iyi düşünülmüş. ilk oyundaki gibi bunaltıcı ve insanı hile yapmaya zorlayacak ortamlar ve bölümler yok. olumsuz yön olarka aklıma gelen düşman elite soldiers karakterlerinin kullandığı silahın kurşunu çok az (90 tane).","timestamp_created":1453320265,"timestamp_updated":1453320265,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20648025","author":{"steamid":"76561198067689177","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":773,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":773,"last_played":1454089591},"language":"polish","review":"NAJLEPSZA GRA ŚWIATA - POPROSTU HALF LIFE 2.\nNie grałem w jedeynkę ale dwójka tak mnie przekonała do siebie, że za 3 wydałbym 150 euro.\nTe uniwersum jest tak rozbudowane (pamiętajmy o Portalu i Apeture science), że człowiek nie wpadłby na to. :D\nNie będę spojlerował, ale tylko powiem, że nie może obejść się bez kontynuacji :)","timestamp_created":1453319681,"timestamp_updated":1453319681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49977487325668335","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20646809","author":{"steamid":"76561198051528849","num_games_owned":722,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":946,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":940,"last_played":1646481863},"language":"english","review":"I liked the third game more.","timestamp_created":1453315515,"timestamp_updated":1453315515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20646602","author":{"steamid":"76561198035936270","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":594,"last_played":1530033128},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever\n∞/10","timestamp_created":1453314785,"timestamp_updated":1453314785,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20640156","author":{"steamid":"76561198080807345","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":1109,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1108,"last_played":1454651106},"language":"russian","review":"Халфи лифи два, это самое интересное во что я играл в последнее время.

But now it's time to take a look at the sequel. After playing through it, I was awestruck. This game is a great game and a vast improvement over the original \"Half-Life,\" in terms of quality and gameplay. And it stood firm in the face of modern shooter tropes that are prevalent in the age of \"Halo\" and \"Call of Duty.\" \"Half-Life 2\" truly is an example of sticking to what made it work in the first place.\n\nOnce again, you play Gordon Freeman, who finds himself in a dystopian future in City 17, ruled by the evil Combine. He joins up with the Lambda Resistance to try and overthrow the Combine and save the world. Again, Gordon is a silent character, keeping the player immersed and drawing their own conclusions about what kind of person he is. It never once goes into a cutscene, instead having sequences that leave you in control of Gordon. This way, it feels like you're actually in those scenes.\n\nThis game also maintains the level design that I liked about the original \"Half-Life,\" keeping them interconnected with only a short load screen, and makes it feel like you're actually going to these new locations and exploring them. In a sense, it keeps a seamless and flowing game, that doesn't have you in one place one moment and in another the next.\n\nThe game avoids modern shooter tropes, keeping you carrying enough firepower to be a one-man army. There isn't as much weapon variety as there was in the original game and it's expansions, but there's enough that's needed. My favorite weapon goes without saying. The Gravity Gun. This weapon is such a joy to use when you pick up the right item. My only complaint is it's hard to hit those annoying headcrabs when they jump. But overall, it's a creative new way to fight, since this game makes everything movable, from crates, to dressers, even toilets can be dismounted with the Gravity Gun. \n\nWhich brings me to the next subject. This is one of the first games where Valve uses their new Source Engine. The physics of movement are brought to live very well in this game, everything is not some static object for you to ignore, here, everything that's usable, is usable, even playground equipment. This was a very tricky thing to attempt, especially for using the Gravity Gun, but it pays off very well and it's rendered very nicely.\n\nI also liked how it was easier to maintain health and HEV Suit Energy, since there was a lot more power cells for the suit to maintain it's charge, so you don't have to worry as much as you probably did in the original game. \n\nThere's also a very good cast of characters. The original \"Half-Life\" didn't have any characters outside the main character that you really cared about, but here, they really added on. Alyx Vance is a really good companion for Gordon, and proves a very able character that isn't helpless (but don't think her combat skills have anything on you, keep her alive when she's accompanying you.) Also, in sections where you get to command allies, their A.I. is able enough to keep them alive and competent in combat, though they tend to get in the way of you exploring. I also found the antagonist, Dr. Breen, to be a little ambiguous to me, he didn't make a whole lot of sense. So it wasn't as clear as to why you should despise him.\n\nI also found that this game greatly reduced platforming sections, though there's still the occasional difficult area with bad level design. Also, it still uses a lot of old sound effects from the original game (though in all honesty, that's excusable.) \n\nSeeing this game as it is, and what kinds of things it does with the gameplay, there is no question in my mind it has earned the praise it deserves, and it's spot as one of the best games ever made. It kept away from modern shooter tropes and instead stuck to what made it work in the first place, while at the same time, trying very hard to exceed the quality of the original, and when a game does that, it has done something right.

From every fucking person on Earth. Well, here's a diferent opinion!\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a hugely disappointing waste of goddamn potential. There are many times throughout where I just sad to myself: \"What could have been done!\" It's decent, but it could have been so much more...\n\nYou start in a train to an Eastern European town 20 years after HL1. None of the characters seem to have aged 20 years (assuming that the characters shown are the dozens of same-looking scientists and security guards, but now they're one person? Ok). Apart from that slight plot-hole, the world after the invasion of alien life is interesting; It's turned into an Orwellian dystopia. You go around, run from the Combine (the police force tasked with repressing the populace) and then you run into Alyx Vance. Here, the game starts to give hints on how it's going to treat you. I mean, Gordon, the player character. Throughout the game, everyone keeps raving about how amazing you are through the cutscenes that aren't cutscenes because you can move around waiting for everyone to shut the bloody hell up so they can open the door and you can progress throghout the game. It comes to a point where everyone calls you the One Free Man and appoints you as leader because, well... It's you! The One Free Man! In 20 years, no one in the resistance force against the invaders has bothered to appoint a leader. 'k... I guess.\n\nThe other bad thing about this game, as I said previously, is that it could have been so much more. There are gameplay elements (Gravity Gun, antlions) that are used on 1 level primarily, and then barely have a use anymore. This game could have been a Deus Ex-like where all of these weapons and items can be used for you to get to your objective, but... I guess that would have meant the game had to have a non-linear level design, which it doesn't have. It's strictly linear.\n\nGunplay is very interesting, since Valve decided that the best weapons (more specifically, the alien/sci-fi weapons and the revolver) are barely used because you rarely find ammor for them. Instead, you get a crappy Glock pistol, a peashooter SMG and a... decent shotgun. Movement is good when you're sprinting (which is pretty much sliding around at a fast speed) but unfortunately you can't spint all the time.\n\nHL2 gets more interesting to the end, it feels more sci-fi on its final levels, but it's too little, too late.\n\nSo, why the hell is it so praised? Because, when it came out, it was pretty revolutionary. The graphics looked really good (and still do, thanks to the graphic enhancements that Valve did.) The lead artist is the same as Dishonored (Viktor Antonov) and both games look fantastic and have a great art direction. It still has better facial animations (both HL2 and Vampire Bloodlines, released in the same day with the same engine) than a lot of games today! And it had a physics engine, which is again squandered for awful teeter-totter physics puzzles instead of any meaningful gameplay.\n\nI'm probab ly being too harsh, giving it a negative review, but yeah, whatever.","timestamp_created":1453043364,"timestamp_updated":1455276477,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517479479312896729","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20584632","author":{"steamid":"76561198216550603","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1273,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":874,"last_played":1629201065},"language":"russian","review":"10 фрименов из 10 и мантировок тоже\n","timestamp_created":1453038298,"timestamp_updated":1453038298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20584081","author":{"steamid":"76561198104162258","num_games_owned":441,"num_reviews":104,"playtime_forever":622,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":622,"last_played":1421571619},"language":"russian","review":"Премия «Проверено временем»","timestamp_created":1453036546,"timestamp_updated":1480085875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20583870","author":{"steamid":"76561198269652805","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1104,"last_played":1575687661},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo muito bem feito.
