That is the exact moment I got hooked on Half-Life because computers were already fascinating to me, let alone playing adrenaline inducing games (for the time at least half life was adrenaline inducing lol) I had a very hard time imagining how much entertaining it would be to engage in shootouts with terrorists in virtual world. That was the Half-Life demo, I think, where you constantly kill terrorists until you see G-Man watching you from on top of a scaffolding. Anyway, we were playing as if there was no other thing to do in this world. Recently, I got into it again and finished the storyline for the first time. It was entertaining and enlightening at the same time, because when you were playing the demo, you wouldn't know what the hell is going on; the game is just another hack/slash for you, not any different than DOOM. The story is, how can I say, legendary. A straight ten. At least from my perspective because I love the abandoned laboratory concept a lot. Being as objective as possible, you may see a lot of flaws but there are things that should be taken into consideration before becoming way too judgemental about it. First things first; the game is fucking 23 years old. This simple fact is enough to start praising this game. Anyway, my point is that when it's half-life; you don't take its age into consideration. It's like GTAV where the game is older than most industry-leading games nowadays but it doesn't stop it from being better than them in most of the aspects. To compare Cyberpunk 2077 and GTAV would suffice to support my take. Long story short, depending on when you play it, it's a life changing experience or a duty to play. Duty, because this is undoubtedly a classic. You should definitely play it if you haven't already.

It's not a bad game, however it is not particularly good either. Nostalgists won't hesitate to tell you that this game is what shaped the modern FPS landscape, as if that suddenly means we should ignore the shortcomings just because it did something different.\n\nI started off this franchise by playing HL2, and I really want to try Black Mesa, but I decided I would have to play the original first for the full experience, and oh boy what a mistake. I have heard that Black Mesa is very faithful to the original, so apart from graphics I have a feeling it is going to annoy me just as much.\n\nLet's talk about what this game did well:\n[list]\n[*]As a Half-Life game the world is engaging and it is easy to follow the story.\n[*]Wide variety of weapons\n[*]That's it... Nothing else really wowed me.\n[/list]\n\nLet's talk about what missed the mark:\n[list]\n[*]Infrequent auto saves. Maybe I am just so used to HL2, Halo, CoD, etc. but the auto saves seemed to set me back up to 10 mins of progress, which was beyond frustrating. One small mistake (jump, 1 hit kill enemy, or even put in a situation where my health is just too low for me to survive) is all it took and yet it would send you back so far to the point where it made seemingly simple things tedious.\n[*]Trip mines are stupid it's easier to just headshot a soldier with a revolver than to try and strategically place these. Soldiers also seem to see through walls as they will be very aggressive if you suddenly don't have a gun in your hands, so they will charge you and you will lose health trying to switch back.\n[*] Getting lost or really stupid paths. No this isn't a complaint about \"On the rail\" (albeit I do have complaints about that chapter). I have played HL2, and had no issue finding my way there, but I found myself getting lost over and over, I don't know if it is the dated graphics making the lack of detail cause everything to look similar or if the devs just didn't make it clearer where you were supposed to go. I frequently found myself consulting a YT walkthrough to find out where I am supposed to go.\n[*]\"On the rail\" is an experience, but controlling that machine with the same controls you use to move was awful. I frequently ran into traps because I kept moving when i tried to slow down or I accidentally released control of the mechanism causing me to just walk off. The chapter is actually very linear, and yet I found that jumping off the machine and just walking made it redundant and 10x easier, so not sure why it existed in the first place, because jumping off and walking skips entire sections.\n[*]The game doesn't even tell you the controls anywhere. I had to find out how to long jump using Google. Thankfully as I had played HL2 most of the other controls were easy to figure out, but someone new to the game would likely be very annoyed and frustrated to have to consult options every few seconds. Also why doesn't the weapon selection menu go away if you choose not to change weapon? You have to press M1 to make it go away, so this meant I might cycle through, change my mind and unlike HL2 it would stay there making me waste time switching back to the weapon I was using.\n[*]The shotgun sucks even at point blank. I guess this is to balance the ridiculous amount of reserve ammo you get, but I found myself using the revolver and crossbow for 90% of the game (once acquired) because I could just kill everything in 1-2 hits (normal difficulty). Whenever I used the shotgun it just didn't pack a punch even at point blank, and even with the alt-fire. HL2 handled this gun much better.\n[*]The Assassins are so unbalanced. You will kill them, but your HP will be so low by the end of it, that you will just die as soon as you hit the next section. It's so annoying to simultaneously handle an enemy that dodges so efficiently while also being very aggressive.\n[/list]\n\nNeutral Points:\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are okay, nothing that will blow your mind\n[*]Enemy design is tolerable given the era. You have your basic monsters, zombies, soldiers and 1 hit hazards, I can imagine that because of how focused Valve were on world building that these enemies would be considered \"meh\" in that time period.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]\nYou got this in \"The Valve Complete Pack\" just like I did. Put this in your \"hidden\" list and forget it exists, just not worth the effort. Read a short synopsis if you care to know the details of what happened that badly.\n\nEdit:\nI forgot to mention my absolute top pet peeve, doors in this game require you to WALK INTO THEM, yes unlike any normal game you don't press the \"use\" key you just walk into them. This is such a small detail and yet it drastically affects so much.\n\nEdit 2:\nThanks for free Steam points!
