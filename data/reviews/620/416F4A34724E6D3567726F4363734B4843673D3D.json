Some of the locations have an almost \"open world\" feeling about them and the puzzles will often turn into a challenge of \"Find Waldo\" involving portal-able surfaces, and many of them could be described as \"cheap\" in retrospect.

If that doesn't entertain you the constant back and forth commentary between everyone's favorite AI GLaDOS and of course Wheatley will give you a good laugh or two. Portal 2 also now offers a Co-Op mode which lets multiple players engage in solving the most difficult levels while having a buddy at your side. The game also has a lot of extra mods and user created levels off of the Steam Workshop for all of you willing to constantly test new levels.

It's a much more plot-driven game this time around and adds a lot of flavor to the game, but it doesn't focus so much on the story so as to distract from the main gameplay. It's the PERFECT balance between story and gameplay for a game of its kind.
