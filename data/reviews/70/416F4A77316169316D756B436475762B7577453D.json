Holds up quite well, aside from the ending parts of the game. It's quite long, too. Circa 8 - 10 hours long. I'd recommend this to any shooter fan. [u]I would recommend it at full price, and I strongly recommend it when it goes on sale, which, it goes on sale often[/u][/b] \n\n[h1]THE REAL REVIEW:[/h1]\nHalf-Life is a puzzle shooter from 1998 developed by Valve. It evolved gaming as a whole with its gameplay, visuals, and how the story is told to you in a first person perspective without control ever being taken away from you. \n\n[b][u]GAMEPLAY:[/u][/b]\nVery tense and fun, though, it's a slog in the last 15% (Or so) of the game. Guns feel meaty, and there's a large variety of them, and enemies are fun to fight (With an exception of a boss) with a large variety of them as well. It's fights are a mixture of strategy and running and gunning (Hence the tag on the box, \"Run, Think, Shoot, Live\"). However, the hitscan from enemy soldier can get annoying at times because they do not telegraph their attacks. But aside from that, the opposing AI make competent foes and fun battles. Encounters never feel the same, making each battle in a separate playthrough fresh and interesting.\n\n[b][u]STORY:[/u][/b]\nThe story itself is average with some average writing, but how it is told to you is done excellently. The game makes sure to keep you immersed in its world by never taking control from the player, and never taking the camera away from the 1st person perspective. It makes the  story more interesting than it actually is, and it's done very well. With the story, the voice acting is above par. The performances are awkward here and there, but aside from the occasional, goofy, scientist scream, the voice acting is decent.\n\n[b][u]VISUALS:[/u][/b]\nGood for the most part. However, art style is bland and ugly. I can see where they were going with it, but it's executed poorly. Other environments look quite nice for 1998, like [spoiler]Xen[/spoiler] and some outdoor environments here and there. Some textures are randomized, and that's quite impressive, even by today's standards. There's some nice flares on lights and some other details here and there that makes the experience feel lively.\n\n[b][u]OTHER:[/U][/B]\nNot really much else to say. I like the blood effects and how the alien blood is different from the human blood. I like gib effects. Seriously, not much else to say. The sound quality is quite low, even for 1998 standards, but that's a minor nit pick, really. Not much else. Doesn't affect the gameplay in any sort of way whatsoever.\n\n[h1]OVERALL SCORE AND OPINION:[/h1]\n[b]8.5/10[/b]\n\n[i]The last part of the game in Xen is very boring. It's not fun, seriously. It was a slog playing through Xen. The moment it started, I wanted it to end. Combat was tedious and overall, not fun. It's good it only lasts at least 30 minutes to an hour. But even then, the fact that I have to play through Xen is irritating. As much as I recommend this game, I recommend you skip Xen and just look at the end cutscene on Youtube. It's extremely boring and tedious, despite looking nice for 1998.[/i]","timestamp_created":1551730399,"timestamp_updated":1606692943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584055483341217041","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49356434","author":{"steamid":"76561198318741630","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":174,"last_played":1549717257},"language":"turkish","review":"nice

It's a great example of show don't tell as you uncover the story organically and put the pieces together to uncover the full picture. If you are looking for a game dripping with atmosphere and has great combat to boot, then Half-Life is the perfect fit for you. It is shockingly addictive and once you start you won't want to put it down.","timestamp_created":1551463388,"timestamp_updated":1588962551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49299170","author":{"steamid":"76561198867376503","num_games_owned":166,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":47,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":40,"last_played":1584465754},"language":"english","review":"Half life is a great game, I played it for 45 minutes and its great i love the scp genre and the old graphics keep up the good work vlave!","timestamp_created":1551460606,"timestamp_updated":1551460606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49298239","author":{"steamid":"76561198336655138","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":6355,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5841,"last_played":1621830516},"language":"spanish","review":"Gordo Puto Saca El 3","timestamp_created":1551457224,"timestamp_updated":1551457224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.716673135757446289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49296545","author":{"steamid":"76561198842969743","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":3774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1201,"last_played":1656264231},"language":"russian","review":"Стоит своих денег даже в 2019году!!!","timestamp_created":1551451540,"timestamp_updated":1551451540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49296339","author":{"steamid":"76561198871366123","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7,"last_played":1614496731},"language":"tchinese","review":"在windows 10 無法開啟","timestamp_created":1551450803,"timestamp_updated":1551450803,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471014469861984253","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49294198","author":{"steamid":"76561198841875053","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":941,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":156,"last_played":1641836499},"language":"russian","review":"Рекомендую всем эту игру","timestamp_created":1551442686,"timestamp_updated":1551442686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49292161","author":{"steamid":"76561198389720134","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":975,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1596341369},"language":"koreana","review":"밸브.갓겜.찬양\n레알루다가 개재밌음\n근데 중간중간 분위기 조성땜에 개무서움","timestamp_created":1551432837,"timestamp_updated":1551432837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49287882","author":{"steamid":"76561198137221516","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":670,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":463,"last_played":1596578464},"language":"english","review":"I FUCKING HATE THIS GAME AND THIS REVIEWS IS UNIRONIC\n\nTHE LEVEL DESIGN IS 90% JUST QUICKSAVE AND THEN INSTANTLY AFTER","timestamp_created":1551405766,"timestamp_updated":1551405766,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":11,"weighted_vote_score":"0.378173619508743286","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49286415","author":{"steamid":"76561198057612089","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":4221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2456,"last_played":1627139401},"language":"spanish","review":"Half Life cumplió 2 décadas el año pasado (19 de noviembre de 2018), algo que personalmente me emocionó muchísimo y que me trajo muuuucha nostalgia, por ser fan de esta gran saga; habiendo pasado tanto tiempo creo que no hay mucho para agregar o decir a estas alturas... Este maravilloso juego (junto con otros clásicos como por ejemplo Quake) significó una revolución en el mundo de los FPS (\"First Person Shooter\"), ya que se convirtió en el paradigma o base que siguieron otros juegos del mismo género (tener en cuenta que gracias a HL apareció Counter Strike, otra joya). Incluso podemos decir claramente que Valve se convirtió en el coloso que es al día de hoy, gracias a estas 2 obras de arte (me refiero tanto a HL como a CS). Respecto al juego en sí, puedo decir que tiene una gran jugabilidad, donde hay acción toda la hora, constantemente tendremos que luchar y abrirnos paso por las diferentes secciones de Black Mesa; la historia es muy entretenida e interesante, amén de que siempre me agradó el protagonista, Gordon Freeman, se nota que los desarrolladores tuvieron buen tacto al elegir ese perfil de individuo como personaje principal; a mi parecer, tiene una de las mejores Soundtracks del mundo, ya que la música acompaña y ambienta perfectamente cada escenario (muy pocos juegos logran eso); gráficamente, está muy bien también, obviamente hoy en día se lo ve muy viejo comparado con los juegos que hay en la actualidad, hay que tener en cuenta la época (años 90'), donde el motor gráfico GoldSrc fue toda una innovación en aquellos tiempos. aún a pesar de ello, siempre me agradó mucho ese motor gráfico, no me importa que sea viejo la verdad. La única crítica que siempre hago es que es una verdadera lástima que nunca se hayan tomado la molestia de darle un final decente a esta gran saga, a esta gran historia, pero bueno... por todos los acontecimientos que sucedieron y que son de público conocimiento está más que claro que nunca veremos un \"Half Life 3\", por lo menos no de manera oficial. Mi calificación para esta Joya: 10/10.","timestamp_created":1551395861,"timestamp_updated":1551395861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501754403114318848","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49282891","author":{"steamid":"76561198261313902","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":8613,"last_played":1660236034},"language":"english","review":"Definitely worth a buy!","timestamp_created":1551378428,"timestamp_updated":1612572783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"49280694","author":{"steamid":"76561198369522271","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1586844520},"language":"english","review":"still is the best clasic game of vavle\n","timestamp_created":1551369586,"timestamp_updated":1551369586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1ai1mukCduv+uwE="}
