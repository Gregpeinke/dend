You can choose between basic melee or a bow. Magic only requires you to have the spell and proficiency and is freely cast as a skill rather then a class of its own.\nYou will mainly be roaming the map and looking for villages for quests while making your way to your main objectives. It is hard to tell the difference between npcs and alot of the cities suffer from poor design but important npcs do have special interaction icons to make things easier- However alot of the quests have waypoint markers for the npcs over the actual objective.\n\n5/10. The world felt empty, but it was made in a time where that was more common. Probably a 8/10 for when it came out.","timestamp_created":1639556202,"timestamp_updated":1639558339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"105854606","author":{"steamid":"76561198068176908","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1397,"last_played":1653268443},"language":"english","review":"The Top Notch Voice acting is why I kept playing.

Even the movement in this game is FRUSTRATING.","timestamp_created":1638035932,"timestamp_updated":1638035932,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104375963","author":{"steamid":"76561198223274944","num_games_owned":371,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":384,"last_played":1638029360},"language":"spanish","review":"El sistema de combate es mal√≠simo","timestamp_created":1638029551,"timestamp_updated":1638029551,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"104096474","author":{"steamid":"76561198156123904","num_games_owned":94,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1973,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1972,"last_played":1637936121},"language":"polish","review":"Fajna gierka, wszystko fajnie w sumie to fajnie","timestamp_created":1637936069,"timestamp_updated":1637936069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"103578882","author":{"steamid":"76561198073533400","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":127914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15691,"last_played":1654376917},"language":"english","review":"A little glitchy, but, very fun to play!!!","timestamp_created":1637796743,"timestamp_updated":1637796743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"103569747","author":{"steamid":"76561198017891114","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":7627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6933,"last_played":1651266191},"language":"russian","review":"+1","timestamp_created":1637794952,"timestamp_updated":1637794952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"103396228","author":{"steamid":"76561198020145814","num_games_owned":369,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2646,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2437,"last_played":1638481135},"language":"english","review":"Awful drm good game","timestamp_created":1637770373,"timestamp_updated":1637770373,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"103385905","author":{"steamid":"76561198350915957","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1638364991},"language":"hungarian","review":"r√©gi √©s ahhoz k√©pest sz√©p √©s √∂tletes j√°t√©k","timestamp_created":1637757337,"timestamp_updated":1637757337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"103350233","author":{"steamid":"76561198079737439","num_games_owned":465,"num_reviews":248,"playtime_forever":1055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1055,"last_played":1637697549},"language":"brazilian","review":"Excelente jogo de RPG, recomendo!","timestamp_created":1637697818,"timestamp_updated":1637697818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"103001109","author":{"steamid":"76561198806905026","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":4683,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4683,"last_played":1637258103},"language":"ukrainian","review":"–°–ø–æ—á–∞—Ç–∫—É –∑–∞—Ç—è–≥—É—î, –≤ —Å–µ—Ä–µ–¥–µ–Ω—ñ –≥—Ä–∏ -

I reckon the lack of tutorial or hand holding would perturb a lot of people, especially nowadays, but I like the way you're not locked into doing things a certain way. The lack of direction also makes you feel a little more immersed in my opinion, and promotes exploration, the side quests you find along the way are generally basic enough you can do them quickly but complex enough you know that you're doing a quest rather than accidentally completing them (most of the time.)

Ob es nun darum geht, die Lager der Groms auszuheben, Wildtiere zu erlegen oder Dungeons zu erkunden - es kommt selten Langeweile auf. Bugs oder Fehler habe ich beim Spielen keine gefunden, was aber nicht hei√üt, dass es keine gibt. In der ganzen Spielwelt st√∂√üt man immer wieder auf kleinere und gr√∂√üere Ansammlungen von Feinden (Groms, Orks, Banditen u. a.) in diversen Lagern am Wegesrand. Durch ihre Vernichtung erh√§lt man nicht nur XP und Gold, sondern auch n√ºtzlich Sammelgegenst√§nde wie Waffen, R√ºstungen, verzauberte Ringe, Tr√§nke und Zutaten f√ºr deren Zubereitung. Auch finden sich in den den meisten Lager Kisten, die ebenfalls Beute enthalten. An diese kommt man leicht heran, wenn der Skill \"Schloss knacken\" einen angemessenen Level erreicht hat.\n\n\"Two Worlds\" hat jedoch auch Schwachstellen, die einen nicht unerheblichen Teil vom Spiel kaputtmachen. Zum einen gibt es Skills, die vollkommen nutzlos sind. Warum sollte ich lernen, wie ich einen Feind vom Pferd sto√üen kann, wenn ausnahmslos alle Feinde zu Fu√ü unterwegs sind? Zus√§tzlich sind die Bewegung der NPCs stark eingeschr√§nkt und vermitteln den Eindruck, als w√§ren sie ferngesteuert. Weiterhin haben die Entscheidungen, die man im Spiel trifft, wenig bis gar keinen Einfluss auf die Spielwelt. Lediglich die Antwort nach der Frage, ob es etwas Neues gebe, √§ndert sich. Auch ist es nicht besonders realistisch, dass in der Stadt Quidinar, die von Orks belagert wird, der Alltag unbek√ºmmert weitergeht. Die Vernichtung des Lagers der Orks, in welchem sich die Belagerungswaffen befinden, sowie die Beschaffung der Ausl√∂ser f√ºr die Katapulte aus der Festung Hadeborg, √§ndern auch nichts. Die Stadt befindet sich auch dann noch im Belagerungszustand, wenn alle Belagerer tot sind. Realistisch? Nicht wirklich.\n\nMein gr√∂√üter Kritikpunkt ist aber, dass das Spiel nach dem ersten Akt gewaltig an Fahrt verliert. Nachdem man entweder dem Karga-Klan oder Haus Skelden zum Sieg √ºber den jeweils anderen verholfen und den Rahmen des Relikts in seinen Besitz gebracht hat, wirkt die Spielwelt weitaus weniger lebendig. Der Konflikt zwischen Karga und Skelden in Talmont ist viel interessanter als der Krieg zwischen den Orks und den Menschen bei Cathalon und Quidinar. Durch Hintergrundinformationen, die man erh√§lt, indem man mit den Leuten spricht, wirkt Talmont lebendig.

Two Worlds: Epic Edition has all the charm of a game made with genuinely good intent, but not executed as well as the developers had hoped. Is that a bad thing? \n\nNO! \n\nAll the glitches, cheesy voice acting, and wonky combat make Two Worlds: Epic Edition the lovable game it is. Don't expect a polished experience. Expect a game that will make you laugh and roll your eyes as you slice through hordes of wolves, chase down archers, and completely neutralize every single enemy with simple bear traps.\n\nBuy it and don't let it collect dust in your library.","timestamp_created":1629923197,"timestamp_updated":1629949088,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.652138233184814453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98129764","author":{"steamid":"76561198373697965","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":42849,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3813,"last_played":1655317668},"language":"english","review":"Great game!  \n\nIt has a very scenic, huge, beautiful open world.  I have not finished it.  I'm too busy exploring, hiking, climbing, swimming, spelunking, taking pictures of sunsets and huge statues, and sometimes completing side quests.  I think I'll be spending many hours on the game.  I've already got over 60 hours and I'm still mostly in the beginner areas.\n\nThe combat is fun.  Making your weapons OP is fun.  Getting surprised by the occassional really hard group of enemies or bosses is fun.  Learning the social aspects of the people in villages and towns is fun.  If I could get my character to dance and sit down, I'd probably hang around some of the villages for a while and pretend I'm in a Sim game, lol.  I'd go out, gather some herbs, make potions, sell them and set up a regular shop (not really - you can't get NPC's to come and buy stuff from you.  You have to go to them).  Maybe as a side business I'd get the disarming skill and disarm unsuspecting NPC's everywhere, pick up their weapons and sell those.  Or I could make friends with the thieves in camps and pick their pockets, then sell the stuff back to the vendor in their group.  But I digress.  :)\n\nYou can mold your character into whatever type of class you prefer.  Just equip the desired skills, spells, and weapons and there you are:  a berserker; a thief; a tank; a mage; an archer, or some combo of those.\n\nThere is a lot of potential alchemy you can do, if you like. \n\nThe story is interesting and there are many side stories on this game, if you like lore.\n\nThe most negative thing in my experience so far:\nIt's awkward to learn things at first.  Some things are intuitive, while a bunch of important things are not.  I'll probably be publishing a guide for newcomers.  I've spent the last 3 days compiling a guide for myself, so I won't forget things when I've cycled back to this game after this initial thorough experience.  I definitely will want to replay this game in the upcoming years and I am putting it on my \"favorite games\" list.\n\nI highly recommend the game.  It's very much worth the price.\n\nEDIT:  Movement is WASD; Camera is fully rotational in all directions via mouse movement;  You can zoom for first-person view or so your character will not be visible when taking screenshots.","timestamp_created":1629779180,"timestamp_updated":1635235083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604472041130065918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"98120343","author":{"steamid":"76561198111986797","num_games_owned":219,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1017,"last_played":1629778828},"language":"english","review":"Great classic RPG feel","timestamp_created":1629763131,"timestamp_updated":1629763131,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97962985","author":{"steamid":"76561197992025358","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":75,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75,"last_played":1485681199},"language":"english","review":"I got this game to play at a time when my laptop was not good enough to play Skyrim, so I thought, \"Well this looks fun!\" and bought it.

Cutscenes do not trigger normally, and you must go into the game's local files to play them manually to get any story from them.  Riding a horse is a herculean task, and horse combat, while existent, is nigh on impossible.\n\nBut I love this game.  It is clunky and awkward and the voice overs are intense and at times silly, but it makes the game memorable and fun.  A week does not go by that I don't reference or quote the game.  A day where your character is more \"talkative\" (reacting to the things around him) is a great day indeed.\nThe skills are fun, and magic and alchemy can make your character so incredibly overpowered that you can murder the entire population of the game (I have killed every NPC in this game on stream just to prove it (it was a blast--for me)).  Stacking weapons and armor is incredibly satisfying and oddly addictive.\n\nAnd then there's the crit sound/effect.  It is the single greatest critical hit indicator of any game I have ever played.  Missing a crit feels like such a failure, but getting three in a row feels like power running through your veins.\n\nI love this game.  I will buy it for another person if they want to try it out.  I would buy another copy for myself because I have a problem.
