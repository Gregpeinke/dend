Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to science[/h1]\n\nPortal 2 is the one of the greatest games I’ve played and this is actually coming from a person who doesn’t even like platformers and puzzle games. Portal 2 is equivalent to [b]T2: Judgement Day[/b] when it comes to rating sequels. I’ve refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and I regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+The developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot. \n+Well written and memorable story and dialogues. Pacing is also well done. \n+Best voice acting in a puzzle game. I seriously can’t think of any game topping this. \n+[b]Stephen Merchant[/b] and [b]J.K Simmons[/b] did an absolutely terrific job. [b]Ellen McLain’s[/b] performance as GladOS is so good that you’ll love to hate her character. So, then it’s a success I guess :D\n+Portal 2 has a humor like no other game. It’s funny, it’s dark but most importantly it’s original!\n+Gameplay is fun, addictive and educational. No matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original Portal which was a lot frustrating at times. \n+Performance is flawless. It was so smooth like as if Valve built Source just to make this game. \n+Excellent soundtrack and musical score by [b]Mike Morasky[/b] and [b]The National[/b]. \n+Two player co-op campaign is equally fun as single player mode. Very well-designed levels and actually requires co-operation and trust of your friend. \n+User created levels and mods are very impressive. Shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels. It was fun playing. Check them out once you’re done with the main story. \n+Nice and clean graphics. Aged very well even though it’s almost a decade old game. Visually this perhaps the best-looking game from Valve imo. \n+Suitable for all ages, no matter whether you’re young or old, Portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard. There’s also a PS3 port available with PS Move support.\n+Credit to Valve for providing soundtrack for free.\n+Excellent port. Also supports Linux and Mac so no one is really missed. \n+Steam Cloud saving, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Official mod support. \n+One of the greatest video game endings. So many great and ambitious and big budget AAA games have fulfilling gameplay, story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or don’t meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in. Not Portal 2. It manages to be fun from start to finish line. \n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\n-First part of the story can be a little predictable if you’ve watched a lot of movies and TV.\n-Most assets seem like they’re copied straight from previous Valve’s works like the first Portal, Half Life 2 and its standalone episodes. \n-Honestly, I’ve tried hard to find and couldn’t. At this point I’m just nitpicking Valve.  \n\n[h1]The Bottom Line[/h1]\nPortal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype. You might think it is overrated but there’s only one way to find out. Just get the game and first thing, play the game already! Portal 2 is one of the funniest, best written game of all time. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson; perfect casting. Valve never disappoints, (or at least never did a decade ago or so). Portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and I’m thankful for that.\n\nThe developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game Narbacular Drop. Valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make Portal. You can check that game out for free by visiting their website. Just search the name on Google or any other search engine that you prefer. \n\nHighly recommend it to……[b]everyone[/b]. If you’ve read so far then you’re probably interested in the game so won’t hurt giving it a try. \n\n[h1]My Rating: 10/10 – Outstanding![/h1] \n\nThank You :D","timestamp_created":1593383056,"timestamp_updated":1647703819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":269,"votes_funny":27,"weighted_vote_score":"0.945775151252746582","comment_count":29,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71607828","author":{"steamid":"76561198837999065","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":253,"last_played":1594244067},"language":"english","review":"I love this game NO LAGS and good story.\nBut it is a litter bit hard I have to on YouTube so I can pas the level\nI think it is the best game ever","timestamp_created":1593382973,"timestamp_updated":1593382973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71607620","author":{"steamid":"76561199037466725","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":7892,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6198,"last_played":1610850477},"language":"spanish","review":"El mejor juego de la historia del ser humano e incluso más que solo el ser humano.
