I'm going to review Half Life: Source.\nTruly this is one of Valve's most pitiful pieces of work. All they did was copy and paste Half life into the source engine, change a couple things, and that's it. There was SOOO much potential here, and that's just all thrown away to make this. Let's go over the pros.\nPROS:\nThe water looks very realistic and better overall then the original.\n In some areas the lighting is better(some areas look pretty bad), the ragdoll and particle effects are improved overall from the original. and that's sort of it.\nCONS: \nthe amount of glitches in this game is unimaginable. they aren't neccasarily game breaking, but they're just annoying and take you out of the mood the game intended to set you in. Good example is when you reach the test chamber and there's just a scientist floating in the air where he's actually supposed to be sitting in a chair. when you go to the surface and outside, the sky just freaks out and does some really weird things. these are just two of many noted glitches. \nthe weapons have this weird look to them where they look shiny, like they literally just got polished, and it just looks really odd.\nsome of the weapons are changed, some good some bad. notably the SMG has a bit of an effect where instead of firing somewhat straight, it's like gordon looks up and down a bit while using he gun. very weird.\nanother thing: once you open it up, you unlocked all the chapters even without beating the game, which is just confusing. \n\nand once again, this is just some of many glitches and weird changes in this \"Remake.\" overall, please don't buy this game and just buy the original. you get very little out of this in terms of improvements and you get a whole lot more issues than improvements. just play the original. at most this is just a novelty game, and maybe you play it once in awhile, but that's it. This is probably Valve's worst piece of work so far, and i advise to not get it. even on sale. you're just getting half life in the source engine with a couple of improvements and that's it.","timestamp_created":1593212471,"timestamp_updated":1593212471,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71434637","author":{"steamid":"76561198844027343","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":549,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1637953540},"language":"english","review":"I only recommend this for the funny bugs and the fact that most visual bugs can be fixed by turning off Multicore rendering and as a warning for those who are extremely used to Half-Life's movement Half-Life: Source's movement is just off you move too fast and when you fire the MP5 it sways up and down etc. and I only recommend this for the funny bugs like that scientist that found the secrets to levitation and them screaming non-stop.","timestamp_created":1593205866,"timestamp_updated":1603391852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71403627","author":{"steamid":"76561198004040976","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":8647,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7376,"last_played":1618493583},"language":"french","review":"super jeux","timestamp_created":1593180136,"timestamp_updated":1593180136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71398782","author":{"steamid":"76561198883607032","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":467,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1655304172},"language":"english","review":"Great for its time, but minor glitches and annoying scientists.","timestamp_created":1593176350,"timestamp_updated":1593176350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517906367778778076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71382806","author":{"steamid":"76561198967095318","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":623,"last_played":1626018885},"language":"schinese","review":"太草了","timestamp_created":1593162276,"timestamp_updated":1625461428,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71364572","author":{"steamid":"76561198378390639","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":296,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1579394922},"language":"english","review":"McCumboiga","timestamp_created":1593142451,"timestamp_updated":1593142451,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71354022","author":{"steamid":"76561198042521413","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":436,"last_played":1606965687},"language":"english","review":"for the record i only bought this to mount onto gmod for the weapon\n\nstill decent though.\n\nfor a port..","timestamp_created":1593130354,"timestamp_updated":1593130354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71352405","author":{"steamid":"76561198072119732","num_games_owned":1054,"num_reviews":243,"playtime_forever":536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":536,"last_played":1506278548},"language":"english","review":"A glitchier version of Half Life.

И, пожалуй, всё.\nА чем же отвратительна “убитая Pipe’ом” Source-версия?\n1) Техническая часть игры: количество багов, превышающее все мыслимые и немыслимые масштабы: сломанные кат-сцены и абсолютно кривые хитбоксы (отдельно отмечу тентакли в помещении с тестовым двигателем – урон не проходит как по Mr.Freeman'у, так и по NPC; Вертолёт, который сбить практически нереально; Нихилант, которого раздамажить можно только с определённых видов оружия)\n2) Графическая часть игры: Оружие и объекты, отполированные до блеска, в которых отображается не пойми что; Свечение от теней в полной темноте, что само по себе является полнейшим абсурдом; Отдельного внимания стоит место на переработчиках, проходя которое изначально может показаться, что сгорела видеокарта…Но, нет, в этом моменте игра просто сломана, а всё что происходит на экране в данный момент – рай для эпилептика; Не столь значительная мелочь, но её возможно заметить – плевки Гонарча оставляют после себя “концентрированную темноту” как бы намекая, откуда вылезла Pipe-версия Half-Life: Source.\nКажется, что вроде бы как и немного, но пройдя всё это самому, наступает период разочарования. Сочувствую тем людям, которые не играли в оригинальный Half-Life, и сразу познакомились с этой “убитой” версией…\nИтог: Source – версия на данный момент – яркий пример абсолютно похренестичного отношения разработчика к коммьюнити. Личный совет – покупать оригинал, а Source-версию обходить стороной.\nРаздражает больше всего то, что стоит она как оригинал - тут можно сказать,что частенько бывает огромная скидка. Но даже со скидкой игра не стоит свеч. Удалить её не удалят...Остаётся надеяться, что рано или поздно Source-версия будет исправлена.Надо же верить во что-то хорошее…\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/70/ - рецензия на Half-Life\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/50/ - рецензия на Half-Life: Opposing Force\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/130/ - рецензия на Half-Life: Blue Shift\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/220/ - рецензия на Half-Life 2\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/340/ - рецензия на Half-Life 2: Lost Coast\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/380/ - рецензия на Half-Life 2: Episode 1\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/420/ - рецензия на Half-Life 2: Episode 2\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/290930/ - рецензия на Half-Life 2: Update\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/399120/ - рецензия на Prospekt\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Ancient_Legend/recommended/362890/ - рецензия на Black Mesa","timestamp_created":1592744994,"timestamp_updated":1624644933,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.702813327312469482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71127043","author":{"steamid":"76561198171947078","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1443,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":647,"last_played":1593036256},"language":"english","review":"Better than I thought It would be","timestamp_created":1592744326,"timestamp_updated":1592744326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71117958","author":{"steamid":"76561198080798147","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":510,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1545874485},"language":"english","review":"Meh, this is ok, but the original is better, I only got it for Gmod.","timestamp_created":1592729816,"timestamp_updated":1592729816,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71113337","author":{"steamid":"76561198086773602","num_games_owned":1014,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":421,"last_played":1592762054},"language":"english","review":"Half Life is an amazing game.
