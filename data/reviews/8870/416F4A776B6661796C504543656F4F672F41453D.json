However the gameplay is great with it being more of a twitchy and acrobatic shooter focused on movement on the replacement for plasmids, vigors which could be combined with others or used in a way to fight specific enemy types. I started on hard and the difficulty was great until the second Lady Comstock fight. This was such a bizarrre difficulty spike and was so frustratingly difficult and unfair which actively punished you for dying due to depleting resources that I cranked it down to easy mode and just beat the game on that difficulty. However, this was still a very fun but flawed experience that I think everyone should play it if you are a fan of the Bioshock games and if you enjoy narrative experiences which is very flawed but ultimately pretty great with an amazing ending.\n\nThe two episodic DLCs take place in Rapture are essentially mandatory if you are even somewhat invested in the main game's story. They are divided into into a 90 minute first episode and a 3.5 hour second episode being a little over half the runtime of Bioshock Infinite making it's price on sale justified. Episode 1 is pretty mediocre however due to how Infinite's gameplay doesn't properly translate over to the architecture of Rapture instead of Columbia. As well it has a pretty lame story with it being pretty generic and bland. However Episode 1 sets up the story for Episode 2 and Episode 2 is incredible. Burial at Sea: Episode 2 is pretty much the best bioshock property out there apart from maybe Bioshock 1. Episode 2 has pretty great but a little too easy reworked stealth gameplay since you play as Elizabeth and not Booker. It has reworked level design that makes the levels more non-linear than the corridors of Columbia which was a great return to form. But most importantly it fixes a lot of the issues with Infinite's convoluted story structure and has some amazing reveals and some incredible setup for Bioshock 1. This is a must play for any Bioshock fan and is easily the best thing to come out of Infinite.","timestamp_created":1585694425,"timestamp_updated":1600449804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66291362","author":{"steamid":"76561198113238215","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":760,"last_played":1589413142},"language":"english","review":"<3","timestamp_created":1585692529,"timestamp_updated":1585692529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66289530","author":{"steamid":"76561198060689966","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":687,"last_played":1586610134},"language":"russian","review":"Это.

Infinite[/i] is one of the most theatrical, moving, and enticing video games of all time, reviving the [i]BioShock[/i] series with ease while taking it to new heights it has never known.\n\n[i]BioShock Infinite[/i] is simultaneously one of the most underrated and overrated experiences out there. In the public eye and mainstream, this game is seen as a sort of \"pinnacle of the medium\", but in the eyes of more critical players and those who are frustrated by its more linear nature, it is often disregarded as \"the worst [i]BioShock[/i]\". While both of these sentiments are personal opinion and very subjective to the player, I think both are too extreme to describe this game. After having played through the entire \"Shock\" series, from [i]System Shock[/i] to [i]BioShock Infinite[/i] (which I played when it originally came out and again just recently), I have to say the obvious weak link is [i]BioShock 2[/i]. To say this game is worse than that one is almost a crime, ignoring everything that makes this game so magnificent and cinematic, so heart-wrenching and melancholic, and so engrossing and beautiful. While [i]BioShock 2[/i] felt like a rehash of the original with worse gameplay and an unbelievable story, [i]BioShock Infinite[/i] breathed fresh air into the series and introduced an equally, if not, better overall game here. It's hard to pick between the original and the latest, as they are similar yet very different at the same time, and just because this one is a bit more streamlined and linear does not detract from the marvel of this experience, so claiming \"linearity\" as its downfall is a weak argument.\n\nWhen people claim that this game is way too linear, it kind of baffles me. It isn't as though any single game in the [i]BioShock[/i] series is nearly as free-form and non-linear as they seem to remember them being. Where in the [i]System Shock[/i] games, one could get lost easily and had to rely on audio logs and emails to set them in the right direction with their sparse ammunition and health, any [i]BioShock[/i] game, even the first, is rather linear. Sure, there are a few more optional quest areas, but these are few and far between, and aren't grand optional sections of the map, usually, it's a store or the like that will give the exploring player extra supplies. To say that these games are extremely different in terms of linearity, is bordering on falsehood. In my personal experience, even as someone who pretty much completed all the side quests and explored the very ends of the map, I just don't get where this sentiment comes from, as a marginal difference is apparently enough to claim this the \"worst game in the series, even when it blows the others out of the water in terms of storytelling and character development. [i]BioShock[/i] has atmosphere and its own engrossing story, along with other things that could be argued to be better than this game, which is why I can't claim for certain which one is definitively \"better\", but it is beyond easy to claim that the sequel is the worst.\n\nThe atmosphere of this game is breathtaking: the first time one sees Columbia in the sky is on par with one seeing Rapture down in the depths of the ocean. The culture and artistic direction is very different from the original, which went for a more Art Deco approach set in the twentieth century as opposed to the Neoclassical take of Columbia. Both are extremely striking and evoke different tones, which is the one key difference of this game that strays away from the entirety of the [i]Shock[/i] series: it doesn't focus on isolation. With each game prior, you never had so much human contact or a solid companion to accompany you on your journey. In [i]System Shock[/i] and its sequel, you wouldn't find any humans alive at all, only the enemies and antagonists that wish to kill you. In [i]BioShock[/i], you had contact with other people, but if so, it was mostly only through glass or audio (Little Sisters are the exception). This worked in each respective title to envelop the player into the world around them and feel the isolation work against their will, but was it necessary for this game? I don't believe so.\n\nThe thing is, this isn't what [i]BioShock Infinite[/i] strives to be, or should have to be limited to. Looking at all prior entries, they may have vastly different settings and characters, but they are built very similar and have a lot of shared philosophies, making for masterclass games, but ones that are close in design. There are many audio logs, hallways, and pieces of meta-commentary, but how long can you experience arguably the same thing without getting bored of it? Was this game supposed to not take risks and deviate from what people expect? I don't think so, and am more than thrilled Ken Levine took it in a different direction. No matter how much I love those games, if more and more similar games with different textures came out, i would enjoy them less and less as time went on. There are plenty of similar functions in this game that define it as a [i]Shock[/i] game and definitely as a [i]BioShock[/i] game, but it innovates and changes things in order to stay fresh. The usual narrative type is bent and we get a more personal story between the \"shepherd\" protagonist, Booker DeWitt, and the \"lamb\" he saves, Elizabeth. \n\nWhat goes on in the story here is, once again, fresh and unexpected. The story of revolution brewing and then civil war taking over the oppressive Columbia that, although beautiful, was built on systematic racism and genocidal tendencies is intriguing to say the least. How Booker and Elizabeth's motives change and the ways they develop in this experience is beyond impressive and draws the player into their predicaments, hoping for a happy ending to their grand attempt to escape Columbia. Elizabeth is likely my favorite character in the [i]BioShock[/i] series, this is because she is not one of the impeccably written villains or a self-insert protagonist, she is a breathing human being with hopes and dreams that has felt pain and does her best to be optimistic through it all regardless, with dynamic thoughts and little details that put her on that next level. There is a lot to this character, and it would take a lot more to dissect her and explain what all makes her such a good character and companion, but just know she is the among the best there is in the medium. The meta-commentary of this game is on par with that of the one Andrew Ryan dishes out in the original [i]BioShock[/i], and is actually the one I prefer, though I love both in their own ways. It feels more close to home in this instance because you are seeing through the eyes of a character, not a self-insert. While it worked in the original, it was not as gratifying (or shocking) as it was here.\n\nSaying all this, [i]Infinite[/i] may be my favorite [i]Bioshock[/i], and I would have never expected this to be the case. I love the original, and maybe on a different day, I would prefer that one, but as of right now, I see more value in this game. [i]BioShock[/i] and its sequel feel too close to the [i]System Shock[/i] games for me to really say they took many risks with them in terms of innovating the series, whereas in this one, it feels like a new experience altogether. Enough connects it to the games prior, but enough also separates it into its own section of the modern day immersive sim. A shift of focus more on action-oriented gameplay and a tighter story may bring about more linearity, but the atmosphere here is equally as stunning as Rapture, maybe even more so, and the characters are arguably better here as well. Not enough shifted to make this game disingenuous to the series, but enough was changed to make it feel new and allow our breath to be taken away as the best in the [i]Shock[/i] series have been doing for decades.This may not be the \"pinnacle of gaming\", but it is a masterpiece up there among many other classics of the medium.\n\n[b][RATING: 9.6/10][/b]","timestamp_created":1585642235,"timestamp_updated":1660098647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66232292","author":{"steamid":"76561198281783790","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1585640897},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情真的是太棒了！！！伊丽莎白也很漂亮，就是射击手感略显不足，值得各位试试","timestamp_created":1585641043,"timestamp_updated":1585641043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66232161","author":{"steamid":"76561198202859639","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":580,"last_played":1502505065},"language":"koreana","review":"6 / 10\n\n다들 명작이라지만 개인적으로 잘 안 맞았다.\n총알 떨어지면 총알 줘, 뒤지면 살려줘, 걍 스토리 보기 위해 아무 생각없이 기계처럼 총질하고 스토리를 보는 느낌이었는데 그 스토리도 맘에 들지 않았다.\n이것도 개인적인건데 평행세계 이런거 별로 안 좋아한다.\n캐릭터나 비주얼디자인 같은거는 매력적인 듯?","timestamp_created":1585640907,"timestamp_updated":1585729559,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66228656","author":{"steamid":"76561198071272341","num_games_owned":484,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":284,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":284,"last_played":1585634832},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic.","timestamp_created":1585636988,"timestamp_updated":1585636988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66227887","author":{"steamid":"76561198026565056","num_games_owned":620,"num_reviews":505,"playtime_forever":660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1585616399},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite is a action fps singleplayer game. it is the third Bioshock game in the series. instead of going back to Rapture, you are now sent to a city in the sky named Columbia.

While it may initially seem like a very good game, mostly thanks to its good graphics, the illusion is destroyed when playing it.\n\nWhile the original BioShock is a true classic, Ken Levine seems to have forgotten everything that made that game great.\n\nThere's not enough exploration of the city, as this is mostly an on the rails shooter, and not a very good shooter at all. The original BioShock had some rudimentary RPG and immersive sim elements, which are completely gone here.\n\nThere are no foes as interesting as the Big Daddy, no characters like Andrew Ryan, or Atlas.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are uninteresting, and the ones that had potential like the rails and dimensional rifts are underutilized. Weapons are disappointing and shields are useless. At least combat is fast.\n\nElizabeth seems like an interesting character, which is charismatic enough, but truth be told, she is simply a loot collecting machine. All her amazing abilities are mostly reduced at throwing coins at you.\n\nAnd the plot. Oh, boy, the plot. You can see the twist coming from miles away, the social commentary is badly handled and suddenly abandoned, and worst of all the story and the world don't make sense.\n\nTalking of the world, Columbia looks nice enough, but as I mentioned before, the exploration is extremely linear, audio logs are left with no care around, architectural structure of the city doesn't make sense, and the illusion is fully broken because everyone attacks you on sight, even though everyone seemed completely peaceful before, and here they are not spliced mutants as in the first game.\n\nEverything made much more sense and was better structured in the first BioShock, and what's most important, it made sense. Splice mutants attacked you because of what they were, powers made sense, Big Daddies were not aggressive if you didn't attack them, etc, etc, etc.\n\nThis game is a monumental failure and probably one of the biggest disappointments I ever had in gaming. Maybe everyone should play it at least once, and then watch the E3 trailers which came before its release, and then imagine that in another universe THAT game got made instead.\n\nTLDR.: Just go play the original BioShock and if you like it play BioShock 2 next. Then watch the early E3 videos of this game and think about how good this game could have been.","timestamp_created":1585596691,"timestamp_updated":1585596691,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503816783428192139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66189473","author":{"steamid":"76561198045045685","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1338,"last_played":1585593971},"language":"english","review":"This is a tough game to review.  It has so much going for it, so much that I loved, but in the end I can't recommend this game.  After beating a game I usually have one of two different feelings.  The first is sadness that a great game is ending or happiness that I'm finally thru with such a bad game.  Now I can add a third feeling to it, angry that such a great game turned in to such a horrible one.  \n\nFirst off some things that I loved.  The combat was amazing.  There were plenty of awesome fights that I never got bored.  Plus the addition of the tear system gave you so many more options of how combat could be handled.  The graphics were great.  The city was beautiful and I enjoyed exploring and trying to find everything.  Not once did this game crash on me.  The other two Bioshock games would crash every few minutes at times so this was a huge improvement. \n\nNow some things I didn't like as much.  While combat was great it was also lacking.  There were eight Vigors in the game but I only ever used the same two.  I felt no reason to switch to any of the others.  There are a ton of different guns in the game but they changed it so you could only carry two at a time.  Just like Vigors I never changed from the same two guns either.  I loved the Trap aspect of the game in Bioshock 2 and was excited to see that aspect brought back in this game as well but I don't think I ever actually used it.  Setting traps was pointless when 99% of the enemies would stay at a distance and shoot at you.  The gear that you could find was a nice touch, but like everything else I never saw a need to change from  my original set up.  Combat was great but there was never a need to change from doing the exact same thing for every fight.  They removed the ability to manually save so you are at the whim of autosaves now.  Some of these autosaves were a little too far apart so you had to go thru many tough fights before you were able to save again.  It makes it very difficulty if you have anything else going on that may pull you away or could only play for a short amount of time.  I didn't like that they got rid of hacking all together in this one.  I liked being able to hack different machines in the last two games.  The ability to hack was replaced with a Vigor that lets you instantly hack machines for a short amount of time.  \n\nThe main reason I can't recommend this game is that the storyline is pretty horrible after a certain point.  This part will contain spoilers but I will try to keep them to as small as possible.  The devs build up a great storyline and after a certain point it feels like they got bored or just wanted to hurry up and finish certain storylines.  They build up characters and you are expecting to have to deal with them later only for them to get pushed to the side and forgotten.  By the time the ending comes around you are so confused about what is what that you are just ready for it to be over with.  Overall it felt like the devs were trying to make a really interesting story but just ended up being like the tv show Lost.  After awhile it was just so confusing of a story that you just wanted it all to end.","timestamp_created":1585595762,"timestamp_updated":1585595762,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66188837","author":{"steamid":"76561198979777406","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":1625,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1089,"last_played":1647102999},"language":"russian","review":"❤️I LOVE THIS GAME❤️","timestamp_created":1585595215,"timestamp_updated":1585595215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66185646","author":{"steamid":"76561198052550404","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1108,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":995,"last_played":1585743092},"language":"english","review":"does not come close to bioshock 1 and 2.

Все выполнено на высшем уровне, так что эту игру безоговорочно можно назвать Шедевром.\n   Сюжет - по канонам серии Bioshock очень кинематографичный, запутанный, но при это целостный. Он не отпустит тебя до конца игры, а концовка заставит задуматся. И уж точно вы будете скучать по главной героине-Элизабет, вокруг которой и строится весь сюжет.\n   [b]Геймплей[/b] - много разных видов оружия, особенно выделяется Аэрокрюк - оружие ближнего боя позволяющий пользоваться аэротрассами для перемещения по Колумбии. Энергетики (плазмиды) - напитки, дающие человеку сверхспособности которые есть в каждой части серии Bioshock, дающие призвать стаю воронов на врагов, оглушить их молнией, или просто столкнуть их с края Колумбии и т.д. В тоже время твой компаньон-Элизабет, не просто следует за тобой, во время боя её не надо защищать, но она может подкинуть тебе патроны (если их у тебя мало), аптечку и соли (ресурс для использования энергетиков), вне боя она находит деньги и отмычки и еще она первоклассный медвежатник (взломщик), в случае вашей смерти она вас поднимет на ноги.\n   Графика - очень красивая, красочная для игр 2013, выполненная в едином стиле, который способствует погружению в сюжет, но при этом очень хорошо оптимизированная под многие ПК.\n  Аудиосопровождение - в сочетании с графикой создает уникальный игровой мир, с неповторимой атмосферой.\n  Единственное что не очень понравилось, так это очень маленькая связь BioShock Infinite с первыми двумя играми серии.
