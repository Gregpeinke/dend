In fact, at first I registered on Steam solely just to play this game. My first username \"p-body\" also originated from Portal 2.\n\nI absolutely adore the concept of Portal and its sequel, navigating through puzzles using portals, cubes and other fun gameplay elements. The main mode of the game (singleplayer) has a simple, but thoroughly enjoyable plot. GLaDOS is one of my favourite antagonists in a video game. Portal and Portal 2 are both very important parts of internet and gaming culture.\n\nCo-op is also a fine addition to the game, giving two players even more puzzles and an interesting challenge: they have to work together to complete the tests and only together can they do that. I put countless hours into both parts of the game, having replayed the story about a dozen times and playing through co-op with many good steam friends of mine. In-fact, it was Portal 2 where I met most of my true steam friends who some of them I even know in real life.\n\nThen there's the third major part of the game: creating test chambers yourself. I'm gonna tell you something, I suck at it. Look through my workshop, I only created stupid things like a giant turret. However, people still really liked that concept and that's what made it so captivating for me. You can do great puzzles and share them, which others will appreciate and play them with an already deep dedication for the game. And, if you feel like doing a short story, Hammer is always at your side with all the tools necessary.","timestamp_created":1342190105,"timestamp_updated":1534259654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"183950","author":{"steamid":"76561197964442087","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":400,"last_played":1453214791},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegazo
