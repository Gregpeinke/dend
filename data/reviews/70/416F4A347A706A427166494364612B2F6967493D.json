This game has been utterly destroyed by the passage of time, every enemy is a bullet sponge, the platforming is the worst I have ever had to slog through in a video game.... even fans of the game say that the Xen levels \"arent as good\" as the previous ones when that is the understatement of the century. This game is so frustrating because Ive been told it is a masterpiece for years and to be truthful... I hate this game. All of the xen levels are ugly, vomit inducing I would go as far to say. The sound design is really great, its classic, there is a reason Valve continues to use these sounds in all of their games (other than laziness) and its because they are iconic. Still. this game isnt fun, I am someone that enjoys old games, ive beaten Quake, DOOM, DOOM 2, DOOM 64 but this game is just an absolute slog from start to finish, none of the guns do any damage, the entire game looks absolutely terrible visually and not just because its old but because everything blends in with each other. This game might have been good in 1998 but again, it doesnt hold up well at ALL where as the original doom game felt great with enemies having exactly as much health as they should along with guns feeling like they have an actual impact because of the amazing sound design and bullets making indents on enemies upon impact so you can see that they are connecting. This is not a review saying \"doom good half life bad\" this is just an example of how poor I think Half Lifes gunplay is. I dont know what else to say that I havent said already, horrible platforming, weak guns, bullet sponge enemies, ugly environments. The environmental story telling is great along with the atmosphere but the actual gameplay is so bad I do not recommend this game. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention the constant stuttering, crashing and destruction of save files!

Questo gioco L'ho scaricato e finito nell'arco di tre giorni, non giocandoci nemmeno tanto. Devo dire che da tutte le voci che giravano mi aspettavo molto di più. Il gioco presenta molti difetti tecnici: Glitch grafici, Audio pessimo per la prima metà del gioco (soprattutto nei \"dialoghi\"). Quando si utilizza una valvola/leva/pulsante c'era la possibilità di bloccarsi sul posto e toccava ricaricare il salvataggio. I movimenti sono scivolosi e fatti male (infatti spesso succedeva che scivolavo su un poligono e cadevo di sotto). Insomma un sacco di roba, ma il gameplay non è terribile, anzi, potrei dire che è l'unico elemento che si salva. Sono molto deluso e mi aspettavo MOLTO di più. \n\nVoto: 5/10. \n\n\"Sopravvalutato\"\n\nP.S non sto valutando il gioco per l'età ma per come è stato sviluppato, quindi niente commenti del tipo \"eh, ma è vecchio\", grazie.","timestamp_created":1590587515,"timestamp_updated":1639022543,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458333343267440796","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"69888692","author":{"steamid":"76561198157081226","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":43,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1561752620},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyunu 10 dakika oynadıktan sonra midem bulanmaya başlıyor, ateşim çıkıyor amk.

Osobiście polecam dzisiaj zagrać w to i poznać początek walki Gordona Freemana z wyłażącymi z portalu kosmitami i odkrycia prawdy o korporacji.
