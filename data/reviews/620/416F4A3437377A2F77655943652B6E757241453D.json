It takes all the building blocks from the first Portal and expands the basic ideas to every imaginable direction. It's mostly a good thing, but I did also get a feeling that the game could've easily been split into two separate games, which would've given every new gimmick a little bit more room to breathe. Now some of the neat new mechanics felt even somewhat underused, at least in the main story mode. There are also a bunch of fun co-op courses and some not-as-fun achievements tied to them, like time trials and no death challenges. But even if I have a few negative words from the package as a whole, all in all it's still an entertaining game that continues the legacy of the first part very nicely.","timestamp_created":1540325599,"timestamp_updated":1540580179,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45406028","author":{"steamid":"76561198082796312","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":2084,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1195,"last_played":1646424947},"language":"spanish","review":"Me ha gustado mucho este juego.
