I fell in love with Killing Floor since the first time I played it. There is a large variety of realistic weapons to choose from. You collect cash by killing monsters and at the end of every wave, you go to a shop and buy weapons, ammo, protective gear, and much more. There is also an objective mode where for each map has a unique objective to comlete while killing the monsters. Co-op is key in this game. If you go on solo mode, chances are, unless you are really good at this game or you are on easy mode, that you will die within the first three waves. Staying in groups and working together is the onlything that will lead to success. This game is amazing. The repetitivness in this game NEVER gets old. Shootin monsters with friends is always a blast. The graphics are not incredible, but they aren't terrible either. Overall, this game gets a solid 8.5 out of 10. I believe that anyone who enjoys co-op shooters will love this game.","timestamp_created":1388530617,"timestamp_updated":1388530617,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8467364","author":{"steamid":"76561198116246855","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2516,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1478943138},"language":"english","review":"Fun game, especially when you play with your friends.","timestamp_created":1388530051,"timestamp_updated":1388530051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8467338","author":{"steamid":"76561198037358778","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4512,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4385,"last_played":1389668635},"language":"english","review":"IM DELICOUS AND SO IS THIS GAME THANKS. 5 STARRS GG I LOVE YOU","timestamp_created":1388529948,"timestamp_updated":1388529948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8466495","author":{"steamid":"76561198082411907","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":115,"last_played":1422653862},"language":"hungarian","review":"Nagyon lekötő és izagalmas játék!\n\nHave Fun!","timestamp_created":1388527135,"timestamp_updated":1388527135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8465681","author":{"steamid":"76561198095063351","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2343,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":314,"last_played":1514001491},"language":"english","review":"A great zombie shooter, and just about any computer can run this game.","timestamp_created":1388524601,"timestamp_updated":1388524601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8465384","author":{"steamid":"76561198019048384","num_games_owned":493,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":8238,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8141,"last_played":1514234690},"language":"german","review":"; )","timestamp_created":1388523645,"timestamp_updated":1388523645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8465311","author":{"steamid":"76561197970635202","num_games_owned":684,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":3000,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2998,"last_played":1527307393},"language":"english","review":"I'M WELDIN' THIS DOAH!

The game's class system tends to be actually very fun, and it rewards long time players with some pretty nice bonuses for being high level. Sometimes the presence of level 6 players in a game can ruin it by making it impossible to get any kills, but generally the rewards for leveling up you classes are balanced and fun. There's a lot of room for creativity in ways to defeat the waves of mutants, and a door welding tool makes for great fun in doing so. Overall the gameplay is very solid.\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated, but it still manages to be really scary with the technology available. Based on the Unreal 2 engine, the game looks very much like a mod, but it is mostly visually attractive. Some of the levels can be entirely too dark and you have to really memorize their layouts before you can excel.\n\nI'd recommend this game to any fans of shooters (coop or otherwise) looking for something old-school but fresh.","timestamp_created":1388516444,"timestamp_updated":1388516444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8462614","author":{"steamid":"76561197997967637","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":11689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10356,"last_played":1577479753},"language":"spanish","review":"Es un juego que nunca deja de entretener.
