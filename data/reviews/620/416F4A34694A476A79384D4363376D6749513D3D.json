I loved replaying the game and feelings for the game didn't change much second time around. You could feel the creativy and planning they put in the game and the game gives a new feeling replacing the feeling of lonelyness but you feel betrayed at one point in the game and something bigger you have to handle, Challange. The game was somewhat challanging and the story line actaully enjoyed and wasn't confused, on the sort of joke they were going for. The diffcultly of the game wasn't too much of a hassle but wasn't a stroll through the park.

This is as much a puzzle game as it is an enticing narrative, where you, the player, make it all happen. It's beautifully written and designed. When you get stuck in the game, it's not because the environment or game engine is cheating you, it's because you aren't thinking with portals!\n\nI played this game because I had played the first one, loved it, and was anxiously awaiting its sequel. Admittedly, the first time I played Portal 2 was via a cracked copy. However, I wanted to play it again so badly, and determined the developers deserved my money, that I decided to pick it up. My girlfriend and I both enjoy the hell out of the Portal series, and the native controller integration means we can both game off my rig from the couch! 10/10! \n\nAlso, I was just recently made aware of this: there is a very beautifully designed map editor built right into the game, where you can help yourself to a myriad of highly rated maps, and design your own. It's not for the faint of heart, as the thought process that goes into designing a map is not the same one that goes into solving it. But it's very useful if, like me, you have a very young sister-in-law who wants to play your game, but the standard maps are too hard for her.","timestamp_created":1389845763,"timestamp_updated":1596227156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8724264","author":{"steamid":"76561198009430218","num_games_owned":912,"num_reviews":198,"playtime_forever":554,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":554,"last_played":1387336967},"language":"english","review":"“When life gives you lemons, don’t make lemonade.
