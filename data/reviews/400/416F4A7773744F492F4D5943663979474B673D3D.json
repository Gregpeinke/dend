is probably my pick for the best game ever. It's just perfect. The learning curve is consistent, since it won't really put the player in any state of real danger, and lets them have space to figure out how to progress through the game. I have heard many players whine about games nowadays having too many tutorials, and i can relate to those people. Holding the players hand all the fucking time will NOT get them excited to play the game, especially if you are pumping the player too much information on one go. But Portal, i can say 3/4 of the game is a tutorial. While it is REALLY SUBTLE, the different mechanics are delivered to the player one at a time, and are reminded of during the following test chambers. The challenge ramps up all the time, but just enough so that the player won't feel overwhelmed. Although the game is extremely linear, it doesn't hurt the experience. The atmosphere is also brilliant. The solid and pure parts of the test chambers don't give the player anything to get distracted, and the ambient music accompanying the levels also delivers the feeling that you ARE in a testing facility. The ladder parts of the game are also brilliant, keeping the player interested with showing the player what's going on \"behind the scenes\" of Aperture. There may be some parts that may leave you just pondering and pondering the puzzles, but those are few and far away and can be solved pretty quickly by just thinking outside the box. GlaDOS is the one of my favorite antagonists in video games, probably next to Vaas Montenegro from Far Cry 3. As a character, she was interesting. Who was she? Why did she choose me to do this puzzles? Why is it that she seems to angrier and angrier all through the game? Playing the game through a second time made me realize how subtle she was in delivering some negative and hateful comments towards me, but she was also much more than just a really angry AI. Plus Ellen McClain is a really great voice actor. While the game was really short, since you can beat it in about 2 or 3 hours, the game still left me feeling satisfied with the experience and hungry for more. Even though this game has gotten the praise it deserves and even more, i still can't stop loving it! Almost every single one of us have a game that we love so much, that they can always play it. No matter what time or what season of the year it is, they still can. Mine would absolutely be Portal. It's a game i can just launch on Steam and play through in a single run over and over and over and over again, but i still feel this warmth  inside me whenever i play it. It's that great.

It wound up becoming the most successful game of the lot.\n\nThe game was developed by a small team whom Gabe Newell imediately hired after seeing their previous work \"Narbacular Drop\", The precursor to Portal.\n\nSpoiling as little as possible: You are a woman named Chell who has awoken from what can only be assumed is a cryosleep in the Aperture Science Enrichment Centre. You are greeted by a voice called GLaDOS or \"Genetic Lifeform and Disc Operating System\" who tells you that you're about to take part in a serious of tests involving the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. (Or just the Portal Gun.)\n\nThe gameplay is simple. You guide Chell through a series of puzzles contained within the game's 19 test chambers with naturally progressing difficulty, though, the difficulty of the game as a whole isn't that bad, the puzzles aren't mind boggling and the closest thing you'll come to common enemies are these adorable white spherical turrets. The game runs on the Source Engine and it's acurate physics simulations. This is shown off in many of the game's mechanics most notably momentum based puzzles which like the rest of the game is sound. The game is quite easy once you know the solutions to the puzzles, beatable in just three hours on the first playthrough and if you're like me can be beaten in as little as 35 minutes when you decide to try and speedrun it. (or even less if you're persistent enough, I've seen people do it in as little as 9 minutes.) Don't worry about that first playthrough though, as you'll miss out on the game's fantastic writing and pacing if you do. Ellen McLain gives a brilliant performance as GLaDOS with well crafted dark humour anybody can enjoy.\n\nSPOILER TERRITORY AHEAD\nAfter all is said and done and you reach the end of Chamber 19 you're sent into an incinerator. Most of GLaDOS' dialogue up to this point sounded as though it could have been pre-recorded but it now becomes aparant she's been watching you the whole time and is aware of your escape after you... do that. You make your way through the less sterile maintenance areas of the facility with GLaDOS trying desperatley to convince you to go back with promise of cake. You eventually come across an office area after a turret battle and become ever more convinced that GLaDOS is the reason you've not met any other humans. You then cross a bridge into her chamber. The hulking machine now resorting to death threats. You then do battle, redirecting rockets through portals and into her body. You then incinerate some important pieces of her until she's destroyed. You're shown a brief glimpse of the outside world before being dragged back into Aperture's walls. The credits roll to \"Still Alive\" written by Jonathan Coulton. It's a sweet little tune, I'll leave it at that. Go listen to it yourself after beating the game.\nNOW LEAVING SPOILER TERRITORY\n\nThe game has 15 achievements for you to get in order to claim you've 100% complete the game. To get some you'll have to play through the game's extra modes. Challenge mode puts you back into a few chambers except trying to beat it under one of three conditions: Least Portals, Least Steps, Least Time. Getting every achievement will require some very good knowlege of the game's mechanics and the way the chambers are designed. Good Luck getting the Vanilla Crazy Cake achievement, this requires getting the highest rank for each challenge and for each chamber. The other mode are the Advanced Chambers. You're dropped back into chambers 13-18 except they've been made much harder to complete. To get the Aperture Science achievement you will need to beat all six.\n\nAfter you've done it all? Well. I'm kind. I shall now list some notable mods and map packs for Portal which you should definately give a look:\n\nMODS:\nVery hard logical puzzles: Portal Pro\nBullsh!t flinging puzzles: Portal Prelude\nSomething Different: Portal Unity\nGreat Aesthetics and New Mechanics: Blue Portals\nJust...
