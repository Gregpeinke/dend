Cependant, ce serait se mentir que de dire qu'il ne souffre d'aucun défaut.\n\nDéjà, graphiquement, à moins d'être resté coincé en 2007, Killing Floor est très largement dépassé : l'Unreal Engine 2, c'était bien en 2003/2004, mais malheureusement, en 2010, c'est plus vraiment ça : les modèles sont bien polygonnés, les animations sont un peu trop mécaniques et les textures un peu crade... Plutôt bof, donc. Heureusement , artistiquement, le jeu s'en sort bien, l'ambiance de fin du monde/apoclypse \"zombie\" est bien retranscrite et le level design est bien foutu avec des maps d'anthologie (mention spéciale aux cartes Farm ou Aperture).\n\nCôté sonore, c'est très mitigé, là aussi. Autant les musiques sont bien sympas, autant le doublage VF est juste catastrophique. Mais vraiment, hein, j'exagère pas : ne jouez pas en Français à ce jeu. La VO passe déjà mieux, même si c'est pas transcendant (carton rouge à la vendeuse, notamment).\n\nPour ce qui est de la jouabilité, eh bien là encore c'est bofbof. Autant les contrôles répondent bien, et les bugs sont peu nombreux, autant l'impossibilité de sprinter plombe vraiment le gameplay. Résultat, au lieu d'avoir un jeu bien nerveux, on a un jeu assez lent où va tenir des positions plutôt que de courir partout. C'est un peu déstabilisant pour être tout à fait honnète. La présence d'un Bullet Time est, elle aussi, très déstabilisante : si d'un côté celui-ci permet de faciliter sa visée lorsqu'un allié réussi un headshot, d'un autre côté, sa présence entraine très souvent des cassures de rythme (notamment en l'absence d'ennemis ou lorsque l'on recharge son arme).\n\nNiveau durée de vie, en revanche, y a vraiment de quoi faire : terminer toutes les maps dans tous les modes de difficulté et dans tous les modes de jeu demandera énormément de temps. Et cela, c'est sans compter les événements spéciaux qui se déroulent en été, pour Halloween et à Noël. D'ailleurs, à l'heure où sont écrites ces lignes, la communauté sur Steam est toujours très active : il n'est pas difficile de trouver et de rejoindre des serveurs publics et ceux-ci sont bien remplis. La communauté est d'ailleurs dans son immense majorité très sympa et très mature, ce qui n'est pas un mal vu que le jeu requiert de jouer très teamplay et de ne pas hésiter à partager son argent. Dernier petit point concernant les créations via le workshop : elles sont nombreuses et variées, là encore, y a de quoi faire.\n\nEn conclusion, Killing Floor est un jeu qui n'est certes pas exempt de défaut mais qui malgré tout vaut le détour, surtout lorsqu'il est joué en clan ou en team où il y a moyen de bien s'amuser. Cependant, ses graphismes totalement dépassés, sa VF complètement ratée et les quelques défauts dans son gameplay inciteront à attendre une promo pour acquérir ce jeu (parce que, bon, quand même, 20€, ça fait un poil cher).","timestamp_created":1390255435,"timestamp_updated":1390255435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":28,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.675140738487243652","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8788096","author":{"steamid":"76561198067110433","num_games_owned":398,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1400873011},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom jogo, bons gráficos e muitas armas para comprar.

British People vs Zombies: The game. Complete with Dosh, Heavy Metal, more stereotypical Brits than a Monty Python sketch, and over 32 of some of the beefiest, most satisfying Zed-killing weapons you'll encounter in a video game. There's even 'Loadsamoney' himself, Mr Harry Einfeld, present and accounted for to wreck the Zed menace. \n\nThis is a game where you need to play on a difficulty higher than 'beginner' to experience. The fun of this game comes from it's challenge, and while I can understand people liking their games as easy, simple fun, the real 'survival horror' elements of this game come out when you're up against tougher enemies. I personally don't find this game scary due to the undertone silliness from all the characters models and event Zeds, but I still have a lot of fun with this game.\n\nDespite coming out back in 2009, Tripwire Interactive have been supporting this game for the last 4 years, and with each update, event and DLC pack they've added, the game's got better and better! \n\nSo go ahead and pick up a copy of this now! Hell, get the 'bundle' copy which contains 90% of the game's DLC for only slightly more (trust me, most of it may be character models, but by god are they worth it).\nIf you ever wanted a video game equivalent of Shaun of the Dead, you need to play this.","timestamp_created":1390228909,"timestamp_updated":1390228909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.65048980712890625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8783267","author":{"steamid":"76561198081540507","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":434,"last_played":1647866234},"language":"english","review":"Killing floor is a awesome first person zombie shooter that has loads of zombies and loads of guns to kill them with.","timestamp_created":1390225671,"timestamp_updated":1390225671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498220652341842651","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8782573","author":{"steamid":"76561198102152333","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1533,"last_played":1456759502},"language":"russian","review":"Хороша игра))","timestamp_created":1390221399,"timestamp_updated":1390221399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8781817","author":{"steamid":"76561198072652930","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":5376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2983,"last_played":1546552646},"language":"russian","review":"Отличная игра, ничуть не хуже Left 4 dead, Убивает время.
