Using the H.E.V. Suit and whichever working weapons he finds, he will have to go to the world between dimensions named Xen and fight the leader of the alien riot. To do so, he has to navigate through a destroyed Black Mesa, going through the railway, the laboratories, and the surface, heavily guarded by the military aiming to kill the ones who made the supposed experiment, that including Gordon Freeman himself, and reach the Lambda Complex. By this description, it may sound like a short game. But it actually has quite the challenges. You'll need to crouch through tight areas, jump over hazardous liquids, and shoot everything you see. I consider this game to be a Shooting-Platformer, due to the amount of challenges required to take alternative routes through destroyed rooms requiring jumping skills.\nOh, and it also has a Multiplayer mode. I haven't played on it much, but it seems pretty good. Hence why there's also a mod for HL mainly based on Multiplayer, which is Counter-Strike. So good that it was even released as it's own game and sequels.\nIf you don't like the old-fashioned models, there is also a Free-to-download HD Pack.","timestamp_created":1360856739,"timestamp_updated":1360856739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4058337","author":{"steamid":"76561198031442822","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":685,"last_played":1368527886},"language":"english","review":"Outdated piece of shit, contains less jokes than its successors.","timestamp_created":1360787340,"timestamp_updated":1360787340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6027388","author":{"steamid":"76561198057510387","num_games_owned":285,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1514,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1654613035},"language":"russian","review":"Хоть и старая но класная можно играть по сети так и в оденочной игре графика хуже чем у Half Life 2 но всё же не гавно.

Add to that Valve made the brilliant choice to have no cut scene's.  That is to say your incontrol of the character at al times.  You feel responsable for all that happens in this game.  This game truly started the idea of making a first person  shooter as a story driven game.  There is a reason on ANY crediable best games of PC's  list the Half Life series on or near the top of any list of the best games of all time. Do your self a favor as a gamer. Pick this game up, and fall in love with that shooters can be..... and in my view ...SHOULD be.   An for those whom can not get past the dated grpahics but want to truly play this masterpiece I advise downloading Black Mesa which updates the game in a huge way with newer graphics while leaving the same brilliant story and game play intact, while offering some new voice acting and other changes in it's tribute. I can not say enough good things about this game, and implore anyone who loves story, immersion, to come try this game, and see why it has become so idolized and admired.  Then you can buy yourself Half Life 2, as well as its two episodes that follow and do then what millions upon millions of us are doing.

I first started gaming on a macbook pro and eventually I partitioned the hard drive and had it running windows in 2012, and then I finally got a PC in 2013. The point of this pointless backstory is to demonstrate how influential this game truly is. I am four months younger than Half Life itself, and yet this game has, to me, done more than stand the test of time. It was truly revolutionary in terms of story driven shooters. And what is even more incredible is that Half-Life is the first fps in which the player forms a profound connection to the protagonist, and without uttering a single word, Gordon Freeman becomes more than just a character to the player. \n\n     The player and Gordon become one, locked together in an enormous research facility under siege by not only aliens, but those who are expected to protect civilian life. Gordon must navigate an extremely hazardous environment filled with hostile aliens and soldiers. They must overcome the odds as one and survive a harrowing journey through the heart of the doomed research facility. Half-Life is completely driven by the player. There are no cutscenes. The player is constantly immersed in the game. It has a perfect blend of diverse and complicated level design, while simultaneously guiding the player in a particular direction without the player feeling constrained.  There are no hints.

The suit also shows your oxygen levels while you are under water or the power level of your torch.\n\nThe main type of enemies you will be fighting are aliens, there are also humans to fight as well.\n\nYou get a good range of weapons to use, from a pistol, to energy weapons.\n\nA really nice game to play, you should buy it, if you haven't already.","timestamp_created":1356611944,"timestamp_updated":1425211773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4984559","author":{"steamid":"76561198043939116","num_games_owned":1127,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":84,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":83,"last_played":1420198280},"language":"schinese","review":"1920*1080分辨率！全程中文语音哦！史上最帅男主角！来一发吧少年！","timestamp_created":1356502297,"timestamp_updated":1356502297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1826613","author":{"steamid":"76561197998501462","num_games_owned":585,"num_reviews":81,"playtime_forever":2589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":98,"playtime_at_review":1235,"last_played":1660493666},"language":"english","review":"Hands down everyone..

The enviourment is dark, the deaths are very abrupt, and the enimies are ruthless. Half-Life is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and constantly fueling the feeling of paranoia in the back of your mind. \n\nWhat makes this game so unique is the fact it is a puzzle in itself. This isnt like most of the other games that gave you your classic objectives and kicked you in the but expecting you to \"get er done\". Half-Life required that you used your mind to solve little escape puzzles. These puzzles ranged from, opening an oversized heater vent to activating oversized prones to a massive generator. \n\nNow, lets talk about the dangers. theres alot in half-life that wants to kill you. Oversized fans are sure to turn those bones into processed alien brunch, and lets not forgert about those \"Large falls of doom\" Miss a ledge and its a long way down complimented by a nice crunch and the sound of your heart monitor flat lining. \n\nOverall this is an amazing game that you must add to your collection. My step dad intoroduced me to it before he passed away, and I still find myself playing this game every now and then. I reccomend you play the game while listening to trance music, it makes it go so much smoother as my stepfather showed me.","timestamp_created":1356283334,"timestamp_updated":1356283334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6702584","author":{"steamid":"76561198072822597","num_games_owned":266,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":568,"last_played":1650322767},"language":"brazilian","review":"joguem todos os half-life trilogia  perfeita","timestamp_created":1356223184,"timestamp_updated":1385413834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1528882","author":{"steamid":"76561197994259337","num_games_owned":1388,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":150,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56,"last_played":1406481216},"language":"english","review":"The Classic Valve game!
