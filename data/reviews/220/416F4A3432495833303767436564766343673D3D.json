The structure of the game with its dialogue (which would be in cutscenes in modern day games, here you retain control over your character), characters, scripted events, and world building. In these regards it's a step up over its predecessor.\n\nIt's also a bit of a step up with its \"puzzle\" gameplay, which is really solving practical puzzles often with the aid of physics. The physics emphasis is greater in Half-Life 2 as it's a technological showcase in that regard, although these \"puzzles\" overall aren't the best of their kind.\n\nAs an actual FPS, Half-Life 2 largely omits the low resource, more survival oriented portions of the first game, and has vehicle sections instead. Both games have a bit more gameplay variety than the average shooter, with Half-Life 2 having claustrophobic CQB, larger scale outdoor gunfights, gunfights with allies so it's not just you, vehicle sections, some verticality. Again it isn't top tier in its diversity here, where Unreal is crowned, but it is adequate.\n\nBut compared to the first game, Half-Life 2 makes sacrifices to weapon diversity and most of all enemy diversity. For weapon diversity, Half-Life 2 is just average although one piece of equipment really aids it here, and that's the Gravity Gun being one of the coolest FPS weapon inventions ever. It lacks the more alien or higher tech Sci-Fi weapon design beyond this, although the first game's Hive-Hand is quite useless so not much is lost there. The trip mines were also quite useless. The satchel charges might be nice but aren't a requirement. \n\nAnd unlike the first game, every weapon retains some degree of usefulness here. The crowbar is always good against headcrabs, the pistol is always good for weaker enemies where you want to conserve ammo due to the SMG's inaccuracy. Every weapon has its use here, even if weapon design isn't brilliant overall.\n\nA bit more cleverness went into the level design of the first game. Route Kanal has some questionable, useless areas, Half-Life was weak when it came to having secret areas/pickups on levels but Half-Life 2 doesn't even try here, there's no real brilliance in any of its level design and NPCs can sometimes struggle to navigate it.\n\nThe levels are also artistically outdated. Half-Life 2 is mostly set in outdoor locations but there are often very obvious voids in out of bound areas, or very obvious low quality filler models and textures just outside of the playable area. The outdoor maps never feel like real places and instead they always feel like old FPS video game maps, a weakness Half-Life doesn't have. Thankfully Cinematic Mod remedies this for Half-Life 2.\n\nAs everybody knows by now, Half-Life 2 and Source Engine in general retains the awkward, clunky slidey movement from GoldSource, but you're even floatier now. The lack of movement precision and responsiveness along with the ability to get stuck on light physics objects ensures that Half-Life 2 gameplay never flows particularly smoothly. You're slipping and sliding around and engaging in overall mediocre combat design.\n\nUltimately this is a solid game that, like its predecessor, is overrated considering the most loved thing about it is really its presentation. But it does craft a cool dystopian future with memorable characters, the Gravity Gun, and some fun physics related gameplay even if it never reaches the brilliance of some later games in this regard (like FEAR, Dark Messiah, and Crysis). \n\nEpisode 1 is more of the same from Half-Life 2, a necessary expansion to the story with no gameplay improvements or decline. Episode 2 has slightly better combat encounters and introduces Hunters and Advisors which are nice to have.\n\nI highly recommend anyone playing this game, first time or no, to use MMod 1.3 + Cinematic Mod 2013. This merge keeps the unwanted Cinematic Mod features out of the game and keeps its excellent graphics and artistic level design improvements, and MMod makes undeniably superior gameplay enhancements and is very configurable.\n\n[h3]Strengths[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Highly physics enabled world\n\n[*]Interesting dystopian future setting with some memorable characters\n\n[*]The Gravity Gun is one of the coolest weapons ever designed\n\n[*]AI is advanced, albeit held back a bit too much\n\n[*]Moderately diverse gameplay for an FPS\n\n[*]Super moddable with some incredible mods, plus strong options configuration and a powerful console/terminal\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Weaknesses[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Floaty, slidey movement doesn't feel good and lacks precision especially since you can get stuck on light physics objects, ladders are unreliable as is jumping out of water\n\n[*]Extremely clunky vehicle sections that drag on for too long\n\n[*]Enemy variety is lacking, even compared to the first game which isn't excellent here\n\n[*]Weapon diversity is lacking overall\n\n[*]Weapon switching was always unnecessarily clunky with its two-step process design. It only binds weapons to the 1-5 keys so you will have many weapons bound to one key. To switch, you press the key up to several times depending on the weapon you want to select, and then press LMB, opposed to the classic \"press one key to equip a weapon\" or weapon wheel designs which are much faster and more efficient.\n\n[*]Player weapon accuracy is too poor considering how aimbotty and spongey Combine are, the lack of good cover shooter mechanics for those sections (leaning, iron sights), and the lack of any skill curve and creative design to weapons besides the gravity gun. Just pray and spray. Not unlike the first game though weapons are even less accurate here, further cementing Half-Life 2's FPS gameplay as just mediocre.\n\n[*]Weapons feel ineffectual due to no recoil (fake recoil, no actual change in dispersion or muzzle climb when spamming the two full auto guns) and bullet spongey enemies who are not reactive to shots. You'll just be mag dumping them with the SMG or even pulse rifle while they stand there taking it, not trying to avoid your shots and not flinching or reacting to them in any meaningful way. Compare this to actual challenging battles with responsive guns and enemies in games like Unreal and Doom and Quake and even Turok 2, and it's really bad.\n\n[*]Frag grenade throwing arc is awkward and not ideal\n\n[*]Gravity Gun can't be used to force open doors\n\n[*]The AI is better than it appears in-game due to some restrictions which make the game too easy\n\n[*]AI, especially Combine, will sometimes brain fart at close range and not do anything, and their movement in combat is extremely limited. They always rush you making them very predictable, and they generally don't care to take cover. They will stand out in the open hosing you down while being hosed down, not really reacting to your shots.\n\n[*]Combine AI is grenade spammy to the point where they just frag themselves and take care of much of the work for you\n\n[*]Level design is weak in detail and sorely lacking in secrets and never achieves brilliance. You always feel like you're in dated video game maps rather than real places, unlike the first game.\n\n[*]Maps appear visually unfinished with obvious voids or throwaway textures and models right outside of the playable area (fixed by Cinematic Mod)\n\n[*]Still encourages some degree of cover shooting, even if not as much as the first game, yet has no leaning or iron sights\n\n[*]Surround spatialization is bad and uneven\n\n[*]Long in-game loading times\n\n[*]Obviously a minor complaint but breakable crates not containing pickups are totally empty, whereas in the first game they at least had junk items/props in them\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1344281287,"timestamp_updated":1598147493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"675984","author":{"steamid":"76561197975132018","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1001,"last_played":1429457149},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games in history, hands down.

I felt that the game was just a engine tech demo, but thats what Lost Coast was for.\n\nI'm actually glad I played through it finally. The story is interesting but not enough for me to actually care about it.\n\nThe gameplay is almost standard FPS, but takes a different approach and instead of being a generic run and gun shooter, you can use objects in the environments to make intresting kills. Also there is no regenerating health, well, aside from when you get poisoned by a posionous headcrab. Forcing you to not just run into and get hurt carelessly because you need to find health packs to recover.\n\nThe game environment is interesting because every now and then, instead of just going guns blazing through the entire game, you have to solve puzzles, which is the best way I could describe, to progress through certain parts of the game. This itself makes the game interesting enough to play it because the puzzles aren't challenge and require the use of the engine's physics. It's sort of fun.\n\nThe game's graphics haven't changes that much, aside from the source engine's updates giving it motion blur and some bloom. It still has really great graphics and runs really smooth without blowing up your computer. Still probably the best facial animations and graphics for its time.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone that has a Steam and to play this game at least once.","timestamp_created":1342992190,"timestamp_updated":1454371743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5913494","author":{"steamid":"76561198055972026","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":725,"last_played":1586120715},"language":"english","review":"Just an awesome game to be honest :D","timestamp_created":1342989182,"timestamp_updated":1342989182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1552361","author":{"steamid":"76561197994608892","num_games_owned":568,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":944,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":944,"last_played":1372922269},"language":"english","review":"It's half life 2.
