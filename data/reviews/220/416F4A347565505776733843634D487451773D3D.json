though its not as good as the first Half-Life, it's still pretty much an excellent game in its own right and still holds up  Very Well in terms of Graphics and Gameplay.\nEveryone on Steam should have this and the 1st Game in their Library IMHO.\n\nPros+\n+Good Storyline, a Great Tour De Force IMO.\n+Likeable and Lively Characters.\n+Best Character Facial Expressions I've ever seen in a Game.\n+Good and Clever Puzzles, especially the ones that involve use of the Gravity Gun (One of the Best Video Game Guns IMO).\n+Lots of Great Mods like Black Mesa, SMOD, and Underhell for Example\n\nCons- \n-I thought the Enemy Variety was lacking, you fight Combine Soldiers and Synths for most of the Game, and you hardly encounter the Xen Aliens (Save the Headcrab and their Zombie Hosts) from the Last Game (I miss the Houndeye and Bullsquids ;_;).\n-Compared to the Last Game, the Arsenal felt Generic (The Pulse Rifle was a pretty cool Weapon, though I wish they kept the Tau Cannon or Gulon Gun from the Last one).\n\nNo matter what I didn't like about this, it gets a

It was the first Valve game I ever had the privilage to play back in 2009 when I managed to get a hold of the Orange box for PS3 and since then I still cite it as an example of how to  *Almost* make a perfect game. \n\nThis opinion was amplified recently when I finally got my hands on the original Half Life for the first time and was left quite cold by its set up. Half Life 2 is a perfect example of a sequal surpassing it's original (In my opinion) graphically it recieved a big upgrade, the controls; refined, elegant almost perfect. Gone are the long LONG periods of time spent silently wandering down quiet, empty, repeating corridors and instead we have dialogue; Good dialogue and as if to go further good dialogue that doesnt outstay its welcome. \n\nif half life invented a story, Half Life 2 invented a Universe with Gordon this time exploring a wide and varying world, multiple locations and plenty of hidden goodies to keep even the most avid gamer busy for a good while. The Physics engine has seen a significant upgrade and for the time it was simply revolutionary (Although after the first 3-4 physics based puzzles it does get a bit overbearing) The enemys have also been refined somewhat, The large amount of Aliens and gunmen have been refined to around a dozen overall in game enemys and for me this works fine it helps create a stronger consistency and really feels quite natural. \n\nThere are frustrating moments in the game, but nothing ever feels completely out of your reach and the boating and Car sections are a further welcome addition to the series, Although I personally felt the Boating sections did go on just a little bit to long. \n\nI shouldnt have to try and sell this game to you, my review is only going to be added to the high pile of positive reviews this game has already earned itself. It's simply a must play game and definately worth a place in your library, It's a different beast to anything Valve had released before and is quite simply; Magnificent.","timestamp_created":1441030747,"timestamp_updated":1441030747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17812948","author":{"steamid":"76561198171925573","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":995,"last_played":1588123674},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2 is a First-Person shooter developed by Valve, and is considered one of the greatest games of all time... with good reason.
