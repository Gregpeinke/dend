If you want my opinion this is it:\nImagine a 90 year old man who owns a $150K custom made Viper. He can't drive it, he won't let anyone drive it or even come close to it. He pays a fortune to a mechanic to keep it maintained and in full working order, top notch and HE CAN'T even drive it to test it. That's what bioshock infinite is to me a HUGE waste of god-awesome potential.\n\nI wanted the game they showed in the first trailers. So I wanted $1 million worth of platinum and instead I got $1 million worth of gold. Both awesome and equal worth but...... I wanted the platinum.\nThe remove a lot of awesome features and stuff to replace it with a lot of OTHER awesome features and stuff, again, I was hoping/waiting for the original set of awesome features (i.e: how elizabeth was more proactive support in earlier versions instead of being passive support, which is awesome too [why not both tho?])\n\nI am personally dissapointed because I did not receive what I expected but I still got an AWESOME freaking game. It is the reason why I am even writting this review. I am so passionate about how exceptional this game is and how much WASTED potential it has that makes me mad how Irrational games did not take advantage of it. Instead make way for DLC featuring shit from our earlier and FAR better and FAR more successful game in Rapture. Really? in order to unf*ck yourselves you need Andrew Ryan's help from the previous game to please your fans? NO! Infinite has litterally INFINITE potential on its own. The story is FAR from over. If you need help with this, ask the Luteces. \n( I would love to see a DLC where they show, for example, the alternate universe where booker joins the vox. That is litterally 1 new hole game right there)\n\nHELLO!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????

The best advice for a new player is this: take it slow. Do not rush through the game, listen carefully to everything the characters say, and try your best to find ALL of the voice recordings as they add a lot to the backstory. The final sequence of the game is difficult to comprehend at first, though the developers probably could have made it a little less confusing.

Лично мне, как постоянному клиенту давно не хватало ощущения \"кина\", того ощущения в котором ты полностью погружаешься в произведение и отдаешься на волю разработчикам. По приходу новой ветки BioShock в моем сознании появляется новое понятие - \"игрокартина\". Дело в том, что в наше время мы редко можем увидеть взаимосвязь кина и игры, также редко вливаемся в сюжет с головой, чувствуя на себе каждую эмоцию героя. Но BioShock Infinite явилось новым веянием, сравнимое лишь со снисхождение бога на землю. Учавствуя в игре, ощущаешь свое присутствие на сцене, будто бы это ты на месте Букера Дэвитта попадаешь в историю, переплетенной секретами и тайнами. И эта роль не кажется странной, даже наоборот представляешь себя неистовым Гамлетом, рвущимся на сцену.\nЭлизабет - героиня Bioshock, сравнимая с многогранным алмазом, где каждую грань человек определяет сам. В нее невозможно не влюбиться. Ее красота  - не зыблема, ее душа - недостижима. Никакая другая героиня так не симпотизировала мне, как Элизабет.\nИмею обязательство отметить кропотливую работу художников и аниматоров за антуражность, а также нобыкновенность мира под именем \"Колумбия\". Впервые увидев это, я просто не мог поверить своим глазам, настолько они меня обманывали? Моему счастью не было предела. Я был уверен, что любой человек обязан оценить этот бесспорно титанический труд. Браво! \nПриводя цепочку синонимов, относящуюся к данной игре, хотелось бы выделить несколько слов: любовь, бесчеловечность, гуманность, боль, скорбь, сожаление, двуличность, вера, надежда, одухотворенность, жизнь. Взгляните на эти слова, в каждое из них я вложил частицу своей души, о которой я не сожалею. \nВы наверное ждете деталей, какую-либо определенную оценку элементам игры. Поймите, здесь это не имеет никакого значения. BioShock Infinite - это книга, где каждый символ, букву вы увидите по своему.

Кен Левайн сотворил просто таки уникальную игру! Скажу честно во время просмотра концовки у меня просто отвалилась челюсть от происходящего. Конечно сюжет это очень сильная сторона игры, сам шутер также очень хорошо выглядит и играется просто отлично. В игре огромное количество врагов и способов их уничтожения, разные виды оружия и 8 плазмидов, плюс своеобразные \"опасности\" окружающего мира. Короче говоря геймплейная составляющая на высоте. Соглашусь, что Bioshock Infinite самый лучший шутер 2013 года! В этой игре класно все: история, персонажи, мир и самое главное атмосфера. К тому же Элизабет сопровождает игрока почтит все время, она не нуждается в защите и всегда готова помочь монеткой, аптечкой или же патронами. Кстати умереть невозможно: Элизабет делает волшебный укол, который полностью восстанавливает здоровье и дает небольшое количество патронов, зато отнимает немного денежек.

No es revolucionario pero añade, lo que sumado a la mejora de la historia, convierte el juego en recomendable.\n\n16 horas de juego me ha llevado, más de lo que me llevó el 1.","timestamp_created":1389485975,"timestamp_updated":1389485975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8670775","author":{"steamid":"76561197995891996","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":852,"last_played":1385527849},"language":"english","review":"Gaming of the highest order.","timestamp_created":1389485687,"timestamp_updated":1389485687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8670712","author":{"steamid":"76561198065646111","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1058,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":760,"last_played":1405028166},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite is easily one of the most beautiful games I have played in a long time.

There is so much that is good about this game, but it is so blatantly biggoted against everyone that is religious. As you find out more about the backstory of the main villain, you come to find out that the ONLY thing that made him become evil was becoming religious, and it unflinchingly portrays everyone who is religious as evil zealots committed to controling everyone in the name of their faith and murdering anyone who resists. If you are even slightly religious, I'd steer clear.

Besonders gegen Ende war ich besonderns gespannt. Das Finale des Spiels hat mich einfach fasziniert und war genial. Seit langem habe ich kein Spiel mehr in diesem Genre gespielt, das eine Story so gut erzählen konnte und dabei auch noch spielerisch sehr gut war. Kommen wir nun zu den Pro und Contras des Spiels:\n\nPro:\n+ 10-13 Stunden Spielzeit\n+ Packende Story\n+ Gutes Waffenarsenal (persönlicher Favorit: Präzisionsgewehr)\n+ Gute kleinere und größere Bosskämpfe\n+ Einige verschiedene Gegnertypen\n+ Elizabeth sucht Munition, Geld, Heilung und Salze und gibt eventuell Hinweise\n+ Erkunden lohnt sich\n+ Gutes Leveldesign\n+ Einige abwechslungsreiche Missionen\n\nContra:\n- Manche Missionen sind hingegen etwas in die Länge gezogen, was aber nicht weiter schlimm ist\n- KI ist nicht immer perfekt, aber ausreichend gut\n- Ein paar Waffen sind verhältnismäßig schlecht\n\nAlles in allem bot mir Bioshock Infinte das klassiche Bioshock Feeling, gemixt mit etwas neuem. Einfach grandios!\n\nMeine Wertung 91/100\nKlare Kaufempfehlung!","timestamp_created":1389482905,"timestamp_updated":1434465876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8670125","author":{"steamid":"76561198085025266","num_games_owned":362,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":444,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":224,"last_played":1515917203},"language":"english","review":"AWSOME its run of the best games i havve playd and by already 2 hour's in the game i said THIS GAME IS SO AWSOME like i said it is one of the mode best gamess i have ever playd so i hope you guys get this game its realy fun and have fun!","timestamp_created":1389482216,"timestamp_updated":1389482216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpIHmwcMCfbqJIQ=="}
