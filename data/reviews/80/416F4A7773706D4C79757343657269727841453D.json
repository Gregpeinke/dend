It's a formula so ingrained in FPS games for many years afterwards - competitive, repetitive, harsh, unforgiving, simplistic, multiplayer/team-oriented, wrapped in a modern military flavour at that time only prior seen in a few games such as Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (1998) and Le's own \"Navy SEALs\" Quake mod. Later, gamers would see how Counter-Strike's game modes and style would be copied by common games such as Sudden Attack (2005) and CrossFire (2007). In many cases, these games would even copy Counter-Strike's map layout, e.g. Sudden Attack's \"Desert 2\" is clearly a remake of Counter-Strike's de_dust2. Often these games are referred to as \"clones\" or \"ripoffs\" of Counter-Strike, even though they are quite distinct in their own way - especially in being geared towards a \"pay to win\" model, and blurring the lines between in-game currency and real money. Counter-Strike became a Valve product once Le and co-creator Jess Cliffe were hired by Valve, and since then, subsequent titles have been conservative (changing little of the gameplay, with most of the changes being graphical improvements) innovations on their original work, though CS:GO effectively \"monetizes\" the Counter-Strike formula as the various Asian (especially South Korean) \"clones\" and \"ripoffs\" have in the past. \n\nThe premise of these games is rather simple - players are random combatants on a team in a series of brief military engagements (a match) repeating themselves in the same map. Each match is comprised of multiple rounds, and the team winning the majority of these rounds wins the match. After each round the map is effectively reset. In Counter-Strike, each match begins with players joining the T (red/terrorist) or CT (blue/counter-terrorist team). One team has a goal, the other team's goal is to effectively prevent them from achieving that goal. For example, in maps marked \"de\" (Bomb Defusal), such as \"de_dust\" or \"de_dust2\", a random T will spawn with a \"C4\" object which must be planted (by any T) at one of two bombsites. CT's must prevent the bomb from being planted (by killing the carrier before they are able to plant it, or defusing the C4 within 45 seconds of its successful planting). In Counter-Strike, all players start each round from a practically clean slate except money or weapons carried over from a previous round - there is no long-term progression or persistent items. Instead, items are bought with $ accrued from winning/losing rounds, killing enemies and other in-game actions. Some of these items differ by team - e.g. the illustrious AK-47 (weapons are known by different names in-game) - is exclusive to the Terrorists. Generally a unique item on one team will be countered by another on the opposing team, e.g. the M4A1 is exclusive to the CTs. \n\nCounter-Strike is largely about the speed and precisity of one's aim - weapon accuracy is heavily reduced by movement and automatic fire, and body shots are significantly weaker than headshots. This means that the game boils down to shooting heads as fast as possible. More proficient players will increase the chance of their team winning the round, and they will have higher incomes to attain better weapons and gear. This means that matches are hard to turn around once a team has an upper hand - since a losing team will largely be confined to weapons that are arguably underbalanced, as evidenced by the fact that only a subset of the game's content is frequently used, and players begin quitting due to the notable lack of respawns till a round's end. Most players will stick to a handful of weapons and new players will find themselves encountering players who use part of this subset almost all the time - the AK-47, M4A1, P90, AWP and Deagle in particular. Some weapons like the Grenade and MAC-10 are so useless that sticking with default pistols likely gives players are a better chance, especially as refraining from buying weapons whilst being on the winning team is likely the fastest way to accrue $. \n\nAs the second iteration of Counter-Strike, CS:CZ uses the same, aged GoldSrc engine. There are minor map changes unique to CZ, but the game otherwise retains the same graphical ugliness largely missing from its sequels. CS:CZ includes the little known \"Deleted Scenes\", several single-player missions with no connection to eachother. The game can't run higher than 100FPS without issues. Sounds are largely Jess Cliffe's intentionally muffled voice along with low-quality gun sound recordings. UI is minimalistic and utilitarian. I have found no obvious stability issues. There are no \"safe spaces\" to allow new or deficient players to self-segregate, no tutorials. However, CS:CZ (unlike CS, but like CS:S and CS:GO) include AI opponents (\"bots\") which allow players to simulate most of the aspects of online-gameplay without the hassles of embarrassment, lag, long waiting times upon death (use bot_kill once you are dead), etc. Bot matches allow players to gain familiarity with the weapons, game modes and maps. Game content is all upfront - no DLCs, nothing locked by paywalls or time. I have not played enough in recent times to comment on the level of hacking/glitching or whether CS:CZ has an active player base. \n\nIn general, CS games are likely best enjoyed with friends playing cooperatively. There are reasons that I might recommend CS:CZ when it's highly discounted - if you're a fan of the CS formula and curious about the series' origin, you don't mind underwhelming single-player content and \"Deleted Scenes\" appeals to you, or if your hardware is too deficient to play modern games properly. CS 1.6 was after all very popular in countries with low rates of computer ownership, where \"net cafes\" tend to be bustling. However, most players will be much happier with the better-looking, more refined Source Engine found in CS:S, or if a large player base and an in-game market are more appealing, then you should simply go to, or stick with, CS:GO. In the vast majority of cases, I recommend any curious reader of this review familiar with the later CS iterations to remain with them, and to instead sate their own curiosity with a YouTube video rather than a purchase they will likely regret. Here are a few of my own (note that the Elite bot difficulty is very punishing in CS:CZ), though there are plenty of gameplay videos that will suffice:\n\nCS:CZ:
