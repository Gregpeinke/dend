of levels on which we will have to use our creativity (more or less) in order to complete the levels, even tho there's only one way to complete all the levels.\n\nAfter spending 2 hours into the game, I felt bored throughout the rest, since it goes with the same pattern, solve the puzzle, go to the next one, solve the puzzzle, go to the next one, on and on.\n\nThe story itself goes more deeeper than the game actually tells you, it goes along with you with a lot of dialogues coming out of the companions you meet along the way, but don't expect them to tell you what exactly happened, take all of the information and make a conclution yourself.\n\nI recommend this game to all new players and experienced players who haven't tried it yet, it's a classic I would say everyone must go through, try not to miss it!","timestamp_created":1600041847,"timestamp_updated":1600041847,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75934259","author":{"steamid":"76561198071429221","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3787,"last_played":1600027553},"language":"french","review":"très
