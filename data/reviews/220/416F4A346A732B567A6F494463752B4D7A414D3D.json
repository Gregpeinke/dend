Если вам не жалко пару минут своей жизни и если вы еще не играли и хотите узнать чуть больше об игре, то прочитайте и узнаете чуть больше. \n\nПлюсы: эмбиент прекрасен(особо в рейвенхольме), сама игра довольно атмосферная и можно сказать депрессивная и что выхода нет, нет смысла сопротивляться и т.д и т.п, сюжет и лор, есть эмоции на лицах персонажей(они иногда бывают смешными но они все же есть), физика предметов(можно использовать предмет подпорку или как плот и как оружие чтоб убить врага и это может быть намного эффективней если из оружия у вас ничего нет или мало патронов), вода для 2004 года просто прекрасна и огонь тоже прекрасен, разные виды врагов, довольно много оружия(для 2004), довольно много загадок которые помогут вам облегчить игру, окна(когда их ломаешь они не сразу ломаются и пропадают, от них отламываются кусочки), добавили новый интерфейс, блин это же продолжение конечно это плюс, хоть игра и коридорная но она не скучная, легкие достижения и это повод их всех выполнить. Но почти все проблемы можно решить с помощью чего? Правильно модов, игра имеет очень-очень много различных модификаций(как мелкие доработки так и огромные изменения в плане дизайна карт и сюжета, люди делают свои сюжеты).\n\nМинусы: сама графика устарела, стрельба говно, иногда были баги когда играешь на геймпаде, русская озвучка говнище, искусственный интеллект как по мне плох(они просто могут бежать на вас, может быть кинут гранату это максимум), ну музыка тут не особо хороша(хотя и минусом это особо не назвать), вас никогда не угостят пивом.\n\nЯ рекомендую к покупке.

Having grown up with a generation of games that were released well after HL2, and took MANY notes, playing it well over a decade after its release was odd. With gunplay that felt lacking in impact, and modelling/texture work that just felt *slightly* subpar to the time, (which is a massive testament to how advanced they were for 2004) I walked away feeling underwhelmed. Coming back to the game, once again almost a decade later, my initial reactions have been completely overridden. Keep in mind that I came back to HL2 using MMOD. With MMOD installed HL2's gunplay is perfect, and most of the issues I had with combat are gone.\n\n       A lot of reviewers online imply that HL2 has been eclipsed by it's own influence on the gaming landscape. I agree with this to an extent. Games like Bioshock, Dead Space, Dishonored, Destroy all Humans, F.E.A.R. TONS of games really ran with the physics sim sandbox after HL2 proved that it could be done. These games pushed Half Life's ideas and in some areas did it better. Now? It feels like the industry doesn't really care about the concept anymore. What should have been turned into a standard, left as a gimmick. We get remakes of these games, sure, but coming back to HL2 feels like a breath of fresh air. Not to fall into the, \"new thing bad/old thing good.\" mentality, but playing HL2 again makes me feel like a piece of the world is gone. It also really shows how much these devs cared. People can argue about valve politics all day, but the love that was poured into Half Life 2 was something special.","timestamp_created":1660562451,"timestamp_updated":1660562451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120665126","author":{"steamid":"76561198836896364","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":632,"playtime_at_review":784,"last_played":1660558112},"language":"turkish","review":"degdi\n","timestamp_created":1660558119,"timestamp_updated":1660558119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120665024","author":{"steamid":"76561199146378287","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":287,"playtime_at_review":246,"last_played":1660610731},"language":"english","review":"full-life","timestamp_created":1660557907,"timestamp_updated":1660557907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120664400","author":{"steamid":"76561199139129138","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1806,"playtime_last_two_weeks":72,"playtime_at_review":1806,"last_played":1660556771},"language":"english","review":"TIS

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I...

es el ser más poderoso de universo. En primer lugar, según la altura de un minion (que es de 3.5 pies en promedio) gru tiene 4 minions de alto, lo que significa que tiene un tamaño divino de 14 pies de alto (4.27 metros). En segundo lugar, si alguno de ustedes recuerda en la primera de mi villano favorito, sabrían que hay una escena en la que vector secuestra a las 3 chicas y dispara una serié de misiles en busca de calor a gru y los esquiva todos. Según la velocidad de un misil balístico promedio (3060 km /h) y el tamaño del misil según el tamaño de su tobillo, gru puede percibir y moverse a una velocidad tal que los misiles parecen moverse solo a 15 km /h. Por último, cuando gru golpea mas tarde a un tiburón, lo paraliza. Esto significa que probablemente le rompió la columna vertebral. Se requería una fuerza de 3000 newtons para fracturar la columna, que es igual al impacto creado por un automóvil de 230 kg que se estrella contra una pared a 50 km /h. Gru puede levantar la luna, que tiene una masa de 7.34767309 x 1022 kilogramos (1.61988463 x 1023 libras). Cuando esta en la tierra, lo sostiene con una mano y evita cualquier tipo de interferencia gravitacional. A partir de esto, esta claro que gru puede manipular las partículas fundamentales del universo, gravitones en este caso. Sin mencionar que construyó un mini-cohete completamente funcional con chatarra cuando era niño (ni siquiera un adolecente). Para alcanzar la velocidad de escape de la tierra, su cohete debe haber sido capaz de viajar a mas de 11.2 km /s (25,000 mph), lo que significa que comprimió la tecnología de la NASA en el tamaño de una silla.El coeficiente intelectual promedio de un científico de cohetes es de aproximadamente 130 o más, y para que gru construya un cohete del tamaño de una silla a, digamos, 10 años, debe tener un coeficiente intelectual muy superior a 130.No es irracional decir que podría estar en el rango de mas de 200.","timestamp_created":1660486482,"timestamp_updated":1660486482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120613457","author":{"steamid":"76561199193073629","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":441,"playtime_last_two_weeks":141,"playtime_at_review":441,"last_played":1660470852},"language":"russian","review":"топ","timestamp_created":1660481405,"timestamp_updated":1660481405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120612594","author":{"steamid":"76561199063301965","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":899,"last_played":1657092405},"language":"english","review":"I got killed by my own Airboat flying right at my forehead","timestamp_created":1660480289,"timestamp_updated":1660480289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4js+VzoIDcu+MzAM="}
