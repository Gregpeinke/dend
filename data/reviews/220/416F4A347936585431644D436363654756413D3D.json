I wasn't expecting much, but then when I played them, I was just ultamitely shocked at how great they were. This game is brilliant. I've seen graphics before this game, and this game was just a huge jump forward. One big step for Gamers, one big leap for Gamer kind. The game combines great story and gameplay just as Half Life did. The only thing I didn't like about this game, is I found it too easy compared to the first one. Another thing is the lack of horror. There is one part of the game with horror and great difficulty, but I won't spoil this game. I highly recommend it. 9/10","timestamp_created":1458878957,"timestamp_updated":1458878957,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22033521","author":{"steamid":"76561197980099785","num_games_owned":748,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":551,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1514692663},"language":"english","review":"VERY GOOD GAME","timestamp_created":1458867875,"timestamp_updated":1458867875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y6XT1dMCcceGVA=="}
