The best things Half-Life has to offer is its great level design, its fun, different and rememberable weapons and the variety of enemies and aliens you fight against. The voice acting and the few bugs that occur at some points are probably the only things I can criticise about this game. The enemy soldiers sound like kids roleplaying spies on a super-duper secret mission that comment everything they do by screaming it out loudly which is absolutely hillarious. \nTo prevent bugs from screwing over your game it is advised to save every 5 minutes or so to be on the safe side. (Quick safe and quick load are a great way for doing so effctively)\nThe story is very well done and I love its connection through the two DLCs where you get to see other perspectives on what happend at Black Mesa facility and around it. In my opinion it is by far the best story-driven FPS of that time.\nI can definitely see why people like this game and the DLCs so much because if you´re willing to pay attention to the story and you know how the physics in these games work you´ll get ~15 hours of playtime you won´t regret investing in.\n\n[b] TIPS: [/b]  \nTake your time. There are many secret areas to discover that contain extra ammo, health packs or new weapons you would´t receive otherwise (That also goes for breaking all breakable boxes). Meleeing dead bodies lets you obliterate them at sonic speed which is really fun. My favourite weapon is the double-barreled shotgun which lets you shoot two bullets at the same time when right-clicking, it´s really strong at close range.

While some FPS games were going full 3D, and the Build Engine games were going fully interactive, along came Valve to bridge the two design philosophies. What they created changed gaming forever, and even today, more than twenty years later, there are still aspects of it that just boggle the mind, from it's \"one singular level\" transitions, to extremely fun combat against the soldiers, and some amazing set pieces like the tentacle in the silo and the entirety of Surface Tension, this game is almost perfect. Almost... Towards the end, you go to Xen, the alternate dimension that has been feeding in aliens to the Black Mesa facility. Here, the design quality drops off of a cliff and into an active volcano. It's sprawling and labyrinthine, very confusing, and full of some borderline unfair combat encounters. But the majority is so good that if you haven't played it, you're doing yourself a disservice.

Imprescindible no tenerlo dentro de tu colección. A pesar de los años lo vuelvo a instalar y me divierte jugarlo tanto como la primera vez.\n\nHalf life, este maravilloso juego que fue en su momento revolucionario e hizo a día de hoy uno de culto entre los fans.\nSu historia es interesante ya que no te la cuentan a través de cinemáticas y tienes el control sobre Freeman durante todo el juego (bueno casi), tienes que jugar hasta al final para sacar tus conclusiones pero no fue eso lo que revolucionó de este juego sino de la interacción con los personajes es decir la inteligencia artificial, porque durante los años 90 juegos como Quake, Duke Nukem o Doom eran de matar y nada mas pero en Half life es diferente aparte de que puedes golpear a los aliados también puedes interactuar con ellos pudiendo hacer que te acompañen o hablar con ellos.\n\nGráficamente a día de hoy esta un poco desfasado pero sigue siendo atractivo con unos gráficos que eran muy buenos en su momento aunque si es verdad que el modelaje de los personajes están bastante repetidos y se hubiera agradecido un poquito más de variedad. Pese a eso si tiene variedad en cuanto escenarios y su ambientación es el mejor apartado de este Half Life.\n\nEl sonido no me ha acabado de convencer, el doblaje en español no esta mal pero si que resulta graciosas algunas voces de científicos y guardias quitando seriedad a la trama y hay pocas canciones que no son muy memorables al fin y al cabo. El sonido de los pasos o de las armas es notable y salva gran parte de este factor.\n\nPor último su jugabilidad, digamos que es típico de un FPS, gran arsenal de armas tanto terrícolas como alienigenas, hordas de enemigos por doquier y puzzles sencillos no se puede pedir más. Hay una cosa que no me ha gustado y es la manera de andar que parece que resbale, se me hace frustrante y ha empeorado mi experiencia con este juego pero es personal y no ha habido queja de manera mayoritaria.\n\nConclusión: Es un juego único, revolucionario y que ha influenciado gran parte de los juegos shooter actuales, en el modo un jugador tiene larga duración y si quieres jugar online también te permite hacerlo y por supuesto sin olvidar los mods como Counter-strike Team Fortress Classic entre otros, tiene sus fallos que en realidad son menores y en lo personal se me han hecho hasta importantes pero no echan para atrás querer jugarlo. \nTambién hay la versión remake que usa el motor source por si quieres jugar con mejores texturas aunque se recomienda más jugar al original pero tu tienes la palabra. En fin un juego divertido e ingenioso y de los mejores de la historia.","timestamp_created":1499737129,"timestamp_updated":1501520900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556756734848022461","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33445207","author":{"steamid":"76561198174194497","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":376,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1502223122},"language":"spanish","review":"Nunca me dejará de gustar este juego.","timestamp_created":1499736999,"timestamp_updated":1499736999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33444993","author":{"steamid":"76561198354665947","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":374,"last_played":1653105059},"language":"spanish","review":"Ufff, no hay nada qué decir sobre la \"Joyita\" de valve, de qué tratá \"Half Life\"?
