Die Rätsel sind (durch mehr Spielelemente) komplexer als noch im ersten Teil, es wirkt an keiner Stelle unfair oder überfordernd.

Visuals are also good considering how old the Source engine is, but this isn't industry defining in terms of graphics. The only drawback the game has is that it is suffering MINOR consolitis.

Giving cues on when to stop and stare, and when to frantically run, is the excellent soundtrack. It fits the entire universe perfectly. Then, of course, there's the tried and true gameplay we've come to expect from the original, with just enough new mechanics mixed in to keep it fresh. No need to fix what ain't broken.\n\nWithout ever having touched co-op, I can recommend Portal 2 without reservation.

Between Portal 1 and Portal 2, Portal 1 is rated T and Portal 2 is rated E10+. Why u may ask, its because of the blood they put in Portal 1 so sorry for all u blood thirsty people. With the new Co-op mode it requires a lot of thinking especially when ur playing with a noob. This Game features: Chapter by Chapter story line, More Aperture science technology, More Achievements then Portal 1, More harder test chambers, and L4d2 and TF2 main menu format. Also in case if ur wondering \"Will there be any cake?\" well i got some good news and some bad news. Bad news is No there wont be any cake unfortunlly, Good news is Valve replace it with something better Potatoes, in case u dont get it, before Steam put The potato sack which is a bunch of indie games so yea that was an idea to put in the game.

As some reviewer put it: “Leave it to Valve to add more personality to an insane A.I system, two robot test subjects, generic turrets and a cube than in most human video game protagonists this generation.”","timestamp_created":1311447022,"timestamp_updated":1311447022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2691107","author":{"steamid":"76561198011141794","num_games_owned":201,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1931,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1917,"last_played":1385847224},"language":"czech","review":":)","timestamp_created":1311439295,"timestamp_updated":1595627482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"950857","author":{"steamid":"76561197982891499","num_games_owned":379,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":1706,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1573,"last_played":1622254905},"language":"english","review":"99/100 for being THE Game of the Year, for its story, voice acting, humor, characters, unique puzzles, game play, etc. That being said, this is a must buy for anyone that loved the first Portal game or any other Valve games such as the Half Life series (which also takes place in the same universe / story). Although the single player campaign is only about 10 – 15 hours long depending on how good you are at solving puzzles, it definitely felt like the correct length. Furthermore, Portal 2 has co-op which adds cross platform play and an additional 5 – 10 hours of game play, which continues the story following the events of Portal 2 single player. Finally, as far as the story is concerned, the game answered almost all of my questions about Chell, Aperture Science, etc. Though we may not see a Portal 3, I have a good feeling that Half Life 3 will be here soon and I hope that we see Chell again someday!","timestamp_created":1311436989,"timestamp_updated":1311436989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4864303","author":{"steamid":"76561198042626895","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2430,"last_played":1659123925},"language":"english","review":"11/10\n\nI can't think about anything about this game, that I could even consider critizising.","timestamp_created":1311409437,"timestamp_updated":1498385167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lP+Fq7ECf5LHEg=="}
