I honestly felt warm and coziness within the city. The contrast between warm and cold colors were utilized to sets the tone for that particular chapter, which gave each chapter a sense of uniqueness. The imagery were vastly decorated by the soundtracks, presenting a striking hit to all the senses, not only does it lure your interest but also creates memories that once you've completed the game, it will stay in your mind forever.\n\nNow on to the game play. The sensitivity with the sprint key is kind of bugged but overall, the combat system was very enjoyable, you have many ways of approaching the game, you were provided with numerous tools at your disposal and you can choose your upgrades according to your liking.  Although I personally think that the difficulty is kind of easy even on the hardest difficulty, it's still a very challenging game to none FPS players. If you are a person who really likes to explore and be a completionist, there are plenty of easter egg and items to reward those who do.\n\nLastly, the characters and the story line. \nI feel like the studio had done a great job on narrating the characters, instead of direct information, you start to know these characters through events and other elements you may find in the game, each character are correlated with each other tightly and every single detail in the game may tie into the overall story. Even though you were not given a lot of information on the characters itself, they are still very attractive and likable. The story telling used a mixture of linear story line and back flash technique to add suspense to build the climax. Overall story was complex and immersive, it was interestingly enough to keep my attention yet it wasn't so overwhelming.\n\nAll in all, I honestly believe this is the best story telling game that I've ever played. It not only blew my mind with it's visual and story, but also characters that really got into my emotions. I'm not usually a big fan of these type of game as I believe they are a waste of time. But this game changed my mind and now I'm gonna visit Bioshock 1 and 2 as well as the DLC. I'm not gonna spoil the ending but I do want to say \"This is not the ending that I've wanted but the ending that was needed, This is an ending that marks Bioshock infinite as a masterpiece instead of a good game.","timestamp_created":1557725884,"timestamp_updated":1584438899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50606545","author":{"steamid":"76561198317863928","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":119,"playtime_forever":662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":662,"last_played":1557655070},"language":"schinese","review":"为什么播放录音没有字幕?\n任务路径指示经常让我围着一个地方转圈","timestamp_created":1557655177,"timestamp_updated":1557655177,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50605936","author":{"steamid":"76561198107134775","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":655,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":655,"last_played":1557641704},"language":"schinese","review":"翻译的问题吗 我剧情看的不是很懂。。 魔能什么的根本不需要！ 突突突+体术莽过去就对了！啊啊啊啊小天使伊丽莎白！","timestamp_created":1557652372,"timestamp_updated":1557652372,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50602317","author":{"steamid":"76561198839576675","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":724,"last_played":1561550882},"language":"schinese","review":"吹爆就完事了","timestamp_created":1557631657,"timestamp_updated":1557631657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50600911","author":{"steamid":"76561198144152697","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":4971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4142,"last_played":1600955127},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I have purchased.

Но не без изъянов. Начнем с того, что если вы играли первые две части, то эта часть никак не связана с ними (с DLC вы увидите связь). Поэтому можно считать, что это отдельная игра.\n\nГрафика: наконец-то хороший прыжок вперед, картинка выглядит очень красиво, но при рассмотрении деталей все равно можно найти мелкие изъяны. Тем не менее главное в игре прорисовано отлично: лицевая анимация, сами персонажи, оружия и фон.\n\nМузыка: первая часть, где могу похвались музыку. Здесь наконец-то я ее запомнил, особенно в эпических и драматических моментах она прям добавляет адреналина, ты начинаешь чувствовать игру намного лучше и эмоции только нарастают.\n\nСюжет: вы играли игры со сложными сюжетами? Если ответ нет - тогда вы даже не представляете, что на вас идет. Мне пришлось дважды пройти в свое время эту игру, а потом еще раз, когда я ее купил в Steam, чтобы разобраться полностью в сюжете. Он очень интересен, он заставит вас переживать, ненавидеть, удивляться (ох, сколько раз) и задумываться. После игры я еще долго додумывал свои концовки, интерпретировал их как мне хотелось. То есть после игры остался осадок и она  проникла мне в голову - это удивительное качество, которое делает эту игру одну из лучших игр, каких я когда либо играл. Сюжет далеко не прост с самого начала. Вы будете только думать что все просто, но чем далее, тем больше вы понимаете, что вы начинаете запутываться и нужно сильнее сконцентрироваться, не забывая тех деталей, которые вы увидели.\n\nГеймлпей: по сравнению с предыдущими двумя играми он не сильно поменялся. Я бы сказал что в некоторых моментах он даже ухудшился. Пушек уже не под 9 штук а в разы больше. Да, работа их стрельбы отличается (немного) но тем не менее все равно ты будешь ходить только с 4-6 пушками, которые тебе больше понравились. Ведь нет ситуаций, когда нужна одна пушка а где-то другая. Цель всего оружия одинаково - наносить урон. Так зачем столько ненужного разнообразия? Со способностями ситуацию немного улучшили, их уже не так много, они немного изменены, и большинство из них действительно полезны во время битв или для поиска каких то вещей. Но все еще не все. Даже в финальных битвах я не думал, что у меня под 7 заклинаний. Я просто использовал первые 3, которые у меня были и все. Поэтому проблема осталась еще с предыдущих частей: в теории можно творить интересные вещи но на практике, особенно, когда сложность большая, ты забываешь об этом. Оружия можно улучшать, но это не ново. Да, теперь улучшения стоят денег, поэтому бродить по локации, шныряя от и до стало более нужно. Все еще есть куча умений, которые можно использовать, но так же большинство их них бесполезно. Стоит похвалить нововведение в виде линии транспортировки, за которую можно зацепляться и ехать по ней.\n\nИтог: благодаря прекрасному сюжету, которые подарил мне уйму эмоций, нескольких DLC, которые помогли мне поностальгировать за предыдущими  двумя частями, хорошей картинкой, которая не резала глаз, запоминающимся персонажами я однозначно советую пройти эту игру. Это шедевр.\n","timestamp_created":1556801188,"timestamp_updated":1556801188,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50432425","author":{"steamid":"76561197998868493","num_games_owned":592,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":811,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":811,"last_played":1547441279},"language":"english","review":"This is the first Bioshock game I played. I had been wanting to play through the series for years from the start. But, the age of the first games warded me off. I chose Infinite to start as it's a newer game in hopes of drawing me in. It did exactly that. The graphics are brilliant and environment is beautiful. Instead of it taking place in a dingy, dark, labyrinthic maze. You find yourself among the clouds. In a dystopian wonderland equally as disturbing as Columbia in the opposite sense. Everyone seems happy, but in a off putting manner.\n\nThe audio is top notch as well. The guns and sound effects are very satisfying and voice work is amazing. You can tell they put a lot of emotion into developing this game. The story will bend your mind. The characters make you feel connected and one of them in particular is one of the best side kicks I've experienced in a game. You almost feel like you have a friend playing with you.\n\nA downside of the game is the difficulty. I never really felt challenged throughout my play through. But, I didn't mind it much. It felt almost like a story driven point and click on rails with decent combat. But, that didn't stop me from exploring every nook and cranny to see the personality of the city and it's intricacies. I really wanted more of it. The game wasn't long enough or hard enough to dig into the varying combat setups you can use.\n\nI fully recommend this video game to anyone. Even if they aren't much of a gamer. Actually, it's the perfect game to get someone into gaming.
