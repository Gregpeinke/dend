Admittedly, I'm not a fan of the first two games. I didn't think they had much of a story or world to dive into. You never really interacted with anyone. You're just all alone....which is part of the premise, I guess. I also played the remasters, and found the second to be unplayable with all the crashing.\n\nI'm running this on a Ryzen 7 3700x, 32 gb of ram, an RTX 3070 8 gb, with all the settings maxed out.\n\nThe world here is beautiful. There's things to interact with, and see, that help hide the fact that the game is linear. There's a lot of design that had me enjoying taking a look around to enjoy the world.\n\nElizabeth is a great companion. She takes care of herself, and she keeps you supplied. I like the story with her and the way she's voiced. I really enjoyed her dynamic with you, and how the relationship grows during the game. She had me invested in hers, and the greater story.\n\nSpeaking of...I enjoyed the twist at the end. I enjoyed seeing the different worlds, and how little things changed everything. I'm also a fan of multiple reality stories. I love the path your character walks, and how he changes with it. It's great to see how Elizabeth became someone important to him, and to see his urge to protect her grow.\n\nThe shooting is Bioshock. Thee's not much different with it. The vigors/plasmids are mostly the same in value as well. I really enjoyed the Devil's Kiss. I found it far more useful than any of the ones in the first two games, especially after I upgraded it. I loved the rail system to get around. It made a lot of the combat so much more interesting. Having Elizabeth open tears to give you aid on the battlefield is also a nice touch. The guns had a decent variety, but I stuck mostly to the Carbine, with a random machine gun.\n\nThe gifts are hit, and mostly miss. I found most of them useless, and rarely changed them out after the first cache of them you find. At least there are options for players who want to play the game differently.\n\nI must say that the ability to manually save being removed is a big letdown. I never noticed my game saving all that often, which led me to play it longer than I wanted at times. I've read that the game saves every few minutes or so, but I only ever noticed it unless I was moving areas. I miss the map as well.\n\nI started the DLC, returning you to Rapture. It's really hard, as the game doesn't give you much to work with. I had to drop the difficulty to easy (I'm not a big fan of very hard games, as they take away from the story.) I really enjoy seeing Rapture when it was in it's glory...however, I'm still not a fan of it as a level to play through. That may be part of why I didn't like the first two.\n\nAll in all, I had a lot of fun with this one. It wan't a fantastic game, but it was enjoyable. It made the purchase of all the games in the series worth it to me. I know this is the usually the most disliked of the series, but it was well worth the play for me.","timestamp_created":1631645188,"timestamp_updated":1631730935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99353556","author":{"steamid":"76561198416398263","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1735,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1095,"last_played":1658195480},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game","timestamp_created":1631643356,"timestamp_updated":1631643356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99341692","author":{"steamid":"76561199036878859","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":564,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":360,"last_played":1634460877},"language":"schinese","review":"要是不闪退，保底比现在好，字幕字太小导致剧情什么的看的有点粗，如果你真的闲的慌的话，可以买来一玩。","timestamp_created":1631628537,"timestamp_updated":1631628537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99339781","author":{"steamid":"76561199035440611","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":231,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":231,"last_played":1631614613},"language":"schinese","review":"好老婆🤤","timestamp_created":1631626095,"timestamp_updated":1631626095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99337139","author":{"steamid":"76561198077718649","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":165,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":165,"last_played":1631619974},"language":"turkish","review":"Yapılan olumlu yorumlara aldanarak büyük bir beklenti ile oyunu satın aldım. Şişirilmiş bir balondan başka hiçbir şey değil. Aldığı puanı kesinlikle haketmiyor. Tam bir hayal kırıklığı ve oynarken inanılmaz derecede sıkıldım. En fazla 2 saat oynamaya dayanabildim. Herkes oyunun hikayesini övmüş ama oynarken bu hikayenin zerresini hissetmiyorsunuz. Tek anladığınız kızı kurtarmaya çalıştığınız. Ben kimim, nerdeyim, ne yapıyorum hiçbir şey anlamadan karşınıza çıkan ne olduğu belirsiz karakterleri öldürüyorsunuz. Oyun öldür ve ilerle mantığından ibaret. FPS oyunlarında en önemli detaylardan biri vuruş hissidir. Vuruş hissiyatı atarilerde oynadığımız ördek vurma oyunu ile eşdeğer kalitede ve silah sesleri rezalet. Oyunu uzatmak adına her noktaya loot pompalamışlar. İtem bulduğunuza sevinmiyorsunuz bile. Herşey çok basit ve yapmacık. Oyunun tek iyi yanı büyük bir görsel şölen var. Unreal Engine nimetleri son sınırına kadar kullanılmış. Atmosfer fena değil. Animasyonlar çok iyi, ciddi anlamda özenilmiş fakat bir oyunu oynayabilmek için bunlar yeterli değil. Oyuna bağlanmak gerekir fakat bu oyun ciddi anlamda sıkıcı.

Seriously?\nDon't bother trying to sell me with that [spoiler]\"technically Rosalind Lutece used her big brain knowledge and research to discover quantum levitation to suspend the city\"[/spoiler] bullsh*t.\nThe first two games laid out the foundation as to how realistic the universe was and Infinite pulled a classic prequel f*ck up and cheapened it beyond measure.\n\n[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]\n[b]Part 1.)[/b]\nI personally really, really despise the inclusion of [spoiler]alternate universes/time travel[/spoiler] in almost any medium, and I find it absolutely disgusting when it's introduced in an already established franchise(with a couple exceptions).\nThis is primarily where my hatred of the story comes in; I just don't like these types of narratives. I suppose my simple monkey brain just doesn't like having to work this hard to figure out what I just watched.\nI'm going to avoid going into any amount of detail, but those who know the twist know exactly what I'm talking about.\n[b]Part 2.)[/b]\nThe second issue I have with the story is the inclusion of [spoiler]racism[/spoiler].\nWhy was this added? Who asked for Bioshock to include it? As much as the previous complaint felt unwelcome in Bioshock, this one takes the sh*t cake.\nI get that the whole idea of Columbia is for the succession from the United States, sounds an awful lot like Bioshock 1 & 2's Rapture... wonder where they got the idea, but even then I don't see why they went this route. It seems like they brought aboard a young ambitious amateur writer to lead the entire narrative of Infinite.\nAnd all of the propaganda/portrayals just left a bad taste in my mouth is all. Unnecessary.\n\n[h1][b]Characters[/b][/h1]\n[b]Booker DeWitt[/b] is pretty cut and dry at first glance with some interesting glimpses into his past throughout.\n[spoiler]But once we see the big reveal towards the end, I lost any ounce of interest I had in the character.[/spoiler]\n[b]Zachary Hale Comstock[/b] is a pretty bog standard antagonist with corrupt morals that can't be reasoned with.\n[spoiler]And has to rely entirely on the twist to make him anything more. Weak character[/spoiler]\n[b]Elizabeth[/b] is probably the only character I like with only a few moments that just had bad writing for the character.\n[spoiler]That being said, her ability to create interdimensional tears is f*cking stupid.[/spoiler]\n[b]The Lutece Twins[/b] are just bad. Absolutely the worst. Must've taken a real genius to write these two.\n[spoiler]Going based off lore, they are the reason Columbia exists, therefore they are the reason this game exists.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]\nBioshock Infinite sits off in it's own little corner; I really don't know what to say.\nBut to be fair to the game itself, I'm going to give it a score as if it wasn't linked to Bioshock, as if it were it's own game, an original IP.\n\n[b]I give Bioshock Infinite a[/b]\n[h1][b]7 out of 10[/b][/h1]\n[b]If I'm judging it as a Bioshock title then I give it a[/b]\n[h1][b]SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN MADE[/b][/h1]\n\n\n[b]Closing Thoughts[/b]\nI feel like even the devs knew how much Infinite strayed away from the previous games and felt forced to revisit Rapture in the Burial at Sea DLC to appease fans.\nAlso, I can't help but notice how much Elizabeth was loved by the community.\nI have a strong inclination that her character alone is what has made Bioshock Infinite as popular as it is.\nBunch of dirty perverts.
