Like your first playthrough is over in maybe two hours short. And half of that time is spent figuring out the buggy aspects of it. If you do buy it, a great timesaver to know... F6 to quicksave, and F7 to quick load, you'll need it. Also, if you jump onto a ladder, you wont grab it if still holding space. That wasted over half an hour for me.\n\nNow, the game itself isn't... bad... but it's not great or anything, again, it's got some issues and sticky moments in the gameplay or logic puzzles that are kind of jumps from what it set up before then. So there is frustrating moments. The basics of the story and experience is kind of interesting... but honestly there's just so little story or stuff here it's barely worth playing for extra half life lore (the reason I got it). So, not bad... but not good, and super insanely short to the point that even five dollars I payed feels like too much for this bite size bit of a game.
