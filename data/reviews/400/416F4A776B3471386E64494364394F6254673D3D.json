It has a plot that gives you a rough idea of what's going on but doesn't intrude on the cool gameplay too much. You play as Chell, who is testing the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device for Aperture Science, however the situation is not as it first seems. Using the 'Portal Gun' you play through a variety of levels as you explore the lab. The portal mechanics are mind-blowing to those who haven't played with them before and as a result this is a game like no other.\n\nI give this game a 9.5/10 rating. My only issue with this game was that my R9 390 rendered 1000's of frames during the loading screens for no particular reason. Horrible screeching noise. Apart from that, Portal was a very fun game to play and I would recommend buying it if you like puzzle games and/or the game is on sale.","timestamp_created":1453105244,"timestamp_updated":1468078984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20601161","author":{"steamid":"76561198150439457","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":152,"last_played":1453165360},"language":"english","review":"11/10 would listen to the credit song again.","timestamp_created":1453104123,"timestamp_updated":1453104123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20600992","author":{"steamid":"76561198050384273","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":183,"last_played":1453102678},"language":"english","review":"Best Credits, 10/10 would watch again.","timestamp_created":1453103034,"timestamp_updated":1453103034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20600871","author":{"steamid":"76561198212495597","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":66,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":66,"last_played":1469269066},"language":"russian","review":"Игра нормальная правда очень запутанная\n\n\nГрафика 6 из 10\nГеймплей 5 из 10\nМузыка и звуки 7  из 10\nУправление 7 из 10\nРазнообразие 6 из 10\nОптимизация 10 из 10\nМоя оценка 7 из 10","timestamp_created":1453102276,"timestamp_updated":1514051932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20600125","author":{"steamid":"76561198193926701","num_games_owned":364,"num_reviews":59,"playtime_forever":77,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":63,"last_played":1454166531},"language":"schinese","review":"这游戏神了","timestamp_created":1453097599,"timestamp_updated":1453097599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20599689","author":{"steamid":"76561198013495990","num_games_owned":1525,"num_reviews":127,"playtime_forever":67,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":67,"last_played":1434326171},"language":"english","review":"Dear God,\nThis game is awesome.","timestamp_created":1453094933,"timestamp_updated":1453094933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20598634","author":{"steamid":"76561198232157208","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":94,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":93,"last_played":1458272101},"language":"schinese","review":"这可是神作，嗯，准确来讲是只能玩一次的神作，以前盗版通关，现在买了正版却没有动力通关第二遍，算是为盗版还债吧，这种游戏第一次就是永恒。","timestamp_created":1453089072,"timestamp_updated":1453208502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20597124","author":{"steamid":"76561198172755467","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1485,"last_played":1453082303},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego te entretiene mucho tiempo.","timestamp_created":1453081143,"timestamp_updated":1453081143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20596955","author":{"steamid":"76561198103738065","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1182,"last_played":1453160590},"language":"english","review":"Placed one portal on the wall just to the left of the other...\n\n...

By positioning the portals in certain ways you can step, jump, or fall huge distances. You can also use them to redirect lasers and bullets, which you must do in order to stay alive, although the game can be completed within a few hours, and the scenery is quite sparse. Nearly everything that GLaDOS says is absolutely hilarious, and the challenges are fun and really challenge you to think. Additionally, they can be completed in several different ways and it is possible to pick up awards for doing certain things, so the game can easily be replayed with great satisfaction.","timestamp_created":1453060227,"timestamp_updated":1453060227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.624637424945831299","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20590940","author":{"steamid":"76561198043192670","num_games_owned":524,"num_reviews":320,"playtime_forever":254,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52,"last_played":1614659170},"language":"english","review":"y

is one of those classic games that came out so ahead of its time. It's one of those games that most people nowadays will have it stored away in the darkest recesses of their Steam library, bought and forgotten during some Steam sale. That's my story anyway. \n\nI tried not to play the game because I hate puzzlers. I hate looking up guides to get past certain objectives if they're too difficult and I hate not being able to solve it myself. So, for the longest time, I didn't play it. \n\nBut this is a different kind of puzzler. It's driving factor and it's most prized possession is the Portal gun that allows you to cross miles in a fraction of a second. You might think that you can go wherever you please with the gun but the level design will bar many areas with clever placement of platforms or unplaceable walls. \n\nThe puzzles start off rather easy as most puzzlers do just to get you acquainted with the controls and mechanics. Once you start moving out, however, the game ratchets up the difficulty. You'll breeze through most of the beginning and then start spending quarter of an hour or half an hour or maybe even a full hour trying to figure out just ONE segment. Maybe you've already figured it out but just can't execute it. I can't tell you how far I came to looking up a guide for one part (but thankfully, I did not). \n\nAnd of course, who doesn't love the sarcastic, witty, devilishly gorgeous GLaDOS, the narrator and later found out to be [spoiler] the villain [/spoiler] of the game? You get hints of the evilness of the facility throughout the game with etchings and messages written on plaster wall behind the nice, clean white walls that you are accustomed to. \n\nIf you haven't played it yet, give it a try. Whether you're a puzzler natural or a filthy casual to the puzzle-game scene, I'm sure you'll enjoy the game.","timestamp_created":1453021655,"timestamp_updated":1453021655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481838434934616089","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20579078","author":{"steamid":"76561198148172807","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1453110493},"language":"schinese","review":"valve出品，必屬佳品\n利用傳送門逃脱\n沒有蛋糕  =(\nstill alive好好聽\n建議download soundtrack :3","timestamp_created":1453017567,"timestamp_updated":1453017567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20578740","author":{"steamid":"76561198031027183","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":84,"playtime_forever":383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":224,"last_played":1645995669},"language":"english","review":"9/10  Very amusing.","timestamp_created":1453015773,"timestamp_updated":1453015773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20577812","author":{"steamid":"76561198064724027","num_games_owned":412,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":435,"last_played":1573986754},"language":"english","review":"It's a must play game, what more can I say?","timestamp_created":1453010755,"timestamp_updated":1453010755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20575415","author":{"steamid":"76561198072732583","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":863,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":690,"last_played":1466497406},"language":"french","review":"Fini en 3h.

Вот именно эти уровни составляют по моему мнению всю основу игры, что называется сложнейшей головоломкой!
