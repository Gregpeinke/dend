if you compare Killing Floor to a game like Battlefield (3, 4, or 1), then you can see that Killing Floor is quite dated - I would suggest that it should be sold for $5 or $10; if Killing Floor 2 takes away a lot of its player base, then Killing Floor may yet be reduced to a more reasonable price.\n\nI should note that I played this with a two-day guest pass, so I haven't played the game as much as I would have liked.

Isn't this game just a bunch of zombies in co-op, coming at you in waves? There are a lot of these games already! How's it different?\nA. Well, this game has a better pedigree than many. For me, a huge appeal of the game is the fun variety of maps. Sickening green laboratory, trashed office building by night, post-apocalyptic London streets, late afternoon forest with underground bunker tunnels, snowy military base, highway with grassy hills, and the list just goes on and on. Few games have so much quality map variety. If map variety is your thing, that aspect of this game may really appeal to you. Beyond the maps, the guns themselves \"feel\" really good to use, and that's not something I say often in games. The developers put a lot of is a lot of attention to how powerful certain guns feel to fire, the usefulness of each, and the game's economy.\n\nQ. Economy? What are you talking about?\nA. You get money in the game for each kill, and between waves, you can spend that money at a trader/shop. Granted, you need to either head toward the trader before killing the last enemy, because it can be a long haul, or run fast and hope you get there in time to peruse the store's goods. At the trader, you can purchase more ammo, new guns, sell guns, and buy body armor and grenades. Each difficulty gives you less money per kill, the harder the difficulty is set...which can sometimes feel a little ruthless, but if you want a challenge, that's the way to do it. Buying new weapons gives a feeling of progress throughout a round (one \"game\" of Killing Floor) and encourages participating to get more kills. Team mates can also toss cash to one another to help each other out, and there's a surprising amount of this cooperation despite playing with random people (probably because having a weak party member means less help against the horde!).\n\nQ. It's all zombies, though, right? Boring!\nA. Not exactly. Kinda? You have very zombie-like enemies, which are easy to kill, cloaking enemies that flicker in and out of view, enemies who have lights than change color and they then run at you to kill you, enemies who amble toward you then run full speed after taking a certain amount of damage, enemies that crawl on the ground and leap at you, and several more times, along with a boss who has a rocket launcher, a minigun, a cloaking device, and he can run away and heal. So no, not just zombie-ish enemies. You could draw comparisons, but there is a lot of great wave-based horde combat in this game.\n\nQ. Is there really any story to the game itself? Not like...comics or videos online, but actual story happening in the game?\nA. No. I love story, but there is none to find in the game. This game is a black hole as far as story/plot is concerned.\n\nQ. Is there any progress in between rounds/games of Killing Floor? Like...does anything carry over so I have a feeling of progress/accomplishing something aside from achievements?\nA. Actually, yes. Each \"perk\" (character class, like sharpshooter, firebug, demolitions, etc.) starts at Level 0 and levels up to...I wanna say 6 was the max? Anyway, leveling up takes quite a long time, but you get bonuses to various things like your damage with certain weapons each time you level, and discounts on buying certain weapons from the trader, if my memory serves. Maxing out all the classes will take a long time and got really old for me, but it does give you some sense of progress, if that's important to you.\n\nQ. Is this game difficult?\nA. Unlike some games, Killing Floor has multiple difficulties, and each changes how tough enemies are, money accrual rates, time to get to the trader between waves, etc. When you first start out, even on lower difficulties, you can get your butt kicked pretty well and good if you \"go Rambo.\" Going Rambo is the easiest way to die in this game, regardless of the difficulty you play on, or even if you get pretty decent at the game. I'm sure there are a few people who can pull it off, but for the most part, you're going to die if you do it.\n\nQ. Um...excuse me, what's \"going Rambo?\"\nA. Oh! Sorry. Yeah, this is a co-op game, right? The best way to play it is to either meet up at one area and only spread out just a teensy bit to fend off various areas enemies wander in from, regularly taking a look to see if your buddies need a little help. Y'know, because it's co-op and that's kinda the idea. However, \"going Rambo\" is when someone decides \"Wow, I wanna go run off all by myself because [reason]! I'll be fine. :D\" If that's a new player, they are so dead. Experienced player? Toss a coin, it's rough. Like I said, I sure some great players can pull it off, but to be a good team player and not risk losing all your stuff, you'll want to stick together.\n\nQ. Wait, losing all my stuff? Wha?\nA. If you die, you can only respawn when the wave is over, and you spawn in without any weapons you bought at the trader. Whatever was in your hands when you died will be on the ground where you or your team mates can pick it up. So if you spent all the money you had on a new gun and you died while holding a crappy pistol, you just lost that fancy gun. In this fashion, you can pretty much be ruined if you and/or your team mates die on higher difficulties and have to respawn but lost pricey guns in the process, because money is so tight and the game is treating you like you have the best gear you could possibly have...even though you totally don't thanks to losing the guns and money.\n\nQ. There's a Killing Floor 2. Should I just buy it instead?\nA. As of right now? Probably not. It's been a few months since I played Killing Floor 2, and honestly, it does not yet have the map variety, well-balanced and complete sets of perks, and overall good feel of Killing Floor. Later, it might be better, but for now, you can get Killing Floor either in Humble Bundle bundles for cheap, or on Steam sales for like five bucks or less. I would certainly recommend it for that if you like cooperative, wave-based shooters with tons of map variety.","timestamp_created":1479442143,"timestamp_updated":1479442154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26653733","author":{"steamid":"76561198070048801","num_games_owned":458,"num_reviews":160,"playtime_forever":1113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":444,"last_played":1648002042},"language":"english","review":"British/10\n\nWould sip tea n kill Zombies again","timestamp_created":1479429088,"timestamp_updated":1479429088,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26642552","author":{"steamid":"76561198264180653","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":42890,"playtime_last_two_weeks":10,"playtime_at_review":804,"last_played":1660489147},"language":"english","review":"old god game","timestamp_created":1479381830,"timestamp_updated":1479381830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26638539","author":{"steamid":"76561198142994699","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":154,"last_played":1426999788},"language":"tchinese","review":"好像很好玩的樣子","timestamp_created":1479348705,"timestamp_updated":1479348705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26637675","author":{"steamid":"76561198115685852","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":8425,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2722,"last_played":1524012069},"language":"spanish","review":"SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!","timestamp_created":1479342665,"timestamp_updated":1479342665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26634111","author":{"steamid":"76561198272995791","num_games_owned":794,"num_reviews":118,"playtime_forever":160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":159,"last_played":1535451135},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom, mas ja esta ultrapassado graficamente e com a jogabilidade pois o seu sucessor Killing Floor 2 e demais.
