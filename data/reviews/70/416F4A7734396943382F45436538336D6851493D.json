Me gustó mucho. El principio me pareció muy atrapante, y se mantiene bastante bien el ritmo porque cambia tanto los escenarios que propone como los desafíos y enemigos. Más allá de las limitaciones técnicas que tiene por ser un juego tan viejo me parece que está bien ambientado. Cada escenario tiene sentido, no se siente tan artificial, sino más bien funciona de manera orgánica. Se juega en general muy bien, es divertido, hay variedad de armas, más de las típicas de otros fps. Lo único es que Freeman por defecto corre muy rápido y en las partes plataformeras se complica. \nCon respecto a los desafíos o mecánicas para avanzar, tiene que ver muchas veces con interactuar con el entorno, palancas, botones, mecanismos, que a veces están señalizados en el escenario, cuando tiene lógica obviamente (ej: sala de máquinas, mantenimiento de turbinas, etc). Otras veces hay que encontrar caminos alternativos o hacerse uno, subir por tuberías, tubos de ventilación, alcantarillas, escaleras de servicio etc. En general uno encuentra el camino, aunque muchas veces es posible “trabarse” sin saber cómo avanzar. Pero una vez llegado a cierto punto, uno entiende medianamente cómo funciona el juego y le encuentra la vuelta. \nLos enemigos son muy variados y tienen cada uno su forma particular de atacar, hay zombies que atacan cuerpo a cuerpo, soldados con armas de fuego, granadas, trampas y torretas, y extraterrestres, algunos pequeños, otros voladores, otros que tiran rayos, escupen ácido y algunos muy resistentes. También podemos decir que hay jefes, algunos se vencen a pura fuerza de fuego y otros al resolver algún puzle.\nSi tengo que hacer alguna crítica es que experimenté al menos en dos ocasiones errores del juego que me impidieron avanzar, tuve que cargar partidas anteriores para solucionarlos. Nada muy grave, pero me pasó. \nEn fin, es un juego de ciencia ficción que va a veces de aventura, otras marcadamente de acción, de puzle, algo de misterio e incluso un poco de terror en el principio.

I played most of it in offline mode and I guess that affected my time.)\n\n     Half-Life is considered a pioneer of the FPS genre, and after playing it through, it is easy to see why. While fun to play, the CODs and Battlefields of today all feel the same, leaving me barely interested in the story. Most of us play those games for the multiplayer, and that’s fine but sometimes we want more. Half-Life gives us exactly what we want, and then some. You play as Gordon Freeman, a worker at the Black Mesa Research Facility. The game starts out as a normal day of work for Gordon, but things quickly change when aliens begin to come through a dimensional rift created through an accident at the lab. One of the most interesting and, at the same time, most frustrating aspects of the game is the different types of aliens that you will have to fight. You’ll experience a variety of alien enemies from the small but annoying head-crabs to the massive nihilanth. Aliens aren’t the only enemies that you’ll be fighting though. Obviously the higher-ups don’t want any unnecessary information to get out to the public. The Hazardous Environment Contact Unit is there to ensure that doesn’t happen, through any means necessary. Unfortunately, this includes killing anyone involved with the project. You’ll have to fight your way through countless HECU soldiers to get out of the facility alive.\n\n\tAs I said before, the different enemies are a big part of the gameplay. You’ll need different kinds of guns for different kinds of enemies. A small pistol isn’t going to take down a helicopter, after all. It is always exciting to get a new weapon and experiment with what it works best on. For some enemies though, average weapons aren’t going to do the trick. The second largest part of the gameplay is the puzzles. Every now and again you’ll come to a dead end and can’t go anywhere. Look around you, there’s probably a hidden switch or a vent that you can use to your advantage. These puzzles not only are fun to figure out, but they also give you a little bit of a break from constantly being on the lookout for enemies. There aren’t too many of them, I would say just enough. It’s definitely a FPS first, with some puzzle elements. This game came out before Steam was released, all the way back in 1998. Obviously the graphics aren’t going to be top-tier. Bad graphics don’t really get to me, but if they do get to you, I would recommend watching some gameplay before buying. That being said, the graphics in this game look GREAT for their time period. Still dated obviously, but way better than one could expect. My favorite part of this game is the story. I was always kept on the edge of my seat, wanting to know what would happen next. The last couple of missions in the game are the best FPS missions I have ever played. I can’t talk about what happens in these levels due to HEAVY spoilers, but I was amazed at what I was playing. The game does a good job at hyping you up so the ending levels are super satisfying. \n\n\tTL;DR: I really don’t think I would be exaggerating by saying that this game is a masterpiece. If you like FPS games, you will love this game. It shows it’s age in places, but there is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more.\n","timestamp_created":1588977094,"timestamp_updated":1588977094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68810179","author":{"steamid":"76561198081420622","num_games_owned":406,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":2309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1937,"last_played":1635383031},"language":"english","review":"In

Before Half-Life's release the shooter genre was dominated by games like DOOM and Quake (not bad games by any mean) but they all shared sporadic and mindless gameplay. Very few times in these games would you have to use brainpower to solve a puzzle or manage resources. The absolute opposite of this coin being Half Life, a game where very few times will you go guns blazing into an encounter spraying bullets endlessly. Most enemy battles in Half Life require lots of planning, or a deep understanding of the games engine to survive. Every enemy has deep AI systems that can be studied to conquer them in combat. For example: Instead of advancing on you, soldiers will instead choose to retreat and throw grenades until the player comes out of hiding, headcrabs when in groups will coordinate and time their lunges at the player to catch them off guard, hiding behind cover too long when fighting an alien slave will cause it too advance fast and use a rarely seen melee attack. Every enemy has its weakness and they can be exploited if the player thinks instead of aimlessly shooting.\n\n(Almost) every chapter in Half-Life is perfectly crafted to suit each enemies unique quirks, and to suit YOU the player's unique weapons. As Gordon you have a wide range of weapons, all of them different and used for different situations. If you choose to only use the Shotgun and Pistol you WILL be punished in Half-Life, it is imperative to the players progress that he experiments with each weapon (like a true scientist)\n\nHalf-Life has a certain charm that more and more shooters are trying to replicate these days. All of the textures are blurry (be sure to disable HD textures for best experience), the dialogue is campy and ridiculous, and the sound design is crispy and crunchy. Despite all this, Half-Life still manages to be frightening at times. You will come across multiple areas in the game that are designed to creep the player out, and the phenomenal music helps this atmosphere establish itself even more. The wonderful soundtrack will fade in at just the right times to empower you, scare you, or just to sound awesome (klaxon beat)\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Half-Life was a severely rushed game and it shows in the final areas of the game, most notably Interloper. In Interloper you are thrust into SEVERAL terrible maps that betray Half-Life's design philosophy up to that point. Instead of carefully constructed areas meant to make the player think, you are given giant shooting arenas with infinitely respawning enemies. Instead of amazingly aged visuals you are given barf colored asteroids floating in a green abyss. Once you reach Xen the game kind of shits its pants, I recommend you still stick through to the end on a first play through, but I almost always skip most of Xen and use commands to enter the final bossfight.\n\nIn summary, Half-Life is an amazing game that has aged wonderfully and still holds up to this day (except for some notable areas at the end). This game is a must-buy and probably my favorite game of all time.","timestamp_created":1588742027,"timestamp_updated":1623136313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68654375","author":{"steamid":"76561198930815628","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":92,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":92,"last_played":1590593731},"language":"turkish","review":"yıllar","timestamp_created":1588739800,"timestamp_updated":1588739800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68653929","author":{"steamid":"76561198284513805","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":70,"playtime_at_review":370,"last_played":1660267762},"language":"english","review":"fordon geeman fun game good job","timestamp_created":1588738923,"timestamp_updated":1588738923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68651974","author":{"steamid":"76561199053910155","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":644,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":344,"last_played":1621017583},"language":"english","review":"Classic game.","timestamp_created":1588735362,"timestamp_updated":1588735362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68651212","author":{"steamid":"76561198090124181","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1626,"last_played":1588735147},"language":"english","review":" \n","timestamp_created":1588734033,"timestamp_updated":1588734033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68650988","author":{"steamid":"76561198169228436","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":844,"last_played":1630809682},"language":"english","review":"c","timestamp_created":1588733630,"timestamp_updated":1611013845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68648939","author":{"steamid":"76561198387477507","num_games_owned":396,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":577,"last_played":1547761018},"language":"english","review":"Pretty darn good for a game that's older than me.","timestamp_created":1588730084,"timestamp_updated":1588730084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68647390","author":{"steamid":"76561198844027343","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":2900,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1920,"last_played":1657498744},"language":"english","review":"It's a good game a hidden gem definitely not one of the most important FPS ever","timestamp_created":1588727493,"timestamp_updated":1588727493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68644851","author":{"steamid":"76561198975719567","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1655668088},"language":"spanish","review":"Este juego es muy bueno por algo hice la reseña.lo recomiendo si les gusta los juegos de Accion oh aventura oh experimentos bueno es muy bueno los graficos son normales no son los mejores pero yo creo que satisface a los que juegan esta joya de juego muy bueno amigos!!!!!","timestamp_created":1588723535,"timestamp_updated":1588723535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68638546","author":{"steamid":"76561197997472456","num_games_owned":287,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":248,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":248,"last_played":1588713656},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um jogo classico!
