Как — уже? Всего лишь через шесть лет? Мысль о том, что тебе предстоит играть в эту игру настолько неуютна, что знакомство с объектом ожидания откладываешь до последнего. Потому что знаешь: чудес не бывает, избавление от иллюзий будет очень болезненным. Сколь бы хорошей не была игра, разочарование неизбежно — ведь ты ожидаешь абсолютного идеала, божественного откровения, а перед тобой оказывается всего продукт, созданный такими же несовершенными людьми, со своими достоинствами и недостатками.\n    Но только не в этот раз. Через пару уровней привычное разочарование сменилось диким восторгом, а любые сомнения в том, что Half-Life 2, упаси боже, уронил марку серии, выветрились начисто. Это не просто лучшая игра года, это лучший экшен со времен первой части. В первую часть я играл на протяжении двух лет (причем не эпизодически, а по нескольку раз в неделю — настолько сильно она меня зацепила). Вторая часть, похоже, отнимет еще больше времени.\n    Единственное, за что игру стоит пожурить, — это слабый AI “комбайнов” (по сравнению с оригинальной Half-Life). В первой части спецназовцы действовали настолько умно и слаженно, что переигрывать каждый бой можно было почти до бесконечности — каждый раз все было по-разному. Они атаковали игрока с разных сторон, прикрывали друг друга, грамотно выбирали укрытия, забрасывали гранатами, отчаянно пинались, когда дело доходило до рукопашной... А здесь... Здесь ничего подобного даже и близко нет.","timestamp_created":1406012235,"timestamp_updated":1406012235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11355432","author":{"steamid":"76561198017431364","num_games_owned":742,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1662,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1625,"last_played":1474578028},"language":"english","review":"Half Life + Half Life 2 = 3 Half Lifes - Life = 3 + Life Half = 3 Life Half + Pulling Down Alyx's pants down to see her panties = Half Life 3.\n\n\nHalf Life 3 confirmed.\n\n","timestamp_created":1405997578,"timestamp_updated":1405997578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11354693","author":{"steamid":"76561198018873326","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":521,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":465,"last_played":1405032849},"language":"english","review":"The icon of classic PC games, play it or regret it, trust me.","timestamp_created":1405992229,"timestamp_updated":1405992229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11354498","author":{"steamid":"76561198058216175","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":734,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":711,"last_played":1423892906},"language":"english","review":"It's alright, but after waiting so long to play it, it did not really meet my expectations.

Hopes for a sequel were high, and Valve knew that they had to change the gaming industry again, but surely they couldn't make a sequel that's better than the original, right?\n\nWell, after spending 6 years in development (and having the source code leaked by a hacker in late 2003), Half-Life 2 was released in 2004 to universal acclaim. It took everything we loved about the original Half-Life, and multiplied it ten times over.\n\nAs the game begins, you wake up after being put into stasis by that mysterious man in the suit from the first game. Getting off the train, you find out that a lot has changed since you were gone. Everything looks...Orwellian. It turns out that the Earth was taken over by a multi-universal alien force known as the Combine, and you gotta stop them! As you travel throughout the game, you meet underground resistance members who have the same goal in mind. Pretty soon, news spreads around that \"The One Free Man\" has returned, and you trigger a revolution.\n\nHalf-Life 2, in my opinion, is much better than the first game, and is one of the greatest sequels of all time.

Half-Life 2 did the same thing but bigger and better with the improved Source engine. Without this game we would never have gotten for instance games and mods like Garrys Mod, The Hidden, Zombie Panic Source and other great works. The community is massive and still ongoing for over 10 years and stronger then ever. The story is great and immersive, the graphics are simply stunning for a game that came out so long ago, heck, I can even play HL2 maxed out on my crappy laptop with a constant 60 FPS, while it cant even handle simple browser games. There is a wide variety of guns to use and the gameplay is smooth, fluid and almost constant action. All in all this is one game and a heck of a adventure you DO NOT want to miss. Consider this masterpiece a remnant in history that will never be forgotten. And now if Half-Life 3 does come out at some point, I'm sure it will improve in every aspect that made the entire Half-Life series a legendary status, and an unforgettable piece of art.","timestamp_created":1405876186,"timestamp_updated":1405876186,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469875514507293701","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11334308","author":{"steamid":"76561198127158064","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":7212,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1316,"last_played":1658548028},"language":"english","review":"Who could hate this game?
