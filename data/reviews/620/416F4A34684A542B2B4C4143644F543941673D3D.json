Of course people will complain that it's too short if they rush through it.  There's actually a lot of painstaking details and secrets that the developers put in the singleplayer that you should really slow down and investigate - and I'm not just talking about the achievements only.\n\nAs for the purchasable DLCs, yes it's sucky that some stuff is by additional purchase only, a la TF2.  It's not what the entire game is about though.  Working and playing together with friends is a wonderful satisfaaction.  Would you really care about purchasable customizations that you'll never really get to show off that much?\n\nIf I were to reconsider this game, maybe $45 to $50 is pushing it in price, based on the replayability of this game - even after considering user created levels.
