Сюжет и геймплей сделаны на отлично. Во-первых сама идея, довольно-таки необычная. Для решения всех проблем мы должны использовать портальную пушку. Во-вторых - это испытания увлекательно проходить. В-третьих в игре присутствуют усложнённые версии камер, а так же испытания, в которых у нас ограничены порталы, шаги или время. В-четвёртых это сюжет с юмором и неожиданным поворотом в конце.\nКратко о геймплее:\nНам дают портальную пушку, использовать её можно на левую и правую мышку. Левой мышкой мы открываем синий портал, а правой - жёлтый. Через эти порталы мы можем телепортироваться.\nКратко о сюжете:\nМы испытуемый нового оборудования, с помощью которого мы можем телепортироваться.
