Star Craft: Broodwar, Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil 2, Final Fantasy Tactics, Fallout 2, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Half-Life. It feels like this one is the the runt of that litter, though. \n\n This game was toted as absolutely revolutionary for the FPS genre, for telling a story through NPC dialogue, I guess. The NPC dialogue unfortunately overlaps and skips worse than Skyrim, and it feels like there is around two paragraphs of exposition to explain the entire game, spread across 10 hours of lonely duct-crawling.\n\nDid this game revolutionize the genre and allow for stuff like Halo to exist? Maybe, sure, but after playing System Shock 2 just before this and seeing the inspiration they took.. I think Half-Life has aged like milk in comparison. The gameplay is pretty floaty and fast paced, but.. low impact, by todays standards. The story seems barely-there, the levels aren't very impressive, the puzzles are simple and the platforming is a headache. I look at System Shock and it has a great story and atmosphere going for it, so that even where the old graphics and weird mechanics fail, the experience is still good. The advantage of voice logs and bits of story being rewarded for exploration also prevents the issue I had with much of this game; exploration can only reward you with more health, and more ammo, which you probably won't be hurting for. It feels like they wanted to make sure there was enough 'loot' for people to get by on hard difficulty, which increases enemy health and decreases your bullet damage, but has no affect on anything else.\n\nIf you're looking to play the classics that you've heard of and never gotten around to.. maybe read a recap and skip to HL2, or try one of the other games that came out this year.","timestamp_created":1605463122,"timestamp_updated":1605463122,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.434782594442367554","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79314402","author":{"steamid":"76561199066100549","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1415,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":248,"last_played":1630106914},"language":"spanish","review":"buenardooooooo\n","timestamp_created":1605456525,"timestamp_updated":1605456525,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"79313742","author":{"steamid":"76561198271075496","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":5009,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3889,"last_played":1653938614},"language":"english","review":"better than the original in my opinion, not even joking, get the resized map mod + uplink mod and this game is alright aside from the existing bugs.

The only thing which I remember from my childhood is the long train intro and how boring it was for me to wait 5 minutes without any interactions with the game itself. Unfortunately, I hadn't the chance to explore the Half Life universe back in the days when it was brand new.. the game is awesome, really - it's great! Now I know why this game is considered a true classic, the storyline is fascinating, the gameplay is variable and actually the game is not that easy, you have to spend more than a few ours in order to make it though all of the chapters. So, if you didn't play Hal Life, you should definitely do it, no matter that its 21 century now. And since this review is for the Source version of the game, I must say it brings a lot of improvements to the game.. and actually makes it a bit easier than the original predecessor (and easier does not mean easy!).

Source es la remasterizacion del juego original adaptado al en ese tiempo novedoso motor source, pero en realidad esta adaptacion es bastante mala, principalmente porque el juego no esta realmente remasterizado, solo portearon el script y texturas originales haciendo una ambientacion rara al ver que las texturas tienen una calidad fea y que hayan al mismo tiempo efectos realistas y apartado tecnico superior, es como jugar un mod de half life 2, en vez de hacer un remake del original como lo hicieron con counter strike, tambien faltan las expanciones opposing force y blue shift, ademas de que aun a fecha de hoy no esta adaptada la expancion cooperativa decay, por lo que no estaran ni Adrian, ni Barney ni Gina ni Colette, solo podremos jugar con gordon, es uno de los factores por las que la version source se siente incompleta\n\ny dije uno de los factores, ya que hay otros, como los errores de hitbox y programacion, destruir uno de los bosses, el helicoptero de la HECU, es un dolor de cabeza ya que la hitbox esta mal programada, o los colmillos gigantes que salen de la tierra, los cuales no pueden dañar a gordon (o quizas sea errores de los mods, fijense ustedes) ademas que el nihilanth no tiene una buena hitbox tampoco, y tuve que subirme a el y matarlo con la palanca, aunque hay cosas buenas, la inteligencia artificial es mucho mejor y los aliados no se quedan trabados a cada rato, en cuanto a las animaciones, pues es raro como se mueven personajes poligonales y toscos en un entorno de fisicas avanzadas.\n\npor lo cual no recomiendo comprarlo, es mejor jugar la original ademas de que puedes jugar decay a travez de un mod del original. algo positivo de source es que la comunidad hizo muy buenos mods que arreglan problemas graficos que he mencionado, cambiando iluminacion y colocando las texturas originales con 16k de resolucion y relieve, o otro mod que portea opposing force, pero de forma independiente no vale la
