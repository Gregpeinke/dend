Combat mechanics are really smooth, really doesn't get boring shooting zombies in the face. The game has alot of depth for an arcade-y zombie game, the modding community is pretty decent, and the harder modes of the game are very challenging. The amount of DLC is a little off-putting, but you don't NEED any of the packs to enjoy the game to it's full potential.","timestamp_created":1388057792,"timestamp_updated":1388057792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8296693","author":{"steamid":"76561197997106163","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":16880,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":15782,"last_played":1540156865},"language":"english","review":"best game","timestamp_created":1388057767,"timestamp_updated":1388057767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8295044","author":{"steamid":"76561198109418913","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3970,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2857,"last_played":1594997296},"language":"italian","review":"dovete mettere la versione di killing floor fututistica anche per mac !!!

People may bash it for the simplicity, and lack of single player. But the ammount of support for mods make for a fresh experience. The gunplay is pretty satisfying, with very nice limb dismemberment and headshots. Theres an active effect called \"ZED TIME\" when the game thinks you did something cool, for example, a single bullet penetrating threw 3 or 4 heads. When \"ZED TIME\" kicks in, everything gets slow-motion, and you have extream accurecy with very little threat, (Your aimer moves quickly but the zombies do not.) Its got a very tacticle feel to it, Where you get money for each wave of zombies you survive. Then the traded opens for a few moments, you can restock on armor,  gernades, ammo and of corse, firearms. There is also a perk system, where doing certian tasks level your selected perk. They provide some decent class bonuses, most consisting of discounts to your specific wepond class when you buy from the trader. There is a great varity of weponds as well. Ranging from the Katana to rocket launchers and everything in-between. HOWEVER, A HUGE NEGETIVE FOR ME IS TRIPWIRE WANTS YOU TO SHELL OUT REAL CASH TO BUY WEPOND PACKS. They are nothing amazing, but if they arent anything great, why make us pay? Bad tripwire. But like i said before, the mods keep me into it, and also keep everything fresh. I personaly love the \"Gun Game\" mod, pretty much modled after Call Of Duty's game type. Theres also DM, TDM, and DM Extreame, which is a deathmatch with random zombies in the mix. Theres also some other modes, but another thing that keeps this game fresh is events. Holiday or whatever, but they add new things, new unlockable characters, and reskins to all the zombies. But all in all, this game is a deffinte hit for me, and at its price point, its worth a shot to anyone intrested for sure.","timestamp_created":1388035608,"timestamp_updated":1388035608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8288794","author":{"steamid":"76561198059201401","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3452,"last_played":1459838976},"language":"english","review":"This game is incredible!","timestamp_created":1388035548,"timestamp_updated":1388035548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8288672","author":{"steamid":"76561198052649930","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":407,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":317,"last_played":1395777802},"language":"spanish","review":"Uno de los mejores juegos de zombies","timestamp_created":1388035115,"timestamp_updated":1388035115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8288325","author":{"steamid":"76561198054785159","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":230,"last_played":1586986271},"language":"english","review":"Bloody zombie killing with crazy guns very fun and cheap!","timestamp_created":1388034034,"timestamp_updated":1388034034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8287602","author":{"steamid":"76561198018464565","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":23182,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18167,"last_played":1428636929},"language":"english","review":"KILL ZOMBIES.
