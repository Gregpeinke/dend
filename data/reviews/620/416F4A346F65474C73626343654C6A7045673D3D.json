I finally beat this game, too, so now I feel obligated to make a recommend this game as well.\nPortal 2 picks up about 2 years(?) after Portal 1 left off after Chell was (ANTI-SPOILER CENSOR).  You get the portal gun back, and you actually pair up with GlaDos.  If only Wheatly didn't reasemble her!\nAnyway, the ending was pretty dramatic, funny, and pretty epic if you ask me (you see Chell's arms!).  I have tried a bit of the co-op, which requires some communication with your partner, but word to the wise:  there's a story that picks up where the single-player ends, so beat the SP first.  They just added a level editor, which is pretty user friendly (note:  the emancipation grids are called \"Fizzlers), and you get to upload them and stuff.\nAll in all, Portal 2 is a good game to play, and it has some goodies to keep me sucked in for a while.","timestamp_created":1337382079,"timestamp_updated":1337382079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oeGLsbcCeLjpEg=="}
