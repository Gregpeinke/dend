The visuals were stunning, both in terms of art style and just graphics. The opening portion of the game was an incredible sensory experience, I felt so immersed. The ending (well not the very ending, which got a bit conceited and cinematic imo, but the last truly playable portions) were also very intense. It isn't something I normally notice in a game, but the sound design was phenomenal, and contributed a lot to the game.\n\nReally impressive, and surprising to me was that it made me actually care about Elizabeth. Every time she was in danger I actually panicked, and the penultimate chapter was an emotional roller coaster as a result. The designers did a good job of integrating her powers into combat I felt (although I wish there was a noticeable difference between her reviving you and whatever the hell happened when she didn't).\n\nSadly, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the original bioshock. Both games looked fantastic, had solid gameplay, and compelling stories. But like its predecessor, Bioshock Infinite slumps, though instead of at the end it does so in the early-middle portions. After 'the fall' I found the next portions boring and repetitive, at least compared to the other parts of the game. I didn't find the music as interesting (though it still suited the game), and I passionately hate whoever decided to bastardize Chopin's beautiful Nocturne op 9 no 2 by playing it on repeat through a tinny radio filter...\n\nThe real problem with the game though compared with Bioshock was its level design. Like I said, it looked phenomenal, but a lot of the time it didn't feel like a real place. In my opinino that was the best part of Rapture, was that all of its levels (except perhaps the last few, and that's maybe why they sucked) felt like very real places, while simultaenously allowing for varied gameplay. Columbia by contrast felt very linear and closed-off. Throughout most of the game, I didn't feel like I was navigating a real place so much as a video game level, and there was at a couple points (to my horror) actual backtracking. It wasn't terribly designed, but compared to a masterpiece of design like Bioshock it was dissappointing. On a related note, I felt like the backstory wasn't quite as rich as in Bioshock, with what felt like far fewer recordings. The game itself seemed shorter as well.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game. It's gorgeous both visually and auditorily, and its main characters were compelling. However, its level design was inferior to Bioshock, and the world had less depth to it overall. Certainly a top game of the year, and worth anyone's time, but it's not a legendary game like its predecessor.","timestamp_created":1396320572,"timestamp_updated":1396320572,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9691269","author":{"steamid":"76561197979423339","num_games_owned":604,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1179,"last_played":1396319108},"language":"english","review":"What an absolute masterpiece\n\nJust finished the game, and thought it was one of the best I have played.

And as with all BioShock games, the audio is incredible.  The storyline is also great, like all the other BioShock games.  My only beef with the game is that it has no manual save ability.  With just autosaves, I went though the game far quicker than I would have liked, and missed some of the voxophones and other achievements.\n\n8/10\n\nMy thoughts about the ending:\n\n[spoiler] It's true what they say online, that when Elizabeth is in the rowboat, she has the opposite necklace from what you chose.  But they think that it means that it's not the \"real\" Elizabeth.  These people don't understand the multiverse aspect of the ending, in that there are an infinite number of Elizabeths.  You see a sampling of them in the river scene, and it is perfectly logical that an Elizabeth from one parallel universe may have the opposite necklace.\n\nOf course, the other explanation could be that it's just a bug in the game.\n\nAnd Rapture totally did not need to make an appearance.  This story did not need to be connected to that one in any way.  And, in fact, it does not make sense that Songbird is killed in 1912, but descends past 1960's Rapture.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[u]DLC[/u]\n\n[u]Clash In The Clouds[/u]\nIt's just some skirmish maps.  Would have been better if this was multiplayer.\n\n[u]Burial At Sea - Episode 1[/u]\nIt was good, but so short.  The Radar Range gun was amusing.  And I didn't realize on my first play through that you actually carry more than two weapons at a time.  I was just using the scroll wheel to swap weapons, but if you assign a key and hold it, you get a selection menu.\n\n[spoiler]The ending seemed really vengeful on Elizabeth's part.[/spoiler]\n\n[u]Burial At Sea - Episode 2[/u]\nIt was good too.

As a die-hard Bioshock fan, this game didn't disappoint me. I still prefer the darker and sinister Rapture than the shiny, glorious Columbia, but the last is incredibly well done and gorgeous. All Bioshock elements are still here, plasmids became vigors, you can still upgrade your weapons, use the scenario for your advantage etc. There are no Big Daddys though, and that's something I missed. Hook on air rails is fun, and Elizabeth tear abilities make her extremely useful on combat.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the game was the great focus given to art and story instead of gameplay. The story is very good and the climax is amazing, but there is too much concern on stopping the action all the time for another in-game cutscene, while showing all the minor details of Columbia. In consequence, gameplay is kinda of generic at some points and some big level design errors can be found.\n\nStill an awesome game, an awesome Bioshock.\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1396236021,"timestamp_updated":1396236021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9682196","author":{"steamid":"76561198035705957","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":3322,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2629,"last_played":1551853206},"language":"english","review":"An amazing game with an interesting storyline, awesome fights and great theories.

The art is top notch, but the voice acting feels clunky and fake.  Elizabeth's VA can't fake cry to save her life.  As far as gameplay goes, the only difficult fight in the game is the last one, in which a HUMONGOUS case of Deus Ex Machina occurs, nullifying any potential they had.  With a broken wrist IRL, I got through the entire game (with the exception of the last fight) on Medium.  I then bumbed it down to Easy and finished on my first try.  \n\nBioshock Infinite, while a decent game, far undercuts the expectations of the franchise.  It doesn't feel like a Bioshock game.\n\nOverall, skip it for this price tag.  If you want a better (but \"infinitely\" superior) story, play The Walking Dead Game.  If you want better combat, play Half Life 2.

No. Pero tú sí me das miedo\n\nUna maravilla, una obra maestra, de arte... muchas definiciones se puede llevar éste juego, pero todas buenas desde luego. Espectacular.  En un principio éste juego lo vi en trailers, y cuando aproveche una oferta de steam y dije ''al fin tengo este juegazo original''.... me arrepiento de no haberlo comprado antes. Éste juego vale todos y cada de los dolares que paguéis por él. Pagaría hasta 100 dolares por comprarlo.  Sí, así es, hasta ahora mi juego favorito era Dishonored, pero ha llegado ésta bestia y lo ha relevado, Bioshock Infinite se ha convertido en mi juego favorito, y para mí, no solo es el mejor juego de 2013, sino de toda la generación. Muchos dirán: ''es un FPS más''. Sí, lo es, pero no es ''un FPS más''. ES EL FPS. Y ahora os diré por qué no es ''un FPS más''.  \nJugabilidad: La de posibilidades que hay en el juego son increíbles. Vuelven nuestros queridos plásmidos (en éste juego llamados vigorizadores), con nuevos tipos y muy útiles a la hora de luchar (obviamente, para éso están). Éstos nuevos vigorizadores también nos dan la oportunidad de colocar trampas, lo cual hace que podamos planificar mejor nuestras tácticas a la hora de una pelea. Se ha añadido la opción de esprintar (algo indispensable en los FPS actuales). También tenemos la posibilidad de interactuar con el escenario, ya que Elizabeth puede crear ''desgarros'', lo cual hace que podamos crear cajas de botiquines, de sales, de armas, torretas... etc. En éste nuevo Bioshock encontramos mucha más acción que en los anteriores, aunque sin embargo menos exploración, lo cual no me ha gustado porque Columbia (la ciudad) es increíble y digna de ser explorada a fondo.  \nGráficos: Impresionante. Pero ésta vez hay que matizar que son buenos gráficos en conjunto, ya que individualmente algunas texturas dejan mucho que desear.Éste juego usa el Unreal Engine 3.5. La iluminación es lo que más impresiona, y el diseño artístico y la ambientación son sencillamente sublimes.  \nSonido: Espectacular. Temas y canciones muy pero que muy buenas que se adaptan a la perfección al momento que estamos viviendo. Cabe destacar también el doblaje a nuestro idioma, el cual es brillante y está muy bien doblado.  Innovación: Qué queréis que os diga... increíble. Una ciudad flotante en el cielo, la cantidad nuevos de enemigos que hay, las armas, los nuevos ''plásmidos'', LA HISTORIA... \n En conclusión: Como ya he dicho al comienzo de mi análisis, para mí éste es el mejor juego de la generación sin duda alguna, la historia es digna de una película, y el final.... el mejor final que he visto en mi vida incluyendo videojuegos y películas. Eso sí, la historia es algo compleja, y tras el final, te tienes que comer un poco el coco para matizar algunas cosas, pero una vez la has comprendido y vuelves a jugarlo otra vez... es lo mejor, porque te darás cuenta que durante todo el juego te van dando indirectas y guiños con respecto al final, y pues esas cosas tú la primera vez que lo juegas no las entiendes, pero luego ya lo entiendes todo, ves cómo todo estaba planeado desde el principio, y te das cuenta de que es uno de los mejores juegos jamás hechos.   Cuando todo el mundo creía que Ken Levine no podría superar su trabajo realizado en el primer Bioshock... ¡PAM! Te viene con esta jodida obra de arte hecha videojuego. A mí el primero me encantó, pero definitivamente pienso que éste es mejor. Diría que se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo, pero no es así, porque éste juego te puede causar 2 sensaciones: O no gustarte nada, o que se convierta en uno de los mejores juegos que has jugado.

It also contains some spoilers in the story section.\n\nGameplay-wise, Burial at Sea is fairly fun, with the more stealthy Episode 2 being a nice change from the standard formula. The game seems to heavily encourage stealth, but it's quite possible to slaughter everyone you meet with few problems, you just have to be a bit more cautious and pick enemies off one at a time. Personally, I found it immensely satisfying every time I cleared a room with lethal force, since it was kind of a mix of the best parts of combat and puzzles combined into one. Sadly, the lack of quick-save meant that if you messed a section up, you had to restart from relatively poorly placed checkpoints if you wanted a fresh run at a particular room. One very notable section had a checkpoint followed by a minute and a half-ish section of dialogue that you *had* to listen to before the doors would open.\n\nStory wise (and this is where the EP2 spoilers come in), part one was fairly mediocre, but with an interesting twist at the end. As for part two, the story was just bad. Basically, Elizabeth goes to rapture to rescue a little girl. For some reason (that never seems to be adequately explained), going back to rapture causes Elizabeth to lose all her powers. It is eventually revealed that, apparently, she saw everything that would happen beforehand, and still decided to go, even though it would kill her. Yes, she can apparently see all possible realities, and goes on a long, difficult, journey, and gets herself killed because she's too dumb to just tear a hole into rapture right next to the girl and just grab her.\n\nOne other thing I should note, is that episode two is by far the longer episode, and has much more content. On the whole, episode two is the better part, but you need episode one in order to have any idea what's going on. If Burial at Sea is ever heavily discounted, I would recommend it for the gameplay, but know that the story is not really worth your time.","timestamp_created":1396194116,"timestamp_updated":1396194340,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9676399","author":{"steamid":"76561198039367758","num_games_owned":114,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1490,"last_played":1505658688},"language":"russian","review":"zaebis'","timestamp_created":1396192560,"timestamp_updated":1396192560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546384990215301514","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9676231","author":{"steamid":"76561198057773475","num_games_owned":97,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1052,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":972,"last_played":1402856586},"language":"german","review":"EIn geiles Spiel mit noch geilerer Story, die aber schwer zu verstehen ist!
