What's even more awesome is that I got this during the summer sale for $9.99, saving me half of my Steam card. The story manages to be both hilarious and serious (but mostly hilarious). If someone were to ask me who was my favorite character, I wouldn't know where to start! Wheatley would have to be the worlds greatest moron for his horrible ideas and hilarious frantic personality. Not only is GLaDOS's name fun to type, but there has never been a better villain/antihero/AI. But Cave Johnson would have to be one of my favorites. He's the only supporting character who doesn't hate you or try to kill you, mainly because he's already dead! Also, his attempts to do anything legal or illegal for science make's his character even more likeable. Ok, back to the game. Even when your done with the singleplayer and co-op stories, there is still so much to do! The Perpetual Testing Initiative allows you to create your own test chamber (which might end up crappy) and upload it to the workshop for all to test it! This also gives you an Apperture nametag with your Steam profile pic to make it look like you work at Apperture. Also, you can here quotes from Cave Johnson (who, in this multiverse, is alive (another reason I love him)) whenever you start a community test. Cave's quote and the Apperture name tag make you feel like your an actual part of the story. This game is a 10/10.","timestamp_created":1377466677,"timestamp_updated":1377466677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25879","author":{"steamid":"76561197960435588","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1911,"last_played":1377936767},"language":"english","review":"Brilliant in both single player and coop!","timestamp_created":1377463997,"timestamp_updated":1377463997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5417651","author":{"steamid":"76561198049440059","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":448,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":267,"last_played":1554463934},"language":"polish","review":"Polecam\n","timestamp_created":1377450073,"timestamp_updated":1377450073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6389725","author":{"steamid":"76561198065248698","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1192,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1462557978},"language":"english","review":"Soo many puzzles, onen of the best games I've ever played.
