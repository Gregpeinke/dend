The game world is very unique, attractive, and immersive.  I love the soundtrack and the period setting (a \"futuristic\" 1910s motif, if that makes any sense - it works well even if I'm not explaining it well).  Like 1 and 2, Infinite offers the same dynamic of carrying few weapons and equipping few abilities at a time, with wildly varying strengths and weaknesses, to make highly varied combat experiences based on your choices.  It worked well in those and still works well here.\n\nThe gameplay of Infinite is very solid.  However, I do feel that about halfway or 2/3 of the way through the game, the gameplay had become somewhat repetitive to a degree I never felt in 1 or 2.  But, while 1 and 2 had compelling stories, Infinite outdoes them both, and more than makes up for a bit of repetitiveness when the story unfolds quickly and stunningly to its conclusion at the end of the game.  I found myself still reveling in and piecing together the story of Infinite for a week or more after I finished the game.  The more I pondered, the more meaning and clarity was given to earlier parts of the game, and yet these answers raised other questions.  In short, very rarely has a game's story moved me to the extent of this one.\n\nAs with 1 and 2, I recommend this game to almost all gamers.  I would count all games in the Bioshock series as classics.","timestamp_created":1520737079,"timestamp_updated":1520737079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40727714","author":{"steamid":"76561198043973895","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1239,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":783,"last_played":1595988121},"language":"english","review":"Awsome game, awsome story, crazy as hell ending","timestamp_created":1520731752,"timestamp_updated":1520731752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40725683","author":{"steamid":"76561198133511693","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":448,"last_played":1530604151},"language":"latam","review":"Nada que decir de este bioshock, simplemente un juegazo.","timestamp_created":1520724144,"timestamp_updated":1520724144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40724522","author":{"steamid":"76561198122063080","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3811,"last_played":1654618321},"language":"english","review":"Overall: Stop reading and buy the game durring a steam sale. \n\nSummery: Solid FPS gameplay, Deep story, Good DLC, Will run well on most systems. A gem to grab at a Steam sale.\n\nPros:\n- Best looking game I have obtained that gets a next to perfect 60fps lock\n>>>> Only 1 small area saw dips below 58 fps at max settings.\n- Gameplay that is resembles the original BioShocks but emphises the introduced aspects.\n- The 3 main DLC (Clash in Clouds, Burial at Sea EP 1 And 2) add a lot of cool content.\n- Game play features a combination of older bioShock elements and traditional Shooter elements as well.\n- Story is deep, required 3 play thoughs before I understood the entire story. \n- Executions with SkyHook and AirGrabber (Burial at Sea EP1/2). \n- Skylines and a balanced but versitle movement system.\n- Unlike the Previous bioshocks, namly the second one, NO STABILITY ISSUES. \n\nDLC Pros: \n- Clash in Clouds is challenging and provides a great arena style combat system. \n- Burial at Sea EP 1 & 2 is amongest the best DLC I've played. \n-- EP1 Brings you back to rapture with Bioshocks Infinites combat system combined with Bioshock 1 and 2s one man army approach to weapons. Familar yet differnt.\n-- EP2 Connects the story of BioShock Infinite to the Original BioShock and brings about a stealth system that was very fun to play. Easily the most enjoyable gameplay of the game. \n- Brought back some of the original sounds and models from the original BioShocks Rapture.\n\nCons:\n- Ocasional graphical issue, vissual hole in the map, vissable texture flickering in some areas. \n>>> You likey will not notice if you're not aware of it or looking for it.\n- Combat was pretty generic in many areas. \n>>>> Easy access to cheap ammo from vending machines makes using same weapon most of the game common and Elizabeth is constantly throwing you ammo. \n\nDLC Cons:\n- Other than the Clash in the Clouds and Burial at Sea, the other DLC is basicly a micro transaction. \n- Freight hooks and Skylines (called a slighly differnt name) didn't make sense for Rapture and they were implemented like the Skylines of Colubia were. \n- Didn't reuse the old textures for health packs and Eve bottles. The original meshs and textures made sense only when in Columbia. Didn't rename the equievent Plasmids to the name that was used in the original Bioshocks. Other small and trival immersional related things that take away from the immersion. \n\n","timestamp_created":1520720167,"timestamp_updated":1520720167,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517167389392852783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40722701","author":{"steamid":"76561198135826205","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":550,"last_played":1576161439},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bom jogo muito bom com uma historia otima com um mapa perfeito recomendo mais se for comprar tem que ser pra jogar \nperfeito jogo recomendo","timestamp_created":1520714755,"timestamp_updated":1520714755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40722004","author":{"steamid":"76561198411496694","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":47,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1514912181},"language":"english","review":"Meh\nIt was ok","timestamp_created":1520712783,"timestamp_updated":1520712783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40721054","author":{"steamid":"76561198044695912","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":577,"last_played":1575062451},"language":"english","review":"I might not have played this game for more than 10 hours, but i am 100% sure this game is worth its price, time and way way more!
