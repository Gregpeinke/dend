Не исключено что здесь есть несколько минусов. В общем расскажу про саму игру: На каждой из немногих карт, идущих в комплекте, нужно сдерживать волны зомби-клонов, и не давать им скушать героя и его храбрых друзей. Поскольку дело происходит в Великобритании, то между волнами – обязательный перерыв на чай. В это время работает отличный буфет, только вместо сладеньких булочек – оружие. Покупается оно на фунты, сыплющиеся из убитых монстров. Как только перерыв заканчивается, наш герой, закусив напоследок прихваченной печенюшкой, разбирается с новой волной, и так до встречи с огромным боссом (А точнее - Патриархом).\nИнтересная тактическая возможность: воспользовавшись специальным аппаратом, игроки могут заваривать двери на карте. То есть прошлись горелкой по закрытой двери – и вуаля, теперь пробиться через нее сможет разве что очень большая толпа. Действовать, правда, нужно с умом, если отряд перекроет себе единственный путь к спасению, то пенять будет не на кого. Заодно повышается драматизм – добровольно ушедшего наружу «коллегу» можно счесть за безумца, а случайно оказавшись таким безумцем или потеряв из виду в горячке боя всю группу, можно наткнуться на как раз такую запертую дверь. Это очень «адреналиновая» игровая ситуация, когда британский спецназовец, характерно матерясь, отстреливается от наседающих зомби, а позади него дверь спешно «разваривают» обратно.\nЛегко сказать, но стоит только самооценке привести спецназовца на уровень сложности выше Normal, как за ошибки начнут кусать. Монстров-то много, и разных. Одни – ну чисто классические зомби, разве что по спине горазды гладить да подвывать, но только на них наткнись, как схватят и постараются не отпустить до прибытия более упитанных подкреплений. Оные, как правило, оперативны и жертву настигают стремительно, а дальше пускают в ход что есть – бензопилы, содержимое желудков, крайне тренированные голосовые связки…\nА есть совсем здоровенные. То есть засядет где-нибудь группа и отстреливает себе всех подопытных, чувствует себя уверенно. А тут приходит махина, которая от нескольких выстрелов впадает в ярость и на первого попавшегося бросается. Вы бы видели, какая начинается суета с приходом такого гостя! Один, словно этикет соблюдая, постреливает из пистолета, другой пытается уйти по-английски, без крепких объятий и не пожимая руки, кто-то срочно пытается достать огнемет и запечь угрозу по самые пирожки…\nИ с каждой волной машина для клонирования работает все лучше и лучше, стремясь опечалить игроков сообщением «Ваш отряд уничтожен». Когда финальная волна схлынет, буфет в последний раз продаст нашим героям, как они надеются, что-нибудь серьезное, а затем закроется – продавщица тоже хочет понаблюдать за сражением с боссом. Он на все карты один, но от этого не менее опасный – может стать невидимкой, из пулемета стреляет метко, а если припрет – колет себе шприц с чем-то красным и снова как новенький. И пока полицейские с Бейкер-стрит не приспособились, битвы часто кончались в его пользу, а он, будучи крайне невежлив, обязательно вслед откалывал что-нибудь обидное.\nОтношение к оружию честное и уважительное – после выстрела обязательно вылетит красивая гильза. От удара, сотрясшего парня в камуфляже и противогазе, в руке у него дрогнет и «ствол», хотя затем выдержка возьмет свое, а прицел вернется на место. В дробовик патроны кладут один за другим, при этом пластина-ограничитель прогибается. Когда решают подлечиться и вкалывают в руку состав из походного шприца, ее на мгновение сводит судорога. И еще прицел не рисуют – для точной стрельбы нужно прильнуть поближе к мушке, а уж паля навскидку – палить навскидку.\n\nИ еще достижения. Я, конечно, понимаю, что на них никто не обращает внимания, и долго их не пытаются добыть – 8 часов игры в сутки набежало исключительно от интереса, но хотелось бы чего-нибудь более изобретательного, чем набивать тысячу побежденных монстров.\n\nПлюсы: играть интересно; временами очень зрелищно; оружие красивое; бензопила.\nМинусы: скучная система развития персонажей; Мало карт в комплекте.\n\nСтавлю этой игре 8/10","timestamp_created":1403780908,"timestamp_updated":1403780908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499835044145584106","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10829458","author":{"steamid":"76561198054397308","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":13952,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12114,"last_played":1422880781},"language":"portuguese","review":"Jogo Muito bom e Viciante, Esperando pelo KF2 ^^","timestamp_created":1403780804,"timestamp_updated":1403780804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10827363","author":{"steamid":"76561198067002702","num_games_owned":463,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":534,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":459,"last_played":1416612175},"language":"italian","review":"Questo gioco è sbilanciato.

I was completely helpless against the unending swarm of terrors and died very quickly.  Of course now it's just a hilariously fun time every game.

The game is basically a wave style first person shooter. Pitting you and your team of up to six against massive numbers of Zeds. Zeds is the term for the NPC hostiles you fight in each game mode, and the most basic of them is the clot. The clot is practically the embodiment of the zombie genre, since it moves slow, appears in groups, relatively weak on their own, and who's only way of attacking is getting close and grappling to humans. However the enemy groups are much more expansive and elaborate than their brainless cannon-fodder bretheren. With nine other enemy types: the Stalker, The Crawler, The Bloat, the Scrake, The Husk, The Siren, the Fleshpounder, the Gorefast, and the Patriarch; The game forces you to adapt to each individual when encountered, usually at once and in large quanities.\nIntroductions out of the way, the game is terribly fun once you start expanding into the six player classes, each drastically different from the others. \nEXAMPLE : The Sharpshooter can deal tremendous damage against solitary targets, a few more with bullet penetration, compared to the Demolitions Expert, whom is best used against large hordes and occasionally powerful enemies. Or the Field Medic (almost laughable attack power on higher waves yet possesses the strongest armor in the game and is crucial for team survival on higher difficulties) against the Beserker, whom is a perfect kiting unit that boosts increased speed and armor but not the extent of the Medic, and despite this the Beserker is an expert in melee weapons; these tools are capable of killing almost any ZED with 1 or 2 attacks. Due to the Beserker's Nature, he is almost always on the front lines with the Medic further back.\nNow for my opinion, With over a hundred hours into this game in total with two classes maxed leveled (Sharpshooter and Support Specialist) I can say that without a doubt the game can get boring fast, especially when the same maps are played over and over again. You can easily combat this by always moving into new maps via a roster, yet killing the same enemies again and again can still get tiring despite the different maps. Therefore you must play with a balance, perhaps changing classes every few games to mix up the monotony. \nOver all this game is rather entertaining for such a low price, and with all the dlc updates you can constantly find new strategies when combating the ZED horde. However with Killing Floor 2 being rumored in development, expect to find a sudden drop in players upon the release of the sequel. \nBUY IT NOW, and TRAIN YOURSELF TO MASTER VARIOUS SKILLSETS TO KILL MINDLESS MONSTERS.","timestamp_created":1403758713,"timestamp_updated":1403758713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10821664","author":{"steamid":"76561198013778816","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":6292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6292,"last_played":1356940800},"language":"english","review":"super fun... more fun with friends","timestamp_created":1403758034,"timestamp_updated":1403758034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10821442","author":{"steamid":"76561198024735554","num_games_owned":261,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2833,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2811,"last_played":1430765381},"language":"english","review":"As far as Co-op goes - one of the best group experiences.

The different perks(classes) provide a great variety in the way you play this game, and an RPG like upgrade path. Different environments require different strategies as well. If you just try and blast everything, you will probably fail, so learning the different abilities and weaknesses of the Zeds is important. The different game difficulties require you to master new tactics and tricks in order to be successful. The achievements make you want to keep playing and the social aspect of working with friends is very satisfying. Single player also requires different tactics to multiplayer coop. I have been playing this for a long time now, and still get surprised at how unique each game can be. One of the all time best coop games ever.
