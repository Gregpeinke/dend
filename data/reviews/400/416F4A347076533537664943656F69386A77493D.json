Есть незамысловатый, но тем не менее достаточно интересный сюжет для игры, которая проходится \"за один присест\" (имею ввиду главную игру), и в которой ты вовсе не ожидаешь его увидеть. \n\nЯ просто в восторге от дизайна уровней. Сперва уровень заставляет задуматься, чтобы его пройти, а при повторном прохождении тот же уровень заставляет задуматься, чтобы найти для него новые, необычные и усложнённые способы. И то чувство, когда ты наконец их находишь непередаваемо, даже начинаешь немного чувствовать себя гением, если сделал это самостоятельно, без гайдов. Так и прошёл я с удовольствием все 95% игры. \n\nНу, а для оставшихся ужаснейших 5% отдельно подготовлено место в игровом аду. Это конечно же испытания на меньшее количество шагов (думаю, со мною согласится каждый, кто прошёл игру на 100%). По сравнению с другими, испытание на шаги выглядит крайне убого и является очень дешёвой попыткой сделать игру сложной (я думаю, что по большей части это связано именно с особенностями движка). Очень раздражает, что после отпускания клавиши ходьбы, персонаж ещё совсем капельку проскальзывает в сторону движения... и этого как раз хватает, чтобы засчитать дополнительный шаг! Случайно встал на блок, после того, как прыгнул за ним в портал - получай ещё шаги, хоть и стоишь ты на месте, просто делаешь это на предмете! А при прыжке у меня в половине из случаев добавлялись к счётчику сразу два шага. Да и постоянно регистрируются шаги, которые определённо не должны были.\n\nСамое глупое решение со стороны разработчиков - уровни, верное прохождение которых требует использования багов. Уровень 17 на меньшее число порталов я прошёл честно - поставил портал в комнату за выдвижной плиткой, достал оттуда все валяющиеся на полу камеры и соорудил из них себе \"лесенку\" наверх. Но начав проходить на меньше число шагов у меня возникли серьёзные проблемы. Что ж... не глядя гайда на Ютубе, я бы никогда в жизни бы не догадался, что решением этого является баг на создание портала за стеклом. Для \"правильного\" же прохождения уровня 18 нужно подпереть раскрывающуюся дверь сорванной камерой или сломанным системным блоком (это, на мой взгляд, именно баг, так как дверь ломается (в программном плане, а не на самом деле), издаёт звуки удара о предмет, а при касании может и вовсе убить персонажа).\n\nНо игра стоит внимания, даже через 13 лет после официального выхода. Люблю я находить самое плохое в хороших играх и описывать именно это, а не её плюсы, так что хоть мой обзор и звучит негативно, после прохождения у меня остались только положительные эмоции :)\n\nP.S. После повторного прохождения игры на достижения с ловлей радиосигналов, мелодия, которая играет на радио, теперь постоянно находится у меня в голове, но я и не против :D\n\nP.S.S. И песенка GLaDOS из титров тоже :)\n\nP.S.S.S.

One of Valves most innovative games, and out of their holy trinity (Tf2, Half life 1-2, and Portal 1-2) I would personally rank the Portal series second only to Tf2 (Half life isn't that great in my opinion). Glad0s's dry humour, but the occasional moments of a darker atmosphere, such as the caves of the ratman, or power shutdowns, and the \"surprise,\" really send chills down your spine.","timestamp_created":1592815653,"timestamp_updated":1592815653,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71164042","author":{"steamid":"76561198001004312","num_games_owned":280,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1593378688},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever made.","timestamp_created":1592810513,"timestamp_updated":1592810513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pvS57fICeoi8jwI="}
