In case you think I've reviewed the wrong game, do not despair, I haven't, it's just I feel I need to share this declaration in order to set the foundation of this review. Right, let's get to it. After the HUGE success of Half-Life I was genuinely overwhelmed by the announcement that a sequel would be coming out. I’ve played HL2 when it was first released in 2004 and again recently. So, what did a fan (huge fan) of Half-Life think?\n\nConfused.\nYou begin as Gordon Freeman having just arrived in City 17, from where you don't know and never do. A figure on a screen is broadcasting, a person whose name, once learnt has no meaning to you. The city and indeed the world has been conquered by a force called the Combine. Who they are or why they invaded is never explained (at least in no detail). You meet up with three colleagues from Black Mesa. One is Barney who we know escaped the facility before its destruction. The other two were last seen deep within Black Mesa yet here they are, alive and once again no explanation is given. This theme continues through the game, causing me to constantly scratch my head in thought. Only by reading online did I learn what the hell HL2 was all about, something that I should never have had to do.\nGraphically HL2 was a huge improvement on HL, yet by today’s standards dated and lacking features that one would expect in a FPS. Weapons are your usual standard, with one exception. Enemies are varied including some old favourites.\n\nI can't help but feel that HL2 was (and is) an incomplete game story wise. For me HL2 was not HL. Other than Gordon Freeman and the occasional G-man scene it felt nothing like the original, which was (and is) so good. The only level which reminded me of HL was Ravenholme, a rather scary place. I get the feeling that the developers, after the huge success of HL thought they'd make a sequel but had no idea what story to go with, no idea what to do as most scientists etc were killed in the original. There is no continuous flow from HL to HL2. It was not seamless. It was disjointed and full of storyline holes. As I didn't know who anyone was I found myself not caring what happened to them. I played through the game emotionless, uncaring and confused.\n\n7/10","timestamp_created":1443614093,"timestamp_updated":1443614093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18260757","author":{"steamid":"76561198040196744","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":182,"playtime_forever":2446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":43,"playtime_at_review":930,"last_played":1659816229},"language":"english","review":"Was i moron enough for not playing this game `til now ? - Yes.\n\nWas i moron enough for buying the game but not playing it  ? - Yes and no.

I had no idea why the Combine had invaded Earth, I didn't know what Barney meant by \"Just like old times\". \n\nDepite this, Half-Life 2 was still the most immersive story-driven games I had every played. I didn't know these characters, but I didn't need to in order to connect with them, and I didn't need to know the origin of the setting to understand my actions within the game.\n\nStory related tangents aside, the gameplay here is fantasitc. The limited maximum ammo forces the player to use their entire arsenal, whereas if Half-Life, the ammo capacity was so large you could go the entire game only using about 5 weapons of your huge arsenal. The enemy placement is also great. There are largescale firefights where you are pitted against several enemies, but they're positioned in a way that prevents you from being easily overpowered.\n\nOf course, you also have the joy that is the gravity gun. There are some areas where it is mostly ineffecitve, but in the right place, it is an absolute blast to launch whatever objects might being lying around at your foes, as well as having a makeshift shield wherever there happens to be any props.\n\nI'd reccomend playing on Normal for a casual experience, and Hard if you're looking for a decent challenge. Easy can be fun if you feel like going on a completely uninterrupted rampage, but I personally don't find that totally exciting.\n\nOverall I think this is a game everyone with a steam account should play, along with the rest of the games in the series.","timestamp_created":1443409757,"timestamp_updated":1546274692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18228444","author":{"steamid":"76561198140327296","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":345,"last_played":1591408354},"language":"english","review":"Your life is only half complete before you play this.","timestamp_created":1443391985,"timestamp_updated":1443391985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18227261","author":{"steamid":"76561198066802704","num_games_owned":264,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":24,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24,"last_played":1391111555},"language":"english","review":"Truly Masterful","timestamp_created":1443386290,"timestamp_updated":1443386290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481927722692489624","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18223523","author":{"steamid":"76561198122604100","num_games_owned":372,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":2226,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1809,"last_played":1613679253},"language":"koreana","review":"하하 재미지네","timestamp_created":1443372585,"timestamp_updated":1514310948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18222170","author":{"steamid":"76561198059352359","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":3142,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2628,"last_played":1590355867},"language":"turkish","review":"Half life 3 nerede Gabe ?","timestamp_created":1443367250,"timestamp_updated":1500504806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18221770","author":{"steamid":"76561198137173329","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1707,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":854,"last_played":1656162390},"language":"spanish","review":"half life 3 pls","timestamp_created":1443365771,"timestamp_updated":1443365771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18221457","author":{"steamid":"76561198023344946","num_games_owned":442,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":429,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"Waiting on Half-Life 2 Episode 3","timestamp_created":1443364645,"timestamp_updated":1443364645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18221280","author":{"steamid":"76561198128096233","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":9974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3390,"last_played":1645187820},"language":"french","review":"","timestamp_created":1443363950,"timestamp_updated":1443363950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18220511","author":{"steamid":"76561198120236961","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":211,"last_played":1629155775},"language":"russian","review":"атмосфера,которую нельзя передать словами.Просто поиграйте в эту игру","timestamp_created":1443360896,"timestamp_updated":1443360896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18220041","author":{"steamid":"76561198136365487","num_games_owned":407,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1652882885},"language":"english","review":"One of the epic Valve games!

większość ludzi, którzy w nią zagrali choć raz.\nA więc wymienię jeszcze plusy i minusy gry.\nPLUSY:\n- Świetna (według mnie) mechanika (tak, wiem, powtarzam się :D )\n- Grafika - mało wymagająca gra, potrafi momentami zachwycić\n- Fabuła - część osób nie zwraca na nią uwagi, lecz upominam - WARTO! :)\n- Długość fabuły, przez co gra staje się wciągająca.\nMożna jeszcze dodać, że gra w jakiś sposób rozwija ciekawość, bo jak wiadomo jest do niej przypisane osiągnięcie \"Lokalizator Lambda\", w którym to musimy znaleźć czasami bardzo utajnione/ukryte miejsca i podnieść z nich coś/dokonać czegoś. W każdym z takich miejsc znajduje się charakterystyczny znak (litera) Lambda na ścianie/elemencie otoczenia.\nMałym minusem według mnie jest czasami niezrównoważony poziom trudności, zaczynającym przygodę z Half-Life zalecam zacząć od średniego/trudnego (w miarę umiejętności), a dopiero później rozważać zmianę poziomu trudności na niższy.\nOgólna ocena to oczywiście \"dycha\", gra zasługuje na to nie tylko samym byciem grą, ale również swoją już (można powiedzieć) legendarnością.\nSerdecznie zapraszam do zakupu gry jak i dodatków, bo gwarantuję - nie zawiedziecie się :)","timestamp_created":1443014767,"timestamp_updated":1443014767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18158619","author":{"steamid":"76561198167906999","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1466,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":674,"last_played":1519065091},"language":"english","review":"This game is just simply awesome","timestamp_created":1443014467,"timestamp_updated":1443014467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18158096","author":{"steamid":"76561198161141911","num_games_owned":453,"num_reviews":443,"playtime_forever":714,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1439560503},"language":"english","review":"This is one of those games that makes you remember all of its stages after just playing through it once, they are very memorable.
