Fortress Classic: Outclassed by Time[/h1]\n[b]Introduction to Team Fortress Classic[/b]\nTeam Fortress Classic is an online Team-based action game that takes some assets from Half-Life and expands upon it with its unique gameplay, 9 classes, and Red/Blue Teams.\nUnfortunately, this game has not aged well, and it especially shows nowadays. The difference between this game and its sequel Team Fortress 2 are night and day. Classes in this game look and play differently from their TF2 counterparts, and not for the better (No medigun for Medic, Scout has no double jump, and Sniper has to charge shots, just to name a few). There are still servers up to this day, but only a few have actual people in them. The rest of the servers are completely empty. The players still playing TFC are ridiculously good at the game, and it's difficult to survive for long in the explosive chaos.\n\n[b]Rating: A Classic Outclassed by its Sequel[/b]\nI'd give this game a 3/10. I honestly had a little fun with this game, but with hardcore TFC players aloof, that fun didn't last for long. This game isn't worth buying individually, even for $5. Only get it if its in a Half-Life or Valve bundle (Which is how I got this game).

superior than the uninspired, hacker-rampant TF2\nSubstantially friendlier community if you hang out with the big-name OST guys, but you get the same level of unsustainable long-term autism any boomer shooter brings. People will always scream at you if \"you\" make any sort of mistake, for instance if your blind sniper runs into you while you're diseased and far away from your team, or if you don't know your way around some obscure map nobody's played since 2001, be prepared for some assassin's creed sperg or goldi-locks to spittle their baby food all over their keyboard.\nGrenade spam is annoying, but about as common as sticky spam so it's a fair trade.\n\nPeople should be more like the OST guys and attempt to educate politely, not scream at any new player that makes the simplest mistake. Gatekeeping your horribly balanced boomer shooter doesn't do anyone any good.\n\n[b]TFC has a very high skill floor, but none of that is in relation to in-game mechanics. Being able to handle nailguns and high-speed combat are the barrier to entry, and just like Quake or UT, most people are going to quit because of that. The game isn't particularly hard and it isn't particularly balanced either. Scout and Pyro are quite literally worthless because Scout is outclassed and Pyro only performs well comparatively if you're using dialup. It's not a game that was refined and designed around every class being useful like TF2, so you should have some vague idea as to what each class' strengths and crushing weaknesses are before you hop in. That being said, with the very few available options you're mostly going to be in shotgun fights so the only transferable skill from TF2 is being a scout main and knowing how to meatshot people. Air nades have incredible delay and are pretty sluggish, so piping is spam-and-pray more than ever, and grenade spam is the equivalent of stickybomb spam, so it's goddamn annoying but you get used to dying 100% out of your control a hell of a lot.[/b]\n\nJust don't let the autistic people ruin a potentially fun experience.\n\np.s. when you first launch, change your name in console, so use \"name Sweet_Reverb\" (for example) otherwise you load in named \"Player\" and these fckrs mald like nobody's gd business when they see a new player.","timestamp_created":1633572042,"timestamp_updated":1642622094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100576064","author":{"steamid":"76561198973726147","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":371,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1656535088},"language":"english","review":"Reminds me of fortnite","timestamp_created":1633463827,"timestamp_updated":1633463827,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481927722692489624","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100523236","author":{"steamid":"76561199172901675","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":146,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":32,"last_played":1650004198},"language":"spanish","review":"Good Game Lastima Los Servidores Que Estan Re Muertos Al Menos Estaria Bueno Que Le Añadieran Bots Para Entretenerse Mas","timestamp_created":1633383044,"timestamp_updated":1633383044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100435626","author":{"steamid":"76561198372326129","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":186,"playtime_forever":62,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":62,"last_played":1633264435},"language":"english","review":"You might have some trouble at first playing against veterans, but the game is still fun.","timestamp_created":1633265163,"timestamp_updated":1633265163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100348386","author":{"steamid":"76561198978329087","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":96,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":60,"last_played":1657012825},"language":"tchinese","review":"沒有TFC就沒有TF2","timestamp_created":1633155266,"timestamp_updated":1633155266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100257651","author":{"steamid":"76561198309235459","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":140,"last_played":1634312929},"language":"spanish","review":"Es muy caotico y en la mayoria de las partidas no tendras idea de lo que lo que esta pasando. \nEl juego esta muy mal balanceado, unas clases son buenisimas mientras que otras son basura.
