Сам геймплей приятно скакнул вперед и во многом очень упростился, хотя кому-то это будет в минус. Нету бесполезных взломов, нету бесполезных 100500 оружий и т.д. Игра намного проще, чем ее предшественники. Но сюжет и его развитие очень затягивают. Прошел за 2 дня на харде, игра даже показалась слишком легкой в плане геймплея, но для того, чтобы переварить сюжет, потребовался часик раздумий в довольно таки поникшем настроении.  В ней нет никого необычного в плане игровых механик, но за сюжет ставлю  от себя 10/10. P.S. Не встречал в играх лучше и полезнее компаньона, чем Элизабет. 10/10","timestamp_created":1627243910,"timestamp_updated":1627243910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96366055","author":{"steamid":"76561199130897390","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":130,"last_played":1630260208},"language":"english","review":"My favourite Bioshock game.

things first.\n\nInfinite as a standalone title - It's a great game. Gameplay wise, besides being limited to only being able to hold 2 guns, it's pretty decent. I will recommend this game, but don't jump into the game expect many similarities to the previous 2 series. Graphics is beautiful as well. Stealth wise, this game has none tho. Once enemies spotted you, they are pretty much stuck in aggressive mode even if you run out of the area. For DLCs, the gameplay is pretty decent as well(minus the storyline). CITC might/might not be fun depending on how you decide to approach it. Length of this game is decent as well. Like the previous 2 bioshock games, it encourages exploration with more ammo/health packs/salts/money or even infusion upgrade and the best vigor Return to Sender in those areas(this is close to the end of the game when you get this tho).\n\nInfinite being tied to bioshock series - Bad. While the format they did to vigor was useful since you can now easily switch between the 2 vigors you used often, they now limit you to only being able to have 2 weapons on hand, which SEVERELY limits you to how you want to deal with different situations and enemies, let's not mention you can no longer hold extra health packs and salts so that you can use them when you really need them. People can argue \"But you got Elizabeth!\", sorry but I rather have the same systems as Bioshock 1 & 2 rather than rely on the tooth fairy named Elizabeth to dig up for resources while I run around trying to get around the health/salt/ammunition issues on hand with crazy soldiers shooting at me. The shield system does help to alleviate the issue of not being able to carry health packs somewhat, but when faced with a big horde of angry soldiers it sometimes doesn't help much tho. The upside is that at least in the BaS DLC, I can hold more than 2 types of guns/ammunitions. Some of the gears are pretty useful as well, with some being completely useless/not feasible in most situations. If you want to find a way to cheese through 1999 you might want to soft-reset the checkpoints at certain parts of the game to get the gear you desired since the game generates random gear pieces when you pick them up with the exception of a few fixed ones.\n\nWhat I don't really like - is the storyline. The ending simply does not go well with me, and the DLC made things worse. The story linking to the bioshock series in the DLC feels \"forced\". Episode 1 you have a \"Comstock\" with the \"AD\" tattoo on his hand like Booker which makes completely ZERO sense. If anything, the DLC stories has caused more unanswered questions instead of concluding the story of infinite itself. Jumping through time/alternate realities can easily make or break the story, which this in fact breaks the story as it raises more unanswered questions.\n\nAs a whole, I will say, infinite is a great game, especially if it is a standalone title(not being related to bioshock series at all).","timestamp_created":1627179582,"timestamp_updated":1627179582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96323705","author":{"steamid":"76561198080089577","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1061,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1061,"last_played":1588559579},"language":"english","review":"i cried","timestamp_created":1627179443,"timestamp_updated":1627179443,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96322780","author":{"steamid":"76561198442969199","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":684,"last_played":1645812593},"language":"spanish","review":"si\n","timestamp_created":1627177793,"timestamp_updated":1627177793,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96322530","author":{"steamid":"76561199146242926","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1635562444},"language":"schinese","review":"Kolumbien, die Traumstadt, ist wie der Protagonist Adliger, den der italienische Schriftsteller Italo Calvino in \"Der Baron auf dem Baum\" beschrieben hat. Die Stadt, die auf in der Luft schwebende Anti-Schwerkraft-Substanzen setzt, bricht aus vielen Zwängen aus und ergreift die Antigravitationsmaterial Der \"Ballon\" der Gravitationsmaterie schwebt schließlich zu den Wolken und taucht in Licht.\n\n￼Der Charme, den Kolumbien den Spielern bringt, ist weit mehr als nur die traumhaften Lichter und Farben im Spiel. Freunde, die gespielt haben, sollten sich so gefühlt haben: Hinter dieser wunderschönen Stadt, die dem Himmel nahe ist, haben sich Chaos und Dunkelheit schon immer leicht verbreitet, so dass sich die Menschen selbst angesichts der wunderschönen Landschaft ein wenig in Trance und Unbehagen fühlen.\n\n\nDie Kollision von Licht und Dunkelheit sowie die Infragestellung von Menschlichkeit und Freiheit in der Handlung lassen die meisten Spieler nach Spielende unerfüllt fühlen. Rein aus der Perspektive des Kunststils hat die Vorstellungskraft und Darstellung der Stadt am Himmel des Spiels jedoch bis zu einem gewissen Grad ihren Höhepunkt erreicht.\n\nFaszinierende Welt. Alles faszinierend. Es hat wahrscheinlich wirklich die perfekte Kombination aus Kunst und Gameplay erreicht. Verschiedene Spieler können einen bestimmten Teil finden, der ihnen gefällt.

It's a shooter with satisfying and fantastic gunplay, and a very good story/characters. The story can sometimes get a little too much, but is still great and, fundamentally, the game is very fun and absorbing.\n\nAt the end of the day, Bioshock Infinite is a shooter, and as a shooter it is very, very fun. It has this perfect balance of making you feel invincible without actually being easy- that is to say, you will die if you don't play well, but the game absolutely succeeds in making you feel like a badass. It's extremely satisfying. The landscape you're fighting in and beautifully made and detailed, and the worldbuilding is excellent. This really adds to the gameplay: it feels like you're playing in a world with real character rather than just an empty sandbox. The general atmosphere, something which is very hard to do well in a game, is extremely absorbing, similar to another game- Dishonoured, one of my favourites of all time. They really nailed it here. The characters are also very good and mostly genuinely interesting to hear, and the story is very well made and a major component of the game which distinguishes it from other shooters.\n\nThe game has its flaws. For example, you are given plenty of guns and vigours (i.e. special abilities/powers) to use in order to try and simulate a 'play your own way' approach. This sort of works, and allows the player to use a weapon which feels satisfying to them, but you'll generally be using the same 2-4 weapons the whole time because, although there are maybe a dozen, around 6 of them are actually good. A few of the special abilities feel a little underwhelming as well. The game would benefit a LOT from a greater number of both to properly realise the vision of the player being able to utilise any play-style. The story, whilst good, can sometimes get a little too much: what I mean by this is that whilst I do believe it's a well-written story, it excessively talks about 'quantum particles' and 'alternate realities' without really explaining them. The ending, whilst it does make sense and is a good twist, confused many because it can be difficult to follow just what the story is talking about. \n\nThese problems are sort of marginal, though. You might notice them occasionally, but personally what I really thinking throughout the game was mostly either 'wow this is fun' during gunplay or 'wow this is cool' when just browsing the beautiful level-scapes. I strongly recommend this game. As an introduction to the singleplayer FPS genre, it is excellent. If you've enjoyed games like Dishonoured, Prey, Metro, Wolfenstein, or Far Cry it'd be stupid NOT to get this game. \n\nEach playthrough is about 10h and because the opening/ending scenes are so long (as they're used to drive the story) you probably won't be bothered to start a second playthrough immediately due to not wanting to go through the long opening exposition again. This is definitely a flaw, but give it a while like I did and you can certainly enjoy the game again. Because of the 10h playthrough time, maybe get it on sale (like I did), but if it is on sale absolutely pick it up.","timestamp_created":1627136080,"timestamp_updated":1627136080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96293662","author":{"steamid":"76561198065508686","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3190,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2156,"last_played":1633284564},"language":"german","review":"Blockbuster <3","timestamp_created":1627134882,"timestamp_updated":1627134882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96292550","author":{"steamid":"76561198198129937","num_games_owned":458,"num_reviews":275,"playtime_forever":1623,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1623,"last_played":1627133303},"language":"russian","review":"ᅠ ᅠ","timestamp_created":1627133354,"timestamp_updated":1647664655,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467496544122695923","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96291107","author":{"steamid":"76561198177215927","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":634,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":634,"last_played":1627058940},"language":"schinese","review":"没那么生化奇兵却非常生化奇兵的生化奇兵 剧情很有意思 也足够便宜（推荐买大包 生化奇兵3部都很好玩）\n唯一美中不足的是 [spoiler] 没有小妹妹我浑身就像有大老爹在爬[/spoiler]\n","timestamp_created":1627131271,"timestamp_updated":1627131271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96290332","author":{"steamid":"76561198157658880","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":865,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":865,"last_played":1627129811},"language":"koreana","review":"엘리자베스.. 죽일걸","timestamp_created":1627130190,"timestamp_updated":1627130190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96288003","author":{"steamid":"76561199124165931","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":274,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":212,"last_played":1651898837},"language":"russian","review":"топ \n","timestamp_created":1627126609,"timestamp_updated":1627126609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96287838","author":{"steamid":"76561199041235540","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":801,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":800,"last_played":1627126944},"language":"tchinese","review":"推薦程度: 超出預期\n\n遊戲類型: FPS\n遊玩難度: 中等\n遊戲性: 9/10\n探索性: 7/10\n觀賞性: 8/10\n\n簡評: 完美地把生化奇兵系列提升到另一層次, 前半段就像是一部迪士尼電影一樣的冒險之旅, 後半段回歸系列節奏, 結局來個神逆轉, DLC再把故事和第一集連結起來, 充滿新鮮感卻味道依然, 新系統讓戰鬥部份更加精彩, 唯一缺點是可攜帶武器實在太少","timestamp_created":1627126340,"timestamp_updated":1627126340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538167953491210938","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"96287160","author":{"steamid":"76561198364523478","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":397,"last_played":1627122039},"language":"english","review":"Worse in every way.\n\nNEGATIVES\n\n- Can no longer carry more than two weapons at a time\n- No manual save feature, all autosaves and the autosaves are sometimes spaced out up to an hour apart. If you're actually interested in exploring you can get screwed over very easily. How is it possible to fuck this up?\n- Powers all feel gimped and lifeless compared to their Bioshock 1 and 2 counterparts, pretty sure shock jockey only immobilizes enemies for one full second.\n-No more hacking, best you get is the ability to make robots a temporary ally but if you don't kill them by the end of the duration they'll just turn on you again.\n- Weapon Upgrades are no longer visually represented on your weapons making them much less interesting and turning every upgrade in to a boring stat boost (e.g. +2 Machine Gun)\n- No more Gene Tonics and no equivalent instead you get a \"Gear\" system where you can arbitrarily only equip 4 items at once which arbitrarily are filtered in to different slots further gimping creative playstyles in an already barren game.\n- Can no longer carry Healing Kits or Salts, forcing you to constantly get chewed away at by hitscan bulletsponge enemies while searching every inch of the floor for crumbs or a puddle of Salts you can slurp up before they blast your head off.\n- No player choice, not even minor player choice. Saving or harvesting Little Sisters in the old games was kind of a shallow way of introducing morality and alternate endings but to remove all player choice entirely seems insane. I get to pick a bird or a cage necklace though! Yay..?\n- Oh, also, no alternate endings.\n- Elizabeth is hateable from both a character and gameplay perspective. I've watched her walk through walls, objects, people, and most annoyingly of all back and forth in front of whatever thing I happen to be trying to read, the \"finding things\" mechanic she has is also annoying, she never shuts up. I would understand and actually like it if she were just finding real items in the environment that I may have overlooked then I might actually feel like she's helping me but that isn't what she's doing. As far as I can tell she's magically pulling these things out of her ass or a tear or whatever stupid logic Ken Levine wants to use. I almost feel like this was a way to get around putting more effort in to the item placement in levels because if there's not whatever item you would actually need around you right now Elizabeth can just magic it the fuck up so we're good. Why allow you to actually carry equipment to prepare yourself for an engagement? Hahahaha that would just be craaaaazy!\n- Researching enemies is gone. Thing that's been around since System Shock 2 they felt the need to eliminate. WHY NOT GET RID OF THE AUDIO LOGS TOO WHILE WE'RE AT IT KEN?!?!???!\n- Buggy. I've found doors that go out of the map. I've watched enemies spawn in front of my face. I've killed enemies and had their bodies despawn in front of me and not even leave a loot container. I've watched enemies stand in place and stare at me just waiting for death. 10/10 experiences!\n- Disposable lockpicks are horseshit and I feel like they're only here to try and get you to subconsciously feel like Elizabeth is actually useful and to try and convince you to spend more of your time exploring the boring empty maps so you can sit and look at all the neat setpieces someone at the company spent way too much time on. \n- No Map. Didn't even include a Map. Another thing a game from 30 years ago got right that this didn't somehow. Are you guys devolving? Now we're stuck with a \"GO THERE\" giant fuck off arrow.
