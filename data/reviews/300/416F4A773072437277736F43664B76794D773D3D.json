No jogo há duas equipes, o exército americano e o exército alemão, e cada classe possui uma arma e função diferente dentro da equipe. O multiplayer anda um pouco vazio, mas sempre há alguém jogando em servidores nacionais, consegui jogar tranquilo e achei bem divertido. A jogabilidade e a física são boas, com selo de qualidade Source, o que peca é a mira, alguns dizem que é proposital, mas ela é ruim mesmo. Existe uma quantidade boa de modalidades e mapas, contando os oficias e os não oficiais, que são muito bons também; algumas modalidades de jogo requerem bastante estratégia e trabalho em equipe. A trilha sonora não é muito presente, mas é boa, os gráficos eram bons na época que foi lançado e ainda são agradáveis, é um game leve e eu recomendo.\n\nMinha nota: 8,5/10","timestamp_created":1421413882,"timestamp_updated":1441204324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.729605615139007568","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14003791","author":{"steamid":"76561198027242882","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":35792,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2121,"last_played":1657921149},"language":"portuguese","review":"melhor game pra fazer amigos e se divertir","timestamp_created":1421372299,"timestamp_updated":1421372299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13998967","author":{"steamid":"76561198090417717","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":538,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1514842354},"language":"english","review":"If Half-Life and Cod WaW had a down syndrome baby","timestamp_created":1421351484,"timestamp_updated":1421351484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13998375","author":{"steamid":"76561198112538147","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":66,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":65,"last_played":1434247925},"language":"english","review":"It's a bit like capture the flag on TF2, except that its people in army uniforms.
