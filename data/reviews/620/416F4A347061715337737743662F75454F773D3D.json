With great puzzles that start you off with the same old tricks as the first Portal, but now new tricks and Apature sciences crazy experiments such as propulsion gel, conversion gel, repulsion gel, hard light bridges and gravity funnels. Lots and lots of fun and thinking to get through some of these test chambers. With the hi jinks and jokes also at an all time high, I have to say Portal and Portal 2 are some of my favorite games. Also for the achievement hunters there is a lot of new hidden gems through out the test chambers and game to find. Also with an all new co -op capability you can use robots Peabody and Alpha  to hook up with friends to defeat some ultimate hard puzzles that need both players sharp and thinking. Also there is the level creator, so you can make your own test chambers. And then other people can try to solve them! Just hope you don't develop ''the Itch''.

Klar, der Humor war gut, doch fand ich, dass das Potenzial nicht komplett ausgenutzt wurde. Doch das macht Portal 2 dafür um so besser.\n\nStory\nDas Spiel spielt eine unbestimmte Zeit nach dem ersten Teil. Chell (unsere Protagonistin) wacht in einem Hotelzimmer wieder auf. Sie soll einige Fitnessübungen absolvieren, danach legt sie sich wieder schlafen. Als sie wieder aufwacht, ist das Zimmer zerstört. Wheatley, ein kleiner Roboter, der die menschlichen Testsubjekte von Aperture Science überwacht, klopft an die Tür und CHell lässt ihn herein. Die beiden begeben sich auf die FLucht aus Aperture. Doch Wheatley aktiviert aus Versehen GlaDOS wieder zum Leben, die sich sofort an Chell rächen möchte. So beginnt ein Abenteuer, welches sich von Testkammer über Testkammer bis zu den Anfängen von Aperture Science abspielt.\n\nGameplay\nDas Gameplay ist wie im ersten Teil. Zwei Portale, in das eine rein, aus dem anderen raus. Neu hinzu kommen Katapultplattformen, verschiedene Gele und noch ein paar andere nette Elemente. DIe Tests sind anfangs noch einfach, werden aber mit der Zeit immer kniffliger. Allerdings sind sie dieses Mal etwas mehr auf Physik basiert. \n\nGrafik\nWas soll man zur Grafik sagen? Die gute alte Source-Engine, ein wenig aufgefrischt mit etwas schöneren Texturen.\n\nFazit\nGROSSARTIGES SPIEL! Zwar hat man es in etwa fünf bis sechs Stunden durch, wenn man rusht, doch es lohnt sich. Für Leute, die nicht alleine testen wollen, gibt es einen Co-Op-Modus, der eine komplett eigene Story hat und mindestens genau so lang ist wie die Einzelspieler-Kampagne. Zudem gibt es einen Map-Editor, mit dem man eigene Tests erstellen kann. Und durch die Community gibt es quasi endlos langen Spielspass. \n\nMeine Wertung: 9/10 Punkten\n\n","timestamp_created":1429629959,"timestamp_updated":1429629959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15476821","author":{"steamid":"76561198052689431","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":412,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1473225034},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games i've ever played, BUY IT!!","timestamp_created":1429625745,"timestamp_updated":1429625745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15476671","author":{"steamid":"76561198163426003","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1975,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1459,"last_played":1656705485},"language":"thai","review":"Good","timestamp_created":1429624935,"timestamp_updated":1429624935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4paqS7swCf/uEOw=="}
