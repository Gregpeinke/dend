You first are introduced to a seemingly friendly floating robot head Wheatley. He takes you through a bunch of tests which GLaDOS is presenting you with while he tries to take over the place. What happens next You have to find out for yourself.\n\n– My thought’s\nThe game itself is a piece of Art. Everything about the game just screams yes. The game is about puzzles and thinking with portals. If you haven’t played the first portal that’s ok, I’ve played the first portal a long time ago and it didn’t impact the second game that much. Story mode of the game is done perfectly, voice acting as silly as it may in a robot game is done very well + animations are great. Maybe the only way it would be improved if you could play co-op with more people, other than that it’s perfect. I personally like the introductions of the Portal gun. Co-op was executed as good as you can possibly execute it, I was stunned to see how well the Multiplayer was made. A lot of games don’t have a good co-op system and/or multiplayer, but Portal 2 just took made it as easy as possible. If you wish to play co-op I suggest finishing singleplayer beforehand. Co-op doesn’t include a story, but rather multiple puzzles for you and your friend. I honestly can’t find anything bad to say about this game because it is just perfect, little to no bugs at all.\n\n– The summary\nThe game is excellent for people who wan’t to challenge themselves and friends.\n\n– The Pros\n+ Story – The game has an excellent story mode for you to complete.\n+ Co-op – This game includes a co-op mode for you and your friends to play, and can be set up in a matter seconds.\n+ Smooth graphics – The graphics of the game are just stunning and perform well even for not so good computers.\n+ Little to no Bugs – In my time of gameplay I didn’t experience any bug at all.\n+ Community workshop – When I found out I could play other people’s creations I was just sucked even more into the game then before.\n+ Level editor – Another option the game allows is a custom editor for you to make your own maps and creations and share with the world.\n+ Independant game – What I mean by this is, even if you haven’t played the first portal game you don’t need to because the game’s story mode isn’t affected by the other game.\n\n– The Cons\n+ Short ending – To be honest this is the only thing I could put on this, it doesn’t even deserve a “The bad” section because it was so darn good.\n+ Micro-Transactions – The only way to customize your character within the game is to spend a few bucks on a skin.\n\n– The rating \n+ I would rate the game a solid 9/10 just because of the performance and everything about it. Definitely suggest this game to your more puzzle-loving friends.","timestamp_created":1399063931,"timestamp_updated":1448451786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543222725391387939","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10000272","author":{"steamid":"76561198093814335","num_games_owned":401,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":774,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":406,"last_played":1527267609},"language":"spanish","review":"Buen juego.\nTe hace pensar, tiene una jugabilidad perfecta y una personalidad de los personaje muy buena","timestamp_created":1399062049,"timestamp_updated":1399062049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10000209","author":{"steamid":"76561198065304903","num_games_owned":83,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2152,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1985,"last_played":1519675455},"language":"english","review":"siiiiiiick","timestamp_created":1399061428,"timestamp_updated":1399061428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9999883","author":{"steamid":"76561198013326941","num_games_owned":380,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1397,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":705,"last_played":1658955598},"language":"english","review":"Well.

Borealis — «сияние»; греч. Βορέας — «северный») — исследовательский корабль-лаборатория, принадлежавший Лаборатории исследования природы порталов (Aperture Science).\n\nИнцидент с Бореем\nБорей являлся исследовательским кораблём Aperture Science, расположенным в Кливленде (штат Огайо), и содержал на борту некий высокотехнологичный груз (учитывая тотальную секретность проекта, надо полагать, Борей содержит весьма мощные и опасные технологии, связанными, судя по всему, с теми же технологиями использования порталов, поболе, чем позволяет ASHPD (Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device) или попросту — Portal Gun). Что бы ни находилось на борту Борея, если Альянс доберётся до него первым, овладей он содержимым, последствия будут катастрофическими, учитывая выгоду Альянса. У последнего нет абсолютного преимущества по отношению к разработкам Black Mesa и Aperture Science, однако, если он доберётся до такового, шансов у галактики мало :D\n\nВ своём стремлении обойти Чёрную Мезу и получить правительственный грант, в «Aperture Science» пренебрегли «элементарными мерами безопасности», из-за чего в результате инцидента произошел мощный выброс энергии, связь с кораблём прекратилась и он просто исчез в одно мгновение с частями его сухого дока и вместе со всей своей командой, и стал считаться навеки утерянным, а после и вовсе превратился в научный миф.\n\nВ Half-Life 2: Episode Two\n\nПосле расшифровки сообщения от Джудит Моссман, которое было перехвачено компьютерной системой в Цитадели Альянса в Half-Life 2: Episode One выясняется, что находкой Моссман было именно расположение Борея, причём обнаружен он был скованным льдами в Арктике. В этом же сообщении стало ясно, что Альянс тоже занимается поисками Борея. Доктор Кляйнер предлагает использовать научные данные, находящиеся на Борее, против Альянса, но Илай Вэнс решительно отвергает это, утверждая, что нельзя допускать повторения катастрофы, произошедшей в Чёрной Мезе и Борей необходимо уничтожить («Чёрная Меза тебя так ничему и не научила? Такую мощь невозможно контролировать!»). По всей вероятности, именно Борей подразумевался в предупреждении G-man'а «Будь готов к непредвиденным последствиям», которое он передал Илаю уже вторично (впервые G-man сказал ему это перед катастрофой в Чёрной Мезе).\n\n[spoiler]Когда Аликс Вэнс и Гордон Фримен отправляются на поиски Борея и Джудит Моссман, в ангаре, где находится их вертолёт, на них нападают Советники Альянса и убивают Илая Вэнса.\n\t                                                                    \n\"Корабль должен быть уничтожен!

There's plenty of gameplay options and the single player game practically picks up the story from Portal. You'll more insight into the Founder of Aperture Science and also a little story on GlaDOS. Each time i thought, \"Ok, this must be the last boss fight\" boy am I wrong! I love the surprise one after another. The game starts off similarly as Portal, where the player must go through tests after tests, but there's plot twists in between. I love this aspect, as it's not just a simple puzzle solving game but there are stories behind it. It's practically an Adventure game actually.\n\nThe new Co-Op mode is also interesting, though you'll need a partner who is able to spend just as much time playing in the mode with you. I have not been able to complete it yet as it really requires another player to play this mode.\n\nApart from that there's a few interesting Extra's that are funny. I really enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed Portal. Highly recommended to those who finished Portal single player as you get further stories as continuation to Portal.","timestamp_created":1398956775,"timestamp_updated":1398956775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9989122","author":{"steamid":"76561198003756245","num_games_owned":394,"num_reviews":357,"playtime_forever":357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":357,"last_played":1398953481},"language":"russian","review":"Увлекательная головоломка.
