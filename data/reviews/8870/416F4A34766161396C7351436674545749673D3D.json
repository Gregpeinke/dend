I really grew attached to a lot of the characters and I LOVED exploring Columbia. The setting, art and soundtrack is fantastic! That being said, I do think the hype of the game has hurt it a little--the gameplay, while fun for me personally, is a little repetative and not particularly complex or difficult. As a story-driven gamer this was fine for me and I loved the game, but if you lean more to gameplay-driven you might find yourself frustrated.\n\nI do think that it's totally worth the price it's currently at, though--I preordered the game at full price and don't regret it one bit, so it's DEFINITELY worth the current price (as I write this, $30). I do highly suggest giving it a try if you're interested in the game, it's really, really enjoyable.\n\nAlso, a warning: AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS. It's much, much better to go into this game fresh than to play it with everyone's opinions and the story spoilers floating around in your head, I feel. Since it was a very hyped and critically acclaimed game there's a ton of arguments about the game on the net--which are worth reading, but AFTER playing the game. Try to go into the game with neither super high or negative expecations from others, I think it's a much more enjoyable experience that way.","timestamp_created":1392472345,"timestamp_updated":1392472345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9119737","author":{"steamid":"76561197977948916","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":822,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":765,"last_played":1631975894},"language":"english","review":"The story looses it's ground at times, but this is because it's simply hard to keep all the strings tied together, replaying the game is a solid decision for anyone who might have gone through it a bit too fast.\n\nDefinitely one of the top 5 of 2013, in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1392468462,"timestamp_updated":1392468462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9118529","author":{"steamid":"76561198047972213","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":780,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1385873487},"language":"russian","review":"заебись!","timestamp_created":1392462956,"timestamp_updated":1392462956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9118012","author":{"steamid":"76561198039301456","num_games_owned":588,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1061,"last_played":1596988050},"language":"russian","review":"Игра отличная.

The story is just a crazy rollercoaster ride that has you bent over on a table and mind-f*cked. First off, the story is quite possibly one of the best stories ever (granted there were some parts in the game that were not necessary). The way the game drops plot bombs on you as you go is just insanely clever, constantly leaving you baffled by the events that pass. The entire setting and scenery of this floating city in the sky, Columbia, is absolutely beautiful while at the same time giving off a eerie vibe as all bioshock games do. There are hardly any flaws in this game in my opinion and i would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good story as well as some intense FPSing. The DLC Burial at Sea was definitely worth getting and i can't wait for part two. 9.75/10\n\nP.S That ending though..","timestamp_created":1392456817,"timestamp_updated":1392456817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9117219","author":{"steamid":"76561197988277688","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1189,"last_played":1396043460},"language":"english","review":"Elizabeth 2 Hot","timestamp_created":1392456527,"timestamp_updated":1392456527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9116457","author":{"steamid":"76561198052798110","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1055,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1023,"last_played":1581334913},"language":"french","review":"Superbe jeu, dynamique beacoup plus que les 2 premiers, artistiquement parfait sortir de rapture fait énormement de bien, elizabeth est attachante, il ne faut absolument pas hésiter","timestamp_created":1392452035,"timestamp_updated":1392452035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9115813","author":{"steamid":"76561198043802509","num_games_owned":928,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":536,"last_played":1374040679},"language":"english","review":"GOTY 2013, so intense\n\nPS TLoU is dull overhyped crap\nPSS GTAV is really good","timestamp_created":1392448300,"timestamp_updated":1392448300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560867607593536377","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9115138","author":{"steamid":"76561198039317229","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1620,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":848,"last_played":1416727220},"language":"english","review":"Holy bualsville why aren't you already playing this game","timestamp_created":1392444352,"timestamp_updated":1392444352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9114961","author":{"steamid":"76561198065816935","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1411,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":530,"last_played":1396069665},"language":"english","review":"wow what a game, the beginning can seem like too much action and shooting but man did that ending make my nipples wet.\n9/10 fo shizzle definatly in my top 3 games.","timestamp_created":1392443213,"timestamp_updated":1392443213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9114721","author":{"steamid":"76561198117051427","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":752,"last_played":1551053885},"language":"spanish","review":"La historia de Bioshock Infinite es sencillamente sublime, Columbia es impactante, la relación entre Elizabeth y DeWitt, soberbia.

Experienced through the eyes of Booker DeWitt, the franchise's latest utopia-gone-wrong, Columbia, is a watercolor painting come to life and is a joy to behold. However, it's Elizabeth, the game's other main lead, who steals the show. Elizabeth is so well realized and beautifully animated/voiced, she'd be right at home in a Pixar or Disney film – she even sings (quite well, I might add) at one point during her and Booker's journey. Without spoiling anything, the story is quite ambitious and largely delivers. However, unlike the first and second games, Infinite does not give the player the chance to make any meaningful decisions and is a more on-rails experience this time around.\n\nFrom a purely gameplay perspective, Infinite is a solid action-shooter, yet felt uninspiring at times. It takes many cues from Bioshock 1 and 2 while adding several new wrinkles such as the skyline system, and the ability (*minor spoiler*) for Elizabeth to warp in ammo and other helpful items. Plasmids reprise their role in the form of vigors, yet they feel a bit out of place in Columbia and seem like they were only included as a way to make sure franchise veterans would recognize Infinite as a proper Bioshock game. \n\nIn another departure from earlier games, Infinite only allows the player to hold two weapons at a time. While not a huge deal, it makes fully upgrading one or two guns nearly pointless, as you know you'll probably just be picking up whatever is available at any given time. Guns also don't feel as unique as they did in Bioshock 1 or 2.  Enemies are fairly bland and Infinite does not provide enough opportunities to square off against the cooler foes. Midway through the game, fights became more of a chore than anything else -- perhaps this was a result of only playing on medium difficulty.\n \nWhile the gameplay left a bit to be desired, Infinite is an incredible overall experience and the city of Columbia is well worth exploring. I definitely recommend it. If you're on the fence, just wait till it inevitably goes on sale.","timestamp_created":1392346757,"timestamp_updated":1392346757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9095290","author":{"steamid":"76561198023278179","num_games_owned":494,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":715,"last_played":1392341675},"language":"english","review":"Comprem e joguem.\nO jogo pode não ter a melhor jogabilidade, pode ser fácil demais.
