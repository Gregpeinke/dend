It attracted universal praise and paved the way for future FPS titles. Now over 10 years after its release, does it still stand the test of time?\n\nWith regards to gameplay, HL2 has an intuitive control system that is easy to master and feels right at home with any modern day shooters. The level design has excellent variation and creativity, whether you are speeding through canals on an airboat or overrunning Nova Prospekt with a swarm of Antlions, each chapter has its own unique feel. The pacing is also well balanced, with high intensity action scenes often followed by slower paced puzzle areas. This helps to prevent repetition and keeps gameplay feeling fresh.\n\nThere is a decent enemy selection, ranging from Combine military units to zombie hordes; however the AI does feel a little dated by today’s standards. At best the enemy behaviour is quite predictable, and at worst often exploitable. Squad AI also deserves a dishonourable mention as it is incredibly annoying when friendly squad members continuously block tight corridors or refuse to jump down from higher levels.\n\nThe weapon arsenal is a fairly standard layout comparable to what you would find in most shooters, however the ground breaking exception to this is the gravity gun. HL2 was revolutionary in its use of physics and even years later the design concept of this weapon still manages to feel innovative to me. Although you can largely go through the game without making much use of it, there are a couple of fun achievements that force you to rely on using gravity gun based attacks and techniques.\n\nThe puzzle sections are relatively easy, usually focusing on showing off the physics engine by manipulating environmental objects, but they are passable and serve as a nice diversion to the obligatory action scenes.\n\nGraphically, Valve’s pioneering Source Engine has of course started to show its age but it still manages to do a competent job. The fact that it was designed as a modular engine means that Valve has been able to apply upgrades relatively easily, providing vast improvements in graphical quality as the series progressed. The character models still look decent enough, and the facial expressions / lip sync movements of the main characters (Alyx in particular) are fairly impressive for their time.\n\nThe environments and lighting are also still solid. The transitional sunset sequence in the Water Hazard chapter stands out in my mind. Occasionally some of the background images look very flat, but this can be forgiven considering they are never the primary focus of attention. Visceral sound effects and small details like dropped shell casings and blood splatters help to elevate the experience. The soundtrack itself is a mixture of short electronic tracks and ambient sounds which I personally feel is a bit lacking and out of place at times.\n\nLike its predecessor, Half-life 2 uses fluid, in game story telling that does not remove the player from game play. The story itself is fairly light and the game relies more on environmental narration and atmosphere. This subtle style does work quite well, but it can result in some sections of the game feeling like you are simply travelling from point A to point B and it is fairly inconsequential why you are doing so. What the game does do incredibly well is creating the atmosphere and tone of the environment that the game is set in. Within the first hour of gameplay I can feel invested in the oppressive, dystopian society of City 17. The main characters are also memorable which is helped by some decent voice acting.\n\nOverall, even when assessed by today’s standards, HL2 still manages to provide a fluid and satisfying experience. There are some highly innovative gameplay elements which have been integrated into a classic FPS framework. It is an incredibly well polished presentation with very few glitches or significant criticisms. It should be an essential part of anyone’s Steam Library and it genuinely does stand the test of time. So, if you have not played HL2 in a while (or ever), then what are you waiting for? Wake up, Mr Freeman. Wake up and smell the ashes.","timestamp_created":1483896823,"timestamp_updated":1491849728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504950523376464844","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29118017","author":{"steamid":"76561198085332728","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":2399,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1822,"last_played":1643189631},"language":"finnish","review":"Very good game","timestamp_created":1483887347,"timestamp_updated":1542995579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29117678","author":{"steamid":"76561198328981134","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1024,"last_played":1632897523},"language":"schinese","review":"阿基米德：“给我一个支点，我就能翘起地球。”\n\nDr.Gordon Freeman：“给我一把撬棍，我就能撼动两个文明。”\n\nGabe Newell：“你给我什么我都不会数3的。”","timestamp_created":1483886500,"timestamp_updated":1494994291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29115842","author":{"steamid":"76561198301067615","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1488988456},"language":"russian","review":"Для ностальгии самое то)Покупайте!Не зря потратите средства!","timestamp_created":1483881832,"timestamp_updated":1483881832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518072307109832764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29114677","author":{"steamid":"76561198319758405","num_games_owned":30,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":382,"last_played":1531237757},"language":"italian","review":"Bello, nient'altro da dire","timestamp_created":1483878554,"timestamp_updated":1483878554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29114570","author":{"steamid":"76561198313935278","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":171,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1467630863},"language":"schinese","review":"说想吐的评测都点个赞，游戏可能是个好游戏，我不清楚是画面的原因还是什么，一玩就头晕想吐。如果你买了也发现头晕的问题，不要疑惑，不止你一个！！！","timestamp_created":1483878289,"timestamp_updated":1483878289,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.394837379455566406","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29112616","author":{"steamid":"76561198061679288","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1031,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":642,"last_played":1610895076},"language":"english","review":"just buy it already 10/10","timestamp_created":1483872693,"timestamp_updated":1483872693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29112249","author":{"steamid":"76561198195186561","num_games_owned":423,"num_reviews":79,"playtime_forever":831,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":504,"last_played":1561024828},"language":"polish","review":"Good game valve :D","timestamp_created":1483871524,"timestamp_updated":1483871524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29112102","author":{"steamid":"76561198340446888","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1299,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1638048657},"language":"russian","review":"Классическая, но по-прежнему современная игра.

Quite possibly the greatest gaming value in history, or at least close to it\n2. Console jockeys now will know the pleasure of Half-Life 2, et al\n3. Portal is one of the more memorable and original FPS experiences in years\n4. The Half-Life games tell a story better than any FPS in recent memory\n\nCons:\n\n1. Driving in Half-Life is dismal\n2. People will complain about the controls, others will be glad to be keyboard free\n3. Yup, framerate issues again, the Xbox 360 version runs more smoothly\n4. Load times can be a drag, not too long, but close for a FPS\n5.
