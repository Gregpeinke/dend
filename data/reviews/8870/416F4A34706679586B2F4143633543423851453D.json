      Booker DeWitt剧情\n\n　　1874年，4月19日。Booker DeWitt出生。\n\n　　1890年，Booker参与了伤膝大屠杀，由于其对于土著印第安人残暴的行为，被冠以 \"The White Injun\"的称号。\n\n　　伤膝战役小科普：Booker在16岁参军，在伤膝河战役时，Booker在犹豫该不该下手屠杀已经投降的平民，而中士此时面对所有人指责Booker拥有土著人的血统（所以才不下杀手）。为了不被朋友同僚嘲笑，Booker剥掉了土著人的皮，并点燃了仍有印第安人在内的帐篷。由于这一令人发指的行径，编队中的同僚，包括Cornelius Slate，给了他这个The White Injun（白皮印第安人）的称号，因为Booker喜欢从受害者身上收集战利品。\n\n　　经过这次战役之后，Booker一直为当日的所作所为感到后悔。战役结束后，Booker带着内疚去参加一个小河中进行的洗礼，希望能够以新的身份重新开始生活。但是，在最后时刻，Booker拒绝了洗礼，认为自己的罪孽无法靠“浸在水里”消除。与此同时，另一个位面的Booker接受了洗礼，成为Comstock。\n\n　　1892年1月，Booker成为 Pinkerton's National Detective Agency的一名侦探，由于在处理工人运动时利用极端的暴力手段而背负“盛名”。在为Pinkerton工作期间，他遇到一个女人，并很快的搞大了人家的肚子。结果该女子在生Anna时难产死了。这场悲剧结合Booker因平时滥用暴力的行为而被工作机构开除，Booker走向了自我堕落，沉迷于酗酒和赌博。\n\n　　1893年，Booker成为了私人侦探，但债务高筑。在1893年10月, Robert Lutece 走进Booker的办公室，代表Comstock神父给了他一个用女儿Anna抵消所有债务的条件。出于绝望，Booker将女儿交给了Lutece和Comstock。Booker在Anna即将被Comstock带入传送门的最后一刻反悔，在与Comstock争抢Anna时，由于传送门的关闭，Anna在Booker的位面留下了一截被时空切断的手指，因为Anna获得了穿梭位面的能力。\n\n　　Booker陷入更大的绝望，之后在自己的右手上烙印了AD两个字符来即纪念自己的女儿Anna DeWitt。20年之后，1912年，Lutece兄妹再次出现，开启了一个位面让Booker进入解救自己的女儿。进入位面时，Booker由于空间转换效应（由Lutece提出）失去了记忆同时捏造出了新的记忆。他将20年前卖女儿抵债的记忆和现在的解救女儿任务搞混，认为自己应该找到一个叫Elizabeth，并将她带去纽约，然后抵消自己的债务。\n\n　　之后便是无限中发生的剧情，找到Elizabeth，E被SONGBIRD抓走，另一个位面被洗脑成功因为过度使用空间装置而加快衰老的Elizabeth将Booker召唤过去，让他将一个控制SONGBIRD的密码交给刚被抓走的E，之后E在得到密码后开启了全部的空间力量。在女神之塔被SONGBIRD摧毁后，SONGBIRD失控，试图攻击E和BOOKER，被E传送到深海中被水压挤死。\n\n　　开启全部力量的E带领BOOKER走过灯塔的每一个门，BOOKER的记忆也慢慢回归，记起了自己当初卖掉女儿以及在争抢女儿时，Anna被切断小拇指的经过。他也想起来，E就是Anna，是自己的女儿。BOOKER被E带回当初接受洗礼的地方，BOOKER同样在最后时刻拒绝了洗礼，同时告诉E一切都结束了，COMSTOCK已经死了，他们可以一起去巴黎。E回答，comstock没有死，还活在千千万万的世界里。愤怒的BOOKER表示E所受的一切苦难都是COMSTOCK造成的，要将COMSTOCK淹死在摇篮里。E问BOOKER，是否真的决定要这么做，BOOKER给与了肯定的回答。\n\n　　最终E将BOOKER带到“摇篮中的comstock”位面，BOOKER发现，是自己在小河中接受洗礼前的场景，他终于明白，自己在接受与不接受洗礼时产生了两个位面，只要这个做出决定前的BOOKER还活着，不接受洗礼的BOOKER和接受洗礼的COMSTOCK就会一直在不同的位面出现，E也会一直受苦。最终，BOOKER让所有位面的E将自己淹死在小河里。其他位面的E，由于BOOKER和COMSTOCK都不存在所以一个接一个的消失了，只有当前位面的E还存在着。\n\n　　BOOKER在1893年10月8日，失去女儿的同一天醒来，他打开了ANNA的房门，见到ANNA的婴儿车还在屋内","timestamp_created":1581422489,"timestamp_updated":1581422489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":448,"votes_funny":21,"weighted_vote_score":"0.961727261543273926","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63331482","author":{"steamid":"76561198806666399","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2069,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1025,"last_played":1658799632},"language":"latam","review":"Muy

this very quickly, and forgot to review it.. may as well amend that..\nBioshock infinite is all the bad things from the previous bioshock games mixed with all the good things from games they tried to copy (and failed at). It's a literal railtrack shooter insofar as you spend most of the game moving on rails and shooting things; honestly the dumbest concept i've seen in an FPS. The rest of the gameplay consists of picking up ridiculously overpowered abilities, then systematically blundering and blasting your way through hordes of mindless idiots that never so much as dive for cover.\nThe story is, for want of a better word, dumb. Not in an enjoyable, self-deprecating way or in an over the top slapstick way, but in a heinously cringey bible-bashing way. The game gives you 'moral choices' that are almost always binary and don't actually change the game in any meaningful way, and the characters are so two-dimensional that you'll wish you could just perma-die off one of those rails just to get away from how annoying they are.\nThe graphics are very pretty, but the game isn't as stable as previous incarnations and stutters in the oddest places even if you do have a rig that outmatches its preferred specs, but overall no complaints. the level design sucks; lots of closed environments that give the illusion of an open environment and rails...omg..so many rails..so lame..\nThe soundscape is pretty decent, and the voice acting, all things considered, is pretty good; i feel sorry for the actors though..

Be very careful before you decide to purchase this game.\n\nI’m basing my “Like” recommendation mainly on the gameplay and the colorful and interesting world.  I’ve always felt that gameplay was the most important detail to a video game.  Your story doesn’t have to make sense if your game is still fun to play.  That’s the only reason Bioshock Infinite (hereon referred to as BI) passes.\n\nSo lets start with helping you make a choice on whether or not you want to buy this game.\n\nIf you’re a former player of Bioshock 1 & 2, you should know that the base game of BI only barely belongs in the Bioshock family.  The reason it fits is more or less 3 minor details.   Then the Burial At Sea DLC’s tries to conveniently join Bioshock 1 to BI in ways that I don’t really find satisfactory, but it’s hard to be clear about these things without spoilers.\n\nIf story means a great deal to you, then you might have some problems with this one. \n\nA lot of proponents for this game’s story want you to believe it’s really in depth and you have to have a certain intellect to understand it.\n\nI played through the entire game, I played through the 2 story DLCs, I read the wikis and then I went through and read a good number of online message boards, youtube videos, and reviews before posting this, and my doctor says I’m smart enough to figure it out.\n\nIt’s not entirely as full of itself as a David Lynch film, but it comes pretty close.   The ideas that the game presents makes sense in terms of the lore the game has given and in terms of the timelines, but a lot of it doesn't make a whole bunch of sense in terms of reality.  In other words, just because they explain something, doesn’t mean their explanation is good, or even satisfying.  In addition, a lot of the story is left out, mainly the reasons for the character’s motivations.   It also introduces themes like racism and religion, but then abandons them and leaves them unanswered.\n\nOne of the main characters, “Elizabeth” is a mary sue, who conveniently makes everything work.  The previous games had surprises in them, but BI tries to act smarter than everyone else in the room.   Even the PC.  Your character, “Booker” isn’t smart enough to pick up what’s going on, despite certain things that should be blatantly obvious.  Levine (the creator) uses Booker’s stupidity to fill in a bunch of exposition.\n\nThe game is extremely cinematic, with long stretches where you can’t do anything but walk along and fill in the story.    If your character gets in an elevator, you’re guaranteed to get a conversation filled with more exposition.   \n\nAnother point that really frustrated me is that there are audio tapes called voxphones littered about the world to give exposition just like the first two games, but while they help YOU figure out what’s going on, the PC and his companion Elizabeth are oblivious to these messages and plod along with their fixed story regardless of whether or not their questions were answered.  The bottom line is, I’m not impressed with any of the stories from BI, the base game, or the DLC’s.\n\nThe visuals and sound are hit or miss.  The towns, creatures, and settings are the most impressive part of this game.   But other parts are less impressive.  Many of the “civilian” NPC’s are terrible looking, particularly the children.  I felt like they improved that in the DLC.   \n\nThe sound is about as good as any other game, but the mechanics of the sound are off.  What I mean is, with stereo headphones on, sound seemed to travel through walls and solid objects in ways they shouldn’t.  In addition, there are many conflicts… start listening to an audio tape (in game) and then have it get cut off for a cinematic.   Have your PC start talking, cutting off your audio tape.  I very often would wait until I was certain nothing was going to happen before listening to the voxphones because the minute I picked one up, the PC would have a conversation.\n\nI personally found the gameplay very good, but the pacing between story and actually doing something was rough.  If you find yourself exploring and engaging in the world without fighting then there’s a good chance either there’s some enemies waiting for you, or you’re about to engage in a cinematic again.  It’s fairly predictable in that respect, and the abrupt changes back and forth weren’t really something I enjoyed all that much.\n\nYou should also be aware that the vast majority of the game is an escort mission.   It feels a bit unnecessary for Elizabeth to tag along with you, but they gave her some peripheral reasons for being with you.  In the base game she pretty much stays out of your way and can be helpful.\n\nThe FPS action again I found really satisfying, but I also could see a lot of people not enjoying it.  To be plain, it’s pretty easy to get through each area and the plasmids that make a return from previous games would be nearly unnecessary if ammunition wasn’t an issue.   In the DLC’s in particular, the amount of ammo you carry is frustratingly low, with only 1 or 2 guns having an option to upgrade.  There are a number of plasmids I never used at all except to see what they did.   Some of them I couldn’t even figure out and didn’t bother.  A brief cinematic (again) shows up when you pick them up explaining what they’re [u]supposed[/u] to do, but that doesn’t make their mechanics easy to figure out.\n\nI’m also going to point out that Burial at Sea Episode 2 changes the gameplay entirely to an Arkham City clone, complete with Detective Mode, minus the hit combos.\n\nIf you’re wondering should I buy the DLC’s, well… I understand Clash of Clouds is some kind of Arena battle, so even though I got the season pass, I didn’t bother with it.   \n\nColumbia’s Finest gives you some extra gear and money to start out with.  The gear was really good, and I rarely swapped it out for something else as the game went on.\n\nBurial at Sea 1 & 2 work very hard to tie BI to Bioshock 1.  It also retcons a certain set of events from BI for reasons that are unclear.  It feels more like fan service than a compelling story to me.   The game mechanics don’t work nearly as well in the DLC’s.  Elizabeth often blocks your way, there’s an airlock that won’t open if you come back to it a second time, and the skyrails seem a lot more unforgiving than the base game.   It's still worth buying if you get the game on sale.   It's not a bad amount of content for the money and at least you can see where Levine went with the story.\n\nAll-in-all, if I had to evaluate my purchase, I am ok with it.   I found the story increasingly frustrating as it went on, but the gameplay was interesting and I still wanted to know just where they were going to go with the story.\n\nBut this game is not for everyone.
