best way I can describe this game is tight and tidy. It has everything it needs, and nothing it doesn't. It respects your time and isn't bloated. It is a great addition to a compelling world created in the other Bioshock games, adding its own touch to the series. The story is very good, although I didn't find it as compelling as the first (granted that's a difficult achievement especially for a follow-up), and I saw a few major plot twists coming a mile away.\n\nI'll say it again because I think it bears repeating; the best part of this game to me is they respect your time and crafted an intentional experience. It does all the FPS things right, but even if you aren't great at FPS and just want to experience the game, the difficult settings allow it. Like a good book, I couldn't wait to load my save and see what came next -- there was always something new and fresh around the corner, without feeling like I was stuck in a gameplay loop waiting for some kind of reward. All-in-all, a very well-done game.","timestamp_created":1608836853,"timestamp_updated":1608836889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83059605","author":{"steamid":"76561198152983523","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":11,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11,"last_played":1596486005},"language":"turkish","review":"Abartıldığı

Ele traz tudo que já havia de bom dos outros games de uma forma ainda mais bela.\nA direção de arte é apaixonante, e te faz parar a cada minuto apenas para ficar observando a riqueza de detalhes de cada canto de Columbia. [u]O jogo tem vida para dar e vender![/u]\nA trilha sonora não fica para trás em momento algum. A musica [b]\"The circle is unbroken\"[/b] e o tema dos [b]Lutece[/b] são as que mais marcaram.\nA jogabilidade é parecida com a dos antigos Bioshock's, porém um pouco melhorada e mais dinâmica. Se você jogou os outros não terá dificuldade alguma para se acostumar.\nQuanto as história... ah, a história...  em minha humilde opinião é a melhor das três. Além de marcante tem ótimos personagens. Senti falta das lutas com os Big Daddy's, mas os Handymans e a lindíssima Elizabeth dão conta de tapar esse buraco.\nE para quem adquirir as DLC's terá a incrível oportunidade de ver todos os enredos se conectando. É lindo!  \n\n","timestamp_created":1608698405,"timestamp_updated":1608698405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82930115","author":{"steamid":"76561198868339532","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":595,"last_played":1603721649},"language":"koreana","review":"최고의 게임\n몰입감있는 배경과 영화같은 스토리\n아름다운 음악까지 완벽했지만....\n전투중 스토리가 나와 집중하기 힘든면도..\n그러나 감안할만큼 아름다운 게임이었다.","timestamp_created":1608698225,"timestamp_updated":1608698225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"82927679","author":{"steamid":"76561198155124746","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":669,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":669,"last_played":1460266048},"language":"english","review":"LOVE this game!
