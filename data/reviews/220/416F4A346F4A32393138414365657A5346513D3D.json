Also not to mention...gwaphics...gwaphics...GWAPHICS!!!!!!! This game had amazing graphics for its time. And it ran really well on my crappy computer. But it did crash alot. This game picks up after Half life 1 in a completely different area. Also some of you might not know this but this game takes place in Russia! Because it has russian letters. (my brother told me because he played Metro Last Light :P) In a city where the cops abuse their power and the mayor doesn't care. Also there are aliens everywhere. Now this game was a pretty long game. It was about 10-15 hours. It also has amazing puzzles. However there is a pretty stupid lighting glitch but it's fixable. If you are a fan of aliens then you might want to give this game a try. final verdict...10/10 ONE OF THE BEST SHOOTERS OF ALL TIME MAYBE THE BEST!","timestamp_created":1379793993,"timestamp_updated":1379793993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6696747","author":{"steamid":"76561198072667156","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1379,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":829,"last_played":1396373798},"language":"english","review":"You need to have played this in your lifetime","timestamp_created":1379780568,"timestamp_updated":1379780568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6662891","author":{"steamid":"76561198071778341","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":1890,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1127,"last_played":1404497920},"language":"english","review":"A game with a good storyline, clever puzzles, a diverse ammount of enemies and locations, and let's not forget to mention the ammount of mods for HL2.

Поэтому \"Valve\", как кровь из носу, нужен был новый \"мотор\" на котором они будут делать игры. Сначала они выпустили \"CS: Source\" - это был ремейк \"CS 1.6\", чисто коммерческий проект, клонирование той же \"контры\", а главная цель в том, что именно \"CS: Source\" являлся открытым бета-тестом нового движка. Он был достаточно глючный практически во всем, но его стали активно дорабатывать и исправлять. Все-таки \"Valve\" понимали, что выпускать вторую часть \"Half-Life\" нужно не сырой, чтобы не ударить в грязь лицом перед всеми. Ставки были очень высоки и компания заложила в движок игры и саму \"Half-Life 2\" огромные по тем временам деньги. Но одним из самых правильных шагов во время разработки игры был запуск интернет-магазина \"Steam\" в котором \"Valve\" собиралась продавать свои игры. Время прошло и оно доказало, что все инновации были успешны.\n\nКогда \"Half-Life 2\" вышла, то сразу же стала хитом по всему миру. Пожалуй, не оставлось игроманов, которые не играли в эту игру. Игровые журналы и издания назвали новую \"Халфу\" идеальной игрой, оценки были самые высокие. И не было тех кто упрекнул бы её, она была не только популярна, но и замечательно сделана. Все отмечали отличную графику, сюжет и само прохождение, а так же геймплей. Конечно, с годами хиты стареют в техническом плане и сейчас вторая \"Халфа\" кажется достаточно коридорной, где все завязано исключительно на скриптах, а графика достаточно простой. Однако, каждую игру нужно судить по своему времени и по своему игровому поколению возможностей. В свой год выхода \"Half-Life 2\" была игрой года, это объективно.\n\nСердце этой игры ещё живет и работает, стучит и бьется, она никогда не сможет умереть. И сейчас она выглядывает из \"Steam'a\" как брошенный плюшевый медведь, которого мы убрали куда-то далеко, но все рано или поздно достают свои старые игрушки, чтобы вспомнить былые времена. Мы можем похоронить все что угодно, но мы не способны похоронить свою память об играх, которые мы проходили с огромным интересом.","timestamp_created":1378068794,"timestamp_updated":1378068794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":62,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.872507691383361816","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6161525","author":{"steamid":"76561198060317193","num_games_owned":400,"num_reviews":224,"playtime_forever":939,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":376,"last_played":1379454434},"language":"english","review":"Será que precisaria de alguma recomendação para este CLÁSSICO!?
