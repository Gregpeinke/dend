It quickly became my 2nd favorite game due to the difficulty of knocking Super Metroid out of that #1 spot.  Some time later HL2 was released and I started looking at building my first computer.  I went watercooled on AMD's first dual core proc (back when they were rock stars) and bought my first of many Nvidia GPUs (7800gtx).  HL2 quickly beat the first one out of that #2 spot.  HL2 originally came with and started Steam.  Everyone thought Steam was pointless bloatware and here we are now, loving Steam and in most cases hating Uplay and Origin.\n\nHere I am about 10 years later and HL2 is still a monument in PC gaming and I love it dearly.\n\nPros\n-The main character is a mute that happily follows directions and jumps in harm's way to kill people/things and save the day.  Being mute is a HUGE bonus because you simply cannot dislike him.\n-The gunplay is tight and speedy.\n-Platforming and puzzles aren't as common as it was in the 1st.\n-You get a gravity gun!\n-You get to summon large bugs to kill for you!\n\nCons\n-Ravenholm.\n-No ability to aim down sights.\n\nI really wanted to have more cons but I can't think of any.

Often hailed as THE best game of all time, how does it hold up 11 years later? Lets find out\n\nPros: well, the game looks really nice. It shows its age almost always, but it also somehow doesn't. You look at it and conciously think it looks old but it also looks odly good. The story is WELL above average as you'd expect, and you don't really need to play the first one to understand this game (although you should, it helps you feel a LOT more invested in the story, which can be hard if you play this first). There is also GREAT variation, in both location and in gameplay. Ravenholm is basically a physics sandbox, allowing you to use the gravity gun (a gun that alows you to manipulate objects without touching them) to its full potential, while the next section is in a car. This helps make the game not feel repetitive and makes playing in long sessions posible, if not completly unavoidable. You start in a city, then go to a river, then to a buring city, then to the open roads, and then to a prison. The settings change almost always, and keep the game feeling always fresh. \n\nCons: the car and boat sections go on too long and they don't control very well. They aren't bad by ANY means, but really should have been cut down or had their controls tweeked. The shooting is good, but not impressive. It's perfectly fine, but from a game with this reputation you'd expect more. Most importatly, (simi-spoiler) when you're back in the city again and command a squad of soldiers, YOUR TROOPS ARE IDIOTIC! They are almost useless in battle and get in the way 90% of the time. Also, the enemies always seem to have an advantage, they may suprise you, have cover, or have the high ground. I'm sure this was done to make you feel like the odds aren't in your favor, but it ends up just being annoying. \n\nIn short, this is an AWESOME game, but also one that doesn't deserve the hype it gets. The first game was revolutunary in the way it told it's story, but this game didn't really have anything like that. Still, it's amazingly fun and any FPS fan MUST play it at least once in their lifetime!","timestamp_created":1433999514,"timestamp_updated":1433999514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16297226","author":{"steamid":"76561198098378520","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1556,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1157,"last_played":1501211926},"language":"brazilian","review":"Clássico!\nEsse jogo é bom em qualquer época!

Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).\n\n2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.\n\n3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.\n\n4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.\n\n5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.\n\n6) Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Serve warm if desired.","timestamp_created":1433904175,"timestamp_updated":1448072421,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":12,"weighted_vote_score":"0.465241342782974243","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16284765","author":{"steamid":"76561198099969030","num_games_owned":232,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":5497,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4944,"last_played":1596760289},"language":"english","review":"This is a great and wonderful game.

I mean, the scenary you get can look flatout amazing for a post-apocalypse Earth dominated by a ruthless alien force. Gameplay still rocks and the ragdoll physics still gets you some hilarious results.\n\nHell the airboat trip to Black Mesa East still goes on for ages yet I still love playing through it because of all the wacky sights you see and the adventures Gordon Freeman has along the way. And Alyx Vance is still a well written character and Dr. Breen is still a nicely written villain.
