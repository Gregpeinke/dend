Its a game I keep finding myself going back to every few months.  Go through waves of 'Zeds', killing them all as a team (Or dying if everyone tries to be rambo on their own), fight a big boss at the end.\n\nThe graphics aren't great, there is only one game mode (Though different wave lengths/difficulties), yet its just so addicting.  Its likely down to how satisfying it is to kill the Zeds, body parts coming off, brains splattered.  There is also a wide variety of ways in which to take them down, shotguns, rifles, flamethrowers, theres plenty here! \n\nOne of my favourite games and its the one I've put more hours into than any other! Its repetitive sure, but its the sort of game you keep going back to months, years after you bought it rather than the type of game you play for a few hours and then never touch again.","timestamp_created":1419277280,"timestamp_updated":1419277280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13529518","author":{"steamid":"76561198099295765","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":98,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":64,"last_played":1420239658},"language":"english","review":"Fun Co-Op game!

Crazy experiments are on the loose. Whole cities are abandoned (or all inhabitants are exterminated, but hey, no one had time to inform you about that!). No one knows where you are, but as a cold comfort: most people don't even care whether or not you survive, so even if they could, they wouldn't help you. You and your squad are on your own, surrounded by experiments and weird humanoid-looking-ish fusions that are basically your worst nightmare, and theyre out there to eat you. Exterminate them all or they will have you grilled medium rare for dinner.\nAND AS IF THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH YET, once you destroyed enough experiments, the creator and 'father' of them will appear, and he wont be happy! But who could blame him? You'd be mad too if a random squad of 6 weirdos would come and kill hundreds and hundreds of your children!\nThis is the premise of Killing Floor, a first person shooter that brings you to a (maybe not so original, but who cares, as long as you can shoot things) scenario in which you're the last men standing against monstrous opponents. With a good variety of enemies and five difficulty levels, this game is gamer-friendly for the newbiest of newbies and challenging for the experienced exterminator, whereas every different enemy will require a different strategy to get rid of when you play on the highest difficulty level. You will level up your classes on the go to match your characters abilities with the level you'll be playing on. With the 7 different playable classes (or Perks) you can play your preferred role in a team, so you'll have your favourite way of destroying evil: Fightin' (or kitin') like a MAN? play Berzerker. Steady aim, ready to take out the big threats? play Sharpshooter. Do you like to watch the world burn? play Firebug. Like gibs flyin' around and explosions? play Demolitions. Assault rifles 'n kalashnikovs 'n stuff? play Commando. Wanna be that guy that carries a million different (and heavy) guns? play Supports specialist. Do you love ze healing, not ze hurting? play Field medic!\n\nThis all comes with a sh*tload of different maps in completely different settings (woods, buildings, cities, north pole, on a ship, on the moon, EVERYWHERE), able to keep your interest for quite a while. Also contains objective modes to keep the diversity in the game.\n\nSTILL haven't had enough? There's an incredible amount of custom content with EVEN MORE perks to level up to even greater heights, additional objective modes with a wide range of different goals to achieve.\n\nTo top this off, your squad consists of whiny, cocky british people with a strong accent, so insults, directions and calls for help will sound hilarious! Despite many negative remarks on the 'crappy' voice acting, I actually think the lack of seriousness these squad members show with their snarky voice commands adds nicely to the game's attractiveness.\n\nPros:\n- A million different guns\n- Dont like guns? It has explosives too\n- AND fire\n- AND melee weapons\n- Playable at all skill levels\n- A lot of variety in the maps\n- Challenging and interesting action on higher levels (especially as berzerker in my opinion)\n- Enemies with chainsaws\n- A boss with a machine gun for an arm\n- ^I forgot to mention his OTHER arm is a FRIGGIN' ROCKET LAUNCHER\n- Has nice skin overrides with christmas, halloween and in the summer.\n- \"Help me or I'll be pushin' up the bloody daisies!\"\n\nCons\n- By far not the best graphics (Don't get me wrong, they're not terrible!)\n- Camping to survive waves on high difficulty can get stale easily (but there's kiting to make up for that)\n- Not the most serious and realistic shooter (I personally don't mind, but I know many will see this as a downside)\n\n\"YOU MURDERED MY CHILDREN\": prepare to fight, stock up on the biggest, baddest guns and bombs and sht and take the challenge! A great gore-spattered shooter that will be guaranteed entertainment for a long time!\n\nRating: 9/10","timestamp_created":1419211087,"timestamp_updated":1419211339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57938992977142334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13511807","author":{"steamid":"76561198045804523","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":825,"last_played":1484100254},"language":"english","review":"Metal as hell.
