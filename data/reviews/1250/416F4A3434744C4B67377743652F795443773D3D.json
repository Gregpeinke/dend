Imagine um L4D, só que com muitos, muitos mais zumbis e com os especiais aparecendo mais vezes. Killing Floor tem ambientes sombrios e macabros, você ganha dinheiro (matando os mutantes) para comprar armas na Trader, tem classes e cada uma delas tem armas especiais. O jogo é de ondas que quanto mais tempo você sobrevive, mais dificil fica. Na última onda tem uma surpresa... não muito agradável.

All of the classes are awesome and when you earn xp on one server it transfers to another so you can move from one difficulty to another very easily.

But if you liked doing something other than mindlessly facing against 10 waves of experiments and creatures trying to dismember you, then you might want to bring some friends. This game is heavily dependant upon how much you enjoy cooperating with your team (unless you're a bad@$$ that can run around during a zombie apocalypse and avoid the nasties and still remain at the top of the kill board). Fun game, but can get stale without friends.","timestamp_created":1358294593,"timestamp_updated":1404125023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6779890","author":{"steamid":"76561198074968007","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":9550,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7152,"last_played":1577656899},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo super legal recomedo ;D","timestamp_created":1358273404,"timestamp_updated":1358273404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6428968","author":{"steamid":"76561198066106807","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":82843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54913,"last_played":1557602311},"language":"english","review":"ы","timestamp_created":1358272881,"timestamp_updated":1358272881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502133727073669434","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2837813","author":{"steamid":"76561198013372317","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":95038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":72983,"last_played":1646248743},"language":"english","review":"Я был готов к драке, хотя и не успел снять костюм цыпленка... а сейчас вообще отказался от этой мысли.

That is unless someone makes it so you can shoot something not real, or the weapon you have is just crazy, that is why I recommend Killing Floor.\n\nThis first person shooter horror survival is very enjoyable, play solo or with your friends there is plenty to look forward to and a number of weapons to try out, and not to mention if you think the game is too easy you can increase the difficulty, and trust me you will lose many times if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nThe game feel is frightening by yourself,  and you get a sense of what it would be like if a huge wave of monsters was coming for you, and even with friends the tension you feel is still there, just make sure you have a good team unless your all done for.\n\nThere are a good number of maps and monster to empty your clips on, ranging from downtown London to a hillbilly bayou, you'll have plenty to keep you busy. And if that's not enough for you, there are 7 perks you can level up to make yourself and your team even stronger. At the beginning I thought to myself \"I'll level these guys up in no time at all\" how wrong I was, level each perk will take a long time to reach the highest rank of perk. I grained the medic class only for 3 months and I achieved highest rank. and that the easy one! Aside from medic, there is Sharpshooter, firebug, demo, berserker, support and commando with their own unique weapons to use and own unique abilities to help you out.\n\nThis game its worth buying and I highly recommend it, hours of fun and you'll defiantly not complete it within a week.

Not only does the game have a very addicted and fun gameplay. But the classes in the game that you can level increase the amount of hours you can pour into the game. \n\nHow it works:\nKilling floor works in such a way that you will have a team of different classes. All classes fills a purpose and a good team setup is needed to counter certain difficulties and maps. A base setup on higher difficulties are 1 medic(for obvious reasons), 1 berserker(that can tank damage and stay on the frontline), 1-2 support specialists(To wield doors fast and use shotguns piercing to kill several enemies, 1 sharpshooter(to take care of the tough enemies) and the other classes can be added depending on what the team need.\n\nWhen the team have a good setup they will later face waves of enemies. These waves will continuesly grow stronger and after the last level you will face a boss. Remember that no class are effective against all enemies and will struggle when facing several 'wrong' enemies at once. The difficulty dictates how hard the enemies you face are. Having an increased difficulty does not only make the enemies harder to kill but also faster and they deal more damage. \n\nWhat makes this different from any other zombie game:\n\nIts a very free and open game that lets the players decide how they are going to counter waves. The team can be roaming or defensive. But the core gameplay in the game is often to barricade and defend(as roaming usually results in you getting ambushed). Because of the classes there are a huge variety in players as they all specialize in different things. There also exist a huge amount of weapons that each class can use, and certain weapons grant different subplaystyles for classes.\n\nOverall its a great game and one of(if not) the best LAN games you can play.\nThe only bad thing with this game is that the network coding can be a trouble sometimes when healing allies. \n9/10","timestamp_created":1357411267,"timestamp_updated":1357411267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5881254","author":{"steamid":"76561198055798745","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1375973165},"language":"english","review":"Killing Floor to modyfikacja Unreal Tournament 2004.Która działa na silniku Unreal Engine 2.5.Akcja gry osadzona jest w Wielkiej Brytanii gdzie w skutek niudanego eksperymentu z klonowaniem ludzi ludzie zaczeli zamieniać się w mutanty.W grze wcielamy się w żołnierzy i antyterrorystów,którzy walczą o przetrwanie.Do gry zostało wydane dużo dlc w którym są dodatkowe bronie i postacie.Postacie są ciekawymi gośćmi różnych stylów np steampunkowców :P oraz również mrocznych gości,\nspecjalnych wojsk i dobrze uzbrojonych przetrwańców.Uzbrojenia w grze jest nawet sporo od broni białej aż do granatników i innych gadżetów które urozmaicają rozgrywkę i robią niezłą rzeź.Są nawet eventy w których mutanty zamieniają się w zombie lub elfów i innych dziwadeł, można dostać specjalne osiągniecia eventowe np: za zabicie św.

It doesn't take much time to learn to play it, but you can always tell an experienced player from a rookie, because it actually takes some skill and creativity, plus it has a variety of difficulties to suit any player, from casual gamer to hardcore FPS fan. Can be fun both with full team of friends and with only one friend, or even solo - and yes, even the hardest difficulty is doable solo, so don't be discouraged if you don't have 5 friends to play with and don't want to play with random people.","timestamp_created":1357401817,"timestamp_updated":1357401817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5680987","author":{"steamid":"76561198054014873","num_games_owned":471,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1115,"last_played":1431136058},"language":"english","review":"Dosh.
