Nine distinct classes, each with at least one role the others can't fulfill, and a signature style that brings humor to a 20th century-esque battlefield, a place where humor was simply not there. A wide variety of weapons, hats, other cosmetics, and game modes make for a new experience every time you play. Casual lets you enter a matching system that ensures you never really play the same match twice, Competitive takes it one-step further, putting you in a competitive environment, and consists of a rating system based quite heavily on performance. Mann vs. Machine is a co-op mode where you team up with other players to take down hordes of robots, with epic rewards. Community Servers let you mess around on servers hosted by the ever-loyal community, and you can even bookmark ones you like. Finally, there's Training Mode, which lets little beginners figure out what you're supposed to do, and shows FPS veterans how un-CoD-ly this game is. Not only that, but ther's also a secure, but friendly trading economy to do business with other players (there are websites and Community Servers dedicated to this). Sure, the last year of updates have been a little controversial, but the years of content before that are still here for your enjoyment.

It was my first valve game, my first steam game, and also my first real computer game. I played just about every day. I went from not understanding a thing, to thinking pyro was the strongest, until hearing wm1 is trash and then figuring out that rocket jumping was a thing. I discovered the community servers button and spent time playing wacky game modes. Jailbreak, ballon races, slenderman, deathrun, and a lot more. I found out about a map called turbine and found a server close by that ran it 24/7. I played on that server almost every day until the day it closed. I met so many people that I talked to all the time and played some tf2 with. Some of them I still call my closest friends today. I listened to numerous sob stories of several veteran players, about how \"it was better when I first started playing\", yet they were still playing. I would even try out trading for profit. That would lead me to the unusual I still treasure to this day. I even tried my hand at non-valve competitive. There I found out the true divide between casual and comp players. I decided I would try to take it more seriously. I led a team that only won one game. (The one game that I wasn't in) I played pugs, watched streams, watched matches, practiced my movement, grinded mge, and just played n played. \n\nI remember the gun mettle update. \"The last good one.\" I remember the tough break update. All the hysteria with balance changes. I remember the meet your match update, and how that \"killed tf2.\" And finally, I remember the jungle inferno update and how it was a step in the right direction but ultimately underwhelming. \n\nBut eventually it got to me. There comes a point where you don't put up with the crap any more. Enough was enough. I was put off by tf2 because of how much it was neglected. The lack of valve's communication, their shameful approach to their comp system, how they view community competitive tf2, and eventually my loss of interest.\n\nTf2 would go on to leave a sour after taste in my mouth. I liked playing it, but every time I finished playing it would spiral me further and further down into a pit of desperation. I wanted so badly for others to love tf2 as much as I did, but not even the company responsible for making this game would. \n\nOverall its a good game folks.\n\"Its like cancer attached to your bones\"~Squiggy","timestamp_created":1485650877,"timestamp_updated":1530416971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531914889812469482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29553553","author":{"steamid":"76561198269450847","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":53279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7959,"last_played":1524374913},"language":"english","review":"Best Game Ever!!","timestamp_created":1485650636,"timestamp_updated":1485650636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29553536","author":{"steamid":"76561198021858645","num_games_owned":144,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5255,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5255,"last_played":1483981490},"language":"german","review":"Gutes spiel , macht Spaß.

Come \"[i]beginner[/i]\" non è facile ambientarsi, ma dopo qualche mese si impara come usare le classi e sfruttare le abilità di ognuna di loro. \nLe 9 classi (dalle personalità interessanti e carismatiche) infatti permettono a ognuno di giocare secondo lo stile che preferisce. ([i]Ad esempio, se si preferisce un approccio più aggressivo si sceglie una classe piuttosto che un'altra.[/i])\n\nLe mappe sono abbastanza da rendere ogni partita diversa dalla precedente. Per quanto riguarda le armi...Beh, ce ne sono moltissime con vantaggi e svantaggi unici.\n\nLa [i]personalizzazione[/i] dei personaggi è possibile quasi unicamente grazie allo shop dal quale comprare oggetti estetici che sono puramente decorativi, cioè [u] non danno vantaggi[/u].\nDa sottolineare che il gioco non è assolutamente [b]Pay2Win[/b] perchè tutte le armi si trovano giocando, anche se avere un account premium garantisce dei vantaggi in termini di \"Slot di inventario\".\n\n[h1]TF2 Oggi[/h1]\nDevo dire, a malincuore, che dopo più di 2000 ore di gioco, TF2 mi ha abbastanza deluso.\n\nCiò che più mi ha spinto ad abbandonare (o quasi) il gioco sono gli update... incentrati sempre sull' aggiunta di nuovi cappelli, vestiti e [b]A VOLTE[/b] qualche mappa. Davvero raramente vengono introdotte nuove armi.\n\nSe volessimo chiudere un occhio sugli aggiornamenti, non lo si può fare per quanto riguarda il sistema anti-cheat.\nDalla mia esperienza di gioco posso dire che qualche anno fa, su 100 partite, solo in 1 o 2 c'era il solito cecchino con l'aimbot. Recentemente invece si trovano cheater molto più spesso; questo problema è aggravato inoltre dall'impossibilità di bannare i cheater dal server.\n\nInfine, nell'estate del 2016, TF2 ha ricevuto \"il colpo di grazia\"; mi riferisco al discusso \"[i]Meet your Match Update[/i]\" che ha rimosso il semplice e veloce sistema di matchmaking del \"vecchio\" TF2 sostituendolo con uno lento e macchinoso. Il nuovo sistema di matchmaking è stato tuttavia notevolmente migliorato con i successivi update.\n\n[h1]Perchè lo consiglio allora, dopo tutte le critiche che gli ho fatto?[/h1]\nPerchè, per quanto sia peggiorato, resta uno dei titoli più validi di Steam e giocato con gli amici garantisce ore di risate e divertimento al modico prezzo di... € 0.00.","timestamp_created":1485643055,"timestamp_updated":1542909834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.738474726676940918","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29551670","author":{"steamid":"76561198001072096","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":297,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":118,"last_played":1533759299},"language":"english","review":"amzing","timestamp_created":1485642733,"timestamp_updated":1485642733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29551627","author":{"steamid":"76561198287616897","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6400,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2784,"last_played":1575745231},"language":"english","review":"I HIGHLY reccomend this game.
