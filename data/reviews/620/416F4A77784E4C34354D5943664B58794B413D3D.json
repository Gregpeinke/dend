But I've probably got about 2,000 hours at least in this game. I've played it through a few times, played tons of community made maps and mods. This games is absolutely killer. You wont regret it. If you enjoy putting your mind to work, amazing physics, and good graphics. Then get it. Portal 2 has more replay value than any game I have ever seen. I can't recommend this game enough! The voice acting is top notch. GlaDOS is my all time favorite character/villain in a game. Wheatley is funny. The turrets are hilarious. This game has it all.
