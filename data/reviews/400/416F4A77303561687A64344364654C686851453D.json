The puzzles must be hard enough that solving them is satisfying, but not so much that you quit in frustration.  [b]Portal[/b] threads that particular needle expertly.  Sure, the first couple of puzzles really are easy, but after that you get an expertly pitched difficulty curve.  New elements are added at just the right rate, building to a highly satisfying conclusion.\n\nOf course, what made [b]Portal[/b] as famous as it is is its brilliant humour.  If you're unfamiliar with all the jokes and memes that sprang from here, then welcome, youngster, you should immediately play this game.  But even if you've heard those quotes and quips, that shouldn't put you off.  For one thing, there's so much humour packed in here, you probably won't know it all.  For another, don't you want to know the context? \n\n[b]Portal[/b] is ultimately just excellent.

You can only have two portals at the time and if you enter one portal you exit through the other portal. The main objective is to escape a set of test chambers under the supervision the AI computer GlaDOS. For that you will need to take advantage of the portal gun. It's an interesting concept and the story does not disappoint.\n\n+ Great concept\n+ Interesting puzzles\n+ Very good atmosphere\n+ Interesting story\n- Kind of short\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\n\nThis is one of those games that explains itself inside the game. There is no tutorial or introduction. This makes you want to explore the game and perhaps know more about the background story. As soon as you make your first steps you will be introduced by GlaDOS which will invite you to complete a few tests.\n\nTo solve the puzzles you will have to master the portal gun. A fully featured portal gun allows you to shoot two portals, a blue and a orange one. You can only have one each at a time. This allows, for example, to shoot a portal at a far spot and another at the near spot, making to move great distances instantaneously. You can also get to high ground or take advantage of your fall speed to jump very high. It's a very powerful tool.\n\nThe puzzles are very well designed. These never feel too easy or too hard and often leave you with satisfaction of having completion. You will have to get to though spots using the portal gun, lock buttons with cubes and avoid android with a built-in machine guns.\n\nThe story of the game itself is very intriguing, GlaDOS seems to honestly want to you to complete the puzzles but at the same time seems like you're just another test subject. The test chambers are not fully covered and often you will get to parts that shouldn't be there, making you wonder what's going on. As the game goes on both these characteristics will only intensify. For me it never felt bored.\n\nUnfortunately the game is small but after you beat the game you have advanced puzzles and challenges. The advanced puzzles are more difficult puzzles than the ones in the main game and the challenge are puzzles with limits such as time or steps. It's a nice addition.\n\nIf you like puzzle games and this sort of story this is a must have.","timestamp_created":1506113189,"timestamp_updated":1506113189,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35134094","author":{"steamid":"76561198344009850","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":451,"last_played":1515109246},"language":"english","review":"THE CAKE ISN'T A LIE!
