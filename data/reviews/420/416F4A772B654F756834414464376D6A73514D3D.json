Yet still, Half-Life as a series really is something. The story is actually rich, and it felt at least to me, even more fleshed out in episode two. The dialogue is getting better to the point where interactions are feeling more human. The graphics are getting better don't get me wrong, but for a 2007 game it still manages to set scenes and create atmospheres that give you a bit of an emotional roller coaster throughout. \n\nPlaying this now in 2022 I can say easily this is better than a lot of modern triple A games and I loved every minute of it. Although Alyx do be gettin' kinda thirsty the more the game goes on, which is pretty impressive for a guy who hasn't said a word from start to finish. Freeman you stud. But, even though her dialogue is crisp and very fitting for how her character has developed, I'd take a Vorti companion anyday. They;re infinitely more useful, deadly and are great shoulders to cry on.\n\nI can now join the church of Half-Lifers praying to Gaben every day for Half-Life 3.

I have known of its significance on the gaming industry, the impact of its cliffhanger and meaningful connection to story and characters, yet I did not know exactly what I was in store for. I have been steamrolling (lol steam pun) my way through the entire series blindly from Black Mesa to Half-Life 2, episode 1 and now here. Gordon's journey has touched me emotionally in ways I have not felt from a game in a long time. I felt, as he rightfully felt, the desparation and futility surrounding him yet none of which held him back from stepping up to do as he had to for his friends and the fate of humanity. \n\nWhen compared to Episode 1, I think I did enjoy the experience of this one a bit more. Episode 1 felt shorter somehow, while this story felt more whole. I loved Arne Magnusson, he was so hilarious and the humor was not at all unfitting alongside the other characters. His interactions with Gordon, Alyx, Eli and Kleiner were fabulous and I wish to get to know him more. My biggest complaint was not knowing the fate of Barney Calhoun since episode 1. He did not make it to White Forest ahead of me as I thought he might, and as he is one of my favorites I do worry for him. Speaking of worry, I sincerely hope Lamarr is not lost for good. \n\nBy this point in the story, so many games deep, there's no way my emotional connection to Dr. Freeman could be severed, nothing to make the pain of not knowing what happens next go away. I am now among the thousands of others lying in wait for our lord & savior, Gaben, to deliver us the finale that was promised and is needed more than ever.

Второй эпизод вышел в 2007 году и на данный момент является последней частью в серии.\n\nНачиная со второй части, игры серии Half-Life заканчивались на довольно остро-сюжетных моментах. Так случилось и в конце первого эпизода. Игра оставляла несколько не решенных событий, тем самым заставляя ждать следующий продукт Valve с нетерпением. Надо сказать, что второй эпизод не стал исключением и закончился на таком же остром, трогательном моменте. Так же сюжетно, игра постоянно держит в напряжении. А эффектное начало и трогательная концовка, заставляет по настоящему сопереживать.\n\nПо части геймплея игра во многом осталась такой же, как и предыдущие части. Перестрелки с солдатами Альянса, убийство зомби и мутантов, решение всяких простеньких задачек и езда на машине. По сравнению с тем же первым эпизодом, карты и локации стали куда больше и масштабнее. При этом появились большие, открытые локации в лесной и горной местности. Даже снова дадут покататся на машине, как это было во второй части, с багги.\n\nВ игре не появилось нового ожидаемого оружия. Разве что специальные бомбы для страйдеров, которые можно было использовать исключительно в последней схватке с ними. Да и врагов тоже новых не особо много. Среди Советника, Стража и Охотника, можно выделить лишь последнего. Который встречается не в одиночных эпизодах, а создавал проблемы на протяжении всей игры. Охотники чем то напоминают министрайдеров. Однако они более подвижны и быстры.\n\nПонравилась фишка с прикрывающей из снайперки Аликс, ещё со времён первого эпизода. И если в прошлом эпизоде, данная геймплейная фишка продолжалась не более 5 мин, где требовалось пройти одну улицу, то во втором, развитие этой идеи было на порядок выше и длилось дольше. Для этого был выделен целый, небольшой район, в котором затаившиеся зомби выходили из-за угла, в больших кол-вах и прикрытие снайпера было быолее чем уместно.\n\nХорошая игра, однако эта часть не продолжала и не развивала идеи второго Half-Life. Практически всё осталось на том же уровне. Те же враги, то же оружие. Чем игра запомнилась, так это сюжетом, динамикой происходящих событий и трогательной концовкой.\nИ вот прошло уже почти 7 лет, а ни третьей части ни третьего эпизода нет. Ждём, надеемся, верим...\n\nОценка: 8/10","timestamp_created":1649769622,"timestamp_updated":1649769622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550234079360961914","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113735255","author":{"steamid":"76561198135968664","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":89,"playtime_forever":1386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1386,"last_played":1649762516},"language":"french","review":"[i] 500 million people have died since Half Life 2 was released.\nMillions of people who will never see Half Life 3.\nHow many more people have to die, Gabe?\nHow many more millions until you do the right thing?\n [/i]\n\nDans l'ensemble, l'épisode 2 reste l'entrée populaire de la franchise qui a laissé tout le monde sur un cliffhanger massif.

Half-Life 2: Episode Two скрывает в себе сразу 3 безумно сложные ачивки:\n1) Маленький космонавт - пронести через всю игру гнома и посадить его в ракету\n2) Выкопать личинок - уничтожить 333 личинки\n3) Страж порядка - не дать страйдерам уничтожить постройки в роще.\n\nЯ прошёл игру на 100% достижений с первого прохождения и это было невозможно. Никогда в других играх я не сталкивался с настолько трудным достижением, как \"Маленький космонавт\", посмотрев на эту ачивку становится ясно, почему игроки так сильно любят серию Half-Life. Начиная с оригинальной игры и заканчивая ep 2 количество безумных достижение увеличивается в геометрической прогрессии. В оригинале самой сложной ачивкой была \"Следопыт\", где нужно было найти 45 тайников разбросанных по всей игре, в ep 1 - \"Одна пуля\", пройти игру с единым выстрелом и в ep 2 - \"Маленький космонавт\". Valve словно глумится над игроками говоря \"А пусть пройдёт игру без огнестрельного оружия! Нет-нет! Пусть тащит через всю игру гнома!\"\n\nПройдя Half-Life 2: Episode Two на 100% я чувствую удовлетворяющее блаженство. Это чувство невозможно передать, я могу лишь предложить тебе, проделать тот же путь пройдя на 100% оригинальную игру и её сиквелы.","timestamp_created":1649587291,"timestamp_updated":1649587291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113628354","author":{"steamid":"76561198295563724","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1004,"last_played":1651079929},"language":"english","review":"day in the life\n","timestamp_created":1649585935,"timestamp_updated":1649585935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113626101","author":{"steamid":"76561198865448078","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":28,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1546757352},"language":"english","review":"not worth the 56 terabytes","timestamp_created":1649582761,"timestamp_updated":1649582761,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113621048","author":{"steamid":"76561198056332041","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":726,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1649649519},"language":"english","review":"Sound defaulted to \"2 Speakers\" instead of \"Headphones\" and it nearly gave me a migrane before I figured out the issue. 10/10","timestamp_created":1649574190,"timestamp_updated":1649574190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113604666","author":{"steamid":"76561198916774217","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":358,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":358,"last_played":1649972741},"language":"polish","review":"Pieprzyć problemy techniczne.\nGabe Newell, teraz mogę to powiedzieć z taką samą powagą jak ci co czekają od początku.\nKiedy Half Life 2: Episode 3?","timestamp_created":1649545049,"timestamp_updated":1649972970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113600998","author":{"steamid":"76561199108847877","num_games_owned":19,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":532,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":531,"last_played":1654972888},"language":"polish","review":"veri col\n","timestamp_created":1649539484,"timestamp_updated":1649539484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113596803","author":{"steamid":"76561199155238840","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":605,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1643219330},"language":"english","review":"Longer than Episode One, but still short 'n' sweet.\n\n[spoiler] gotta love the unfinished story tho :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) thx valve[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1649533966,"timestamp_updated":1651614556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616101861000061035","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113580951","author":{"steamid":"76561198434100158","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":531,"last_played":1658517204},"language":"english","review":"Jalf laif tu episoud tu","timestamp_created":1649514586,"timestamp_updated":1649514586,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+eOuh4ADd7mjsQM="}
