I love Bioshock in general. My issue with this game is that I can't beat it. Not because of difficulty, but because of a known game breaking bug that will likely never be fixed. Getting in the elevator to go to The Hand of The Prophet after many hours of playing only to find that you load in what looks like out of the world, shield repeatedly breaking until you finally die and then get stuck sucks. None of the janky work arounds work. File check comes out normal. I just wanted to finally beat this game, but it looks like that's not gonna happen.","timestamp_created":1623039297,"timestamp_updated":1623039297,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93332178","author":{"steamid":"76561198976474718","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1460,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":722,"last_played":1644921044},"language":"schinese","review":"我是聪明逼","timestamp_created":1623033284,"timestamp_updated":1623033284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93332089","author":{"steamid":"76561198272658103","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1093,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":970,"last_played":1630395176},"language":"english","review":"pretty good","timestamp_created":1623033148,"timestamp_updated":1623033148,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93331239","author":{"steamid":"76561198346314566","num_games_owned":419,"num_reviews":52,"playtime_forever":4338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1236,"last_played":1642157228},"language":"english","review":"If you've played the previous Bioshock games you'll love this too, it sorta sums up all Bioshock games and connects them together","timestamp_created":1623031549,"timestamp_updated":1632695366,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541284441947937012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93330006","author":{"steamid":"76561198829979475","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":391,"last_played":1609422606},"language":"koreana","review":"내 야동","timestamp_created":1623029413,"timestamp_updated":1653820895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93329557","author":{"steamid":"76561199072899354","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":590,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":590,"last_played":1622685667},"language":"spanish","review":"JUEGAZO B)","timestamp_created":1623028664,"timestamp_updated":1623028664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93328143","author":{"steamid":"76561198126078629","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":878,"last_played":1622907785},"language":"english","review":"This is my favorite game of all time.","timestamp_created":1623026113,"timestamp_updated":1623026113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93325215","author":{"steamid":"76561198285388194","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1135,"last_played":1623020336},"language":"spanish","review":"las primeras 2 horas de juego, cuando encontre a elizabeth me un hice MONTON de pajas. este juego es una maravilla, si jugaste aunque sea al Bioshock 1 te cag4s encima en el final. no es SPOILER. pero posta que si esto sale de oferta, compralo, porque es una put4 locura. no es largo, corto, es grueso y gordo. asi como a ella le gusta. posta q recomendadisimo 10/10.","timestamp_created":1623020998,"timestamp_updated":1623067776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":26,"weighted_vote_score":"0.735449254512786865","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93324490","author":{"steamid":"76561198079763874","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":542,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":542,"last_played":1478186952},"language":"turkish","review":"Hikayesi film olsa IMDB TOP 10'a oynar.

The location is very different from anything in real life at the moment, but the society is true to the time period, and shows some harsh truths that persist to this day. It's probably not the thing to play for someone looking for a low-investment shooter because it is very intense at several points. If you don't mind an emotionally intense and story driven game with shooting, it might be a good choice. \nThe whole world is clearly very carefully crafted, and the soundtrack stands out in particular. The original music for the game sets the tone and communicates different things to the player depending on what is going on. The existing songs that are used in [i]Bioshock Infinite[/i] are significant as well. Some of the time they help fill out the setting with period appropriate music, and other times they aid in expressing a particular sentiment. \nOn the other hand, while it looks like an expansive world to explore, there is a definite limit on how much freedom the player really has, and it is ultimately a very linear game. This is not necessarily bad, as it contributes to the message and allows the developers to tell the story as they want to, but it can be frustrating as a player. \nOverall I enjoyed it, but there were definite caveats such as the restrictive nature of such a linear story.","timestamp_created":1623014434,"timestamp_updated":1623014434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93320412","author":{"steamid":"76561198060568452","num_games_owned":182,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1723,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":867,"last_played":1624046328},"language":"german","review":"For everyone who played the first two parts.. this one is different.

There are no manual saves and multiple times I lost over 10 minutes of progress which I had to repeat because I didn't have enough time to reach the next checkpoint before I had to quit the game and stop playing. Very often when I restarted the game it would spawn me in the middle of a gunfight which was very annoying.\n\nAlso the game completely broke  for me because I knocked an enemy off of the map and because this enemy was inaccessible but still alive, the game thought I was still in combat and wouldn't let me continue on to the next area. I had to restart the whole level in order to get around this.\n\nThere is another glitch in this game where there is a double-vision effect with every light source having a second, identical light appearing right next to it. This was extremely distracting and nearly ruined the game. I had to go into my Nvidia graphics card control panel and disable transparency anti-aliasing.\n\nAlso you can only carry two guns but enemies will consistently drop ammo for guns you don't have. And you can't carry health kits or \"eve hypos\" (it's not Eve in this one, it's called \"salt\") anymore so I would constantly be backtracking after every encounter in order to go pick up the health and magic I needed to restore my health and magic.\n\nAlso the Handyman is the worst enemy in the game. He's super big, does a ton of damage, has lots of health, and moves much much faster than you. He's not fun to fight, just frustrating. There's not time to read his movements because if you stop moving for a second he'll just jump on you and beat you up with his lightning fists. You only have to fight about 3 of them in the whole game though so it's not too bad. The worst one is the first handyman fight because there aren't any skyrails you can use to fly away from him, so he has the mobility advantage and it is extremely unfair.\n\nOverall I would say this is the worst game in the Bioshock series in terms of gameplay. There's even a forced stealth section where you have to fight a bunch of bullet sponge enemies whenever you get caught and none of them drop ammo and there's no ammo until you get to the end of the level. It is at least very short but still it is a very bad level. Especially since the checkpoints are so far apart and there are no manual saves.\n\nI found some of the visual effects kind of disappointing. Often times when you see a hole in reality, there's nothing different on the other side; it's just the exact same level with a black and white filter over it.\n\nThe story is fun. It's a very dumb story. There is a weird and unnecessary incestual undertone throughout the whole story though which I found kind of disturbing. My favorite character in the story was Songbird, the giant leather bird monster who shows up from time to time. He kind of reminded me of old Kaiju movies especially how he flies around destroying buildings and zeppelins. Plus I just like birds.\n\nI'm not sure who this game is for. As a fan of Bioshock, I don't really like it. As a shooter it still has a lot of gameplay issues which make it unbalanced and frustrating. I guess I like how it offers a glimpse into a world that is new and interesting, and that at least makes it worth purchasing at a deep discount. I only bought this one because it was bundled with Bioshock 1 and 2. Now that I've beaten it I am uninstalling it and I don't ever plan on playing it ever again.","timestamp_created":1622938240,"timestamp_updated":1622938645,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93260915","author":{"steamid":"76561197965656032","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1640,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1471,"last_played":1623704399},"language":"english","review":"Absolutely amazing story, one of my favourite games.","timestamp_created":1622934858,"timestamp_updated":1622934858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93260769","author":{"steamid":"76561198838224217","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":501,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":501,"last_played":1622932368},"language":"english","review":"I didnt beat the game.The game beat me.It Broke Me.\nAs It did 6 years ago.One Of the Best Stories in Gaming Ever.\nElizabeth Was/Will always have a place in my heart.\nI Thank the Devs For Making This Game.\nPLS PLAY THIS.","timestamp_created":1622934635,"timestamp_updated":1622934635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93260423","author":{"steamid":"76561197980293280","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1295,"last_played":1622931602},"language":"english","review":"This is the worst entry in the franchise. The people who made this game should be ashamed of themselves. This game had great potential with exciting idea but then you turn the game into something else. This isnt Bioshock. You are severely limited on weapons, ammo, plasmids (which they call something else), and none of you choices make a difference. Thats the second biggest problem is you have no choices. There is one ending and you dont get any say in it. For a franchise that helped pioneer player choices in game, this game is a complete let down to that legacy.\n The biggest problem is the story though by far. It barely makes senses. It borrows heavily from the other two games to build its world and then decide that the other games are trash and they are going to do it right.  Its like all the original people left and the studio brought in new writers’ to tell what ever story they wanted; didnt matter that it didnt fit the franchise. They wanted to tell their story of how people aren’t redeemable and you can just suck it if you don’t agree. This franchise is about giving options. Good and evil. Letting you decide how you were going to stand in the world.\n In short this is a very pretty game with beautiful graphics and with a ton of potential to be great.

BioShock Infinite is everything you should not do when writing a brand-new narrative and constructing a brand-new setting. Not only is Columbia a pale successor to the brilliantly-realized Rapture of yesteryear, Booker and Elizabeth actively prohibit this game from being as interesting as it could be. The \"mind-bender\" twist at the end is insanely contrived and adds nothing to the experience beyond an assist to make the player feel smart and good about themselves for a passing moment. Instead of helping me understand Columbia, Irrational expects me to care about a minute-long diatribe on a poorly-conveyed civil war, and feel a desire within myself to help the future of these people.\n\nThe level design is unbelievably weak. Linear as sin, few-to-no easter eggs, and with the curse of entirely-staionary NPCs affecting an attempt at \"liveliness\". To me, it's insane that the prior BioShock games could convey *so much life* alongside an absence of normal human beings. Yet Infinite, replete with dozens of normal NPCs, feels completely artificial and hollow.\n\nAs if I didn't already hate the base game enough, Irrational also chose to bring themselves back home with the \"Burial At Sea\" DLC, bringing two extremely underqualified characters into the Rapture fold. It's an understatement to call BioShock Infinite dogshit, and having the protagonists from a particularly dogshit title try to headline a follow-up to the excellence at this series' roots is raw grossness.\n\nClunky, highly-linear gameplay, a convoluted and poorly-written plot, a mediocre setting...do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from BioShock Infinite.\n\nRealistically, it seems like most people greatly enjoy this game, and I don't expect you, dear reader, to be any different. I'm sure you'll probably enjoy this title, but i personally despise Infinite on every measurable scale. It was a massive disappointment at launch and it remains a stale, personality-devoid generic FPS to this day. It's a poor successor to the gameplay freedom, philosophical concepts and art direction of the original, and 2K Marin already showed Irrational how to perfect their formula via the excellent BioShock 2. Do NOT pick up this game. There are much better ways to spend your time.\n\n*BioShock* and *BioShock 2* were measured, well-designed projects with immense replayability and a brilliantly-realized setting. BioShock Infinite is a reactionary response to the original's success, and a complete failure to care about any of its best traits. I seriously fucking despise everything about this fucking game.","timestamp_created":1622867292,"timestamp_updated":1622868771,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.461832046508789063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93207885","author":{"steamid":"76561198361098351","num_games_owned":342,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1050,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":704,"last_played":1622954019},"language":"latam","review":"jod3r q rico","timestamp_created":1622867003,"timestamp_updated":1622934836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93204588","author":{"steamid":"76561198254442940","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1690,"last_played":1651431570},"language":"spanish","review":"Literalmente me enamore del juego","timestamp_created":1622861690,"timestamp_updated":1622861690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93203755","author":{"steamid":"76561198055679388","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":383,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":250,"last_played":1623836329},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite is old enough to start disagreeing with everyone on the internet about where it's favourite fortnight dance moves came from.\nHaving said that- It's by no means a rubbish game.
