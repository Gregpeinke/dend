I somehow managed to get myself stuck as well in the first 30min of gameplay (jumped on stuff then got eventually stuck)\nOne thing that I found annoying but were at start like “hmm that’s nice”. Is the ammo management. First half of the game or even more, you get ammo everywhere and Elizabeth also gives you free ammo… but after certain threshold in game ammo becomes suddenly so scarce, which was really annoying. I mostly were forced to melee around as I hate collecting random guns on the ground from enemies as not only I haven’t upgraded em, but also that ruins my meta gameplay. I usually end up choosing guns I like the most, upgrading them and using the whole game, which was really nice at first half of the game as I got 0 ammo issues.\nWith weapon upgrades you have to be picky. As throughout the game I could upgrade only 2 weapons fully.\nIf compared to previous installations…. I enjoyed this the most. Artstyle was more pleasant, enjoyable sidekick, more entertaining characters and world was much much more fun and pleasant to explore. Sky islands with skylines was tons of fun. Also gunplay wasn’t so obnoxious. As you essentially could pick between plenty of weapons that you like the most and upgrade them. Plus boost your choice of gunplay with gear and abilities. By the end I rolled with rifle and RPG with projectile shield and crows as ability. Damn crows were OP, they essentially disabled the whole arena, especially once you get upgrades for it. Another thing that made gunplay more fun is that you didn’t have to constantly switch between weapons as you got plenty of ammo and with gear could get even more. Previous bioshock stories were maybe more “realistic” in a sense… had sense of mystery.. but this was simply purer form of entertainment. There were fun twists, eccentric elements and more straightforward premise.\nAs for DLCs there is challenge mode I couldn’t be bothered and story DLC of different parallel world. In story DLC we back to aquatic world sadly…. And ammo became cancer again. I ran out of ammo so often that were forced to melee shit… Also think I liked this Elizabeth the most, she hot.\nPart 2 intro was, interesting for sure I guess for lelz? Lockpicking minigames, going through vents, sneak killing enemies, using enemies against each other is essentially part 2.\nPart 1 of DLC focuses on action/gunplay, part 2 focuses on stealth\nBioshag trinity\n[h1] 🌟 Total score: [b] 7/10[/b] 🌟 [/h1]\n[b]Game status:[/b]\n✅ Finished\n","timestamp_created":1660044550,"timestamp_updated":1660044550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120322422","author":{"steamid":"76561199066521594","num_games_owned":68,"num_reviews":63,"playtime_forever":188,"playtime_last_two_weeks":188,"playtime_at_review":147,"last_played":1660266129},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1660036200,"timestamp_updated":1660036200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120319537","author":{"steamid":"76561198353709640","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1543,"playtime_at_review":614,"last_played":1660368232},"language":"english","review":"A captivating fever dream","timestamp_created":1660031156,"timestamp_updated":1660031156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120312868","author":{"steamid":"76561198252936080","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":839,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":839,"last_played":1651478900},"language":"schinese","review":"太他妈流弊了，结局给我震撼哭了","timestamp_created":1660018014,"timestamp_updated":1660018014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120309262","author":{"steamid":"76561198091289536","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1134,"playtime_last_two_weeks":396,"playtime_at_review":1022,"last_played":1660530691},"language":"brazilian","review":"Bioshock Infinite não tem nada a ver com os outros 2 Bioshocks.

História épica, personagens marcantes, imersão e ambientação excelentes tornaram a minha nota de um não crítico em... 10/10.\n\nObs: tenta não pegar spoiler de nada do jogo, pois o jogo te surpreenderá bastante.","timestamp_created":1659968633,"timestamp_updated":1659968633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120278373","author":{"steamid":"76561198154227793","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":155,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1660033776},"language":"koreana","review":"명작 그자체","timestamp_created":1659967306,"timestamp_updated":1659967306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120274756","author":{"steamid":"76561198982142757","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3736,"playtime_last_two_weeks":3640,"playtime_at_review":3736,"last_played":1659957808},"language":"schinese","review":"当之无愧的第九艺术神作，剧情相当精彩，不过本体剧情与前两代几乎没有关联，没玩过前两代也可以放心入，另外海葬DLC和一代剧情形成闭环，在时间线上这一代相当于是一代的前传。打到本体结局的时候真的相当震撼，那种感觉不亚于看星际穿越的时候，只能不停地卧槽，无数的伏笔一下子涌入脑海，好像一瞬间明白了所有事情，但又有些似懂非懂，之后就去网上看了各种剧情解读，真的是回味无穷。\n\n无限的另外一大亮点无疑是女主伊丽莎白了。还记得救出伊丽莎白后的第一场战斗，战斗的音乐才刚响起，屏幕上就出现了一行字：在战斗中你不需要担心伊丽莎白，她可以照顾好自己。当时的感觉就是意外又惊喜，以前玩别的游戏，在战斗的同时还要顾及npc的安危，完全就是带着一个拖油瓶；而这个柔弱的女孩却不一样，她不简单。到这里，这个游戏给我的感觉瞬间就不一样了。\n\n在之后的战斗中我才明白，她岂止可以照顾好自己，甚至还来照顾我。多少次，当我子弹快打完了，她从不知道哪里捡来一支枪，叫我接着；当我被打得只剩血皮了，屏幕闪着红光只听得到自己的心跳，却又忽然听到她的声音：“Booker! You're hurt! First-aid!\" 然后丢给我一个大血包起死回生；哪怕是我以为自己被打死了，睁开眼看到的也是她在给我打药。甚至在看到我站在售货机前纠结的时候，在看到我满大街垃圾桶翻物资的时候，她还会给我丢钱：“Booker, catch!\" 我还有什么不知足的？伊丽莎白，你是我的神！\n\n看着她从天真烂漫的少女一步步成长，自始至终与你并肩作战，没有一个人不会对这样一位女孩产生患难与共的情感吧，玩家如此，主角布克亦是如此。还记得那个在沙滩上翩翩起舞的伊丽莎白，多么希望让时间永远停留在那一刻，没有什么债务，也没有什么巴黎，只有那刚刚冲出囚笼的飞鸟，和她那随心而动却绝美的舞蹈。\n\n奈何故事总有落幕的那一刻，本想着在dlc中与伊丽莎白再续前缘，没想到得到的却是更甚的意难平。不管怎样，都不影响我给好评，这个游戏绝对值这个价，冲就完了！","timestamp_created":1659962365,"timestamp_updated":1659962365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120270199","author":{"steamid":"76561198879149529","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":854,"playtime_last_two_weeks":164,"playtime_at_review":800,"last_played":1660215917},"language":"polish","review":"Kupiłem Bioshock The Collection za 50zł na przecenie.

The gunplay is satisfying and the freedom to move across rails and leap from great heights gives the combat a fluid and dynamic feel. What steals the show is the first ever competent NPC I think we've ever seen in a FPS, Elizabeth. They've managed to make sure she doesn't block your movement, she intuitively stays near you either ahead or behind but never blocks your path, she alerts you to items in your area and in combat will even seek out things you need and throw them to you, they truly set a new standard for NPC design in this game. The story is intruiging, it keeps you constantly interested with a cast of eccentric characters and balances the pacing of story and combat extremely well.\n\nEven if you just want a dumb FPS shooter to blast people and don't care about any of the above, you'll still not be disappointed, this game is solid in every way and you should definitely buy it.","timestamp_created":1659921556,"timestamp_updated":1659921556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120251368","author":{"steamid":"76561198006951888","num_games_owned":511,"num_reviews":212,"playtime_forever":1132,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1132,"last_played":1604245356},"language":"english","review":"Yes","timestamp_created":1659919930,"timestamp_updated":1659919930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120250566","author":{"steamid":"76561198085879200","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":64,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":64,"last_played":1593948083},"language":"schinese","review":"电子游戏史上的奇迹","timestamp_created":1659918639,"timestamp_updated":1659918639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120250217","author":{"steamid":"76561198287870704","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":575,"last_played":1653772935},"language":"brazilian","review":"Sem dúvidas a melhor coisa desse jogo são as músicas.","timestamp_created":1659918072,"timestamp_updated":1659918072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120244263","author":{"steamid":"76561198061335887","num_games_owned":155,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":835,"playtime_last_two_weeks":835,"playtime_at_review":835,"last_played":1659906022},"language":"french","review":"Hi, \nBioshock Infinite is a life changing game.

sawry if this review isn't good, but it doesn't really have to be because ummm i'm just selfish like that :3. i kinda struggled to put my thoughts in order, this game was just so frustrating for one reason or another. i mean, i wasn't miserable the WHOLE time, it's definitely not a Bad Game, but long story short, you might like it, i didn't. sory o^o\n\nIf you're looking for Bioshock, I mean, it's in the name, but... it's not really Bioshock, and I just can't think of this game without comparing it to the rest of the series. Maybe that's unfair, but actually I don't care. It doesn't feel like Bioshock, it REALLY doesn't play like Bioshock, and it might not have been a big deal that it's so different if they did it right. But they didn't. If I'm being completely honest, this should have just been its own game, it would make a lot more sense that way.\n\nThat said, compared to Rapture Bioshocks, the core gameplay kinda sucks, and there were slight technical problems that made me wish I could manually save. It makes me feel like the game won't trust me to do it myself. Can't be trusted to use your own health kits, pick your own weapons whenever you want, let alone save your own game. Plus it caused a nuclear meltdown on my desktop at least once, nothing broke but it was such a pain to deal with.\n\n\n\nAnyway. Yeah this game ain't fun to play. All concepts of self-sustained, strategic combat are completely thrown away. You don't have all weapons at once to choose from, and what you do find out in the world is diluted by faction copies, and you can't upgrade everything. A lot of stuff gets offloaded onto Elizabeth, basically your caddy for the game. She only gives you ammo you're in the middle of using, so nothing outside of fights, and nothing if you're completely out of ammo. Medkits and salts are completely out of your control, so you're constantly pleading with Elizabeth to help you. But don't worry, there's an overshield mechanic. Who cares that you're not responsible for your own health anymore, you have a definitely adequate safeguard that recharges itself, and a temperamental NPC replacement for health kits that sometimes just doesn't cooperate!!! This is sound game design that definitely fits in with the foundation of Bioshock game design they tried to hold on to, given that idk, I guess they expect you to scrounge for health or just buy it from vending machines between fights!\n\nNot much to say about vigors, aka plasmids, because of a similar problem. You can't use them to fight long term because oops! You don't carry salts with you (not like they're really that combat oriented anyway). You just have to suffer from painfully reduced resource capacity. Sure, there's plenty to find in the world, but you are always going to be dependent on the game to do things for you unless you waste your time hunting it down. It's too bad, considering how good Bioshock 2 was with all that. Like sure, you'd always be full on everything you'd ever want, but at least you had it! (although, is it really a good comparison, carrying everything you find versus using it as you find it? or am i just selfish and want easy games?)\n\n(also, regarding upgrades that cost many thousands of dollars over the course of the game, and ignoring longstanding bioshock game design, you end up with thousands of dollars stored at all times, which has pretty bad ramifications for a series that formerly made you dependent on buying things that now cost fractions of a fraction of your money, if you couldn't find it, which you might not if the game is carefully designed. but yknow that's real deep in the weeds about item economy and pacing and all kinds of design intricacies that this game is clearly too good for, being an action shooter unlike its predecessors. so yeah moving on)\n\nCombat is GOD AWFUL but maybe that's an exaggeration but I don't care. First of all, sometimes there's a vague hint that you even CAN be stealthy, but that just doesn't happen here. But seriously, shootouts aren't very fun. Enemies have a tendency to stumble around and disappear behind cover if you so much as look at them. You only really get one good shot off before they duck out of sight. Turrets aren't a resource anymore, they're just an enemy type to kill. And don't even get me STARTED on the handymen. The worst single enemy I think I've ever fought ever. In any video game I've ever played. Which isn't really saying a lot, but they're awful Every time they move they shake your screen like they MEAN IT, you just can't aim at all when they're anywhere near you. Thankfully there's only two required fights. They're also nothing like Big Daddies, which is too bad. Barring that whole discussion, I miss caring about whether I could pass up fights or if it was worth it. No choice here.\n\nLevel design just okay for a pretty straightforward level-based shooter, everything feels too big and wide open. You never get a good chance to get really close when it matters unless the game makes it a point to put you there. There's comparatively little exploration available for one thing, so have fun looking at one or two side rooms before you reach the next objective. And also it feels wrong in comparison to Rapture but maybe I'm just homesick right?\n\nAAAAND story. The story wasn't really there. I liked the supernatural stuff, but there was almost none of it, and basically zero horror elements. I liked the themes, \"constants and variables\" is a very oversimplified way to put it but there's something there. Or, there would be if it had something that built off it well. All the specifics don't really matter after a certain point, and I don't know whether I'm just dumb or I missed something or this game really is as confusing and nonsensical as that. Like it's to the point where Bioshock 1 makes more sense why things happened, and I personally think that game makes almost no sense. I won't go into detail but it's all just ridiculous and stupid to me. Themes and plot devices are cool, plot itself is not. Too bad about Songbird, though, for all the pain they went through to make him seem like a Big Daddy, or maybe a Big Sister if Ken Levine knew what that was, he really wasn't.\n\nAll the DLC have their own reviews, and Clash in the Clouds doesn't even count as real DLC (just a showcase of how bad combat really is. avoid), but in short, Burial at Sea wastes so much time trying to make the original seem \"even better\", which is a stretch I put in quotes because for one, the original can only get so much better when it wasn't good in the first place, and also trying to cram Infinite's characters into it just doesn't work at all. Like, if they wanted an \"Elizabeth in Rapture\" story then sure, go ahead! That's a great chance to revisit Rapture in yet another light, giving Elizabeth's character mileage outside of the main game. But they got so caught up trying to justify Bioshock's original story for some reason, they flubbed it hard.\n\nAlso. Elizabeth girl you Have Something.
