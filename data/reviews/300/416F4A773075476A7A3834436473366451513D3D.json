I really urge you to stop what your doing and buy it right now! here are some reasons!\nThe game is in a really intresting setting! having a valve multiplayer shooter in world war 2 is really cool! as it just have this really realistic tone you can't find in some of the other games, at all times I really felt as if we were fighting a team and I was just a pawn on a larger board, and that really leads me into my next point there is no other game that really has the same level of team work so here's an example if you all go different ways as random classes you will lose the other team will shatter though your defenses, however if one person on your team goes on mic and organises it you can have snipers on a roof covering one point of contest and then you could have gunners ready to jump in one the machine gunner is in postion, one example is I was playing on the snowy map Colmar and we had hit a stalemate every advance my team made was rebuked by the Germans we kept going, and they attacked vice versa it was stuck around the middle point this happened for about 45mins of intense gameplay if anything went wrong there attack would succeed then suddenly we went is at team and flooded there defences we all died save two of us and those two single handly planted the bomb and won the game.\nAnd from another perspective it really shows this game is old so the people still playing are dedicted fans so every match is full of pros but kind pros not the sort who kick you if your new (cough,cough counterstrike I am looking at you cough cough) Its a great community fan made maps are amazing especially strand! which is fighting up a beach,\nthe classes in this game are very well made each to suite a different playstile there is the in your face assualt gunner who is always on the front line or the slightly more reserved sniper or even the heavy weapons Machine Gunner vital for holding an area!\nAlso the atmosphere is amazing each of the maps feels like are in a war and your survival is key to success each map whether its the bombarding of shells and explosians or the brilliantly designed maps unlike any game every round feels intense and atmosperhic, But this game is great cause its not WORLD WAR 2 counterstrike, counter strike is fast and requires quick descions and reactions, this game is very slow in a good way meaning a match could be broken into phases or attack, defense and much more.\nThis game has also aged well with slighly better Graphics than CSSOURCE and for me at least on my laptop I can see frame rates 80-100+ which makes it so smooth! and I am sure those with gaming pc there will see 300+ \n\nI could go on for ever Its an amazing game honestly so good!!\nand if we can get support maybe we may get A \"Day of Defeat GO\"\nthe mechanics are there with a update into Source 2 I can see this being one of the biggest multiplayer shooters If your reading this Valve you know what to do! \nGo Buy this game

It's a WW2 based multiplayer competive team-based FPS with classes. And aiming and headshots and dieing as you are peaking the corner from one bullet.\n\nMultiplayer community is still alive. You will find at least few full servers that play same popular maps 24/7.\n\nIf to say about it short, then imagine Counter-Strike, but more balanced, with classes, more fun and without having to wait until the end of a round. In WW2 setting.\nAnd amazingly enough, it has interesting non-symmetrical maps, which is quite a rarity. Not sure if it's as balanced for both sides, but it makes it much more interesting to play with both teams. More team games should do this.\n\nAnd yea, it has system where you lose energy if you sprint of jump, so if you plan on getting somewhere far away as fast as you can, just walk there, losing energy gives a huge temporary penalty on your speed.\nYou also can run, walk, crouch or go prone, all will decide what kind of accuaricy you will have. Actually camping is a legit tactic there. But watch out, shootign gives you away, with all the muzzle fire effect and big light they give off, so don't expect to camp for too long, relocate. Or push. With teammates.\n\nAnd it has two modes: 5 control points and detonation. Not much should be told about control points, though the last ones tend to be won by a sneaky person, tend to be too close to the enemy spawnpoint to really push with whole force. And I never got to play detonation maps, not popular enough, sorry.\n\nSo, what Source improved over original? Well, you guessed it, the most important change is the inclusion of ragdolls! Well, fine, not important, still nice. Graphics look more clean, less muddy.\n\nThey did some good work on class system, streamlining them and making them all more or less unique. In original, each side had 9 classes with seemingly random equipment, and there could be big difference between each side. In Source there are only 6 classes now, balanced and each made to have something that others don't have. Even better is that you can tell away what you are fighting against.\n\nAnyway, let's get to it:\n- Rifleman are made for fighting at medium and far ranges. And short ranges. Can kill with a single bullet, but they don't shoot fast and their accuaricy is too lacking on the move. They are support to the main force, as well as sniping. Not going to do good at the very front of a force. They can now aim down iron sight, but seeing how they are accurate when standing and aiming down iron sight makes you crawl like turret, it's kinda useless. Can also shoot grenade out onto quite far distances.\n\n- Assault classes are good only at close range and only if you are moving, otherwise you may use Support instead. Recoil and accuaricy losses on his main gun is minimal, it's just that it's not accurate to begin with. Has grenades. And importanly, has smoke grenades, that he can either use for himself, to get into smoke and use his close-range gun at advantage. Or he can use it to team, for tactics, like covering place which is dominated by enemy machine gunners.\n\n- Support class is actually the main class around there. His automatic gun is kinda average, for medium ranges. Have to learn to aim with this one. Can shoot one bullet at a time in alternative mode. Also has grenades. Has pistol.\n\n- Snipers are like rifleman but with sniping scope that makes them accurate. But without grenade-shooting. No, you still don't camp, machine gunners do better job than you. And rifleman do better job at you. You should be at far away but still moving and starfing a lot. Switching to scope mode is instant and accurate fully even when you are standing, so use it to full advantage.\n\n- Machine gunners are the people who defend and clean streets and open spaces until there is nothing left inside. Can defend rooms too, but that asks for a nade. And can do better job than camping snipers. They really kill anything at any range, you have to know where they are and to come out from unexpected angle. Good thing there is a limit on them. You have to go prone to set up machine gun, but you can use any ledge you find as well. At least they can't shoot much while undeployed at least, the recoil and accuaricy loss are gigantic. There are however some players who use while travelling through small rooms, when you can just \"shotgun\" anybody, having learnt to compensate recoil. But at least there arent many of such players. Also have pistols.\n\n- Rocket class has rocket launcher and autoatic little weapons. In original they were just there to have \"random\" selection to troll you, being useless, only there to blow some objectives in very few maps, I heard. In Source, the explosion of bazooka was buffed up, having bigger radius. It's actually good at taking out machine gunner spots. Some of them. the thing is, you have to put them over shoulder to shoot and that makes you crawl, so it's still kinda weird support class. But hey, at least they have automatic gun as backup weapon, not pistol. Those are actually good. So yay source!\n\nSo yea. Still addictive, still campish. Still good. Or better. It's more streamlined and feels more sane in balance for sure.","timestamp_created":1437244249,"timestamp_updated":1437244291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17110109","author":{"steamid":"76561198119390365","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1439936439},"language":"english","review":"Dont buy it, theres a shit load of kids trying to \"MILSIM\", This game is Bullshit.","timestamp_created":1437237806,"timestamp_updated":1437237806,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17108103","author":{"steamid":"76561197960380770","num_games_owned":135,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":642,"last_played":1434813241},"language":"english","review":"has none of the feel and soul of the original dod half life mod i disliked the game from launch i recently tried it again couldnt get into it.","timestamp_created":1437229126,"timestamp_updated":1437229126,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17106072","author":{"steamid":"76561198170413653","num_games_owned":253,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":319,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1569112361},"language":"english","review":"this is a great game once you get used to its style and gameplay.
