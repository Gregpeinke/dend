Enter [i]Portal[/i], the first-person puzzle platformer by Valve. It was first released in the Orange Box bundle alongside [i]Team Fortress 2[/i], as well as [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and its episodes. All three games are possessed of excellent design philosophy for different reasons; [i]Team Fortress 2[/i] offers a multiplayer experience with a variety of playable characters who each serve different functions, [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and the subsequent episodes are great demonstrations of the Source Engine’s capabilities, and Portal has the benefit of damn good writing.\n\nIn [i]Portal[/i], you play as Chell, a test subject at Aperture Science, a facility run by the sardonic AI GLaDOS, who puts you through a gamut of tests and promises cake at the end. The gameplay starts off rather simply; the first puzzle isn’t really a puzzle, but a demonstration of the function of cubes, which are used to press buttons that open doors to the next elevator or test chamber. However, there is one element, among others, that has carried over from the [i]Half-Life[/i] franchise, and that is Valve’s knack for offering discreet tutorials and visual storytelling through the player’s surroundings alone. \n\nEven before GLaDOS deigns to give you the Portal Gun, the initial levels demonstrate the function of portals. That first “puzzle” isn’t just to let you figure out the functions of the E and WASD keys, it’s the first time you see portals, thus showing how you and anything you carry with you can pass through them. The second test chamber shows portals appearing on several different walls which you can pass through to gather the materials necessary to complete the puzzles. Then you get the first Portal Gun; it’s not really a gun so much as a tool, but “gun” certainly works, considering that it fires portals. \n\nThe next few chambers illustrate the limitations of portals, which can only be placed on white walls. Power orbs are also subsequently introduced; they’re balls of energy that can be redirected with portals into generators, and they’ll also look eerily familiar to anyone who’s played [i]Half-Life 2[/i]. During these levels, your Portal Gun can only create blue entrance portals, with the orange exits being generated by other means. Finally, you obtain a Portal Gun that creates both exits and entrances, which are blue and orange or vice versa. It’s at this point that the game stops introducing features, though there are further challenges in store. \n\nHaving control of both portals opens even further possibilities; you can place them perpendicularly and run in a straight line forever, you can put two of them on the ceiling and fall for as long as you please, and best of all, you can hurl yourself across entire test chambers. Velocity is preserved when you jump into a portal, so if you jump from a great enough height you can launch yourself to what should be inaccessible places. If you fuck up the jumps, don’t worry, Chell’s equipped with Long Fall Boots, which thankfully make falling to your death impossible, unless you accidentally fall into pools of acid or water.\n\nAt first glance, [i]Portal[/i] might not sound like it has any replay value, but thankfully it’s also blessed with superlative writing. It appears simple at first, but an atmosphere of complete and utter aloneness is created not only by the distance between you and GLaDOS, but the soulless and sterile architecture that’s always there to remind you of your confinement even as you use the walls and floors to fling yourself gaily through the air. The score by Kelly Bailey also aids immensely in building the lonely atmosphere; where his work for the [i]Half-Life[/i] games alternated between brooding ambient moments and blood-pumping hard rock tunes that take on more influence from industrial rock as the series progresses, [i]Portal[/i] is all about those ambient mood pieces. With some notable exceptions, it’s sparse, almost entirely reliant on texture, and sounds like Brian Eno having a seriously bad episode of seasonal depression. It fits the game so nicely, however, that I wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nIt’s at this point that I should bring up the game’s strange and twisted sense of humour; GLaDOS’ attempts at humour constitute listing the negative side effects of Aperture’s products and taunting that becomes less subtle as you proceed. Not only does it provide solace, but it’s also crucial to the narrative progression; her speeches and her attitude towards you steadily become more misanthropic, but she has such a way with words that I can’t really be mad at her until a certain story beat happens. To say anything more would spoil anyone who hasn’t already played it, so maybe go do so.\n\n[i]Portal[/i] would make a good “baby’s first video game”, but I mean that in the best possible light, because at no point does it insult the player’s intelligence. It has the smoothest escalation of ideas and difficulty I’ve yet seen in my limited experience with PC gaming, and it’s backed up by a dark but meditative score, black comedy that’s surprisingly entertaining given how bleak the game is, a gameplay loop that always offers something new with each level, and a tool that provides seemingly endless fun. Really, the only problem I have with it is that it’s the origin of that cake meme which overstayed its welcome sooner than a turd in a box of truffles, but that’s a factor outside of its control. To put it more concisely, [i]Portal[/i]’s a good game. You should play it. Because it’s good.","timestamp_created":1585283031,"timestamp_updated":1585332846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65905916","author":{"steamid":"76561198160441453","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":338,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":338,"last_played":1549717515},"language":"schinese","review":"很烧脑，适合空间感好大脑灵活的玩家玩，我玩到后面基本是看攻略过关的....\n这游戏是有剧情的，不只是单一的益智通关游戏，剧情也很有深度。\n结尾片尾曲很好听，Valve牛逼！！！","timestamp_created":1585282236,"timestamp_updated":1585282236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65900922","author":{"steamid":"76561198061192492","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":178,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":178,"last_played":1585275526},"language":"english","review":"One of my favorite games, the perfect minimalism in a video game in my opinion.
