The puzzles are smart, the story is engaging, and everything works in gameplay. Co-op is excellently designed, with very few spots that can really stump players for long. Replayability is somewhat limited after figuring out the solutions, but Workshop support means you can play a multitude of single-player and co-op community levels.

With the originality, the unique story, the Coop mode and a joke every now and then, I'm safe to say this is my favorite game at the moment. I have honestly never played a game like this. The puzzles were challenging and fun to do. I also have to mention that they did a great job on balancing the puzzles and the story so it doesn't get repetitive. \n\nAlso there is a coop mode where you and your partner play with a different portal device, making the puzzles even more challenging. There is a handy pinging option, and a ping that counts down for when you have to do the same action simultaneously. This makes it very easy to tell your partner what to do.\n\nEven if you have completed the entire story, and completed all maps in coop mode, you can still play or even make player made maps. These can also be solo or cooperative. Therefor there are plenty of maps to play after the story.\n\nIf you're not into common games (like shooters, MMO's etc.), then you should defenitely get Portal and/or Portal 2.","timestamp_created":1422309741,"timestamp_updated":1422309903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14181921","author":{"steamid":"76561198063600614","num_games_owned":350,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":3837,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1053,"last_played":1617501773},"language":"schinese","review":"单机卡关了放置了很久一直DotA2没空玩其他游戏，有好友要和我联机，玩了2小时感觉超有意思的，好久没有游戏让我产生这种想动脑子的快感了。","timestamp_created":1422301102,"timestamp_updated":1422301102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570647954940795898","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14181275","author":{"steamid":"76561198035765927","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1403,"last_played":1422162248},"language":"english","review":"While playing I found myself really looking forward to discovering more hidden portraits, trophy cases, and recordings of Cave Johnson and Caroline.
