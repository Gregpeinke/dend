Loved the remasters of 1 and 2, but god do I hate Infinite. If you want a pretentious story and a linear slog from one shooting gallery to another with poor gunplay, useless plasmids (vigors/magic), scarce ammo with bullet sponge enemies, have all core gameplay elements clash with one another and a story that makes less and less sense the more you look at it, this game nails every one of those points.\n\nAs much as I hate the game, I must admit that Columbia is a beautiful place, which makes the wasted potential for fleshing out and exploring this world all the more dissatisfying. On a side note, I do think Songbird is excellently designed and I also loved the Luteces, but other than that everything else sucks. Don't buy this, just watch a review on YouTube or something.\n\nGoing to try the DLC and see if it's any good, will update this review if it is.","timestamp_created":1648678406,"timestamp_updated":1648678406,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578830063343048096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113088999","author":{"steamid":"76561198962707360","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":373,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":373,"last_played":1645523104},"language":"english","review":"i misses big daddy","timestamp_created":1648676918,"timestamp_updated":1648676918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113086623","author":{"steamid":"76561198191201081","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1211,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1211,"last_played":1648672563},"language":"russian","review":"9/10","timestamp_created":1648672954,"timestamp_updated":1648672954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113086483","author":{"steamid":"76561197978561842","num_games_owned":305,"num_reviews":82,"playtime_forever":1252,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1649438963},"language":"italian","review":"Rigiocato dopo quasi 10 anni ma con una 3070, nonostante il tempo passato, sempre grandi soddisfazioni.","timestamp_created":1648672727,"timestamp_updated":1648672727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113085583","author":{"steamid":"76561199129102406","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":868,"last_played":1657121090},"language":"english","review":"fun gam","timestamp_created":1648671267,"timestamp_updated":1648671267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113084573","author":{"steamid":"76561198859452687","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":470,"last_played":1648669295},"language":"english","review":"Bad Ending.

З іншого ж боку - після чудових двох попередніх частин серії сама назва \"Bioshock\" в мене асоціюється якраз із тією похмурою атмосферою підводного міста мутантів-наркоманів та Великих Татусів із Сестричками. Тому сприймати \"Bioshock Infinite\" як \"той самий Bioshock\" мені доволі важко. Але це чисто суб'єктивно.\n\n[h1]Сюжет[/h1]\n1912 рік. Історія починається з того, що головний герой, Букер Девітт, якому доручили знайти дівчину Елізабет, попадає в утопічне літаюче місто Колумбію, що знаходиться аж за хмарами. Оговтавшись від потрясіння цього надзвичайним видовищем, він вирушає на пошуки дівчини. Пізніше Букер та Елізабет опиняються в центрі протистояння влади та простих роботяг. А завдяки надприродним здібностям Елізабет відкривати проходи у паралельні реальності герої дізнаються похмурі таємниці Колумбії, а також свого минулого і майбутнього.\nЗагалом сюжет справді цікавий. Тематика паралельних реальностей органічно вплетена в оповідь. Мені тільки не сподобалося, що [spoiler]не показали сам процес трансформації головного героя у Камстока, а просто поставили перед фактом[/spoiler]. Фінал історії лише один. Звісно, це не можна назвати однозначно недоліком, але в попередніх частинах було декілька варіантів фіналу і чогось подібного я очікував і тут. Але ні.\nP.S. Сюжет Bioshock Infinite практично ніяк не перетинається із попередніми іграми серії\n\n[h1]Геймплей[/h1]\nІгровий процес помітно змінився із введенням нових механік. Тепер із головним героєм бігає Елізабет, яка може від час перестрілки і патронів підкинути, і знайдену аптечку, чи фласку мани подати (тут мана називається \"солями\"). Шкода, правда, що сама не відстрілюється). Також Елізабет може створювати розриви в реальності, що дозволить перенести з інших світів, скажімо, стійку зі зброєю, якщо патронів мало, або ж аптечку, чи взагалі робота-союзника.\nДо речі, про зброю. Видів зброї тут вистачає, але Букер чомусь може носити лише 2 види стрілецької зброї. І це ну дуже незручно! Чесно кажучи, якоїсь справді вагомої причини для цього я не знайшов. Доводиться постійно розміркувовувати що взяти, а що викинути: скажімо, чи варто тягати із собою дробовик та гвинтівку? Може краще щсь замінити на гранатомет на випадок здоровенного броньованого кіборга (так, тут є й таке) ? Чи може, взагалі краще взяти снайперку? А патронів саме до обраної тобою зброї може і не бути у щойно вбитих ворожих солдатів.\nТут, як і в попередніх частинах є автомати, що продають аптечки, солі, чи апгрейди для зброї. І ось в Bioshock Infinie апгрейди зброї на самій зброї чомусь не відображаються! І це доволі неприємно, бо в Bioshock 1 та 2 було цікаво спостерігати, як твоя зброя поступово перетворюється в щось круте і футуристично-монструозне. Тут такого нема. Шкода(\nТоніки з Bioshock 1 та 2 тут замінилися на енергетики. Якщо загалом, то це ті самі яйця, але в профіль. Нічого кардинально нового.\nТепер до полоски зі здоров'ям та \"маною\" додалася ще одна - такий собі типу щит, який поглинає шкоду. Спершу віднімається полоска щита, а вже потім здоров'я. Щит відновлюється через деякий час.\nУ відкритих локаціях є рельси, що висять в повітрі. По них, використовуючи спеціальний пристрій, Букер може подорожувати між окремими районами. Цікаве нововведення. В процесі такої поїздки можна відстрілюватися від ворогів.\n \n[h1]Оточення[/h1]\nНові локації обов'язково сподобаються тим, кому набридло на протязі двох попередніх частин блукати зловісними кімнатами занедбаного Rapture. Однозначно, тепла і сонячна Колумбія радує око! Місто вражає своєю величчю. На початку, коли іще все не пішло по одному місцю, доволі цікаво погуляти вуличками і послухати безтурботні теревені містян про те, чи інше, або ж пороздивлятися місцеві чудеса техніки. Так, докорінна зміна місця подій стовідсотково  була свіжим ковтком повітря. \n\n[h1]Висновки[/h1]\nЧи хорошою вийшла ця гра? Однозначно так. Зміна декорацій освіжила гру. Нові механіки розбавили геймплей, хоча деякі нововведення в ігровому процесі неприємно здивували. Сюжет також хоч і цікавий, проте лишив після себе якесь таке відчуття недосказанності де в чому. \nРекомендую.","timestamp_created":1648586530,"timestamp_updated":1648713076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113034393","author":{"steamid":"76561198050488931","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1275,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1275,"last_played":1648419654},"language":"english","review":"TL;DR: On a relative scale (relative to the other BioShock entries), this game is not as good story-wise as BioShock 1 and not as good gameplay-wise as BioShock 2 so I think it's last in the rankings for me: 1. BS1 2. BS2 3. Infinite. Burial at Sea is... I don't like it that much honestly. There's some glaring plot holes and it feels rushed. If you want a good DLC, do yourself a favor and play Minerva's Den in BioShock 2, which, IMO, is one of the best DLCs of all time. On an absolute scale, Infinite is an amazing game that I consider to be upper echelon so it's worthy to play at least once no matter who you are. Also, buy the whole BioShock collection when it's frequently on sale instead of this standalone.\n\nOk, so let me preface my review by saying I DO recommend BioShock Infinite and I think it is worthy of at least one play-through, especially if you're a fan of the BioShock franchise. With that caveat out of the way, let's get to my thoughts.\n\n--Main Story/Game--\nSo the main story of Infinite eschews the awesome environment of Rapture in favor of a new city in Columbia. As somewhat of an American history buff/nut, I absolutely fell in love with Columbia. The city's aesthetic and American historical references were a joy to walk around, explore, and have those \"oh\" light bulb moments when you got a reference to history. That being said, I still think I prefer the environment of Rapture quite a bit more than Columbia. The main characters in the game are both affable. [strike] Joel [/strike] Booker, voiced by the amazing Troy Baker, is a bad ass with a troubled past (gee, sounds familiar), and [strike] Ellie [/strike] Elizabeth, voiced by the amazing Courtnee Draper, a sweet and innocent girl to start the story, are an amazing duo who are a joy to get to know as you battle through Columbia in an attempt to free Elizabeth. Both characters grow and go through a good progression as your adventure moves on. The combat is satisfying with a bunch of different weapons to choose from (they removed being able to carry 1 of all weapons in favor of a 2 weapon at any time mechanic) and the vigors (aka plasmids) were a lot of fun to use and experiment with. I like how Irrational, despite not being the ones that made BioShock 2, learned from the things that game did well in terms of letting you wield both a weapon and vigor/plasmid at the same time. That being said, I thought the gameplay and combat was not challenging enough for my tastes. I played on Hard, 1999 mode was unavailable to me since I haven't finished the game before, so I wonder if I do a second play-through on 1999 Mode if that'll resolve that issue. I'm not saying I'm expecting Dark Souls here, just that if I do something really stupid in combat, I get punished for it. Speaking of challenge, the health system has been retooled. You are no longer allowed to carry med kits or eve hypos to use whenever you want, instead you have both a fixed health and \"salts\" (eve) bar, for long-term bad combat consequences, as well as shields that regenerate on their own, think Halo Combat Evolved if you want an example of how the health system works. Overall, I do enjoy the new health system so that gets a good grade for me. Finally, let's get to the story, which, for people like me, is why I play games like this. I'm not going to go into detail and spoil the game since I'm not an asshole but basically you're hired to retrieve a girl named Elizabeth from a theocratic, autocratic, and racist leader in Father Comstock. All I have to say is, buckle up for the ending because your brain gets f'd. The graphics in this game are BEAUTIFUL in my opinion. As I write this, this game is about a decade old and is still gorgeous despite not being \"remastered\" like its predecessors. \n\n--DLC (Burial At Sea)--\nSo now you're back in Rapture BEFORE the fall, which I like, with Booker and Elizabeth. It's also harder, which I like. That's about where the good things end lol. Both episodes are *very* short, an hour or two at most. Episode 1 you play as Booker and Episode 2 you play as Elizabeth BUT with a very annoying handicap that makes it lame (not spoiling). You got BS1 features of the weapon wheel returning and med kit inventory (Episode 2 only) but resources are definitely scarce (good thing). The story is just... sigh. The story of Episode 1 is just okay but Episode 2 makes no sense to me. Again, not going to say any spoilers, but how am I supposed to believe Suchong finished all that work for his client and didn't mention how to use that work? Those of you who have played know what I'm saying. Whatever. Also wasn't really in love with the stealth in Episode 2, just felt like it was there to pad the runtime, and this is kind of damning since Levine worked on Thief: The Dark Project aka the game that created stealth. Bottom line here: 2K Marin set the bar very high for what to expect from a BioShock DLC with Minerva's Den and Irrational missed the mark in my opinion. It's worth a play-through just one time to get what you can from it but I see myself only returning to the main story when I get the itch to play Infinite, and I will to beat the game on 1999 Mode.\n\n--Conclusion--\nSo this is Ken Levine's last BioShock game since he closed Irrational Games after this game ran its course. I hate to say it, but I think he went out with a whimper with the just meh Burial At Sea DLCs. The main story of this game is interesting and gameplay is enjoyable, but I feel like this game doesn't do anything better than its predecessors with the story not being as good as the first game and the gameplay not being as enjoyable as the second. I don't recommend buying this game separately, wait for a sale and buy the whole BioShock: The Collection to get all games, with 1 and 2 \"remastered\", and all the DLCs. Here's my rankings for all adventure/story content:\n1. BioShock 1 (I love the original, sue me, it set up the whole universe)\n2. BioShock 2 Minerva's Den\n3. BioShock 2 main game\n4. BioShock infinite main game\n5. Burial At Sea Episode 1\n6.

the game as I'm typing this. TL;DR summary: fun game, good story, good graphics, bit on the nose with the subject matter but it doesn't interfere with a fun, probably casual shooter.\n\nIf you're a fan of the original 2, this is a no-brainer. Had a lot of fun with this one in the past. Looking forward to playing this again after I finish up Bioshock II's Minerva's Den DLC.\n\nThe look and feel of the Bioshock Infinite is more colourful, yet that's just the facade. The paint is already cracking and peeling off even before we enter the game. It tackles some heavy subjects, racism, capitalism vs socialism, are our choices actually choices and does it matter in the end y/n? \n\nI had fun with the story. Characters do feel like they grow and grow towards each other. The main NPC's have their own agenda and motivation. Nobody is a true 'bad guy' though some are more bad than others. Feels like all are products of their time, the late 1910's / early 1920's USA.\n\nGameplay wise, I'm not a big FPS shooter guy. Combat felt smooth, I've rarely had framerate hiccups or felt like controls were sluggish. I'm running a 1080TI on a 4K monitor that's capped at 60hz, so YMMV.\n\nIt's been over a year since I've last played.

It doesn't just upend the apple cart of the two previous games and replace it with an entirely different setting, it also subverts the entire franchise by abandoning the purely visual horror of the entire series and its progenitors, replacing it with an idyllic utopian world, that doesn't telegraph its underlying horror with gore and decay, and instead lets you discover its menacing undertones for yourself.\n\nI would say all of the various \"Shock\" games try to place you some kind of \"Paradise Lost\" setting, but this game is the one that actually makes you feel it as it is happening.","timestamp_created":1648427745,"timestamp_updated":1648427745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597976326942443848","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112944673","author":{"steamid":"76561197971174524","num_games_owned":212,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":19167,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18203,"last_played":1651340862},"language":"english","review":"Might be my favorite game ever, I'd have to go back through my memory.
