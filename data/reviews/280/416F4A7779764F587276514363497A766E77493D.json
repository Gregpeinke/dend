Glaring bugs that aren't avoidable. I ran into not one or two but three glaring issues, all of which I saw in the community posts before I even played it. Initially I thought, 'ouch, those must be rare though'. Nope. A missing texture not loading which left huge blotches of black squares in its' wake, a massive 3D graphical glitch that tears across the entire screen in an important 3D platforming scene, a very memorable Barney moment rendered absurd due to him having no hitbox and infinitely shooting at an iconic boss that's supposed to kill him. There are more than that. \n\nAs of 10/5/2020, I actively not only do not recommend but actively discourage purchase of this title due to these unfixed glitches. I WILL say, to it's benefit, you get better lighting, functional ragdolls, and a few minor gameplay changes throughout the campaign. \n\nTo its' detriment, the bugs are awful, and many subtle aspects simply do not work as they were intended. Small things that die-hard fans would notice, (roaches have no AI for instance, they just run around aimlessly). The SMG weapon is also patently broken, nearly useless beyond 10 feet due to both a dramatically reduced standard accuracy (meaning spread), AND a frankly broken recoil system that automatically rocks the barrel/point of aim up and down far too vigorously as you shoot. Neither small bursts nor semi-automatic shots taken reduce this issue in the least. It is only good at very close ranges. Ranges that the shotgun has always dominated in the first place.\n\nI absolutely, 100% DO recommend purchase of the original Half-Life, Half-Life: Blue Shift, Half-Life: Opposing Force, and Black Mesa. Half-Life, the original, is still THE best experience with it you can have, especially if you grew up with it in the late 90's, early 00's as I did. The two expansions function pretty much flawlessly for me, as does the original. Black Mesa is a lovingly-crafted ode to the original, and so far is amazing in its' own right. Half-Life: Source I would only ever recommend if it was patched. As of now, it's frankly an unconscionable thing to pay that much money for.","timestamp_created":1601899148,"timestamp_updated":1601899148,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540069699287414551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77038253","author":{"steamid":"76561198891858329","num_games_owned":111,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":71,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":71,"last_played":1599594754},"language":"portuguese","review":"Eu conheci o Gordon (O protagonista) do Fall Guys.","timestamp_created":1601834092,"timestamp_updated":1601834092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77024689","author":{"steamid":"76561198158502276","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":616,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":386,"last_played":1601832412},"language":"english","review":"half life with better graphics, still buggy but great","timestamp_created":1601817407,"timestamp_updated":1601817407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"77017791","author":{"steamid":"76561198860470308","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":1090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1617551048},"language":"english","review":"Let's be honest, this game generally is terrible.

Half-Life 2 later debuted Valve more advanced Source engine in 2004 with updated graphics to match, and Valve had three Source remasters in the works - Half-Life: Source, Counter-Strike: Source, and Day of Defeat: Source.  Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source are pretty much exactly the same as their original GoldSource counterparts, except they have the Source engine's physics and Half-Life 2's style of graphics.  Half-Life: Source is a direct port with Half-Life 1's style of graphics, Source's physics, and buggy as hell.  It's even more disappointing considering Half-Life was/is Valve's flagship game, the series that debuted each of Valve's new engine, Half-Life 2 was new at the time, and the other two Source remasters turned out fine.\n\nIf you want to play Half-Life 1 for the first time, I highly recommend playing the original GoldSource version before anything else.  Forget about Half-Life: Source, to hell with the fan-made remake Black Mesa, play the original one first.  If you become a Half-Life fan or you are already a Half-Life fan, play Half-Life: Source later, then maybe try the Black Mesa remake.  It's worth noting that Valve has recently gone back and fixed bugs in their previous games going as far back has the GoldSource engine, so I do have hope that Half-Life: Source will be fixed someday.","timestamp_created":1600806700,"timestamp_updated":1600806700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76378394","author":{"steamid":"76561198127508008","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1646345450},"language":"english","review":"The shooting feels a lot more smooth, other then that the game is nearly broken.","timestamp_created":1600781942,"timestamp_updated":1600781942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.641537964344024658","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76368570","author":{"steamid":"76561198434283215","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":788,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1657690034},"language":"english","review":"I Like It I Dunno If Its The Best Way Since I Dont Have Black Mesa Or The OG One So Idk But Yeah Its Fun For The Five Hours Ive Played It So Far","timestamp_created":1600762733,"timestamp_updated":1600762733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76343405","author":{"steamid":"76561198425659899","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":842,"last_played":1604432305},"language":"czech","review":"Half Life pretahnuty do source enginu s kupou bugu hra nejde pomalu ani dohrat.","timestamp_created":1600712481,"timestamp_updated":1655918182,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76333173","author":{"steamid":"76561198094633697","num_games_owned":297,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":240,"last_played":1598731188},"language":"schinese","review":"4小时卸载了，网上找的视频云通关了。\n这代重置画质没提升，反而脚上抹了油一样。\n一代地图很大，基本就是满图走迷宫。\n\n真想玩一代就找原版，这代不推荐。","timestamp_created":1600699068,"timestamp_updated":1600699068,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474489003419876099","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76325899","author":{"steamid":"76561198298752434","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":725,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":725,"last_played":1539784048},"language":"english","review":"it's literally half life in the source engine what do you expect","timestamp_created":1600688242,"timestamp_updated":1600688242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"76314056","author":{"steamid":"76561198228828452","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":26,"last_played":1600222065},"language":"english","review":"GET THE ORIGINAL VERSION, NOT THIS ONE!!!!\n\nBought this with the Valve Complete Pack several years ago, which also included the original version.

The only good things you can do with this shetload of fock is either make a glitch compilation on youtube or use the assets on Gmod to fock around with. Even then, the spheremaps break and you have to download an addon to fix it before realizing the addon clashes with something that shouldn't even be there at all and so it doesn't work with the newest update and just makes every texture supposed to be shiny completely midnight black, so you uninstall it and just deal with the weird black spots that are just there.
