Концовка очень зацепила. Хочется оказатся в Aperture Science в живую (в нормальное время)! Очень душевно! Вообщем круто!\n\nПлюсы: \n+ Крутой сюжет!\n+ Сложные головоломки!\n+ Игра не дает о себе забыть даже после прохождения (Co-Op, редактор карт)\n+ Редактор карт (Каждый может почувствовать себя GlaDOS, сделать свою камеру и дать поиграть в нее игрокам через WorkShop.\n+ Нет катсцен (Все в стиле Valve как и в халфе катсцен нет и все повествование происходит персонажем в самой игре)\n\nМинусы: \n- Загрузки (они постоянно)\n- Сложные головоломки (Да это был и плюс. Но правда, некоторые игроки привыкшие к слабеньким головоломкам современных игр аля: \"поставь куб туда и дверь откроется\" могут сильно бомбануть и выключить игру на 4ой главе.\n- Плохая озвучка на русском. (Иногда не совпадает с субтитрами, ну и перевод в целом)\n- Бесят моменты (особенно к середине игры) когда нужно в огромном зале найти маленькую стенку куда нужно поставить портал. Это очень маленькие стенки! И я часто тупил на таких моментах.\n\nОтличная игра! Можно пройти за вечер и получить кучу удовольствия!\n\nP.S Рекомендую перед прохождением второй части пройти (или просто ознакомится с сюжетом первой) ибо ничего не будет понятно.","timestamp_created":1504286576,"timestamp_updated":1504287547,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34663933","author":{"steamid":"76561198321103956","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1191,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":829,"last_played":1520748314},"language":"russian","review":"Portal 2 неплохая головоломка и с хорошим сюжетом.В данной игре мы должны проходить всякие головоломки с помощью портальной пушки которая создаёт порталы ,а также в этой игре есть кооперативный режим с довольно неплохим сюжетом .\nПрошёл игру 3 раза и не пожалел потраченого времени.Рекомендую","timestamp_created":1504283927,"timestamp_updated":1504283927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.463118195533752441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34663887","author":{"steamid":"76561198348669678","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":909,"last_played":1595607443},"language":"swedish","review":"gg inget våld ;-)","timestamp_created":1504283777,"timestamp_updated":1504283777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34663673","author":{"steamid":"76561198138578225","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1797,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1447,"last_played":1483820012},"language":"english","review":"Worth it.

It's universal praise is well-deserved, it's appeal spans across different ages and demographics. The game has the best difficulty curve I've ever experienced.\n\nIt's never dull, it's never obvious, and I feel satisfied and happy with myself whenever I completed a level.\nIt's also never too hard, it's intuitive enough that whether you look at it and think about it for a while or just dive in head first trying to figure out a puzzle along the way it is possible to solve it in a relatively short amount of time.\n\nI haven't played through the whole multiplayer campaign, but I have beaten the singleplayer one.\n\nThe level design is top notch. It runs well. It's designed well. It looks great and it is superbly written.\n\nI have no idea how the game could've been made any better without having severe compromises.\n\nI highly reccomend it for everyone, it is one games I would show to someone to introduce them to gaming, to show them how great games can be.","timestamp_created":1504281618,"timestamp_updated":1504281618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5fyKn94CeKudhAE="}
