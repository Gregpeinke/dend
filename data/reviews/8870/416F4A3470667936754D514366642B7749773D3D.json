But y'know what, screw you, here's my review (hey a rhyme).\n\nIt's worth noting that this has no connection to the original two BioShock's with the exception of the title. The game makes it very clear that Rapture is in a different universe. This game takes place in 1912, in a ficticious city in the sky called Colombia. Colombia is one of the most beautifully crafted worlds of all time. Everything bursts with life the moment you take your first steps. I don't want to spoil too much about who leads the city though, as it is a major plot element. You play as Booker DeWitt, a mercernary set on finding a girl called Elizabeth, the daughter of the leader of Colombia. She has the special ability to open up \"Tears\" as they're referred to in the game. From there on, it's a bullet tempest as you fight your way through hordes of enemies with different guns...well ok not exactly different guns, but varied enough to keep the game interesting.\n\nYou are allowed only two gun slots in stead of the usual eight. Some people say this is a flaw in the gameplay, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't annoying at first. But you'll slowly get used to it. Much like the other BS's (lawl couldn't resist), you also have special abilities, called \"Vigors\" in this game, and they run on \"Salts.\" Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw of Zero Punctuation claimed that the Vigors aren't as intriguing as the Plasmids in BioShock 1 and 2, stating that the plasmids played a large part of the downfall of Rapture, whereas the vigors are just there. Again, I'd be lying if I said that wasn't true. The vigors are splendidly varied, each having different effects. \n\nI can't really think of anything negative to say about BioShock Infinite. The game is just so freakin' beautifiul, you MUST experience it on your own.\n\nFinal rating: 10/10","timestamp_created":1393700813,"timestamp_updated":1393700813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9307119","author":{"steamid":"76561198075667597","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":815,"last_played":1429059428},"language":"english","review":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0j0lO7uQBo\n","timestamp_created":1393697464,"timestamp_updated":1393697464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9306744","author":{"steamid":"76561198070125120","num_games_owned":269,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":361,"last_played":1466208010},"language":"brazilian","review":"Exelente jogo sem duvidas, não tem como se arrepender depois de compra-lo","timestamp_created":1393695464,"timestamp_updated":1393695464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9306596","author":{"steamid":"76561198020305626","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1089,"last_played":1637341059},"language":"english","review":"this game is amazing can't waite for 2nd dlc :D","timestamp_created":1393694825,"timestamp_updated":1393694825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9306194","author":{"steamid":"76561198101899580","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1615,"last_played":1406242268},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game, must have)","timestamp_created":1393692818,"timestamp_updated":1393692818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521897792816162109","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9305908","author":{"steamid":"76561198097537034","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1137,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1039,"last_played":1390618382},"language":"english","review":"Wow.

Les gunfights sont mous et chiants, on ne peut pas crever (via un systéme de respawn d'une artificialité assez marrante à la longue), la direction artistique est sympa cinq minutes avant de piger que ça ne va guère loin, les combats de boss sont mous et archaïques, les plasmides ou chai plus quoi servent quasiment à rien.

O tão amado e odiado game que é possivelmente a conclusão de Bioshock ou o início para uma variedade incrível de games da série (apesar da primeira hipótese ser mais provável, uma vez que a Irrational Games, produtora do mesmo, fechou as portas).\nPara entender melhor alguns aspectos que vou abordar aqui, recomendo ler minhas análises dos jogos anteriores da saga. E ao ler essa análise, recomendo ler ela até o final, pois contrário às outras, nessa eu falarei primeiro dos aspectos negativos pra poder sobrepor com os positivos.\n\nBio Infinite é um jogo que prometeu uma melhoria em absolutamente tudo o que Bioshock tinha, mas devo adiantar que não cumpriu com tudo o que disse ou até que gostaria de cumprir. Digo \"gostaria\", porque creio que foi um game altamente alterado durante sua produção, tanto que seu lançamento foi adiado duas vezes. Em meu trabalho eu vejo muito bem o quanto o \"dedo do cliente\" pode prejudicar a qualidade final de um trabalho as vezes e, infelizmente, com as proporções que Bioshock tomou, a \"dedada\" do cliente foi absurdamente maior. Vamos entender o porque disso com alguns contras do jogo:\nBio Infinite prometia o que os anteriores desenvolveram, só que melhor, portanto, uma história absurdamente mais foda, com questões morais mais complexas e personagens muito mais marcantes. Para realizar isso, eles entraram em méritos socioeconômicos e raciais, contando na cidade de Columbia, de forma resumida, um pouco do que é a história dos EUA, com todas as suas sujeiras possíveis. Então o jogo traria preconceito racial, disputas políticas violentas, revoltas da discrepância econômica entre ricos e pobres e muito mais! É uma baita promessa e também uma baita responsabilidade de por o rosto a tapa para os críticos de plantão. O problema é que envolvendo um orçamento tão alto para sua produção, o jogo foi sendo podado. As questões raciais e socioeconômicas foram sendo resumidas, personagens foram perdendo a importância, perdendo aparições ou até mesmo sendo cortados da história e o jogo teve de ser re-escrito várias e várias vezes.\nCom tantas alterações, o jogo deixa de explicar alguns pequenos pontos (contrário ao que era os anteriores, onde havia explicação pra praticamente tudo) e simplifica muitos pontos e até personagens a meras aparições. Personagens que eram para serem muito marcantes como os Boys of Silence, Fitzroy (a garota negra revolucionária) e até um dos personagens que era um dos carros-chefes do marketing do jogo e também ocupava o papel de novo Big Daddy que é o SongBird.\nO jogo continua com o esquema de coletar audiologs pra entender a história, mas melhorou bastante nisso porque agora a história acontece um pouco mais diante dos seus olhos ou em conversas com a Elizabeth, o que somado a mais tiroteios tornou a coisa mais dinâmica.\n\nDito tudo isso, quero que você pense se você consegue sentir o quanto esse jogo foi pressionado para mudar e infelizmente o quanto ele perdeu com essas mudanças, mas mesmo assim, o jogo tem seus aspectos positivos e não são poucos, tanto que eu me apaixonei por ele!\n\nCom gráficos absurdamente lindos, efeitos fantásticos e uma direção de arte impecável, você vai literalmente até as nuvens conhecer Columbia. A ambientação é absurda e a forma como você acompanha as mudanças pelo qual o local passa, desde sua estrondosa beleza como um paraíso à destruição e decadência causada por seus conflitos, tudo isso acontecendo progressivamente diante de seus olhos é algo de cair o queixo.\nA história de Columbia tem sua explicação derivada das explicações dos primeiros jogos da série, mas de uma forma um pouco diferente e que envolve o que você vai vivenciar ao longo do jogo, incluindo os plots dramáticos que são em uma área que eu acho beeem legal e que me agradou muito!\nTais plots e todas as questões de Infinite envolvem a Elizabeth, então, prepare-se para um desenvolvimento emocional bem maior que no segundo Bio com esta que, para mim, passou a ser uma das personagens mais marcantes dos games.\nO porque de tudo sobre ela, a cidade e o protagonista é algo simples e complexo ao mesmo tempo, o que acho muito legal, pois te deixa pensando e ao terminar esse jogo eu pensei bastante sobre os detalhes, tanto que (talvez em uma segunda jogada pela campanha) da gosto depois em reparar nas coisas que passaram despercebidas. Ao entender melhor esses detalhes, você passa a compreender cada vez mais os sentimentos dela. E cara, é difícil ver personagem de game que demonstre sentimentos tão bem quanto ela! O que faltou de desenvolvimento em outros personagens foi absurdamente compensado nela! Ela te acompanha interagindo de forma positiva em tudo, seja nas batalhas ou na busca por itens, ela vai conversando com você, te contando a história (então agora você não vive a história apenas por gravações, mas também por ela e as coisas que acontecem conforme você anda com ela) e sempre reagindo às suas ações, podendo ficar feliz com você, triste, irritada e por ai vai.\nA forma como ela transmite as coisas e cria o desenrolar da história é algo mais do que admirável!\nE o final com ela é como eu disse antes; simples e complexo, de uma forma muito boa, que te faz pensar e arrepia na emoção, principalmente transmitida por ela!\n\nNum geral é um bom jogo de tiro, com ambientação linda, gráficos lindos, história boa, ação melhor que os anteriores e uma personagem absurdamente incrível que em sua simplicidade de garotinha meiga consegue ser tão marcante e humana como nunca visto antes nos Bioshocks (ou em tantos outros jogos)!\nÉ uma pena que o jogo tenha sido tão podado, o que é nítido pelas promessas dos produtores, que eram possíveis de se cumprir e não foram por causa de tantas alterações visíveis em seu desenvolvimento. Mas ainda assim, é um jogo que eu recomendo muito! Pode ser que pessoas que gostaram dos anteriores não gostem desse, pois é um jogo diferente (estilo, história e tudo mais) e vice-versa, mas num geral, se desconsiderar as promessas e curtir o jogo pelo que ele é como resultado final, pra mim é um jogo épico e que só não foi perfeito porque sofreu com alguns males comuns em grandes empresas!","timestamp_created":1393622736,"timestamp_updated":1393622736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502033412456512451","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9295605","author":{"steamid":"76561198120271289","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":658,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":649,"last_played":1411857160},"language":"english","review":"Its a great game omg","timestamp_created":1393621164,"timestamp_updated":1393621164,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9295529","author":{"steamid":"76561198004035939","num_games_owned":1127,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":678,"last_played":1453029065},"language":"koreana","review":"엄청난 게임이다!!","timestamp_created":1393620635,"timestamp_updated":1393620635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9295443","author":{"steamid":"76561198044287240","num_games_owned":217,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1041,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":828,"last_played":1419198849},"language":"french","review":"Excellent jeu !
