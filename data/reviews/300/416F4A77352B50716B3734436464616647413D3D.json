HDR特效，能使玩家身临其境，彻底体会游戏的乐趣并感悟战争对人类的摧残，让人们为了全人类的和平，时刻不能忘记二战的历史。\nDoD和CS的区别在于，游戏脱离了目前火爆的反恐题材，取而代之是第二次世界大战背景。玩家将扮演盟军和德军中的一名士兵，使用自己独有的技能与武器，在争夺区域、守卫海滩等多种玩法模式中，从各个角度去感受战场的残酷和生命的宝贵。每个地图都力求给玩家带来真实感，宏大的室内战场，飞机震耳欲聋的轰炸，满目的残墙断壁，敌人临死前的叫喊，仿佛我们真正置身于60年前的世界大战中。在作战方面，DoD和CS有着截然不同的规则，DoD注重的不只是团队配合精神，更重要的是地形的选择以及勇敢的牺牲精神。这样的设计使得双方进攻和防守都是平等的，不会再出现CS中因地形而导致双方不齐。任何违背DoD规则的玩家，只能用鲜血来证明自己的错误。放眼望去，DoD的出现对于《半条命》发展有着深远的影响，也再次为MOD树下了一块坚实的里程碑，它让我们学会了勇敢、果断、机智与团队合作。如果你想挑战自己，就请戴上钢盔，拿起步枪，随我一起上战场吧！\nDoD的地图普遍要比CS所带的地图要大很多。场景力求真实，每一个窗户后面都可能隐藏着敌人的狙击手，在某个拐角处你都可能和敌人遭遇。总的来说大部分地图对德军比较有利（最明显的是诺曼底登陆地图），其实大家都很认可这种设计，二战中的每一场战役对盟军来说都是艰苦卓绝的战斗，胜利之日本身就是来之不易的。\nDoD现在在很多城市大有流行的趋势，很多CS玩家纷纷转业投入了DoD的阵营，并且涌现出了很多战队，像国内最早的一支DoD战队[RED'CHINA]*战队、台湾省的GFF战队和STW战队等，大家为了一个共同的爱好走到了一起交流切磋。如果你已厌烦了警匪枪战的小场景，想体验战争的真正感受，就和我们一起拿起汤姆逊去迎接胜利之日的到来吧！\n为了胜利的那一天奋勇前进！！！！","timestamp_created":1382455693,"timestamp_updated":1388510045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5177956223487854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7429926","author":{"steamid":"76561197962810502","num_games_owned":433,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1003,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1003,"last_played":1381368093},"language":"english","review":"The

gameplay isn't for everyone, but once you get into it the actual game can be quite rewarding. It feels like TF2 + CSS + WW2 setting = DoD Source. There's classes and it requires team work but unlike TF2 there is skill in aiming and shooting and there's lots of recoil. The gameplay can be addicting, but it's nothing special, though. Personally I prefer this to CSS. The movement and controls feel more smooth, and the recoil is massively exaggerated for better balancing. Each gun feels VERY different so picking the right class at the right time can make the difference between victory and loss.I mostly played custom \"orange\" maps for more gun on gun action because the standard maps do suck (apart from dod_avalanche).
