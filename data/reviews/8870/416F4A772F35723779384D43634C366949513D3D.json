Hang on - we are alike! \n\nDidn't we pass each other at the near end of the game when you went into your own lighthouse in the middle of the sea ala Bioshock? I was trying to come towards you and say hello but Elizabeth was forging another path for me.\n\nOr maybe we did not meet. Because you died - or maybe I died - maybe I finished the adventure you could not because you ran out of ammo. Maybe you took on the baton after I dropped it in the mental asylum having not concentrated at all on melee combat and paid a heavy price.\n\nIf you are anything like me - you would be a father, perhaps have children - this game is perfect for you, perfect .\n\nI was going to write a partly negative review of this one - but I waited until I completed the game and have changed my mind a bit.\n\nThis game is an average shooter - but amazing, incredible gaming experience.\n\nFirstly - let me say I have played System Shock, still have my System Shock 2 CDs and also played Bioshock 1 and 2.\n\nMy biggest regret about this franchise is how it has been moving from FPS/RPG hybrid adventure type to pure FPS . Having said that - the shooter aspect has never been one of its strengths, okay by my standards, but really they have been about storytelling, imagination, creating worlds, the experience.\n\nBioshock Infinite has dumbed down a bit - probably to accommodate the console crowd - Consolisation is happening, below is partly why:\n\nI did not like you could only carry two weapons, could only scroll through two rigours, could only have ONE save at a time?\n\nSay if my son wanted to play the game as well - he might have played on an easier mode - his saved game would have wiped out mine - now come on - what is the point of that?\n\nI found the keyboard layout a nightmare and would have liked the melee option a bit easier to use. Press V to hit with a weapon? What a daft choice!\n\nI found the use of rigours difficult - often the game would have to remind me to use them - I could have gone most of the game without them. The game interface did not help - often I could not find the right vigour for the situation. Why not tab, choose vigour option?\n\nI have never really liked the way the designers hide a lot of the backstory with the audio logs - this should be improved in future games -\n\nPlus - if you moved from the spot once turning one of these machines on - often you missed what was being said due to some other game words/text cutting through it - I would have liked to have the option to read the text on the machines. Can you press tab/ escape and read the logs all over again? Why not?\n\nIt means after you played the game you need to go across the internet to find out what the hell was happening - otherwise the game can come across as lame and boring, a standard shooter, actually not even that.\n\nThe using of tears (to another dimension) facility was a bit useless, Singularity did it better - and that is not saying much. It seems the designers found it quite hard to incorporate that part of the game properly. They mostly felt contrived and enforced onto the gamer.\n\nA lot more negatives by the way - don't get me started on the pants and hats and little missions to find a key to open a chest. More and more besides that...\n\nNow that stuff is out of the way - the game ended up being AMAZING, probably the most effective gaming EXPERIENCE I have ever had.\n\nThe Elizabeth character - wow - completely amazing - you meet her about a quarter way in - do the whole \"I'm here to rescue you\" and most of the remaining game is in her company. I must say the designers found a winning formula here - totally brilliant. When you lose her at a key moment and try and go back and save her - can't describe how I felt - but it did feel very personal and ominous - genuinely like you did not want to let her down - genuinely concerned - she was just not another game character - the designers got that spot on. Due to the relationship build up with her beforehand, when you lose her and fail, yes, YOU FAIL, it feels quite real actually, Had a lump in my front and part of that was not knowing what the hell was going on..\n\nThe relationship between your character and Elizabeth IS THE GAME, give it time, don't give up on it - the rewards come late on but will totally thrill you, haunt you and question the nature of all games.\n\nThe shooter bit - this one was a bit unusual in that sometimes I could not get my bearings and find out where the shots were coming from. I thought this was a bit naff - but I am going to give the designers a bit of credit here - that was probably because your opponents could be in front, behind, above, below, to the left, to the right etc. Enemies could stand on flying ships that are above, below, left, to the right (you get the picture). The City in the Clouds combat was okay actually - will be interesting to see if anyone else comes and does it better.\n\nThe graphics - simply gorgeous at key points, especially at the beginning when you enter a bright and colourful city in the clouds -  and then some other amazing graphic moments. No one creates a graphics style better - totally original and believable.\n\nSo, if you are anything like me - games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind and Daggerfall are the best games you ever played. System Shock 2 comes quite high on your list. Deep down, you know games will never be like that again - it's all about the graphics. Story telling either created by you or set by a games design are mostly too complicated to produce.\n\nSo, if you are anything like me, you will immensely enjoy this unique gaming experience and afterwards wish you had someone to talk to about your feelings and thoughts about it. Thanks for taking on the baton after I fell.\n","timestamp_created":1389993698,"timestamp_updated":1389993698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516582965850830078","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8744358","author":{"steamid":"76561198119526832","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":5712,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2055,"last_played":1477973944},"language":"english","review":"Absolute best game of all time.

Or is it?\nThe game is set in the year 1912.  Booker Dewitt accepts a job to travel to Columbia, a city suspended in the air, in order to retrieve a girl (Elizabeth) and wipe away his \"debts\".  I don't know how much else I can say without spoiling some bits, so I'll just get right into the review.\nYou see, Inifinite not only has a different setting.  It's very, very different to the first two games, in fact.  So different to the point where one could easily say that it's just a game that only has a different, original setting (as well as some lovely throwback references to the series) in common with it's franchise.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and find it to be a great addition.\nThe game itself is fantastic.  The story was good, combat was quite good, the setting was fantastic and I found myself enjoying the characters (Elizabeth, The Lutece Twins and Songbird were probably my favourites.  Yes, even Songbird).\nOne who tries to play this game as if it were the original BioShock (or the second) will not do too well.  This game is more of an open-ish world shooter with large areas to move around while in combat.  As well as this, the player can utilize Columbia's transport system (Sky-Lines, metal lines that one can traverse with a grappeling hook) to fight foes and move around the city.  It's a cool feature in general.\nWhen watching the game be played, the main fear I had was that Elizabeth would be constantly forced as a character I desperately needed to care about.  While this is true in some respects, I didn't neccesarily find her overbearing.  In fact, I began to enjoy her company as well as the character throughout the game.  That being said, though, she definitely isn't a companion; more of a follower.\nOne thing to note is that you can no longer carry more than two weapons.  Apparently the downloadable-content \"Burial at Sea\" allows this once again as the player returns to the city of Rapture but since this is about the main game I'll just say it's a bit of a letdown.  I'm not thrilled that the change was made, but it's not something I believe you should focus on.\nAnother thing to note is that the little \"boss\" characters that the character finds throughout the game aren't utilized very well.  I find that they're nowhere near as memorable as the Big Daddy characters that the player encounters in the first game.  It's a letdown indeed.  That brings me onto another topic; Plasmids.  Plasmids, or \"Vigors\" as they are now called, just aren't as memorable as the ones you encounter in Rapture.  On top of that, I only found myself using two or three of them on a regular basis compared to the first two games where I would use a wide variety.\nTo sum it up, this is a good game that should keep you occupied.  If you're one who likes to play through games multiple times once you get it I'm sure this could keep you entertained for a while.  That being said, I still can't overcome my biased attitude towards the first game in the series and would definitely reccommend that, if you're willing to pay for this game, you at least consider getting the first one as well.\n\n","timestamp_created":1389948975,"timestamp_updated":1389948975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553691267967224121","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8737783","author":{"steamid":"76561198005806303","num_games_owned":237,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":1699,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1014,"last_played":1542141306},"language":"russian","review":"Великолепная игра.

Enemy AI was hit-or-miss; on a few occasions I'd hear combat music playing before even being aware that there were enemies around, and also sometimes would continue to hear it after the fight was assumed over, only to find that there was a random dude standing behind a building in cover doing nothing.

Bioshock 1 didn't make the mistake of focusing the game on the story, the story was just a very good addition to the solid gameplay. Infinite decides to focus more on its story, and the gameplay falls behind previous games in the series. Plasmids aren't varied (to the point of being reskins of each other), and the survival-horror style of gameplay in the original Bioshock is completely stripped from this game in favour of generic 'shoot lots at bullet sponges'.\n\nThere's nothing special about the gameplay of this game. There's the occasional excuse of a puzzle a 4 year old could solve, the combat is generic and there's none of the appealing elements from earlier instalments of the series. So we'll forget about that and look at what the game sells itself on; story and characters. Rather than focusing on key points, it kind of just wanders over an array of ideas without delving into any of them. At times the story is just completely stupid. For example, a group of rebels who look up to you unexplainable try to kill you without a second thought. This is without even mentioning the exposition of the game, but I'll get to that later. The characters aren't nearly as bad as the story, but they're not very 3 dimensional either. Elizabeth is obviously THE selling point of the game and she's quite likable, and they obviously spent a lot of time making her seem less like a typical NPC. However, she doesn't seem to stand by her ideas. She has a go at you for killing someone early on in the game, then proceeds to watch you murder 100's of others without even so much as a frown. Well, it might have gotten annoying if she kept nagging at you. The rest of the cast are really forgettable, or completely misused. Songbird comes to mind here. What a great boss this could have been, but instead it's just used as a plot device, again as an ally in a terrible fight, and then disposed of. A complete waste of an otherwise interesting design. The Twins were the only other memorable characters due to their quirky and entertaining behaviour. \n\nOkay, the ending. It was stupid, pretentious, and pointless. Yes, if you actually understand the nonsense they dump on you at the end, then you will see how pointless it is. Warning, SPOILERS AHEAD. If there are an infinite number of worlds, then Booker has (according to the story) to die in all of them. This simply wouldn’t happen, there will be at least one reality where booker doesn't die, and therefore the supposed reason behind your death is completely void. \n\nBuy it on sale if you wish, but if you were a fan of the original expect to be disappointed. The other reviewers who are praising the writing and story probably haven't read a book in their lifetimes.","timestamp_created":1389903292,"timestamp_updated":1389903813,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8731679","author":{"steamid":"76561198010398764","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":51,"playtime_forever":27,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27,"last_played":1390060466},"language":"english","review":"Played and finished the non-steam version of this game, artworks and storyline is beautiful.","timestamp_created":1389902690,"timestamp_updated":1389902690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8731447","author":{"steamid":"76561198057573131","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":2118,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1545,"last_played":1565198014},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever!

It really feels like the devs worked hard to not let the combat get in the way of the story. That being said, some scenes merge storytelling, sets, and action in a 100% perfect mix.\n\nBy now, you've heard about the story, and it's as high-concept and ambitious as you can possibly dream. Even if you've heard about a twist towards the end, this game is loaded with moments that I NEVER saw coming, and characters that made left me involved. That's good, because nothing in this game exists for a non-setting/story purpose. All of the areas, events, and nearby people are activated as you come by. Save for a few moments, you propel the actual events around you: this is why it really feels like a play, but it's a damn good play. \n\nHere's a game that, possibly even moreso than its predecessors, is truly ambitious enough to try and exist in its own category, and largely succeeds. It's a mix of so many things, expertly combined, that reading about it is not at all the same as really playing it.

It has received a lot of critical acclaim for its story and technical quality. I have to admit that the technical quality is up to today's standards: Graphically, the game looks good and it is up to the standards of the release date. A lot of imagination has been used to create the environment. I didn't notice any bugs or glitches during my playthrough either.\n\nHowever, these qualities don't help with the fact that there are many things done wrong in this game and that the game lacks heart. I generally felt that the gameplay wasn't fun. It was highly repetitive just like in Half-Life 2 and that makes the game burdensome to play. It is a heavily scripted and linear tube run where everybody (apart from Elizabeth) wants to kill you. There isn't much meaningful character interaction with NPC's and there really isn't freedom of choice in the game. Character development is very shallow in comparision against almost any first-person RPG. The firefights are tedious with weapons being unimaginative, vigors feeling weak and enemies being forgettable. The themes about religion, race and segregation were ever-present but they were treated superficially. The environment is well-built but doesn't provide a feeling of being there. Instead, it feels like playing human characters in a pseudo-realistic cartoon world with spells and effects flying around that don't fit the theme and setting. The soundtrack is your typical boring wannabe movie symphonic orchestra crap that can be found in too many contemporary high-budget titles. The game is quite short as well: as per Steam, finishing the game took 8 hours for me using normal difficulty. During my playthrough I really didn't get sucked in to the story. Overall, the game felt more like playing an interactive movie than playing a computer game. It doesn't have enough variation in its events to have replaying value.\n\nSomebody would probably ask that what kind of games one has to play to have his taste spoiled so bad that this game feels inadequate? In my case: System Shock 1&2, entire S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, entire Mass Effect series, Deus Ex (and many of its big mods), Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Star Wars KOTOR all do the story and atmosphere driven adventure with character development better than Bioshock Infinite. Some of those games have their technical glitches but those don't ruin the overall experience. System Shocks have absolutely unforgettable main antagonist and the games recreate the feeling of being all alone well. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. excels with its postapocalyptic atmosphere, dangerous environment and fearsome moments. Mass Effect series and KOTOR have numerous interesting characters to interact with and the games in general make you feel like being part of something larger than life. Deus Ex, its fan-made mods and DX: HR are great for their freedom of choice, the rewarding feeling provided by emergent approaches to problem-solving and highly original and atmospheric soundtracker-created musical scores (DX1). Bioshock Infinite doesn't have any redeeming quality of this kind.\n\nMy advice is to not buy this game unless it's heavily discounted and after that only, if you wish to play it for the story. There really isn't that much content worth playing through.","timestamp_created":1389826254,"timestamp_updated":1389826618,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464756011962890625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8721752","author":{"steamid":"76561198077957754","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1477527113},"language":"english","review":"My brain hurts","timestamp_created":1389825754,"timestamp_updated":1389825754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8721751","author":{"steamid":"76561198072638105","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":694,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":270,"last_played":1465581091},"language":"english","review":"Best game ever 10/10 xD","timestamp_created":1389825749,"timestamp_updated":1389825749,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8721645","author":{"steamid":"76561197964852949","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1453493661},"language":"swedish","review":"bra","timestamp_created":1389825027,"timestamp_updated":1389825027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8721376","author":{"steamid":"76561198104480827","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":888,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":717,"last_played":1395483887},"language":"english","review":"BioShock Infinite is AWESOME\n","timestamp_created":1389823318,"timestamp_updated":1389823318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/5r7y8MCcL6iIQ=="}
