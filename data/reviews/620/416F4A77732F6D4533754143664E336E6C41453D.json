It has the same charisma and enjoyment of Portal 1, but thrown to the extreme. It's unfair to compare P1 with P2 due to the big time frame between them, but P2 just makes P1 look like a demo.\nNot saying that Portal 1 is bad, I still love that game a lot, but you get the idea.\nP2 is way longer, so maybe if your idea is to finish the game quickly, than maybe P1 is better for you.\nPortal 2 not only has a way better campaign, mechanics and graphics, but it also has multiplayer, a level editor and support to the Steam Workshop so you can publish your levels or play custom levels made by the community.\n\nIf you never played Portal 1 before and you’re looking for the best experience, I would recommend you to play it in order, so the first one first, and then the second. Knowing Portal 1 really makes P2 a better experience. I had played P2 on my X-Box 360 before Portal 1, and let me just say, after buying P1 and then playing P2 again, it really makes some things make a lot of sense and brings in some new feelings of nostalgia and charisma. If you want to play Portal 2 before the first one, go ahead, but I wouldn't recommend that.\n\nIf you have played P2 before, be it on a console, or in a friend's house, and you’re not sure if it’s worth buying it and play it again, I can guarantee you that it is. I had the same question in the past, I had P2 on my X-Box 360 but wanted to see the PC experience. I bought it and did not regret it at all.\nLet me just say, I have finished this game three to four times already, and the fun never drained out. Not only that, but the controls and the multiplayer on the PC feels a lot more fluid. The console version also lacks the level editor and Steam Workshop compatibility, which is a big part of the experience.\nLevels can also be made with the hammer editor, which I have no clue how to use it at all, but some people do it, and their levels are amongst the best.\n\nIn general, another thing that makes this game stand out are the characters. GLaDOS is better than ever, Wheatley is a cute and funny little guy, Cave Johnson brings his serious attitude but playful substyle to his lines, and Chell is mute… Like always…\nYou can unfold secrets and make your own theories for this game, the plot really has many twists and interesting moments…\n\nSo yeah, of course, this is amongst my favorite games ever, and saying I “recommend” it is understating.\n\n","timestamp_created":1515026383,"timestamp_updated":1606844944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39031289","author":{"steamid":"76561198372103675","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":502,"last_played":1601663223},"language":"english","review":"FANTASTIC.
