Gracias a eso, creo un vortice interdimensional de la hostia que provocaba que la gente comprase productos de limpieza del Corte ingles. El juego tiene la colaboracion especial de algunos actores famosos, como son Bruce Lee (Que hace de Chino Cudeiro), Willyrex (Que hace de Miñoneti que sale en varias escenas con helicopteros pilotados por una patata rosa) y algun que otra pulga que encontramos en los huevos de Leo-NARDO Dicaprio. Al final la historia acaba con un romance entre uno de los HeadCrabs (Cangrejos pinchones) con uno de los cientificos, lo que hace que se apareen hasta el fin de los dias creando un colapso interdimensional entre los 2 mundos, el de los politicos con paraisos fiscales y el mundo de los hongos. Gracias a ello el protagonista Gordo Freeman consigue parar los pies a los moicanos del bosque que intentaban tomar el control de Madrid, sometiendo asi al hombre blanco y azul que gobernaban aquellas tierras por esos tiempos. Al final del juego podemos presenciar una gran escena erotica Willyrex y un niño rata que desemboca en una pelea por el control de Albulquerque, en la que finalmente gana un panadero que pasaba por alli, ya que uso su habilidad especial de meter una barra de pan en el congelador, y luego partirle la crisma a su enemigo con ella.\nDespues de los creditos podemos apreciar una gran cinematica en la que el Jefe Maestro, tambien llamado Tomas Turbado, primo de Jorge Nitales y hermano segundo de Elena Nito Del bosque se come un yogurt sin echarle azucar antes, una hazaña que pocos han logrado sin poner la cara que pone el Fary al chupar un limon. \n\nOpiniones de algunas revistas\n--------------------------------\n\nGaymers 4 ever: Preferiria jugar al teto antes que jugar a esta basura :3 \n\nGamesconketchup: Lo he probado con Oculus Rift, y la verdad esque me ha parecido una autentica pasada el realismo de los escrotos\n\nGamesForRatkids: Te voy a dar dislike a todos tus mapas!\n\nCanisGaming: Ill0 ShURrA, HeTo K eh","timestamp_created":1407433626,"timestamp_updated":1407433626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11589590","author":{"steamid":"76561198147607351","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":14434,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1795,"last_played":1484602493},"language":"english","review":"The Reason I downloaded Steam","timestamp_created":1407427695,"timestamp_updated":1407427695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551950275897979736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11587872","author":{"steamid":"76561198058801889","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4602,"playtime_last_two_weeks":32,"playtime_at_review":3149,"last_played":1659728949},"language":"english","review":"best game ever played !","timestamp_created":1407417695,"timestamp_updated":1407417695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11587465","author":{"steamid":"76561197964277989","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":35947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":30809,"last_played":1526598969},"language":"english","review":"Game built on an old platform however it is an addicting favorite to play.

Some dislike its graphics, others criticize its seemingly repetitive and redundant gameplay. But to those who have devoted at least a few hours in this game will understand that Killing Floor is not just some zombie FPS game. It is a game that defines what teamwork should be, in my opinion, especially in FPS games. This game is the best way to learn teamwork, tactics, and decision-making for when to stay and fight, and when to hit and run. The main theme of the game is teamwork, and it's not just working as a team. You have to learn to work together, understand each other, protect and fight for each other. If you don't help each other out in this game, you're gonna be another corpse on the road ingame.\n\nAlso the British accents.
