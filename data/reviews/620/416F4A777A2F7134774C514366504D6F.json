If you ever played the first game, then you will find P2 an improved and expanded version of first game. Graphics is better than in Portal, sounds and music are equally good. I don't know how, but they managed to deliver even better voiceacting.  Puzzles are awesome - new machanics add more variety and even more fun - puzzles are more complex now. Again the base game is simple, yet very entertaining, at first confusing (if you never touched the first game), but once you get a grasp of how things work you will lose track of time you spent playing it. If you never played it you will be surprised. This game has no challenges (like the first one), but it comes with coop mode! It's not harder than story puzzles, but definitely requires coordination with your partner. Coop is awesome! Second Portal is an excellent example of a game evolving into a better version. If you like solving puzzles, then it is a must have.\n\nP2 comes with Puzzle Maker - an internal map editor that allows to create your own maps. The editor is simple and very intuitive. You can start building own maps in a matter of few minutes after launching it. You want to play user maps? You will need time - at the time of writing the review there were 350 000 (yes three hundred and fifty thousand user created maps) in the workshop. You can use tags to search maps with desired elements. User created map can be really difficult, but that's where beauty is - base game is accessible for everyone, but Portal veterans can test their skills on other maps. Don't worry - there are easier maps as well.\nMonster of a game.
