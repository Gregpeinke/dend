Bring the young woman Elizabeth from Columbia to New York. Well, what can I say. It won't be that easy after all.\n\n[b]At this point I would dare to say that the game, for a shooter, has an extraordinary and good story.[/b]\n\nColumbia, the cloud city, is not as expected or suspected, the underwater rapture that floats. Columbia is not a city to explore like Rapture and serves more as a backdrop, but a really impressive and breathtaking atmosphere with a lot of life and a gripping history.\nThe game's shooter elements are just as good and just plain fun from start to finish. It is by no means easy and I would also clearly say that if you play the game at the hardest level, then it is even more fun. I immediately dedicated myself to the unlockable 1999 mode because I just wanted to know.\n\nThis level of difficulty makes the game more of a \"stealth game\" in the Wolfenstein sense, but I think this has immense advantages.\nFor one, it's a completely different experience and you don't just have to be careful not to die. As a result, you don't simply \"run\" through the different levels, because the game absolutely doesn't deserve that, but you automatically have enough time to collect all the collectibles and to complete the (unfortunately) few optional side missions. \n\nCarrying \"only\" two weapons at the same time and the continuing shortage of ammunition does not make it any easier. For this you have up to eight forces (vigors) that support you in the fight and prove to be more than just practical.\n\n[b]I enjoyed the game a lot, but there will be some who don't share my opinion, because the game leaves some questions unanswered and much to be desired. In the sense of \"Lost\" it is either a \"WTF just happened here\" or a \"WOW\"[/b]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]MY PROS AND CONS:[/b]\n\n✅ unique atmosphere\n✅ great story\n✅ cool level design\n✅ FoV slider\n✅ emotional\n\n❌ partially lifeless game world\n❌ few challenges or puzzles\n❌ boring weapon upgrade system\n\n[hr][/hr][b]PLAYED WITH: ⌨️ 🖱 🎧[/b]\n[hr][/hr]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/][b] ⮩ CHECK OUT ALL OF MY REVIEWS [/b][/url]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[url]https://store.steampowered.com/app/8870/BioShock_Infinite/[/url]","timestamp_created":1633527234,"timestamp_updated":1651756817,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653179168701171875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100613550","author":{"steamid":"76561198997340696","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":1049,"playtime_last_two_weeks":28,"playtime_at_review":475,"last_played":1659416731},"language":"russian","review":"5/10 у игры хороша атмосфера, а вот сама игра сраный тир.... а и все фаны инфинитифа - дрочеры элизаБЭдДДдД","timestamp_created":1633524254,"timestamp_updated":1657338239,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.429009169340133667","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100611983","author":{"steamid":"76561199006624876","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1813,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1453,"last_played":1635002226},"language":"english","review":"good game\n\nthat's it, that's the review","timestamp_created":1633522529,"timestamp_updated":1633522529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100607946","author":{"steamid":"76561197982704248","num_games_owned":471,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":28,"last_played":1633957428},"language":"english","review":"The way a FPS Shooter should be.\n\nThis is how they use to make em boys. ;)","timestamp_created":1633518055,"timestamp_updated":1633518055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100598020","author":{"steamid":"76561198333553768","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":581,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":581,"last_played":1629362476},"language":"english","review":"Very good game, storyline is very good, gunplay is also good but you get bored with guns pretty slow","timestamp_created":1633501799,"timestamp_updated":1633501799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100597527","author":{"steamid":"76561198857758089","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":435,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":435,"last_played":1633500880},"language":"schinese","review":"我 两者皆是","timestamp_created":1633500914,"timestamp_updated":1633500914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100595681","author":{"steamid":"76561198356813954","num_games_owned":307,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":3608,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3484,"last_played":1634797546},"language":"english","review":"This game is a masterful blend of FPS gameplay with phenomenal story telling!

Иногда бывает то что ты во временных петлях путаешься, тоисть куда нашего главного героя перекинуло(или это мои затупки). Персонажи интересны, интересно их прошлое и их мотивы... любимчиков вы себе точно найдёте))) \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2616450311\n\n[i]Ох уж эти перестрелки... [/i]\n\nНу что ж, стрельба тут приятна, все как всегда красиво выглядит и пухкает, и перезаряжается... Арсенал не прям что огромный, но выбрать есть что, так как игра разрешает с собой брать только 2 пукалки, но у нас есть плаз... энергетики со сверхсилами их всего 8 и каждые из них по своему уникальны и ситуативны. Именно ситуативны, так как я за свое прохождение использовал только 3-4 от силы. И как же без прокачки, прокачивать мы можем не только сверх-умения, но и пушки, там быструю перезарядку или побольше урона. Например, \"Отражатель\" мне сильно помог в файте с боссом, \"Шок-Жокей\" очень хорошо помогает с мини-боссами которые не дадут вам заскучать и хорошо бронированными противниками... а потом это разбирать прокаченной пукалкой. НО, я забыл упомянуть что динамика здесь бешеная, так как у нас есть компаньон Элизабет которая, во время подкинет патронов на твою пушку, то соли подкинет или аптеку, то иллюзию сделает которая будет не только помогать отстреливать тебе врагов, но ещё и восполнять запас патронов, здоровья или соли, ну или вскроет замок... Кароче, не компаньон, а МЕЧТА))). \n\n[i]Ничё се технологии... Город летает... [/i]\n\nВоздушная Колумбия получилась красивой и запоминающейся, вообщем получилось красочно. Локации меняются с города на фабрику или на дерижабль... разгуляться есть где) Продвигаясь от пестрой, революционной и воздушной Колумбии вглубь к лиричному, промозглому и тусклому Восторгу, они впитают историю как есть, без остатка.... \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2613626497\n\nЗнаю, обзор вышел коротким, так как игра сама по себе длинная и прохождение самой игры, самого основного сюжета занимает 10-12 часов, иногда мне хотелось её дропнуть именно на средине, так как игра не кидала новых противников, а сюжет топтался на месте. И знаете... игру я все равно советую хотя бы разок пройти, так как своим геймплеем и интересным сюжетом она точно вам понравится...

One way to go, no stealth, speed around and shoot everything to win. The 2 weapon system is also kind of nonsense, I think I would have been far more comfortable with 3. Annoying, but you can live with it.\n\nStory: I like it, and I think it makes sense, but some don't. For those who think it makes sense and isn't pure nonsense, you'll probably enjoy the ending twist. It's an insane enough revelation you'll likely be dumbstruck for a while. Think about it while credits are rolling, cause there's a post credit scene you shouldn't miss.\n\nAtmosphere: Very different from Bioshock. I liked it more than Rapture, because Rapture was a dead city, its best day behind it. Columbia is alive, and that makes it far more interesting to me. It doesn't have that same spooky atmosphere Bioshock did though. Also, the propaganda videos and vending machine voicelines were copied over, but they're far less natural and look worse. Well I supposed Columbia was on 1920 tech and Bioshock was on 1960 tech so that's the reason.\n\nVisuals: One issue: The female nps in the beginning share the same unnatural looking model. It might have been fine if it was the same for the male models, but there are multiple male models that all look natural, so the female models looking weird looks worse by comparison. Luckily the female models get better later, and Elizabeth looks fine. Though she doesn't look as good in game as in the game thumbnails on steam.\n\nOther than that, game is very pretty. 41GB storage required for a reason I guess.\n\nOverall: I recommend this game, BUT you shouldn't expect Bioshock out of it. It's so different it might as well be another genre in another franchise. The base game is entirely unconnected to the world of Bioshock. Might explain why I like this while not liking Bioshock (yeah, sue me)\n\nThe Burial at Seas DLCs are IMHO an abomination. The game was better off accepting that it was not Bioshock, and I think it was a mistake to try to link Rapture to Columbia.\n\n","timestamp_created":1633278273,"timestamp_updated":1633278273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"100446203","author":{"steamid":"76561198112170410","num_games_owned":358,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":724,"last_played":1633270093},"language":"turkish","review":"Bu oyunu ilk 2 Bioshock'un üstüne oynadığımda sıkılmıştım ve yarısında bırakmıştım. Oynanış olarak ilk oyunlar kadar tatmin edememişti. Hikaye olarak iyi olduğunu duymuştum ama ben oyun kısmına daha çok önem veriyordum, o yüzden hikaye kısmına çok odaklanmamıştım. Ancak oyunu da makinemden silmemiştim belki bir gün dönüp oynarım diye. İşte o gün nihayet dün geldi ve bugünde oyunu bitirmiş bulunmaktayım. Ne oynasam diye bakınırken içimde ukde kalan bu oyunu oynamaya karar verdim. Bu sefer kendimi hikayeye verecektim, bütün ses kayıtlarını dinleyip her odayı gezecektim. Gerçekten de 3-4 saat başından kalkamadım bu şekilde oynayınca. Oyunun aksiyonundan da keyif almaya başlamıştım, hikaye de merak unsurunu hep diri tutuyordu. Oyunu bitirdiğimde gerçekten daha önce yarıda bırakmamın bir hata olduğunu net olarak anlamıştım. Belki de doğru zaman buydu, o zaman sıkıla sıkıla bitirsem bu kadar keyif alamayabilirdim. En nihayetinde bu oyun, oynadığım en iyi hikayeli oyunlar listemde tepelerde yerini almayı başardı. \n\nÖzetle oyunu değerlendirecek olursak, grafikler günümüzde dahi iyi, kendine has bir grafik tarzı var. Atmosfer olarak başarılı, oyun insanı havaya sokuyor. Oynanış ilk oyunlara göre basitleştirilmiş, daha casual oyuncuya hitap eder hale gelmiş, ancak kötü değil, silahların hissiyatı başarılı. Aksiyonu keyifli, silah ve özel güç çeşitliliği yeterli düzeyde 10 saatlik bir oyun için. Oyunun sivrilen noktası ise hikayesi.
