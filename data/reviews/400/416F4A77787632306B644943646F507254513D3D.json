The game does an excellent job in explaining these mechanics, and it's very enjoyable through it's short campaign. There isn't much of a story, but GLaDOS is an iconic figure through the entire game. The game is also generally easy-medium. There's also 6 additional advanced chambers (medium-hard) and 18 challenges (hard-very hard). To complete these, you'll need to learn some tricks. But these are mainly for those who want to master this game, and it's a nice addition. But i easily recommend you to play the story, and in the end you'll want more, which Portal 2 delivers.","timestamp_created":1452678977,"timestamp_updated":1491246127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20500906","author":{"steamid":"76561198171161807","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":272,"last_played":1495944981},"language":"english","review":"I love it but that machine is psycho bruh she try to kill me like over 74 times but I say nope.

Nominee for Test of TIme Award 2016.\n\nExplaining how I feel about a game this good is a waste of time.  I can't imagine anyone into video games who has not heard of this game but has not played it on steam.  Still, I'm going to waste my time anyway.  It's pretty much the closest you can get to a perfect video game which is something I never thought I would ever say about anything I've played.\n\nWhat it is is simple - a first person puzzler using the Source engine and Havoc Physics where you solve one test chamber after another until you reach the end.  Puzzles use physics, blocks, falling and thrown objects, accelleration, and falling protagonists.  This is combined with a \"gun\" which can be used to create entry and exit portals where you can move around the levels and  move objects around to push switches, redirect lasers and pellets, or make turrets shoot each other.\n\nThe levels are intuitively designed, challanging, and fun to play.  The challange is not borne out of frustration, instead you have all the tools you need and the game delicately reminds of what you are capable of either through the design of the stages or through a word from the antagonist.  Each puzzle gives you skills which build from one to the next, training you until you are ready for the final puzzle and the final confrontation with the antagonist.  Every part is carefully and lovingly designed without making you feel dumb or frustrated, instead you will feel accomplishment and satisfaction from discovering each solution.\n\nThe story working in the background, the empty observation rooms above you, the places you find outside the testing chambers all paint a narrative.  The game does not dwell so much on the narrative or story to the detriment of gameplay.  You can speed past it without considering it, or go so far as to investigate stories, listen to radios, and understand the complicated mess leading up to the situation you find yourself in as you do or do not desire.\n\nThe pacing is perfect, the story doesn't take up too much time, the levels and test chambers present themselves, teach you what they need to and move on without sticking around for too long, becoming too much of a nusance, or so familiar they make you uninterested in finding out anything new.\n\nThis all builds up to a finale, one you anticipate in order to discover why you are here, who is testing you and where the cake is.  It takes you outside the test chambers in order to break the system you were trapped in, something you were waiting for for so long.  Finally, you meet your antagonist face to face, confront, and defeat her until you reach the satisfying conclusion to your journey.\n\nBeing well-paced, well-written, well-designed, and tightly developed so that it remains welcome without becoming boring this is one of the better if not perfect games you can end up playing.  That is just my opinion, but it is probably the correct one.","timestamp_created":1452550262,"timestamp_updated":1479938933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20476869","author":{"steamid":"76561198136626349","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":136,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":136,"last_played":1452550276},"language":"english","review":"Beat it in like an hour and a half with a piss poor story and some funny cake jokes only ran into 1 hard puzzle so youll have to get mods for it to have fun but for real this game isnt challenging for anyone with an iq of more than a potato.","timestamp_created":1452550246,"timestamp_updated":1452550246,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20475844","author":{"steamid":"76561198158922462","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":793,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":321,"last_played":1652320314},"language":"brazilian","review":"Muito bom, e a música dos créditos é incrível","timestamp_created":1452545998,"timestamp_updated":1452545998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20474132","author":{"steamid":"76561198058608935","num_games_owned":302,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":21,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":21,"last_played":1452527885},"language":"english","review":"I was upset at first because the game would freeze in about 2-3 seconds after launch, if you're encountering this bug, try running the game in compatibility mode for Windows xp SP3, that fixed it for me - as for the game I haven't played much but the puzzles I have so far have been interesting.","timestamp_created":1452539807,"timestamp_updated":1452539807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20473204","author":{"steamid":"76561198101119987","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1340,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1137,"last_played":1452356088},"language":"english","review":"Very Nice game !","timestamp_created":1452536783,"timestamp_updated":1452536783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20466828","author":{"steamid":"76561198175507334","num_games_owned":455,"num_reviews":87,"playtime_forever":131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":63,"last_played":1572438886},"language":"koreana","review":"웰컴투 에퍼쳐 사이언스 리치멘트 센터\n\n뿅/뿅/슈르륵/철컹↗/철컹↘/위↗이→이↘이↘이↘이↘이↘잉~/삥","timestamp_created":1452512218,"timestamp_updated":1452512218,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496078163385391235","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20464828","author":{"steamid":"76561198121749963","num_games_owned":122,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":320,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":320,"last_played":1448845154},"language":"english","review":"yeah, it's good","timestamp_created":1452499502,"timestamp_updated":1452499502,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20463227","author":{"steamid":"76561198024670288","num_games_owned":269,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":522,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":370,"last_played":1501791694},"language":"russian","review":"Первая часть является ярчайшим представителем эксперемента в видеоиграх: изначально шла в паке, не пиарилась, на нее никто не ставил, сделана за две копейки, довольно короткая.

And boy is it something different indeed. I did have fun playing it for being different, because it's a puzzle game as much as it is an action game. And it was worth playing through because it's humor ensures it doesn't get boring at all.\n\nUsing Valve's Source Engine, the graphics in this game are very nice. The environments look very nice, the Aperture Science Labs are very well designed, they look like a laboratory designed by Apple. This environment really draws you in, cause you don't know what could be lying in the next room, what kind of \"tests\" that were designed for you. \n\nThe gameplay is unique indeed. The Portal Gun really takes puzzle solving to new dimensions. You have to literally think outside the box to try and figure out how to use this device to solve the puzzles and to get to new heights. I was amazed by how Valve was able to make the portals work in this game, allowing to be able to get from one part of the room to another seamlessly without requiring much technical effort on the game's end. It's very well executed. Though my only complaint is trying to keep track of which portal (Orange or Blue) is where. The Tests are also well designed, intended to be challenging, yet give you the freedom to decide how you want to solve them. Test Chamber 17 was the most memorable for me (I miss you Weighted Companion Cube! *sniff*.) \n\nThe other notable thing about this game is the voice acting. The game features Ellen McLain as GLaDOS, the omnipetent A.I. who monitors your progress. GLaDOS is a very memorable character whose auto-tuned computer voice brings out humor in practically every line she says. The comedy in this game reminds me of Coen Brothers movies. I also found it hard to keep a straight face at the turret voices (also done by McLain.) The turrets sound so sweet, innocent, and nonthreatening, you cannot help but take a moment to pause and laugh. \n\nI also liked how the game avoids exposition in it's plot. The player character, Chell, has no voice, but she doesn't need one, because this game does a better job putting you in the driver's seat, making the plot unfold before you. It makes the plot less predictable at times and gives it some realism. Showing the player what's going on and not telling them anything, and overall, letting them discover for themselves, it makes for a more immersive experience.\n\nI have a few complaints about this game, though. My least favorite parts were the jumping segments, where you had to fall down through a portal to get enough speed to soar over walls or to get up to higher heights. I hate them because the portals are never in the correct spot where you'll end up falling. You have little control when you're in freefall. I also disliked some instances where I came through the portal and was upside down, and was distracting and disorienting, especially if I ended up needing to pay attention to what's in front of me. And again, I completed this game in less than three hours, which is a common complaint. But for that, that's what the game does to make you want to come back and play it again someday, cause there are many ways to solve all the tests and play it several times over.\n\nThis game was a really good ride. A shame it was as short as it is, but that's what makes you want to come back and try again, cause you'll likely have thought up new ways to solve the tests. The gameplay is simple enough that first-time players will not have a hard time learning, and returning players will be able to use their experience to think up new ways to play. The voice acting is excellent, the humor is enough to make you pause and laugh. And the game really immerses you in the perspective of the player character and does a great job of using \"show, not tell.\" The game does have it's problems, but they do not detract from the experience. If I need something to pass the time, this game will definitely be on my list to do just that. I intend to play this again.","timestamp_created":1452343843,"timestamp_updated":1452343843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20419886","author":{"steamid":"76561197997703908","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":248,"playtime_at_review":242,"last_played":1659561504},"language":"english","review":"What is not to love about this game?

É fácil se perder no tempo entre os puzzles, testando novas possibilidades e interações com o ambiente.\nOs portais são mecanismos incrivelmente simples e simultaneamente muito complexos, visto que as possibilidades de uso são inúmeras e o jogo faz com que você explore isso. Para fazer com que os portais funcionem bem, a física do jogo tem de ser boa, e neste quesito Portal não deixa a desejar. Os controles respondem muito bem e a ambientação, por mais minimalista que seja, atende bem às demandas do jogo.\n\n[u]Enredo[/u]\nPortal faz muito, usando muito pouco. O enredo é simples, mas satisfatório. A única personagem falante do jogo é uma das personagens mais hilárias que eu já encontrei em todos os jogos que já joguei, rendendo gargalhadas após gargalhadas.\n\n[u]Dificuldade[/u]\nLevando em conta a campanha principal, Portal só apresenta um desafio realmente empolgante, exigindo estratégia e habilidade, na segunda metade do jogo, e ainda assim, não é nada que alguns segundos de raciocínio ou testes de tentativa e erro não resolvam. \nO jogo não é muito difícil principalmente porque as fases só têm uma solução (com uma variação mínima), então geralmente quando você termina uma parte do puzzle, fica bem óbvio qual é a próxima parte a ser resolvida. Para mim isto é um ponto fraco, já que Portal tem uma mecânica que te instiga a procurar novas possibilidades, mas ainda assim a resposta vai ter de ser sempre a mesma.\nÉ um jogo com um potencial de dificuldade beirando o infinito, e infelizmente o jogo te oferece pouquíssimas fases pra ter de exercitar a mente.\n\n[u]Soundtrack[/u]\nMuito pouco memorável, mas coerente com o enredo do jogo. Definitivamente poderia ser melhor mas mesmo assim ela se apresenta de forma satisfatória. A música dos créditos é S-E-N-S-A-C-I-O-N-A-L.\n\n[u]Duração[/u]\nMinha carteira me pressiona a dizer que R$19,99 por ~5 horas de gameplay da campanha principal é um preço bem salgado, mas se eu soubesse o quanto o jogo é fascinante, eu pagaria tranquilamente. \nA duração, infelizmente, é muito pequena. Eu estava tão imerso no jogo que achei que ainda estava jogando o tutorial quando o jogo acabou (ainda que ser semelhante a um tutorial não fuja do propósito do jogo), e me recusei a acreditar que tinha acabado porque o jogo era tão bom e tinha durado tão pouco.\nEm relação ao conteúdo pós-endgame, você tem algumas das fases da campanha principal, mas abordadas de formas mais complexas, com recursos limitados e com uma avaliação de performance no final. O fator de replay do jogo base fica prejudicado por esta repetitividade, mas existem mods e fases criadas no editor de níveis para manter a diversão.\n\n[u]Conclusão[/u]\nPortal é uma pérola dos jogos modernos, mostrando para a indústria que é possível fazer diferente, que é possível pensar fora da caixinha, fugir dos clichés e chavões que vêm sendo martelados na nossa cabeça jogo após jogo. Uma das melhores experiências em termos de videogames que eu já tive na minha vida.\n\n9,5/10","timestamp_created":1452305152,"timestamp_updated":1452305507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20410413","author":{"steamid":"76561198042609548","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3923,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3595,"last_played":1620362849},"language":"english","review":"After playing Portal on my brother's computer I was convinced to get a Steam account so I could get Portal.
