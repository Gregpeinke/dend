To ensure that your pizza cooks evenly, set your oven to either \"bake\" or \"convection.\" While it’s warming up, you can finish getting your pizza ready.\n\nPlace the pizza on a nonstick baking sheet.\nPosition the pizza so that it's lying perfectly flat at the center of the sheet. If necessary, take a moment to rearrange loose or clustered toppings so that they cover more of the pizza.\n\nSlide the pizza into the oven on the center rack.\nSituating the pizza on the center rack ensures that it’s not too close to the heating element at the top or bottom of the oven. Once it’s inside, shut the oven door to prevent heat from escaping.\n\nCook your pizza for the recommended length of time.\nIt usually takes about 15-25 minutes for a frozen pizza to cook all the way through, depending on the size and amount of toppings. Be sure to set a timer so you don’t forget about it while it’s in the oven.\n\nRemove your pizza from the oven with the aid of an oven mitt.\nWhen your cook time is up, open the oven door, reach inside carefully, and take hold of the edge of the baking sheet with your oven mitt. Place the baking sheet on a flat, heat-safe surface.\n\nLet your pizza cool for 3-5 minutes before slicing it.\n\"Resting\" your pizza will allow it to reach a safe temperature for eating. It will also give the melted cheese time to firm back up a little, which can make slicing much easier and less messy.\n\nCut your pizza into slices with a pizza cutter.\nRun your pizza cutter over the center of the pizza, rolling the blade along with a back-and-forth motion a few inches at a time. Then, turn the pizza 90 degrees and slice through the center again, crossing your first cut. Continue turning and cutting until you have as many slices as you want to serve.","timestamp_created":1659786615,"timestamp_updated":1659810049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120157629","author":{"steamid":"76561199092927701","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":287,"playtime_last_two_weeks":40,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1659871943},"language":"russian","review":"like","timestamp_created":1659785015,"timestamp_updated":1659785015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120156199","author":{"steamid":"76561198329596517","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":582,"playtime_last_two_weeks":392,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1659890466},"language":"spanish","review":"Obra maestra","timestamp_created":1659782669,"timestamp_updated":1659782669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120155302","author":{"steamid":"76561198867946926","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":47,"playtime_forever":633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":633,"playtime_at_review":633,"last_played":1659783316},"language":"english","review":"i thought doing 100% was my greatest enemy. when all along. it was my enemy. it sucked.","timestamp_created":1659781134,"timestamp_updated":1659783842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120154656","author":{"steamid":"76561199201054238","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":244,"playtime_last_two_weeks":244,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1659787033},"language":"schinese","review":"太有意思啦！\n只可惜我童年没有玩到这款游戏！！！\n神作！","timestamp_created":1659779993,"timestamp_updated":1659779993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"120154474","author":{"steamid":"76561198269023226","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1033,"playtime_last_two_weeks":117,"playtime_at_review":1033,"last_played":1660467816},"language":"english","review":"The first puzzle game I could replay multiple times without getting bored.

portal silahı da girince bulmacaları çözmek için daha fazla kafa yormak gerekiyor ve bu kesinlikle eğlendiriyor.Grafikleri de yapıldığı seneye göre gayet iyi,yani oynarken asla grafiklere gözünüzün

Not only did it receive critical acclaim, it earned more praise than Team Fortress 2 and Half-Life Episode 2. That in itself is an incredibly hard feat to accomplish when compared to such renowned and prominent titles. Even being cited as one of the greats along side Legends such as DOOM and Half-Life, it has created a legacy for itself.\n\nPortal in its most basic is a platform puzzle game, but don't let that fool you one bit. Probably one, if not the most creative and scientific, Physic based creations Ive seen applied. The level of creativity and cleverness is simply a sight to behold and only Valve could be responsible.\n\nEssentially, you are a character or Sobriquet a \"lab rat\" who must pass a series of tests with a Portal gun and during so you are over watched by an artificial intelligence. The portal  gun can create an entry and exit portal and you must use it to maneuver through these chambers. This area is really where the games physics kick in and its absolutely phenomenal. Kinetic energy is retained through portals and further more so is momentum redirection and conservation. The player will gradually understand and adapt to this concept as time goes by and the difficulty increases. You must also interact with objects to further yourself through the levels such as a cube.\n\nEach test requires more rationale and critical thinking and will challenge the player to come to a solution using alternative methods. However you can be killed, sometimes instantaneously. Once the main game is complete, you can also undertake challenges and advanced mode where you revisit certain chambers that have an increased level of difficulty.\n\nIt is absolutely brilliant how the creators cleverly entwined the Half-Life story with Portal. Many of the games fans, will easily be able to relate to certain connections, however most information is limited and not extensive. \n\nThe game is short but does not outstay its welcome. its full of deadpan humor, which I found great! and mostly good fun.\n\nIf you did find the 19 levels were too easy, head over to the challenges and advanced maps. Once that's done its time to move onto Portal 2. \n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1659595598,"timestamp_updated":1659595598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi+Xms4IDdYDzyQM="}
