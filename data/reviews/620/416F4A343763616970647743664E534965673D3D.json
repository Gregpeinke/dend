Its style of first-person physics-based puzzle gameplay was unique. GLaDOS, the murderous robotic villain, was new and vibrant and evil in the most charming way. Cake jokes and songs about surviving dismemberment were still hilarious. It was short, succinct and essential. Creating a sequel without playing all the same notes and making it feel like Portal: The Longer Version is a tough task. For Valve, it's apparently no problem.\n\nFrom the first moments of waking up in the rusting Aperture Science facility to right before the credits roll, Portal 2 rarely falters. The world is bigger, the story thicker, and the character development more surprising. The mania of GLaDOS, the facility's operator, is molded into unexpected forms alongside a host of brutally funny personalities. The history of the Aperture Science facility is filled in, character origins discussed, and though its pacing suffers as it occasionally strikes a more serious tone, an abundance of cruel jokes and cheerfully sincere death threats prevent it from losing its sarcastic charm. When you're not staring at your screen with wrinkled, pained expression on your face trying to figure out a puzzle, expect to be laughing.","timestamp_created":1496235914,"timestamp_updated":1496235914,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32085050","author":{"steamid":"76561198042429229","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":636,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":636,"last_played":1496057537},"language":"english","review":"Right after finishing Portal for the first time the other day I felt compelled to play through Portal 2 immediately after. Portal ended on a cliff hanger. The ending of Portal may have been spoilt for me but Portal 2 was a completely fresh start for me. I was curious how they could improve on the original when the original worked so well, felt polished and satisfying to play through in a sitting or two. Now after it being out for several years my experience with Portal 2 was as follows.\n\nThe game starts us off in what seems like a post-apocalyptic setting. We are immediately introduced to our new companion Wheatley who guides us out to more familiar grounds. Shortly after we find our trusty Portal gun among the wreckage and the real fun begins. The game remains the same for the most part. It feels similar to the first person puzzle action was saw in Portal but with a lot more polish. To begin with I was impressed by how the tutorials were again clever in getting you familiar with the new mechanics but also at how quickly they trusted you to go nuts with experimenting with the gun. Truthfully the first part of the game was great but they outdid themselves in the second half of the game by allowing us to explore new environments, mess around with new mechanics such as gels which allow you to run faster, jump higher or create portals in different places. All in all the core mechanics from Portal are still here but there’s an added touch of polish that can definitely be seen.\n\nI didn't do any of the co-op missions but I understand that there are new levels that you can try. Definitely worth a go if you’re interested and can add a lot more fun to the game with a player 2.\n\nThe story was very entertaining, the characters are full of personality and charm. Particularly our new companion Wheatley. We re-encounter some familiar settings in Portal 2 and dive into the lore of Portal much more this time around. In Portal 2 there is an emphasis on explaining why this technology exists at all and what happened to those who created it. The game from beginning to end was very entertaining and the voice acting was top notch. Like Portal each level prompted some voice over from GLaDOS and this time it’s no different. As with the original it’s a pleasure to listen to the characters banter and how they develop throughout the course of the game.\n\nTechnically speaking the game like Portal looks good, it’s not the flashiest of games but it feels like a further polished version of Portal with a lot more added to it in all areas. Portal 2 ran smoothly throughout the entire play through. It features Ultra-wide support and look great at 3440 x 1440 without mods.\n\nPortal 2 is a step up in many ways to Portal. It holds up as a game that is constantly celebrated by its community and holds up to this day. Portal 2 doesn’t get much wrong, the only things that frustrated me were some of the puzzles and that was on me not being able to figure them out. Portal 2 lets you test and play around in these environments and allows you to take the approach you want to progress further. This is a game that improves upon its predecessor in many ways while retaining the original mechanics it creates an identity of its own that gamers shouldn't miss. I for one wish I'd played through both Portal and Portal 2 sooner.\n","timestamp_created":1496235813,"timestamp_updated":1496235813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32082021","author":{"steamid":"76561198312531200","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":73,"playtime_forever":332,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":254,"last_played":1591697107},"language":"russian","review":"супер","timestamp_created":1496224700,"timestamp_updated":1496224700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32080770","author":{"steamid":"76561198001442599","num_games_owned":50,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1575,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1575,"last_played":1496507795},"language":"french","review":"Jeu complétement addictif qui retourne la tête par moments ! à faire avec un amis :)","timestamp_created":1496219814,"timestamp_updated":1496219814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32080251","author":{"steamid":"76561198061944852","num_games_owned":424,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":2530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1449,"last_played":1577702364},"language":"polish","review":"Mineło 6 lat po wydaniu tej gry....

Это что-то особенное, доселе невиданное в игровой вселенной. \n\nФактически игра представляет из себя череду изолированных друг от друга уровней с заданиями, не выполнив которые, не пойдешь дальше. Собственно, задание каждый раз одно: пройти к выходу. Для выполнения заданий требуется сообразительность и трехмерное мышление. Используя заданный ландшафт и геометрию стен и определенные приспособления для перемещения, подпрыгивания и телепортации, активируя хитроумные механизмы и лазерные лучи - туннели, надо проложить себе дорогу в выходу из уровня. Вам противостоят роботы охранники, коварные ловушки и гравитация. \n\nЧтобы распланировать путь к выходу, надо быть хорошим стратегом. Наобум, методом тыка проходить игру практически невозможно. Здесь важно планирование и точность движений. Кроме шахматной расчетливости очень хорошо тренируется трехмерное мышление.

Главная героиня игры, Челл, приходит в себя в одной из многочисленных камер внутри лаборатории, и предпринимает очередную попытку побега из лаборатории, которая заканчивается совершенно не так, как девушка предполагала. Героине предстоит узнать много нового о прошлом компании, познакомиться с совершенно новыми героями и даже помочь старой противнице в ее нелегкой миссии.\n\nПомимо сюжетного режима, Portal 2 может предложить режим кооперативной игры для двоих игроков, в котором главными героями выступают роботы Атлас и Пи-Боди, выполняющие разнообразные поручения GLaDOS. У этих поручений есть отдельная сюжетная линия, которая никак не пересекается с сюжетной линией Челл, и которая ведет к неожиданному окончанию.","timestamp_created":1495934959,"timestamp_updated":1495934959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32008712","author":{"steamid":"76561198233930544","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":904,"last_played":1638240083},"language":"english","review":"It's Portal 2.

All puzzle are unique and new features are implement until the very end, vastly expanding on the base principle of portals.\n\nThe now run-down version of the facility proofs to be a great scenery thats gives the player an illusion of freedom until we are again thrown into the steril labrat-chambers. Later on we explore the origins of Aperture Science and its former testing grounds. Now with 111% more Gel to solve the courses and to climb your way thru the facility!\n\nAfter the storymode, you are presented the opportunity to play several coop-levels in which you can feel free to put your combined power of mind into solving dem riddles or bullying the heck out of your friends. But be catious: burning them with lazers may cause fun, at least for you :D\n\nOverall an extraordinary game with challenging riddles that require you to think outside the box at times. Frustration is very limited and the infamous sense of humor is just on point, creating a thoroughly enjoyable experience. 9/10","timestamp_created":1495917817,"timestamp_updated":1642532504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32001335","author":{"steamid":"76561198389814169","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":998,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":306,"last_played":1567931269},"language":"schinese","review":"amazing!!!","timestamp_created":1495905347,"timestamp_updated":1495905347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32000458","author":{"steamid":"76561198279802868","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":271,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1610671277},"language":"english","review":"Definetly worth my money and time.
