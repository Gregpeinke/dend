It's depessingly rare for a game to have a genuine, hilarious sense of houmour, much less any humour, Valve has pulled that off ipeccably which results in a game that will stick with you long after the decent, but kinda 'eh' ending tuned has played. Souce being older then justin Bieber, outputs an amazing looking game that proves again and again that strong art is better then shiny new shaders.

It's a first-person shooter puzzle game where you use your gun to make portals and solve physics puzzles. It continues the story of the first game and takes place in the abandoned and decaying Aperture Science Laboratories. You accidentally revive the AI GLaDOS, who is not very happy that you brutally murdered her. Mandatory testing ensues.[/b]\n\nPortal 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. Every single aspect of the first Portal is turned up to 11 here. The graphics, puzzles, and music are all much higher quality than in the previous game, and the game is about 5 times longer too (depending on how smart you are). Great new additions include grand action set-pieces, new puzzle elements, and multiple characters. GLaDOS is back, and she's free to be her petty, abusive self from the get go. One of the new characters, Wheatley, also takes the spotlight as your talkative traveling companion who isn't the brightest, but provides hilarious commentary. The writing in this game really is its strong point, but the whole experience is vastly improved. There's still the issue of replay value, but the story is good enough to look past.\n\nAlso included is a co-op campaign, which isn't as good as the main game, but it's still a lot of fun if your partner knows what they're doing.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game to anybody and everybody.
