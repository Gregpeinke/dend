Seriously, the ending was sad.\n\nAlthough three episodes were promised, it has been about 10 years as of this review since Episode Two came out. I haven't given up on ever seeing another Half-Life title, but Valve does what they want.\n\nI believe all the people who worked on any Half-Life game at Valve have since left over the years, so any new title will be fresh writing and developement. Who knows what current and future Valve employees will do with the famed series.

There are also some cool vistas in the mines (see cons below).\n[*]There is one twist in the story that really caught me off-guard. SPOILER: [spoiler]Alyx gets brutally (almost) killed by a biomechanical hunter. I've always found her annoying but the way she was suddenly pummeled (almost) to death shocked me and made me feel a sense of pity for her.[/spoiler] This was a well executed scene.\n[*]The visual design of the new Hunter enemies is really cool.\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\n[olist]\n[*]Freeman being a mute character is starting to feel weirder and weirder. The game is riddled with plenty of 'stare awkwardly silent at characters talking to you' moments. Elyx, your co-protagonist, got in love with Freeman despite him not having said a SINGLE WORD since they first met. Other characters interact a lot and speak a lot to you as well, exposing their feelings, and the disconnect is starting to feel somewhat creepy. Sure it's good for Ross Scott's series and I can't wait till his next episode comes out, but when you are playing as 'the Freeman' the suspesion of disbelief really starts to crumble especially when you think of this dude staring with a dead fish eye at other people. I didn't have the same problem with the first Half Life. I really think that Gabe and Company noticed this issue and decided that in an age where every character in narrative driven games has a voice and personality (e.g. the recent Wolfenstein titles or even older Halo titles, really) the mute dude formula doesn't work anymore. Maybe this is why you don't have a Half Life 3.\n[*]Story doesn't progress all that much, honestly. SPOILER: [spoiler]you manage to close the portal opened in episode ONE, some supervisor larvae floating thingies pop out of the sky and kill Elijah and they introduce an unknown threat device, the Borealis. I found this Borealis thing, which is a project developed by a competing group to Black Mesa, really annoying. I wanted to know more about the Combine, who the heck they are, what do they want, what's up with Dr. Breen. I wanted to know more about the vortigaunts, who used to be slaves in the first Half Life and now help you. I really didn't give a damn about this new plot device or even Elijah's death, frankly.[/spoiler] Interestingly, I have no qualms with the fact that the final cliffhanger may never see a proper sequel because I was already not interested in the direction the story was heading to. I don't feel like a want to know more.\n[*]I felt like a tool. People continuously order you around, even when they tell you to \"lead the way\" you are in fact constrained by linear paths. Sometimes they congratulate with you for some successful exploits of yours such as killing bosses or retrieving certain plot critical devices. Yet, I felt more like a child or a dog being patted on the head than an actual adult human being with a brain (and a PhD in Quantum Physics I might add!). Maybe, I feel like I'm not free in this game. In the original Half Life you could do whatever the hell you wanted with NPCs. You could kill everybody if you so wished. There were a few people that were critical for the story to progress, e.g. opening a retinical scanner protected door, but these were people that you needed in order to get a job done, and when the job was done you could kill them off without a second regret. Sure, I almost always found myself leaving them alive and risking my life for them even when they were not mission critical, but it was MY CHOICE. THEY served MY purpose not the contrary. Try and shoot NPCs here, nothing happens. Those NPCs critical for the plot are also almost impervious to enemy attacks, except when they conveniently aren't in cutscenes, further breaking suspension of disbelief. For instance, Elyx survived countless shots and melee attacks by several hunters at once, yet one of them caused her mortal injuries in the cutscene mentioned above.\n[*]Occasionally, the game takes control away from the player to play some in-game cutscene where you are mostly helpless. Something I expected more from a COD game than HL.\n[*]Many enemies are bulletsponges. Even on normal difficulty they still survive ungodly amounts of damage. e.g. shooting a combine soldier in the face with a shotgun doesn't kill him immediately, even using secondary fire mode which lands a double shot. In general the toughness of enemies makes all weapons feel like pea-shooter, the pistol, the revolver, the shotgun the smg, the dart thrower and the other all feel very weak and unsatisfying to shoot.\n[*]Chronic lack of ammo really made shooting sessions a chore. A lot of emphasis is put on the Gravity Gun. Many sections require it but to be frank the over reliance on the physics gimmicks outstays its welcome way faster than I expected. I realize that at the time of release, a decade ago, this was new and exciting stuff but now it gets boring really quickly. Coupled with the hitscan nature of combine enemies, their high damage output and the fact that they pretty much home on you, this encourages a fairly timid combat style, i.e. you'll be peeking around corners a lot. In the first Half Life you could enter a room gun blazing and have fun due to enemies that would move around a lot doing stupid but entertaining stuff like carefully placing granades to the ground amidst firefights or regrouping / retreating with comrades for no good reason. Instead, in this game I felt like a rat hiding behind furniture and inside holes all the time.\n[*]Impossible odds: during the last segment you must destroy a dozen striders (tripods) using sticky bombs. You throw the bombs at them, they supposedly stick to the hull and you shoot them to make them explode. In practice, you can only take one bomb at a time and these are to be collected at specific generators. So you run around this area with your car, collect ammo and the bomb, then go to the striders and kill them. Did I mention that the striders are escorted by hunters that deviate the trajectory of your bombs? Or destroy them before they land on target? Did I mention that the entire mission is you trying to prevent said tripods from reaching a base? Did I mention that the local forces of the base could not stop a single one of these tripods? They literally don't stand a chance without you which made me realize Freeman might as well throw the towel and let humanity die. It was an exercise in frustration. Another section had you defending another position with some dudes from being overrun by antlions. Again, I almost felt like I was playing Starship Troopers rather than a Half Life game. These 'defend the area' missions have a tendency to drag on and on.\n[*]Environments feel a bit samey after a while. Forests, mines, the base and some tunnels underground, all stuff seen time and time again in either HL2 or Episode One. I hoped we would get to see some truly alien environments, maybe? The antlions hive had some glimpses of truly cool stuff such as the larvae cells clusters in the great cavern or the holes covered in yellow icor, but it's not nearly enough.\n[*]Killing enemies is never all that fun since rather than being scattered around levels they tend to spawn from certain spots and pin you down for a while in your present location. Killing them never felt like an achievement, rather a chore to complete before you could move on.
