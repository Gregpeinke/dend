That being said i think it does a good job of forging it's own path, it's a short and concise story which is fine but i don't think it's really labelled that way. I was expecting it to be about as long as opposing force but i finished it in 1/3rd the time on hard mode. \nI know that it's commonly sold in a bundle and i would 100% recommend getting it there but compared to Half Life and Opposing Force i feel it serves as the little brother of the two. Half Life is something i think everyone should play, Opposing Force is something i think any Half Life fans should play but this is just a short add on. Honestly it would fit right in with story DLC these days. \nI know this all sounds very negative but what you should know is that despite it's length it is still a very fun game with a lot of fun puzzles and new takes on old ones despite the fact that it brings nothing new to the table.","timestamp_created":1588041202,"timestamp_updated":1588041202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68151988","author":{"steamid":"76561198145823100","num_games_owned":128,"num_reviews":87,"playtime_forever":15459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":341,"last_played":1608993439},"language":"english","review":"kickass","timestamp_created":1588039744,"timestamp_updated":1588039744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68125319","author":{"steamid":"76561198345239402","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":325,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":315,"last_played":1588014334},"language":"russian","review":"–ª—É—á—à–∏–π —Å–∏–º—É–ª—è—Ç–æ—Ä –æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –ø—è—Ç–µ—Ä–æ—á–∫–∏","timestamp_created":1588001786,"timestamp_updated":1588001786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68120541","author":{"steamid":"76561198872027618","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":599,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":307,"last_played":1632325714},"language":"turkish","review":"optimizayyon yarrak gibi mis gibi pcde kasƒ±yor ne anladƒ±m bu i≈üten aq","timestamp_created":1587995871,"timestamp_updated":1587995871,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476377934217453003","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68116224","author":{"steamid":"76561198085228467","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":204,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":204,"last_played":1587862090},"language":"english","review":"CALHOUN","timestamp_created":1587990753,"timestamp_updated":1587990753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68115131","author":{"steamid":"76561198251421984","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":175,"last_played":1539488745},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buena expansi√≥n, un poco corta a comparaci√≥n de Opposing Force, pero muy buena.","timestamp_created":1587989290,"timestamp_updated":1587989290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68108979","author":{"steamid":"76561198199908428","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":61,"playtime_forever":176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":176,"last_played":1587979675},"language":"english","review":"Great expansion to the original game.

This game tells the tale from a different perspective; from the eyes of a security guard who sees the events within Black Mesa while Gordon is causing chaos. \n\nThat's all there is to say really. You see how your actions link to Gordon's story in loose ways, which is rather interesting and meta, but your character (Barney) has his own story to tell. He must find an important scientist who gets captured by the military, to whom needs your help securing his teleporting project to Xen, then escape from Black Mesa with a bunch of other scientists. It's pretty basic and doesn't last long.\n\nThere's nothing new, really. I suppose one new dynamic is the lack of the HEV suit, so you must rely on body armour scattered around. You fight the same enemies as Gordon, manage to find some of Gordon's original arsenal, but come across the more casual workers of Black Mesa. \n\nThere's honestly not much to say. It's a good 2 hours of fun, but there's no reason to return, it's not as replayable as the core game or memorable. If you're playing Half-Life 2, then this introduces Barney but this game is definitely not necessary to play. Buy when on sale and enjoy a movie length side plot.

a pretty decent expansion pack. Nowhere near as big as Opposing Force is, and doesn't even let you use the full Half-Life arsenal. It's only a couple hours long if it's your first time, so it's a short game. Still worth your money, though, but I'd definitely play Opposing Force over this, it has a lot more content in it.","timestamp_created":1587420703,"timestamp_updated":1587420703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493730425834655762","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67700435","author":{"steamid":"76561198416083204","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":102,"playtime_forever":221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1587405495},"language":"russian","review":"–ü–æ–ª–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –ø—Ä–æ—à—ë–ª.–í –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ö –±—ã–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏—à–∫–æ–º –∑–∞–ø—É—Ç–∞–Ω–æ.","timestamp_created":1587405555,"timestamp_updated":1587405555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584942936897277832","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"67691398","author":{"steamid":"76561197979779165","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":199,"last_played":1586898176},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life is my all time favorite classic game, and it is a mystery how I never played this one before.
