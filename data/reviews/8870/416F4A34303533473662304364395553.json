Однако, привыкнув к интерактивности в других играх, ты не получишь ответа от персонажей, а только услышишь их диалоги, а иногда и вовсе молчание. Для жителей два типа лиц дам и столько же мужчин, и скоро смотреть на людей (кроме Элизабет) надоедает. Главную сисястую няшку приятно таскать за собой, ее помощь и поведение напоминает Аликс Вэнс в эпизодах HL, только она сама никого не убивает (на самом деле нет :-P).\n\nГлавная красота здесь - в зданиях, комнатах, предметах; хочется возвращаться и искать традиционные биошоковские бутылки-улучшалки (здоровья, щита, соли), которые иногда прячутся за стеклом, а иногда хитро спрятаны в потайных комнатах. Летать по рельсам в воздухе и падать на вражин сверху также забавно. Но не дали порулить лодкой или кораблем, в перемещениях всегда включались ролики без твоего участия.\n\nПрокачка оружия подобна второму Биошоку, а именно расставленные по всем картам в изобилии автоматы - были бы деньги, оружие прокачивается легко. Только вот отсутствуют характеристики пушек, и выбирать, из чего мочить \"патриота\" можно только методом проб и ошибок - ну нету здесь \"damage per second\", таков стиль Биошока.\n\nПо сценарию. Не знаю, какие шишки курили разработчики, но вторая половина и особенно завершение это просто вынос мозга; происходят безумные вещи и участововать в них приятно. Но саму суть сюжета я не понял, здесь как в хорошем кино - нет прямолинейной как тапок мысли \"ты победил зло\". Концовка чудесна, псевдоинтерактивность и красота вокруг. Примерно так мог бы закончится Half-Life 3, если он выйдет, конечно.\n\nМногие пишут, что было очень легко играть даже на харде, для меня и средней сложности хватило с лихвой. Немного испортила впечатление финальная битва с дирижаблями, было нервно и пришлось менять сложность. Такой битвы не припомню в прошлых Биошоках, но она мне точно не понравилась. Зато убиение тетушки-призрака выше всех похвал!\n\nС технической точки зрения были косяки в виде фризов при подгрузке карт, но это пустяки. Свет светит, тени падают, дымка и парящие здания - тут все нормально.\n\nЯ доволен!

Totalement dissocié scénaristiquement des deux premiers opus, il en reprend néanmoins le gameplay, alliant FPS traditionnel à coup de gros calibre à des pouvoirs moins conventionnels comme la possession ou le choc électrique. L'histoire prend place à Columbia, une cité  qui flotte dans les airs, pendant les années 20. Le scénario, ou plutôt la bizarrerie cosmique qui fait un pied de nez au continuum espace-temps toutes les deux minutes, est assez réussi, même si passé le postulat de départ, l'histoire tourne un peu en rond, avant de s'enrichir à nouveau sur la fin du jeu, tout simplement magistrale, bourrée de clin d'oeils à Bioshock 1 et prise de tête au possible (dans le bon sens du terme!) Graphiquement, aussi bien techniquement qu'artistiquement, Infinite est une merveille. Chaque scène est une claque visuelle, et l'environnement sonore n'est pas en reste, avec un doublage et une bande son de grande qualité. Au final, Bioshock Infinite mérite les louagnes qui lui ont été adressées, avec un petit bémol toutefois pour l'intelligence artificielle ridicule des ennemis, qui sont tout bonnement stupides. Sans parler de la résurrection infinie qui rend le jeu très facile même lors des derniers combats. Enfin, et c'est probablement le plus gros point noir de cette version PC, aucun moyen de sauvegarder manuellement, tout se fait par checkpoint et même s'ils sont nombreux, ça reste plus qu'handicapant par moments. La durée de vie quant à elle est plutôt honorable puisque le jeu se termine en une dizaine d'heures, c'est la moyenne actuelle. En bref, un excellent jeu, au scénario riche, avec une ambiance digne de celle du premier volet, un gameplay enrichi, sorte de mix entre Bioshock 1 et 2. Des personnages attachants, notamment Elizabeth, une bande son génial, une direction artistique à couper le souffle. Bref, peut être pas le jeu de l'année, mais néanmoins un excellent épisode de cette série, bien qu'un peu moins bon que le premier.","timestamp_created":1365076000,"timestamp_updated":1365076000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1052781","author":{"steamid":"76561197985396953","num_games_owned":524,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":2336,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1593,"last_played":1396579274},"language":"english","review":"In terms of gameplay not as fun or deep as its predecessors.

The cast of characters have depth & sincerity.  The story isn't just good, it's deep.  The plot has actual twists & turns that leave you guessing.  The environment is compelling & complex.  The game itself is flawless (no crashes/glitches) & the gameplay is complex.\n\nI shouldn't be surprised really.
