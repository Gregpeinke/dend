Even better than the first HL, wow I didn't think it was possible. While it is a shooter, it involves a lot more gameplay types, it allows you to drive through to point A-B with intense action, areas where you need to sneak past, you get to control troops of rebels (and even antlions at one point). And the regular shooting is great, it's also a true sequel meaning it's just a bunch of higher tech HL. (with the same physics puzzles and similar gameplay) It also has one of the best sci-fi storyline's of the century, including characters, dialog, and of course just story in general. It introduces a new gun that is just OMG, try launching a paint can at something, see how much damage that will cause. Just amazing, like HL1, I really have NOTHING negative to say.\n\nRated: 10/10","timestamp_created":1398980485,"timestamp_updated":1398980485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9989968","author":{"steamid":"76561198062877474","num_games_owned":174,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1558822696},"language":"portuguese","review":"muito bom o jogo","timestamp_created":1398961190,"timestamp_updated":1398961190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9988685","author":{"steamid":"76561198014207542","num_games_owned":327,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":314,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":311,"last_played":1407379333},"language":"english","review":"Pales in comparison to the third installment in the series","timestamp_created":1398950497,"timestamp_updated":1398950497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9988168","author":{"steamid":"76561198066026893","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":437,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":437,"last_played":1388554904},"language":"english","review":"Simply amazing","timestamp_created":1398946260,"timestamp_updated":1398946260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9986092","author":{"steamid":"76561198077115701","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":298,"last_played":1407093970},"language":"english","review":"This game is fantastic, just sayin.

Saying it was good, would be a waste of the entire internets time. So here's a more detailed description: This is a game that is still generaly better than most games made from 2012 onward. I never was a full PC gamer untill around 2010, and by then I played most triple A games that were available to me on console. Half-Life2 is a great game even if you like most generic money grabbing piles of arse. This game has something for just about everybody. If you like a good FPS, this is your game. If you like a good horror game, this is your game. If you want a puzzle game, this is the game for you. This game was made in 2006, and was around 6 years ahead of its time. The physics engine does its job and there's enough things that either fly out at you in the dark, shoot at you for not \"picking up that can\" (:D) and areas of the game that require skill and stratergy. Not so less that its to easy, and not so much to feel impossible. The story line of this game is overall entertaining and great. If you want to know who Gordon Freeman (the primary protagonist) is, here's a quick rundown: Gordon Freeman is a silent protagonist, wait come back, here's where it gets interesting. The involment of the game is dependant on the player entirely! During the start of game, you could be a guy, who has been sent into the furutre to kill John Conne- I mean, Alyx Vance. The dialog is enough to envolve you but not so much that you feel like the massive hero who immortal! No. The game's story revolves around who the player wants Gordon Freeman to be, thus creating the best video game character who ever existed, because of vanity reasons. So lets get onto graphics, 2006 THE END. No just kidding, Being a PC gamer faced with Alpha's and other games who dont have great graphics so they dont matter to me. They're good enough to see what you have to kill and who you are, also: NOT USING THE SAME (BLEEP)ING TEXTURE ON WALLS MAKING (BLEEP) CONFUSING!

The story, and the action is breathtaking. It must've looked amazing for computers and early consoles back in 2004. It pans very well on how Gorden tries to survive with his life and stop the forces. There was a light glitch that totally ruined the game for me, fortunattly, some die-hard fans found a way around it, and now it works like a charm. I would normally add something like that for negative points, but I'll let it go for now. If Valve decides to fix it up at last, I'll give them the benefit of praise.\nThe music... shaddup and take my money it's AWESOME.\nThe aiming on the hoverboat was kinda hard, but I guess that's just me.

You can see the sadness and the pain on the peoples face in the start, and they see you coming back, the legend himself,  your presence give them strength to fight again, maybe the last hope.
