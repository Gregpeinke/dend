Infelizmente, não é muito incomum quebrar alguns scripts, te forçando a carregar um save anterior. Não só isso, mas tem algumas sequências do jogo que diminuem o ritmo a um ponto que é tão lento que quase para, seja pela sua dificuldade quase que injusta (mesmo no normal) ou por você não ter ideia de onde tem que ir. Isso sem contar outros bugs, como físicas meio quebradas.\n\nMesmo assim, é um jogo extremamente divertido, e um uma revolução na criação de jogos. Assim como DOOM, a indústria nunca foi a mesma desde o lançamento de Half-Life. Um feito considerável, considerando que foi o primeiro jogo da Valve. Half-Life também serve como o ponto do meio da distinção de FPS clássicos (DOOM, Duke Nukem, etc.) e modernos (Call of Duty, Halo, etc.), com elementos como múltiplas armas e vida não regenerativa como era a norma, mas também um ritmo mais lento e metódico como é visto hoje em dia.\n\nTambém vale ressaltar a quantidade de mods criada para esse jogo. Embora não seja tão massiva quanto a de DOOM II, também possui uma quantidade considerativa, inclusive originando a série Counter-Strike de um  mod.\n\nEntre os poucos polígonos e a enorme ambição da Valve na época, é impossível não reparar nas rachaduras desse game datado, porém mesmo com todos os pontos negativos, esse jogo ainda possui o seu charme, inspirando um remake feito por fãs (Black Mesa). Half-Life é sem sombra de dúvidas um dos jogos mais influentes de todos os tempos, e merece uma jogatina para saber o quão impactante foi. Mesmo que você acabe só rindo da cara dos cientistas e zoando a dublagem, esse jogo é realmente algo único.","timestamp_created":1612308054,"timestamp_updated":1612308054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85850033","author":{"steamid":"76561199042196748","num_games_owned":20,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":24,"playtime_at_review":400,"last_played":1660047469},"language":"turkish","review":"1998 yapımı olmasına rağmen sarıyor","timestamp_created":1612307775,"timestamp_updated":1658753622,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500843167304992676","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85849250","author":{"steamid":"76561198354039910","num_games_owned":46,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":2610,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":648,"last_played":1643236336},"language":"english","review":"it is good, of course","timestamp_created":1612306364,"timestamp_updated":1612343714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85848418","author":{"steamid":"76561198970512783","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1419,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1404,"last_played":1658027010},"language":"brazilian","review":"Puta jogão foda (figurinha de joinha)","timestamp_created":1612305081,"timestamp_updated":1612305081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85846228","author":{"steamid":"76561198076340301","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":472,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":347,"last_played":1612390386},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1612301927,"timestamp_updated":1612301927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85845310","author":{"steamid":"76561198121148707","num_games_owned":266,"num_reviews":60,"playtime_forever":1018,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":808,"last_played":1612372039},"language":"brazilian","review":"VAI TOMAR NO CU DESSE JOGO CARALHO QUE PARTO PRA ZERAR ESSA MERDA PQP","timestamp_created":1612300641,"timestamp_updated":1612300641,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471428573131561279","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85844013","author":{"steamid":"76561198890127133","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3088,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2528,"last_played":1659340504},"language":"turkish","review":"adana merkez kafasına göre herkes\n","timestamp_created":1612298864,"timestamp_updated":1612298864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85843924","author":{"steamid":"76561198133896685","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":643,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":643,"last_played":1612002410},"language":"english","review":"This game is the only thing that makes alzheimer's worth having.\nOnce you play it - you can forget and experience the magic all over again.","timestamp_created":1612298748,"timestamp_updated":1612298748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85841015","author":{"steamid":"76561198066905165","num_games_owned":475,"num_reviews":95,"playtime_forever":1090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1090,"last_played":1612294493},"language":"english","review":"You obviously don't need to hear from me that this game is cult, so I'll stick to this: having played it through for the first time in 2021, I can clearly see why Half-Life has its place in the Hall of Fame of videogames.
