That implies I'm not a long time fan if the series, so my words should be taken with a (really big) grain of salt.\n\nThat being said, this review will not be an objective technical analysis, rather it'll be more a description of how this game made me feel during its duration. This is due to two main reasons:\n1) I'm not a hardcore gamer, nor an expert of the industry, nor the best critical mind you can find around the internet;\n2) The relatively old age of this game makes it difficult to me, who grew numb to the modern standards, to take an objective point of view.\n3) As you can see I haven't played so many hours on it, I simply played the main campaign at normal difficulty.\n\nBut let's end this boring introduction and start with the real meat.\n\n[b]A general view[/b]\nFirst of all, I have to congratulate this game: I can see how it was the precursor to the modern FPS genre, in both good and (partly) in bad as well. \nI loved the shooting mechanics, they felt really fluid and responsive. I felt prized for aiming properly, but I have to admit that the enemy hitboxes were pretty generous. There wasn't a weapon that i hated, nor one that has always been useless, even the little gun at the beginning. I felt like the coolest weapons (Gabe bless the pulse rifle) had some little... ammo shortage issues, but i can understand that in a matter of level progression design. After all they don't want a walking divinity in their game (or do they? more on this later).\nFor the bad part... stick with me for a bit.\n\n\n[b]SPOILERINO WARNING[/b]\nI'm gonna spoil the entire game from here on (if it's still relevant to this year).\n\n\n[b][i]Wake up and smell the ashes[/i][/b]\nYeeeeeeeeeeeeah, finally we're back from where we left in the first game. The enigmatic G-Man appears again to finally give our first assignment. Even if it was just one day for me, the anticipation I had from the first game (that, if it wasn't obvious, I really enjoyed) was enormous.\nWe get launched in a mysterious new world we know nothing about, we only know something isn't quite as it should be. I love how the game fills you in with clever and discrete details through all the chapter, ranging from citizens complaining about the situation to big screens with propaganda broadcasting.\nAfter some little action we're then finally introduced to the cast, making me hope in a more personal (for Gordon at least) experience.\nLoved the crowbar (I missed you for a whole day, baby), loved the shooting and yes, Barney, I also want that beer.\n\n\n[b]Water level?!?[/b]\nThe little journey to Black Mesa East was mostly pleasurable. Not the airboat part (but I have to admit that when the vortigaunt installed a gun I had a little dopamine injection) but mostly all the little 'puzzles' that you needed to do for the progression (including the dam 'opening', that felt really good). I also like how you could finally see a bit more of the reality of this world: the citizens helping you during the travel made you smell the growing breeze of the revolutions that would inevitably come.\nI hated the gunship. With all my heart. The feeling of being constantly oppressed and chased can give a really good 'action' atmosphere, but on a gameplay side it felt really frustrating, both running away (before the gun) AND fighting it: even if in terms of numbers we could be considered equals it anyway felt really frustrating.\n\n\n[b]Flex flex, Source[/b]\nThe Gravity Gun. The ultimate flex. A tool that was screaming 'hey guys, we got a new cool engine with all physics and other cool stuff!'.\nReasons to love:\n- You move stuff\n- You shoot stuff\n- You gotta play with a cute doggo\n- Ravenholm\nReasons to hate:\n- I loved my crowbar.\n\n[b]We actually go to Ravenholm[/b]\nThis chapter is... pure genius. It was a Luna Park for my new toy. I loved carrying a saw all around the map and decapitate the poop out of those zombies. The only reason I didn't get the achievement for completing Ravenholm using only the Gravity Gun was because the shotgun threw by Father Grigori (who, btw, is one of the biggest bros I've ever met in a game) was too juicy not to be used for a couple shots.\nIt's really hard for me to find flaws in it, except for the fact that maybe it can be a little too big of a tutorial for your new tool.\n\n\n[b]You knew I hated bugs...[/b]\nThe frustration... again! It's the same exact story of the airboat level + infinite spawn of frigging bugs! I think this point is pretty biased right now because of the antlions but I can only say I just wanted to finish this level as soon as possible. I didn't like antlions that could spawn as soon as you made a wrong step, I hated having another 1v1 with a gunship (I have to admit i couldn't drive that missile properly though) and I hated the platforming under the bridge.\nOn the plus side they gave you the possibility to use the antlions, that felt pretty good, gotta admit that.\n\n\n[b]Where I almost broke[/b]\nHighway 17 felt frustrating but at least it managed to redeem itself towards the end with the use of antlions. Also, the beginning Nova Prospekt felt pretty... normal. But then... there's a reason I hate tower defense games. It wasn't hard, at all, but it was really boring waiting for the 'operation' to finish while i simply butcher the next wave of enemies coming at me.\nNormally I don't bother defending some kind of 'Control point' for a certain amount of time, but not in Half-Life. It really didn't feel like the game I learned to love anymore.\nHere I realized something: Half-Life 2 was a great testing ground for new ideas and concepts, some more clever than others. Many of them worked really good, while others made this game lose a bit of identity. I know the fanbase of this series probably has way better arguments that what I could ever throw in my life, so take this as my humble opinion.\nThe City 17 fight felt pretty good, the atmosphere was spot on: on one side the resistance that you involuntarily bred throughout all the game (high five to the best boy, Doggo!), on the other the oppressors using whatever tool to enforce their regimen. The only problem is... those tools simply felt extremely frustrating to fight against. I really didn't like to (again) defend a control point from waves of enemies and I really... but really hated those Striders. They made me feel impotent, like a was no match to them. For every missile i launched I was praying that they wouldn't hit me while I was guiding it and that they would finally die. However...\n\n\n[b]Oh boy[/b]\nOh boy. Ooooooooooooooooh boy. The power up for you gravity gun and the super medikits felt so... SO good. It was that burst of divine powers I finally needed. It's like having your favorite dish for dinner after a long and stressing day at work. I felt unstoppable. And I loved to finally manage(?) to smash the face of that jerk of Breen. F**k you Wallace.\nNeedless to say seeing ma boi G-man again, in such an unexpected moment, was really satisfying. It makes me want to see what my next 'assignment' will be.\n\n\n[b]In conclusion...[/b]\nIt was a good game. Like every game it had its highs and lows, but in it's entirety it felt pretty good. I can see the will to experiment and innovate that this company had at the time, though sometimes they tried a bit too hard, putting elements that felt unrelated. An experiment that succeed in most of his part and that satisfied me in the end.\nI won't put numbers, I'm not good at it, but I can say I'm simply about to start Episode 1 with great anticipation.","timestamp_created":1585565389,"timestamp_updated":1585567406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":30,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.739647388458251953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66153465","author":{"steamid":"76561198091708273","num_games_owned":89,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":829,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":502,"last_played":1585668790},"language":"koreana","review":"재밌어","timestamp_created":1585565058,"timestamp_updated":1585565058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66151581","author":{"steamid":"76561198835495036","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":536,"last_played":1588597140},"language":"turkish","review":"Namaz italyanca olsa en az 4 rekatto horni morni kılarım","timestamp_created":1585562824,"timestamp_updated":1612341743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66151508","author":{"steamid":"76561198896527360","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":53,"last_played":1587648444},"language":"english","review":"You all know that Valve is known for putting out their quality game changing titles!!\nWell Half-Life 2 is Monalisa to Valve's Leonardo Da Vinci.\nThe best pacing I've ever seen in a first person shooter!","timestamp_created":1585562746,"timestamp_updated":1587648698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66150660","author":{"steamid":"76561198261234965","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":983,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":829,"last_played":1585573336},"language":"spanish","review":".","timestamp_created":1585561754,"timestamp_updated":1585561754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66150465","author":{"steamid":"76561198274440447","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":878,"playtime_last_two_weeks":275,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1660654454},"language":"english","review":"nice","timestamp_created":1585561482,"timestamp_updated":1585561482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66150440","author":{"steamid":"76561197998890843","num_games_owned":251,"num_reviews":231,"playtime_forever":881,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":511,"last_played":1585686093},"language":"english","review":"The Half-Life Universe!

Its a mustplay for everyone in my mind. It's a 10/10 game and i love it even after replaying it a couple of times. If you think the graphics look too bad you can always get mods on steam or on the internet to make the game look even better. Just stay away from stuff that changes the game too much like hl2 overcharged or the cinematic mod. Go with hl2 update for better lighting, bug fixes and higher res lightmaps (staying true to hl2 vanilla) or go with mmod, which changes a lot so i recommend playing the vanilla version first. If you have not played hl2 then what are you doing? go get it","timestamp_created":1585525330,"timestamp_updated":1647449342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494479626417160034","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66124232","author":{"steamid":"76561198284765039","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":796,"last_played":1585524991},"language":"brazilian","review":"sim","timestamp_created":1585525001,"timestamp_updated":1585525001,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66123965","author":{"steamid":"76561198302647071","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1063,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":516,"last_played":1652638343},"language":"german","review":"gud game","timestamp_created":1585524669,"timestamp_updated":1605441450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66123676","author":{"steamid":"76561198058905489","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1365,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":382,"last_played":1615323799},"language":"english","review":"10000000000000000/10","timestamp_created":1585524254,"timestamp_updated":1585524254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66123189","author":{"steamid":"76561198202137806","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":156,"playtime_forever":1076,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1076,"last_played":1585523320},"language":"brazilian","review":"É um bom jogo, mas com o tempo começa a ficar meio repetitivo.
