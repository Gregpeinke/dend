You will become part of our grand puzzle testing group, utilizing this cute little gun to its fullest. The possibilities are endless and it all starts now! Our facility is also overseen by a… proper overseer… not important. And hey, at the end, there is cake! You young people like cake right? What do you say kid: Are you in?”\nMy Opinions: Portal is a game that is unlike many others. It may be the most popular puzzle game where you must use your wits to fight your way through the puzzles. Portal, in my opinion, was the setup phase to the sequel “Portal 2”, but with the resources they had, they did a great job. Portal didn’t leave me completely in the dark considering story line, which is awesome btw, and the overwhelming complexity they were able to innovate to the game is unforgettable.\nRecommendations: I’ma be real: $20 for a game that can be completed in under 40 minutes… a tad harsh ($1 per two minutes) Why don’t I come up with a recommended $ per hour of game play… Over 5 years, I’ve played about 8451.2 hours (352.13 days) of video games and of all that I’ve spent $487.33 total. In other words, I expect roughly 17.34 hours per $1 of game play… yowzers :).

A campanha é curta e não há uma rejogabilidade alta. \nOs principais momentos são o início e o final, onde eu me diverti mais, pois a boss battle contra a Glados é muito bem executada e o início também é muito interessante.\nUma das coisas que eu mais gostei e fez eu adicionar um ponto  na nota que eu dou para o jogo é a ambientação, que é excelente; sublime! Um clima frio e quase aterrorizante de uma empresa do mal. O jogo tem um clima de terror psicológico que é muito bom e funciona muito bem, porque é muito imprevisível o que vai seguir, e a ideia também de se rebelar contra o dono do sistema que controla tudo é muito boa e inteligente.\nConclusão: Vale a pena jogar, contanto não vá achando que o jogo testa suas habilidades mentais ou seu cérebro, pois não é nada disso. Também não vá achando que é um clássico da ficção cientifica. Porém, pelo preço que eles vendem com certeza vale a pena comprar e jogar.\nNota:7.5/10\nVou jogar Portal 2, pois ainda não joguei e espero que não me desaponte como esse jogo me desapontou. \n\n","timestamp_created":1481818974,"timestamp_updated":1481818974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.490196079015731812","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28387067","author":{"steamid":"76561198168495982","num_games_owned":143,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1012,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":806,"last_played":1488067466},"language":"russian","review":"The cake is a lie! \nСупер игра!","timestamp_created":1481808035,"timestamp_updated":1481808035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28385948","author":{"steamid":"76561198091177784","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":163,"last_played":1602332640},"language":"french","review":"good puzzle game even if it's too short ^^","timestamp_created":1481802514,"timestamp_updated":1481802514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28382118","author":{"steamid":"76561198130340274","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1629401324},"language":"english","review":"Portal at its best.\n\nRock solid 2 hours of wonderful gameplay, no regrets.\n\nWould recommend to everyone, even by todays standards.","timestamp_created":1481779032,"timestamp_updated":1481779032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"28381437","author":{"steamid":"76561198140951294","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":295,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":293,"last_played":1590081751},"language":"english","review":"Personal favorite of mine.\n\nWell designed and fun game.
