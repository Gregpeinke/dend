Despite many people comparing it with Left4Dead for me it's not in the line of this game. You fight off monsters in waves together with other players instead of following a certain path like within Left4Dead or Valves Alien Swarm. The game is quite motivating as you A) Can level your character with several \"Perks\" granting you damage, health and speed bonuses and B) it's quite satisfying if you manage to fight off a wave with (or without) your teammates on your \"bloody last legs\".\nSelecting a perks also gives you a discount in the shop after each wave for specific weapons and equipment. Each wave is getting harder as the amout of special, heavy hitting enemy increases. After 10 rounds \"The Patriarch\" will spawn. A really deadly foe with rocket launcher, Minigun, tentacles and a lot of health points. Hard to kill, but extremly rewarding if you do so.","timestamp_created":1336729399,"timestamp_updated":1336729399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1446152","author":{"steamid":"76561197993320624","num_games_owned":385,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2277,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2277,"last_played":1343718000},"language":"english","review":"This game is sooooo much gd fun.

This game has soaked up a lot of great times, and no matter how many times you play a map, the different squad makeups, weapon options, and variety in arrays of zombies which come after you make each adventure different. A great game.
