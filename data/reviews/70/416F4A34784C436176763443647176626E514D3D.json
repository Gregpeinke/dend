It's genuinely impressive how much of the game still holds up today. The puzzles and exploration are where this game shines. I loved searching every inch of Black Mesa and finding extra equipment to aid me. The weapons are also pretty fun to play around with. Despite the game's age, I did not have too many issues with the allied AI either. The enemies are generally fun to fight against. I preferred the human enemies personally.\n\nPerformance wise, the game runs smoothly but the loading areas can be pretty jarring. I thought the story was pretty nice. It wasn't anything too crazy or mind-blowing, but it was pretty solid.\n\nThe game does fall off in the endgame. The alien world is such a slog and it was frustrating at times. I thought the aliens were cool and mysterious from a story standpoint, and it's a darn shame the alien world was as boring and frustrating as it was. The platforming of this game is by far the worst part of the entire game. At no point was it fun to platform, but it could just be the game's age. The headcrab queen thing and Nihilanth were really tedious boss fights. \n\nDespite the Half-Life's faults and age, it is still a fun experience and downright impressive at times.
