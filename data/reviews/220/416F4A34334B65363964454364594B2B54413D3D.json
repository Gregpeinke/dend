There are 6 letters in zombie.\nHalf-life 2 is a game by Valve, whose boss is Gabe Newell, usually called \"Gaben\" by the fans. \nThere are 5 letters in Gaben.\n13+6+5=24\n24 has a 2 in it, and is made out of 2 letters.\nIf we divide it by 2 two times, we get 6.\nLet's remove 6 letters from Gordon Freman.\nHo, I misspelled Freeman ? Let's just forget about it.\nSo, if we remove 6 letters : F, R, E, M, O and N from Gordon Freman, we get Gordan.\nGordan is the anagram of Dragon.\nA dragon breathes fire.\nThere is an E in fire, let's remember it.\nDragon is also the anagram of gardon.\nYou remember the E from fire ? Well let's replace the O with the E.\nWe get the word garden.\nWe are talking about Half-life, which has \"half\" in it.\nIf we cut \"garden\"in half, in some way we get \"nerd\".\nThe nerd stereotype wears glasses.\nGlasses has 2 S in it : like this : SS.\nThe SS during WW2 were under the control of Hitler.\nHitler has a famous moustache.\nLike Dali, Staline, Einstein and Chaplin.\nDali=4 letters.\nStaline=7 letters.\nEinstein=8 letters.\nChaplin=7 letters.\n4+7+8+7=26, which has a 6 and a 2 in it.\n6/2=3.\nIn the movie Total Recall, there is a pros.titute with 3 bo.obs.\nBo.ob is a palindrome, that means you can read it backward or forward.\nAnother very well known palindrome is Bob.\nThis leads me to SpongeBob Squarepants.\nBob's best friend is Patrick, a sea star.\nAs a sea star, he is red and has the shape of a star.\nThe star and the red color are communist symbols.\nCommunist has 9 letters.\nSpongebob Squarepants has square in it.\nThe square root of 9 is 3.\nHALF LIFE 3 CONFIRMED !\n\n*People start applauding, as I start wiping the sweat from my face.*","timestamp_created":1451486341,"timestamp_updated":1451486433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20115130","author":{"steamid":"76561198272871453","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":396,"last_played":1451508671},"language":"russian","review":"ЗАПУСТИЛ ПОИГРАТЬ \n@\nПРОПУСТИЛ: 2 СВАДЬБЫ, 15 ПОХОРОН И 3 МИРОВУЮ ВОЙНУ\n@\nНАУЧИЛСЯ ПИКАПУ ОТ ГОРДОНА\nВ ИТОГЕ \n@\nЕОТ МОЯ\nЕРОХИН ГДЕ ТО В ЗЕН\n","timestamp_created":1451484705,"timestamp_updated":1451484705,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20113971","author":{"steamid":"76561198093315901","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":258,"last_played":1474896736},"language":"spanish","review":"Obra de arte.

Es más, es EXCELENTE.\n\nPero tiene un problema: según he leído le han metido muchas actualizaciones que en lugar de mejorarlo lo ha empeorado. Tengo entendido que en 2010 recibió una actualización del motor Source que lo hizo tan pesado que muchos equipos en los que corría perfectamente han dejado de soportarlo.\n\nParece que el juego hoy sólo corre en PC´s nuevas, pues yo he tenido muchos problemas.\n\n[list]\n\n[*]BUG 1: El tren\n\nHay una parte, como unos 20 minutos después de empezar el juego, en la que debes pasar por unas vías de tren para cruzar al otro lado. Pues en ocasiones muchos usuarios han reportado que el tren se queda atascado en la via y no te deja pasar, obligándote a retroceder a un punto de guardado anterior, usar un truco para volar y atravesar el tren o incluso iniciar una nueva partida.\n    \n[*]BUG 2: El juego falla y se cierra\n\nEsto me pasó en el capítulo \"Ruta de canal\" al abrir una puerta para poder pasar con la lancha, derrepente muchos objetos de transparentan y el juego salta al escritorio con un error, al buscar el problema en internet me entero que a muchos les pasa (y como dato, todos estos reportes son de años posteriores a 2010) y no existe solución exacta, no supe exactamente que hice pero pude seguir. En el capítulo \"Anticiudadano Uno\" me vuelve a ocurrir pero esta vez no puedo solucionarlo, pues con DirectX 8 crashea y con DirectX 9 se congela y no responde más.\n\n[*]BUG 3: Iluminación:\n\nAl llegar al capítulo \"Black Mesa Este\" me topo con un problema, la iluminación del juego falla y los lugares oscuros y todo en general se llena de una luminación extrema, y al buscar en internet me encuentro que para solucionar esto se debe poner este código en la consola:\n\n[code]\nmat_dxlevel 90\nmat_hdr_level 2\nmat_hdr_enabled\nmat_fullbright 0\nmat_dxlevel 80\n[/code]\n\nY con eso se soluciona, pero temporalmente, pues hay que ponerlos en ese orden en CADA UNA de las pantallas de carga que tiene el juego, ya que al pasar a otro lugar se resetea de configuración. \n\nEl problema luce [url=http://fotos.subefotos.com/4e1b0d38b95c65a333d4b7916af37ea8o.jpg] así. [/url]\n\nEste problema parece solucionarse a finales del capítulo \"Nova Prospekt\", pero como ya puse arriba, aunque soluciones esto el problema de crasheo aparece de nuevo en el capítulo \"Anticiudadano Uno\".\n\nSales de una para entrar en otra.\n\n[/list]\n\nAl parecer a Valve no le interesa solucionar esto ya que sólo nos pasa a nosotros los que tenemos equipos malos que no soportan bien el DirectX 9, por lo menos los bugs 2 y 3 pues el 1 le pasa a cualquiera aunque tengas un muy buen PC.\n\n[b] En conlusión: [/b]\n\nTienes un muy buen PC: Cómpralo, lo vale.\nTienes un PC malo como yo: Descárgalo pirata, [b]no te quedes sin jugarlo[/b]. No tuve estos problemas con esa versión.\n\nPor suerte he leído que el Episodio 1 y 2 no tienen estos problemas, eso es bueno :D","timestamp_created":1451345663,"timestamp_updated":1467596016,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471270769834518433","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20049957","author":{"steamid":"76561198109641015","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":770,"last_played":1481124961},"language":"spanish","review":"Queremos half life 3","timestamp_created":1451345133,"timestamp_updated":1451345133,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531914889812469482","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43Ke69dECdYK+TA=="}
