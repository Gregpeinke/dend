Изготовлена по заказу Вентилям и всем игрокам от Gearbox. Вышла через 2 года в 2001, после Opposing Force.\nЗдесь нам дают во второй раз вернуться в Черную Мезу, расстрелять толпу инопланетных супостатов, повоевать с бойцами из HECU и погулять по миру Зен. Управлять будем синерубашным охранником копмплекса Барни Калхуном (Калхауном или Колганом, как было у меня в озвучке, а может я просто ослышался :)), который в дальнейшем станет одним из сюжетных персов в Half-Life 2 и Первом Эпизоде для второй Халвы.\nКонечно Blue Shift сосет большой писос у первого аддона от Гиров Opposing Force, так как Вальве не дала разгуляться разрабам. И из-за этого мы имеем просто аддон без новых врагов и стволов, что немного печально. Но так или иначе играется он все равно очень бодро и динамично, как в принципе вся серия Half-Life. Ну и если вы хотите знать, кто такой Барни и как он выбрался из комплекса вместе с учеными, то аддон однозначно стоит брать.\nПарочка плюсиков:\n+ Главный ГГ в Синей Рубашке - а Сержант Битнер очень любит синий цвет. Так что это однозначно жирнющий плюс. :)\n+ Есть специально изготовленная и уникальная модель ученого, при помощи которого нам надо будет свинтить из Мезы. Это хоть какой-то глоток свежести, ибо все модели ученых это Энштейн, Афроамериканец и Лысоседеющей старик.\n+ Что очень странно: битвы с солдафонами теперь не вызывают рвотных позывов на Легком уровне сложности. Хотя в них все так же приходиться впендюрить больше половниы магаза из Черного Весла М16.\n+ Опять же небольшие задачки, которые приходиться решать при помощи вашего мозга.\n+ Музло, которое перетащили из Opposing Force - оно все таки хорошее и атмосферное.\nМинусы:\n- Вообще нет нового контента. Ни врагов, ни оружия. Старый и до боли знакомый каждому классический арсенал травматов.\n- Небольшая продолжительность: всего 3 часа. Хотя лично по мне это норм, но для кого-то возможно будет минусом, так что пусть будет. :)\nИтог: Да в принципе годный трехчасовой аддон. Берите, играйте, наслаждайтесь. Что ещё нужно?

Wir laufen durch die Level, bringen Aliens um und sehen zu, wie das Militär seine Arbeit tut. Auch immer noch sehr schöne Actionszenarien und Rätsel sind dabei. In Blue Shift greift man als Sicherheitsmann fast ausschließlich auf irdische Waffen zurück, nur die Käfer( \"Snarks\") kann man(muss man aber nicht) finden. Der größte Unterschied im Gameplay ist, dass wir keinen Anzug tragen und somit keine H.E.V. Stationen benutzen können. Stattdessen greifen wir auf Rüstungen und Helme zurück, die oft bei toten Sicherheitsleuten finden. \nDa Blue Shift nur ein Addon ist, beträgt die Spielzeit nicht mehr als 4 Stunden. Aber dennoch war es mal wieder spaßig, in alter Half-Life Manier rumzuballern.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nWir sehen desöfteren den alten Gordon und sogar auch den G-Man. Aber in Blue Shift spielen wir Barney Calhoun, welcher im Hauptspiel nur eine sehr kleine Rolle einnimmt. (Der Typ, der einem am Anfang die Tür aufmacht). Im zweiten Teil ist er dann wesentlich wichtiger, da er Gordon befreit und ihm die gute alte Brechstange zuwirft.\nIn Blue Shift erleben wir erst einen ganz normalen Schichtantritt, bis der Zwischenfall passiert. Also laufen wir mal wieder durch halb Black Mesa, da wir entkommen möchten. Auch wenn wir eigentlich nur raus wollen, dürfen wir uns auf einen Abstecher in die Xen Welt freuen. Ich persönlich konnte wieder richtig schön in die Welt von Half-Life eintauchen, da es auch wieder super Dialoge zwischen den Charakteren gibt.\n\n[b]Grafik/Sound[/b]\nGrafisch gibt es keine Neuerungen zum Hautspiel. Auch der Sound bleibt beim Alten. Die Half-Life Grafik war damals sehr aufwendig, sodass ich das Spiel auch durchaus noch heute anhand der Grafik zumindest akzeptabel halte. \n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\nWie viele andere Leute bin ich ein großer Fan der HL Reihe. Blue Shift ist ein netter Bonus zum Hauptspiel und lässt die Geschichte aus einem anderen Blickwinkel betrachten. \nWer Half-Life mag und sich an der alten Grafik nicht stört, wird hier seinen Spaß haben.\n\n\nHat dir das Review weitergeholfen?

And, to be completely honest, I like this take on the Black Mesa incident more than Opposing Force. This time it's not about aliens or taking over the facility as Gordon or Shepard. You're stuck right in the middle as a security guard who's natural impulse is to just get the f*** out of there. There's no G-man (save for a brief cameo), no high stakes, just aliens, marines, and getting the f*** out of Black Mesa. The story is tight enough for the little developments to come when they do and it's has enough investment that by the end you're on the edge of your seat waiting for what's about to happen. In that regard, I think Blue Shift is a more effective story than Opposing Force.\n\nThat being said though, Blue Shift is a bit lower on the gameplay end. Some puzzles are pretty easy, while some are very oddly designed (like pushing a barrel into a TNT line to blow up a door, even though that was never introduced as a concept in the game before), and there's no addition to the weapon line-up like Opposing Force had. You have almost all the same guns as the original Half-Life and you cover a lot less area in Black Mesa than the previous two installments.\n\nHowever, everything I love about Half-Life is still here, it's just more condensed. I'd consider Blue Shift the cliffnotes version of the Half-Life story. It's short, sweet, and over in about 3 hours. Is it as grand as Half-Life? No. Is it as expansive as Opposing Force? No. But is it still enjoyable? Yeah, I think so. I enjoyed the 3 hours I spent in Blue Shift. It might not be for everyone else, but I still think it's a fine expansion pack to a fine game.

I won't even, given how GearBox didn't even bother making a good game, but I'll try to explain to this as much as possible. But trust me when I say that Opposing Force and the original Half-Life is far better. \n\nFirstly, Barney Calhoun doesn't even get his own unique weapon, which (given how important Barney is in HL2) is incredibly stupid, especially for people who wanted to play as Barney. This is only a minor nitpick compared to everything else, but it was the first thing I noticed that was wrong with the game. To top it off, if you switch to third person you'll notice that they didn't even bother to replace Gordon's model with Calhoun. That's right, the dev team was so lazy they didn't give Barney his own playermodel, this expansion is made by the same company that made Opposing Force. \n\nSecondly, the enemy spawn locations are just unfair as hell, just to increase the longevity of the game, as this game is EVEN more shorter than Opposing Force, in fact, I played through this game with God Mode and it took me only five hours to beat this game. Compared to Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force, this is just pathetic. There is no fairness in difficulty, unlike with Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force\n\nThirdly, no new weapons, unlike Opposing Force that had a plethora of new weapons for you to test out, this game has none, instead just relying on Half-Life's old weapons. \n\nFourthly, thanks to the difficulty, the progression of the game comes to a screeching halt as you have to rely on exploits among other cheap tricks to get passed an area. Whilst Half-Life and Opposing Force had something similar, it only appeared in the final chapters, whereas in Blue-Shift it's present throughout the whole game.\n\nFifthly, the ending is anti-climactic, I was expecting some climactic battle against a new mutated creature whilst waiting for the portal to open up, or a raid of some sort of HECU mecha or something, I dunno, something unique, instead there are just a bunch of soldiers you can easily take down, and that's it, nothing climactic.\n\nSixthly, the only actual pros are the HD model pack, the introduction of Dr. Rosenburg (which either way is useless considering he's forgotten about in HL2), the introduction of Barney (who either way isn't treated as an actual character in this game), and the fact that this game is more Half-Life, however other than that, the cons outweigh the pros and personally this is the worst Half-Life expansion out of all of them. It's not as terrible as say Richochet, but it's still bad due to the sheer laziness and lack of effort GearBox put in this game. \n\nPersonally, if you want a game where you play from the perspective of a security guard, please play the Azure Sheep mod. It's incredibly good, and far better than this shitty excuse that GearBox put out.","timestamp_created":1475515320,"timestamp_updated":1475515320,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25797144","author":{"steamid":"76561197987167966","num_games_owned":893,"num_reviews":134,"playtime_forever":369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":369,"last_played":1475315683},"language":"russian","review":"Blue Shift - это абсолютное ничего, три часа белого шума во вселенной HL.

Sometimes the game isn't even bad, just not as solid as the rest and people act like by proxy it's the worst thing ever. It happened with Fallout 4 compared to Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and I feel like it happened with Half-Life: Blue Shift.\n\nHalf-Life is the second and final expansion pack that Gearbox developed for the original Half-Life, and much like Opposing Force, Blue Shift puts you behind the perspective of another Character during the Black Mesa incident. In Blue Shift, you play as Barney Calhoun, a security guard and familiar face to those who've played Half-Life 2. Much like in Half-Life, Barney is starting his day of work at Black Mesa by commuting via tram, and after arriving at his scattered workplace, he gets his gun and presses a button for some rude as hell scientists in an elevator before everything goes FUBAR. As aliens begin teleporting in from Xen, Barney's elevator crashes into the ground, killing every occupant other than himself. Upon regaining conciousness, Barney sets off on a mission to escape Black Mesa, eventually meeting up with a Dr. Rosenberg, and the two partner up to escape the facility.\n\nOne of the greatest criticisms leveled against Blue Shift is that unlike it's sister expansion, Blue Shift does not add in any new weapons or enemies, without even recycling the ones in Opposing Force. Barney also does not gain access to any of the neater weapons that Gordon Freeman was able to get his hands on like the Tau Cannon or the Hive-Hand, the biggest gun Barney is able to weild outside of console commands being the RPG. While these criticisms are certainly valid, it's not fair to say it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Blue Shift is decidedly much more story driven than Opposing Force, as Dr. Rosenberg is a very important character to Blue Shift's story and is one of the few persistant NPC's in the original trilogy. Dr. Rosenberg explains alot of exposition about his old lab in the facility wile also serving as one of the few charaters with the knowledge and equipment to actually escape the facility. \n\nAs such, the latter half of the game consists of Barney doing various errands for Rosenberg to help calibrate his antiquated teleportation machines, such as going to set up a machine in the border world and restoring the backup power deep below the lab. Even though this may not seem all that important, it really does help Blue Shift feel like it's own experience, which is also accompanied by the game's unique handling of Armor. Barney is the only protagonist of the GoldSrc games who lacks a form of powered armor, so he must use the armor of his fallen comrades to protect himself. This can make the game feel really tense as armor becomes less of a second health bar and more of a finite resource which is found few and far between the last.\n\nThat aside, I feel like the strongest point of Blue Shift is it's level design. The enemy placement and the size of the levels is pretty great, and the Xen levels are honestly really well made compared to the ones in Half-Life. While I'd say Opposing Force has the better gameplay of the two, I feel like Blue Shift's level design is much more consistant than OpFor's. Despite this, the other grave flaw with Blue Shift is it's shortness. Blue Shift seems to end just when it's beginning to get really good, and there's some puzzles in the game that don't make alot of sense initially, like the barrel and TNT puzzle.\n\nAt the end of the day, Blue Shift may not be the best Half-Life game and may arguably be the weakest of the expansions, but it's still a Half-Life game, and it's still just a solid shooter in general. The persistant NPC's in the game as well as the level design and the armor tweaks make Blue Shift still a very positive experience overall, and if you liked Opposing Force or just Half-Life in general, you really should play Blue Shift. While less isn't necessarily more here, you can't really go wrong with a bite sized Half-Life.","timestamp_created":1474922888,"timestamp_updated":1474922888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606664538383483887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25712550","author":{"steamid":"76561198019028638","num_games_owned":236,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1449,"last_played":1474908368},"language":"english","review":"Worth a play-through; it's a nice parallel chapter to the original Half-Life storyline.","timestamp_created":1474908656,"timestamp_updated":1474908656,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25705525","author":{"steamid":"76561198306728008","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":356,"last_played":1474867540},"language":"english","review":"Awosome game.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this game, and I looove Herald!!!
