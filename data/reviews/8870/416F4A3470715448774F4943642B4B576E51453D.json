Well you need to buy it on sale and this game has something seriously broken in it. \nIt's the save option and checkpoints. If you die and this is more true in the beginning, you have to walk through the same stuff over and over again and sometimes it will set you back 10 or more minutes.\nIf you quit, after an important cutscene, because believe it or not, people quitgames once in a while to.. well. sleep, eat, school, work.\nYou get to watch that whole cutscene over again.
