The year is 1912 and the floating city of Columbia resigned from the US in 1909.Welcome to Columbia, a utopia in the clouds (the opposite of Rapture which is a distopia under the sea), but like all utopias there are problems.\n\nThe beginning of Bioshock Infinite begins with you on a rowboat with two other people who don't pay any attention to you whatsoever. You go into a lighthouse and at the top there is a chair, you get in the chair. Suddenly the chair becomes a rocket and shoots you up into the air (note that it is pouring rain) and as soon as you get above the rainclouds you see the floating city of Columbia, its magnificent.\n\nBioshock Ininite has a standing chance to float it's way to Game of the Year but the repetitiveness of the combat system is it's dead weight. The combat is extremely fun at first but then gets older and older as the game progresses. Once you meet Elizabeth she can gie you extra ammo, health packs, and salts (used for magic powers). Although this is helpful of her it really makes the game way easier then it should (except on hard). Unlike most AI, Elizabeth is smart, actually smart. She won't stand in a doorway and block you in or wander way off into La-la-land, she sticks with you (most of the time.) Irrational games really worked hard to make Elizabeth the perfect AI. The story in this game is incredible and has the greatest plot twist in the history of video games. You might expect a plot twist but this one will hit you like a baseball to the face. Irrational games really worked hard on this game and you can tell.

The firefights were uninspired bouts of you against massive bullet sponges.  There is little incentive to use your elemental powers as the enemies are easily defeated without.  The combat seems to encourage the use of cover, however it lacks a key component: usable cover.  Each fight is approached the same way, and although the game lets you use your powers to place traps, you will almost never find yourself in a place to use them.  Each fight is a head-on bout of how many bullets of your seemingly infinite supply it will take to progress in the story.\n\nspeaking of the story, it has no focus.  In the beginning, it is a portrayal of a society in the clouds full of religious bigotry and racism.  It soon turns into a completely pointless display of how much Ken Levine knows about theoretical physics, apparently just enough to think he knows what he's doing when he has really only scratched the surface.  Although at times interesting, by the end it does not make sense with itself and still baffles the community and even Levine himself.  The story will leave you feeling empty, as it makes no remark on the social injustice happening in columbia.\n\nThe game tries to do too many stories and fails to complete them effectively, making the whole game feel both unguided and lazily put together.  If there was a more clear direction as to where they wanted to go with the story, it would have been at least redeemable in that aspect.  The gameplay should be completely revamped, as the actual first-person-shooter aspect is neither fun nor rewarding.  Every weapon uninspired, every special ability almost pointless to use.\n\nBioshock: Infinite gets a 2/5","timestamp_created":1388539260,"timestamp_updated":1388539260,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51326066255569458","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8469759","author":{"steamid":"76561197999495272","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":563,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":465,"last_played":1473449450},"language":"german","review":"gute grafik, geile story, geniales gameplay!","timestamp_created":1388539196,"timestamp_updated":1388539196,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8468704","author":{"steamid":"76561197989489407","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1479,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":971,"last_played":1557398264},"language":"russian","review":"взрывоопасное возбуждение","timestamp_created":1388535086,"timestamp_updated":1388535086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8468459","author":{"steamid":"76561198040848925","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":221,"last_played":1626384878},"language":"russian","review":"Я очень люблю эту игру.
