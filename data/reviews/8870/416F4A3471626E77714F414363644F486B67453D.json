Many sections in Columbia are populated with all kinds of people imprinting their own unique expressions in life, from school children, lovers, admen, to vendors. Exploring this splendid city, you will come upon buildings, blocks and even districts teeming with shops that sell all kinds of services and goods such as books, clothes, records, sweets, etc. You will notice people’s interaction by their occasional private gossip, romantic flirtations and beatific smiles in the richest districts of the city.\n\nFrom time to time you can witness eye catching moments of flying buildings, attaching themselves together just like a cruise boat entering a dock, a singing quartet with such a beautiful melody perfectly synchronized, family picnics and children playing around under the warm gleaming sun. Such breathtaking scenery!\n\nThe story occurs in 1912, you play the role of Booker DeWitt, a former soldier and Pinkerton Agent ashamed by his bitter dark past that has tainted his soul with an achingly heavy burden, the only way to cleanse such debt is to accept the deal made by an anonymous client. The agreement falls on the goal of saving a young woman named Elizabeth. The only hassle in the task appears when Booker finds out that the girl is held captive in an enormous tower in Columbia.\n\nElizabeth’s captor is known in Columbia by Father Zackery Comstock (The Prophet), the religious villain dictator who rules over the city, enslaving everybody to obedience. Those who beg to differ with Comstock’s views will be imprisoned for blasphemous actions and statements against Columbia’s laws.\n\nBioshock Infinite focuses most of its efforts in bringing to life one of the most iconic A.I. companions in gaming history. Elizabeth who plays a central role in Bioshock infinite is a dashed complex, naïve, curious, desperate and strong willed character, able to fully interact with other characters and environments around her. She will never abandon the player or make you feel lonely, her main goal is to aid you in combat by opening rifts in time & space and bringing into our world health bottles, money, ammo supplies, gun turrets, grapple hooks and walls for cover. Elizabeth is an overwhelmingly gifted young girl with her psychic powers reaching very high levels. All of Elizabeth’s manifestations allow the player an array of strategic options to deal with sticky situations.\n\nElizabeth’s facial expressions display a wide spectrum of emotions like love, hate, disgust, sympathy, fear and even guilt. She provides the motivation the player needs for the story to move forward, her presence alongside you always bring a new experience.\n\nIn Bioshock Infinite’s combat system the player assumes the field of vision of the protagonist with special abilities that are held on the left hand and fire guns on the right hand.\n\nThe skylines are the new addition and system innovation to the game series. Booker is able to ride the roller coaster rail tracks with the sky hook as a means of transportation in high speeds around Columbia, moving from city block to city block. The Skylines prove out to be highly intuitive, effective in combat and escapes. The games most acclaimed fights arise from colossal wide spread areas.Skylines can serve you as a tactical advantage by simply swooping down on enemies for a surprise attack.\n\nBioshock Infinite bestows the player with various firearms and vigor's you collect along your journey. In-game you are provided with such instruments of devastation that undoubtedly catapults the game to an extreme action oriented FPS. The powers and weapons you possess can be combined to execute a more effective outcome. Some abilities range from electrifying enemies as they wobble around with no motor coordination, commanding a flock of crows to peck enemies to death, setting enemies on fire and watching them scream, delivering lethal attacks with your sky-hook that decapitate your enemies, levitating enemies into the air, dashing at enemies with an explosive impact, knocking enemies with waves of water, to using tendrils that snatch snipers from a long distance. All existent vigors in the game are the following: Bucking Bronco, Charge, Devil’s Kiss, Murder of Crows, Possession, Return to Sender, Shock Jockey and Undertow. For the weapons we can count on the Burstgun, Carbine, Crank Gun, Hail Fire, Hand Cannon, Heater, Machine Gun, Pistol, Repeater, RPG, Shotgun, Sky-Hook, Sniper Rifle and last but not least the Volley Gun.\n\nThroughout the game you will confront extremely challenging enemies, I will only mention the most threatening and heavy hitters in the game which are the following: The Handyman, Fireman, Zealot of the Lady, Mechanical Patriots, The Beast, Siren and the Boy Of Silence.\n\nGraphically the game presents a dayglo, enriched colour template which clearly reveals all the beauty of the game, every area is never the same. All the colours combined blaze the screen leaving any player dazzled in wonder. The city is truly unrivalled with arresting high resolutions textures, including meticulous in-depth faces detailed to near perfection, a heavenly place that any player will desire to experience. The environment and the music vibrate to the storyline, each district contains a unique ambience that accommodates the player to a fantastic adventure provoking new sensations.\n\nBioshock Infinite has reached 11 million sales until this date, making it the most popular game of the series.\n\nInfinite has managed to stamp the gaming Industry with an exquisite avant-garde world containing Sci-Fi architecture splashed with steam punk technology style and with ravishing, mesmerizing and picturesque scenery. All characters deliver evocative moments linked to striking emotional breakthroughs, plus memorable baddies.\n\nBioshock Infinite’s sublime story propels the series to new heights, an accomplishment beyond extraordinary!","timestamp_created":1513595519,"timestamp_updated":1525283981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520958065986633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38396298","author":{"steamid":"76561198220535723","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":53,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":38,"last_played":1528389815},"language":"koreana","review":"밀리터리게임만 좋아하는 내가 이게임을 하게된이유는 세가지다 \n여캐매력충만,통쾌함,스토리 \n겜중 여캐를 보고있자면 현실에서는 여자따위 없는내가 잠시나마 마치 인디아나존스로 빙의 되서 하늘나라를 \n날고있다. 그리고 리볼버로 적을 쓰러뜨릴때 마치 석양이지며 올킬을 하는 느낌의 타격감과 어느샌가 \n굉장히 심오하고 재밌는 소설을 읽는듯한 스토리 덕에 이게임은 나에게 개인적으로 갓겜 추천한다 \n망설이지마라 이건 가즈아아","timestamp_created":1513591730,"timestamp_updated":1513591730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.452019244432449341","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38395495","author":{"steamid":"76561198234204656","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":43,"playtime_forever":503,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":503,"last_played":1513587660},"language":"german","review":"Wundervoll dieses Spiel ;D Die Grafik ist der Hammer! :D wobei ich beim Ende sehr traurig war :(\nSpoileralarm!

É um ótimo jogo para tirar fotinhas e se divertir cm batalhas frenéticas e poderes diversificados, entretanto para os fãs da ideia original de Rapture, é meio que uma exigência comprar as DLCs, e eu honestamente gostei mais das DLCs que do jogo em si, pois elas se passam em Rapture e mostram como era a cidade antes de ser destruída.. e melhor que isso, elas mostram como o Fontaine conseguiu arquitetar todo aquele plano maluco do Bioshock 1, explicando até mesmo sobre o famoso e insuperável \"Would you Kindly\".

girls、百老汇）\n\n因此下文涉及剧透，请注意，但其实并没有什么关系（如果你没玩过这款游戏那么即便剧透其实也不会看的明白）\n\n弯弯绕，绕弯弯谜一般的烧脑剧情，属于越玩越迷糊打穿了游戏变成了智障的经典游戏.\n\n并且我不想对游戏中的女主人公做任何感性评价，可以想见在男性荷尔蒙为主导的电子游戏领域一个塑造成功的女性角色是多么的深入人心，看看其他人的评测就知道了（横向类比的话可参考巫师中的女儿希里和众多女术士以及行尸走肉游戏版中的克莱蒙特，我们身边的狼中的白雪，美国末日中的艾莉，质量效应中的蓝妹，龙腾世纪中的蕾莉安娜，黑暗之魂中的防火女，还有大名鼎鼎的古墓丽影劳拉等等以至于日韩类游戏诸如猎天使魔女中的贝优妮塔和街霸中的春丽与生化危机中的艾达王等以此类推都没有计算在内更不用说良莠不齐的众多文字恋爱类游戏里多如牛毛的女角色群像）所以我对伊丽莎白的评价绝对不会是“我是个纯粹的人，你给我看奶子，我给你钱，就这么简单”这种内容，但从游戏性上来讲伊丽莎白可以称得上是神AI了，没钱给钱，没药给药，没子弹给子弹，开门撬锁、死了复活、绝不卡壳绝不堵门，实在不行就撕开个裂境帮你召唤炮台、盟友、诱饵、血包、贩卖机等等总之是凡所应有无所不有，很多时候的表现要比真人玩家队友还要优秀，使得游戏体验相当不错，俗话说的女儿是父亲上辈子的情人这种事我不清楚，但绝对是贴心的小棉袄。\n那么在开始评价这个游戏之前需要明确几个游戏设定\n1、量子物理学中提及的平行宇宙的概念（包括可说不说的薛定谔的喵）\n2、悖论\n3、常量与定量\n4、鲁特斯兄妹\n\n再有这款游戏玩懂玩透需要不少知识点，我不愿提及游戏中的文化艺术内容完全可以私下查阅相关资料，玩家理解应该不成问题，而关于逻辑设定上的理解则是需要玩家有一个清晰的思路才能理顺，否则极其容易陷入悖论的怪圈，那么我就尝试理清这个怪圈（网络上关于生化奇兵逻辑世界的分析有很多，但除了官方以外都不具有权威性，存在大量脑洞，我写的也不例外，玩家可以对比着参考着来理解）\n一开始的切入点是要搞懂一切就要先搞懂鲁特斯兄妹，否则其他无从谈起（他们是一切的始作俑者）\n鲁特斯兄妹：\n1、鲁特斯兄妹是非常优秀的量子物理学家，大多数时间保持理性，几乎不存在感情用事，哥伦比亚城漂浮天空的技术和穿越时空的机器以及天使塔的虹吸装置都是他们的发明，并且使天父康斯托克拥有可以预知未来的的能力。\n2、后来的鲁特斯兄妹由于被迫害并且预见到哥伦比亚的毁灭，因此决心扭转一切，游戏中的抛硬币、选首饰、送护盾等都是他们在测试主角的行为是否使一切步入正轨。\n3、鲁特斯兄妹是一个人，他们是穿越不同位面的自己相同却又不同的存在，常量与变量的关系。\n4、游戏一开始就遇到让你抛硬币的一男一女就是鲁特斯兄妹，他们会在游戏中多次出现，说的话玄之又玄。\n5、网络对鲁特斯兄妹的分析很多，但往往忽略其是怎样的一个存在，鲁特斯兄妹的能力无法估量，但是可以肯定的是无限接近于神明，他们由于受到康斯托克的陷害（具体缘由玩家可在游戏中了解）在穿越时空的时候被炸弹炸死，并且明确指出肉体消亡，以灵魂的姿态获得了可以在各个宇宙中随意穿行的能力，因为本身是量子物理学家并且没有肉身的束缚，其穿越能力和理解平行宇宙之间的相互作用能力必定远远强于伊丽莎白，并具备干扰各个时空的能力。\n6、鲁特斯兄妹虽然具备干扰各个时空的强大能力但是保持有限的克制是在于所有的一切都是他们的一场实验，通过一定的引导在尽量不干涉当前宇宙环境、人物的前提下观察各个平行宇宙相互之间的作用、影响、关系，后来发现这种干扰会使各个空间产生混乱准备把一切恢复到正轨，但是仍然居于幕后对恢复到额过程进行观察实验。\n7、鲁特斯兄妹通过对本来永不相交和影响的平行宇宙进行有限干涉后发现：\n（1）普通人在穿越多个世界后记忆会发生错乱，造成一部分的记忆丢失，而失去的记忆会让大脑生理本能产生原先没有的记忆来填\n         补空白  一种自我的生理欺骗；\n（2）普通人在穿行多个宇宙后会发生每一个其他位面的自己死去后自己都会流鼻血这种明显的生理症状（与记忆受损有关）。\n（3）普通人穿越多个平行世界后会对身体产生影响，如癌症、快速衰老、不孕不育等。\n 游戏本体的流程不谈，只说结局，因为争议都在这里，生化奇兵无限的原版剧情理解不难（相对于海葬资料片）往往多数争论的环节都在大结局是否所有的伊丽莎白都已经死亡，我的理解是所有的伊丽莎白都死了。还有一个争议点是是否所有的侦探布克和天父康斯托克都已经死了（布克和康斯托克为同一个人在不同宇宙的不同存在）关键就在洗礼环节。主世界的人是侦探布克，副世界的就是天父康斯托克，而造成一个人在不同的宇宙扮演不同的角色就在于是否接受洗礼，接受就会是天父，不接受就是侦探，那么要想消灭天父最好的办法就是在做出选择前杀死自己（布克是这么想的），做出选择之后再杀死是毫无用处的，这也是很多人脑洞认为还有一个世界的布克和安娜以及主世界的伊丽莎白还活着的原因，但是并不存在，再重申一遍，做出选择后的死亡毫无意义。\n\n伊丽莎白在不同世界也有两种身份，当天父的女儿就是伊丽莎白，做布克的女儿就是安娜，而不管是伊丽莎白还是安娜其都是布克在拒绝洗礼后所生，而天父康斯托克由于不孕不育（前面有说原因）是抢的布克女儿并起名叫伊丽莎白，所以在洗礼前淹死布克，那么所有世界的布克和天父，安娜和伊丽莎白都会消失。其实很好理解的剧情可能游戏制作方为了艺术效果卖了个关子，结局布克在洗礼前被淹死后各个世界的伊丽莎白开始逐个消失此时便会黑屏，你是看不到所有伊丽莎白消失完的，只能听到弹琴的叮叮声，每一个叮代表着一个伊丽莎白的消失，叮叮叮到最后一个音符是个咚声，然后就出字幕结束，后面还有一个布克从侦探社桌子上醒来的彩蛋，包括后续DLC海葬中伊丽莎白的再次出现，使得很多玩家对此抱有争议，我不得不佩服游戏制作的精良，尤其是结局模棱两可的设计使得原本绝望的结局有了一丝转机，许多不愿看伊丽莎白如此结局的玩家开始纠结那最后的咚声是不是表示还有一个主世界的伊丽莎白没有死，最后醒来的布克是不是另一个平行世界仅存的硕果，一个只有布克和安娜的世界，这些官方没有给出答案，开放的结局可以使玩家脑洞出不同的答案，因此我所给出的结论是根据游戏既有的内容作出的，尽量不开脑洞。\n\n那么再说海葬剧情，由于我的论断那么海葬剧情一开始出现的成年伊丽莎白似乎和本体结局对不上，但实际是可以联系上的，首先需要清楚的一个误区是海葬的开始并不是接着无限的结局走的，海葬的故事地点发生在生化奇兵一里的销魂城，而这里的伊丽莎白已经成年，是在销魂城生活过相当长一段时间了，甚至还当过歌手，发过唱片，而其在销魂城蛰伏这么久就是为了追杀在销魂城假扮成侦探布克的天父康斯托克（至于为什么假扮，又为什么跑到销魂城来游戏中有讲解，不再复述），但是可以肯定的是既然康斯托克还在那么这个时间线就不会发生在本体结局之后，虽然销魂城是1958年，哥伦比亚城市1912年，但是这里的康斯托克是从另一个宇宙跑过来的，而伊丽莎白一路追过来还蛰伏了很久，因此只要有康斯托克在那么就绝对不会发生在无限结局之后，而是发生在无限结局之前布克救出伊丽莎白摧毁天使塔彻底解放伊丽莎白能力之后，伊丽莎白拥有了全部的能力，全知全能，而康斯托克未死，于是伊丽莎白穿越另一个时空去阻止康斯托克抢夺安娜（海葬一的剧情），布克在洗礼前淹死自己是一个关键环节，一劳永逸的解决问题永久的使康斯托克消失，结束伊丽莎白的苦难（前面我说了，这是布克的想法）伊丽莎白的想法呢？康斯托克与布克在传送门前抢夺安娜也是一个关键环节，伊丽莎白选择传送到这个关键点来阻止康斯托克可以明显看出伊丽莎白的目的并不是一定要消灭康斯托克，她只需要把安娜留在布克身边就好了，这样虽然伊丽莎白会消失，但是他就会以安娜的身份永远的留在布克身边了，康斯托克死活并不重要，这才是伊丽莎白的想法，虽然最后失败了，这才引出康斯托克出逃，伊丽莎白追杀的内容（详见于海葬一的剧情）。\n\n那么海葬一的结尾伊丽莎白还是死了，海葬二一开始又活了，这是怎么回事？很简单，鲁特斯兄妹复活了她，这也是他们在实验中进行一定干涉从而观察结果的研究行为，但是复活的伊丽莎白却能看到自己死去的尸体，用鲁特斯兄妹的原话来说就是你能活过来完全是因为你拥有穿梭不同时空的能力，如果你想回到自己死去的世界那么就必须变成一个普通人。所以复活后的伊丽莎白小拇指没有断也就没有了超能力，但是最后结局伊丽莎白头部受到重击后依然获得了部分预知未来的能力，这一点跟鲁特斯兄妹很像，一样又不一样，不一样又一样，有些会改变，有些却永远不会变，常量与变量。但是随着海葬二最后结局伊丽莎白的死去，可以肯定的是所有位面的布克、康斯托克伊丽莎白全部死亡，无一幸免，接下来就是生化奇兵一的剧情了。\n\n当然仍然有些玩家脑洞认为有另外一个受影响的位面里布克和安娜幸福的生活着，我对此不置可否，毕竟我想这也是游戏想带给玩家的感受，结局存在每一个人的心中，你怎么想，结局就是在怎样的。\n\n常常有玩家把游戏称之为第九艺术，但我认为作为新兴文化的游戏与传统艺术相比仍然有其局限性，毕竟好的艺术作品是需要经受时间的历练，并且随着时代不断地发展和进步，原本服务于少数人的文化艺术拥有更多的渠道被普罗大众所接触和接受，但有别于主观上玩家喜欢把自己痴迷的游戏动不动就贴上艺术品的标签，这本身就是对艺术的亵渎，艺术有多种的表现方式，但是优秀的艺术作品绝对没有这么廉价，可是如果一定要罗列出可以称得上是优秀艺术的游戏作品的话，那么我想生化奇兵应该占有一席之地。\n","timestamp_created":1513554266,"timestamp_updated":1513554266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":69,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.851804554462432861","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38387185","author":{"steamid":"76561198112792715","num_games_owned":2346,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1413,"last_played":1561857467},"language":"russian","review":"10

I had it previously on the xbox 360 and again on pc.  It's a great story driven game that takes the player on a journey.  This game is often criticized for its linear play style and lack of real choices but it really drives home the point of this game for me. The art style of this game is absolutely enthralling and the sound and game design are full of detail.  The game was made even better by the dlcs that add the shoot-em-up galleries to the game, which was something much needed in the game (Though I'd have preferred it came with the game itself).  The second dlc to add to the game was pretty much a game in itself.  So overall I would give this game a positive review.

It's very common in modern shooters, every part of the game is scripted and you can easily tell whether you are in danger or not. In the first 2 Bioshocks, the encounters were surprising and still the combat was good.\n\nStory and Setting\nThe sky-city was really an amazing setting and the graphics were beautiful, but the story lacked a bit creativity. It's this lone wolf guy who doesn't want to show any emotions and then gets paired up with young and ambitious sunshine-girl. They first like each other, then get seperated because of some stupid mistake or a lie - they hate each other - and finally a happy ending where love rules over eveything else.
