Что оставит она после себя? Безусловно многое, но все ли так великолепно? \nИгра однозначно отличная: атмосферная, музыкальная, увлекательная, содержательная. Но она хуже чем первый Биошок во всем, за исключением Элизабет.\n\n[u]Достоинства:[/u]\n1. Атмосфера. Мир хочется исследовать, его хочется понять. В игре много деталей и контента. От фонограмм и диафильмов до челенджевых карт \"битвы в облаках\".\n2. Увлекательный геймплей. Игровая механика неплохая, хотя и хуже чем в первом Биошоке.\n3. Музыкальное сопровождение. Без замечаний. Джаз также хорош, но в Фаллаут он встраивается гармоничнее.\n4. Элизабет. Именно она и делает эту игру. До ее появления в игре, скучаешь и не понимаешь причину выхода этой игры. Но она все меняет. Один из лучших женских персонажей компьютерных игр за все время. Она вносит необычные особенности геймплея. Такого не было нигде.\n5. Неплохие DLC. BS Ep1 мне понравился больше основной истории.\n6. Достижения и коллекционные карточки Steam присутсвуют.\n\n[u]Недостатки:[/u]\n1. Сюжет. Путешествия во времени + паралельные миры = каша. В первом Биошоке был хороший самодостаточный сюжет, оригинальный продуманный сеттинг. Для чего было разрывать мир на части и не оставлять для игрока ничего? Игрока мотает между мирами и временем, даже многочисленные фонограммы, которые я почти все переслушал на 3 раза, не помогают найти в этом мире свое место.\n2. Ролевая составляющая - хуже чем в оригинале. Неинтересные апгрейды оружия и перки для галочки.\n3. Неинтерактивное окружение.

Instead they are revealed gradually over the first three hours of game play, giving the player little in terms of investment in the character’s plight.  There is little in terms of character development either, more a slow reveal of this biography coupled with a drastic change of personality when it suited the developers to synchronise their protagonist’s actions with the likely emotions of the observer.\n\n By the time the player has roused suitable investment in the story at hand, we have already realised that we are merely watching a scripted production.  Every area is a set piece of a theatre, serving as padding between poorly disguised checkpoints and providing little in terms endearment for the by now stagnant game play.

C'est parfait.\n\n[ HS*: D'ailleurs ambiAnce s'écrit bien comme ça, et pas avec un 'e', je ne sais pas qui m'a foutu le tag \"ambiEnce\" mais si je l'attrape je lui arrache ses yeux, j'en fait une marmelade avec ses boyaux et je lui fait bouffer le tout ! P'tain ! ]\nEdit: On dirait bien que depuis mon évaluation ça a été corrigé.\n\nLa deuxième claque que je me suis pris est en début du jeu, où après avoir découvert ce coté idyllique du jeu, celui ci me rappelle brusquement à la réalité avec une violence inattendue, presque barbare ( pov' gars avec la moitié de la tronche arrachée... Même si c'était lui ou moi ).\nPar la suite rien ne déçoit, le gameplay nerveux est extremement bien réalisé, et l'idée de l'aérotram est excellente pour éviter les combats rectilignes présents dans  90% des FPS. L'histoire est excellente, bien qu'assez alambiquée par moment. Et la fin, Oh mon Dieu la fin, je spoile pas, mais c'est grandiose.\nC'est génial de A à Z.\n\nPour les points négatifs, je parlerai de la durée, légèrement courte, et on aimerai continuer à jouer ( c'est d'ailleurs pour ça que je vais sans doute prendre le saison pass, qui rajoute pas mal de contenu ). Ainsi qu'un gros problème de difficulté.\nPour expliquer, j'avais commencer ce jeu en difficulté moyenne, mais arrivé à la moitié du jeu, je me suis rendu compte que je n'étais pas mort une fois, et qu'il n'y avait pas de véritable challenge.\nJ'ai donc recommencé le jeu en difficile cette fois. Et là, plus moyen de faire un pas sans prendre des coups de chaque coté, j'avançais très difficilement et mourrais fréquement. Finalement, arrivé sur un passage particulièrement difficile, et après être mort une bonne vingtaine de fois ( ouais, j'ai pas mal insisté ), j'ai du me résoudre à diminuer la difficulté en moyen. Et hop, j'ai fait ce passage sans problème avec un respawn à 50% de vie du premier coup. Voyez le problème ?\n\nEn clair, la difficulté moyenne est trop simple, ( et je vous parle pas du mode facile, faudra que je teste pour rigoler un peu ) et la difficile est vachement compliqué.\n\nBon voilà, tout ce que j'ai à dire après ça c'est : Go ! foncez !

Even if the game dropped to $15 dollars, I still couldn't recommend it to anyone.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n-Elisabeth, who was the star of all the ads and some revolutionary AI companion was not a crowning example of NPC companions. For all she was to the enemies, an invulnerable ghost, she may as well have been to you. Elisabeth's 'assistance' in combat is of little to no use. Never once did her abilities actually change the tide of combat nor did the items she threw make a difference, they only function as a jarring pause to combat. Whether or not she's with you made zero difference in difficulty. The turrets were, at best, something to draw fire away from you in a game where your HP was insane, and whatever she threw you always ended up interrupting the flow of combat instead of helping.\n\n-There is zero scarcity or resource management elements to the game. Everything at all difficulties is plentiful, and your only real limitations to combat are having 2 weapon slots, so you might be poorly equipped for the job.\n\n-The hard mode is not harder. You're simply forced to be accurate and conserve ammunition if you have a favored weapon, or drop guns to swap them out for something with more bullets once in a while. This is not difficult to adapt to. There is not an ounce of replayability in this game.\n\n-By the time you find your first explosive weapon, the game is over. One shot obliterates anything in the room, and any sidearm of your choice will let you finish it off.\n\n-Your character's powers are extremely underwhelming and always inferior to firearms, and in some cases, melee strikes. An entire avenue of gameplay critical to the series' identity has been neutered. Vigors are weak, useless, limited in uses, and probably need better upgrades to function as intended. The guns do not.\n\n-\"Boss battles\" are recurring enemies later, with no real power spikes for the player to help defeat them easier. They're genuinely non-threatening the first time you encounter them.\n\n\n\nSTORY:\n\n-Elisabeth is a really bad example of likable companions. She was nothing but an annoyance for the entire game, hindered, delayed, and drew out the story with moments of shallow characterization, and never did anything useful for actual gameplay. She was just a plot device serving to over-complicate a disjointed nonsensical thinly veiled Dr. Who fan-fiction, and all of her powers were huge examples of wasted potential narrative and in gameplay.\n\n-CADbortion levels of shifting tones throughout the story.\n\n-I bought into the epic feeling of flying around on the skyrails, not knowing the rest of the game was as linear as the tracks.\n\n-The environments are beautiful, but they also drag you along on a very narrow path with poor obstacles to replace invisible walls, and the interactivity with the environment is almost non-existant. Level design is lacking and doesn't support the narrative at all.\n\n-The antagonist is fought in a cut scene that, thankfully, doesn't have QTEs, but I think this might be the sole exception for where they'd be acceptable so you might feel some involvement in the story being resolved rather than feeling like you're in an out of body experience.\n\n-The thing they expected to be a plot was so full of holes it couldn't even pass for a screen door.\n \n-Imagine an eight year old trying to tell a ghost story; meandering, thoughtless, can't keep a single train of thought. The final fifteen minutes of the game is reserved for attempting to explain away all this weak writing, psuedo-philosophy, and all of the other flaws in the story, but all you get for sitting through it is an unsatisfying conclusion to the story that made all of your efforts pointless. There's no satisfaction, or resolution to the story. Only disappointment as you realized Booker's time was a waste, everything he did was for nothing, and you're left staring at the credit screen feeling the exact same way: Feeling you just wasted an entire day of your life for nothing.\n\n\n\n\nFOUR YEARS LATER:\nHey, look, DLC! \n....And nothing else changed.\n\nI REALLY, REALLY wish Steam had it's current refund policies back when I bought this game. I'd have returned it less than an hour in just due to how many times the damn thing crashed during start-up, or about half an hour after the racist section when I realized that was the pinnacle of decision-making for the entire game.\n\n3/10","timestamp_created":1439579970,"timestamp_updated":1570921652,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17539345","author":{"steamid":"76561198116552639","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":657,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":586,"last_played":1574007413},"language":"english","review":"Very nice game.\nGreat story, very nice gameplay and the combat is just awesome.\nA great variety of guns and different achievements to get.

An amazing story for this game with some interesting twist and an ending that will hopefully make a person think.
