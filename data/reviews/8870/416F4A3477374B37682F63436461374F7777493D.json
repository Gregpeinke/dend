I've never died, but have come very close on a few occasions. The developers have also got their intended moments of sprinting in and out of cover, or rushing to find a new weapon out of me. Overall the game is pretty well-paced.\n\nOnly major complaint is the save system. Checkpoints only, and they can be very (20+ min) spaced out if you're exploring a lot.
