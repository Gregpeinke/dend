When I look back at the past 25 years of gaming I have experienced, this is easily the most standout of all time, across all platforms. It's influence is unparalleled. If there is any part of the game that may feel dated, that's simply because the FPS genre has evolved so much the past 18 years and you can thank this game for it. It's the Citizen Kane of videogames and I will never listen to anyone tell me otherwise. \n\nWith it being an older game I feel like I can't rate it using my normal system, so it's going to get an overal of 10/10 and that's that.

But coming back to it 5 years after that review, and 7 years after I bought it, I decided to finally play the whole thing from start to finish, and it took me 12.5 hours. What an incredible game. Not quite as good as Half-Life 2, but I'm really glad I played this as I can now say I've played all the main Half-Life games (apart from HL:Alyx, of course). Despite the game being 22 years old, it is still incredibly enjoyable if you like fast paced, strategic and first person gameplay. It's really interesting to get a feel for what the Source Engine was developed from, and seriously insane to see the things that a game company like VALVe were capable of creating in the late 90s. There is no doubt that this game changed the gaming industry as a whole - and I would definitely recommend playing it IF you're a Half-Life 2 fan, or just enjoy a good journey.\n\nOriginal Review: Ya know... the feeling when you're in a vent and a Head Crab comes flying at your face.\n10/10 -Zouty \"Still scarier than FNAF\"","timestamp_created":1436264626,"timestamp_updated":1608525761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16922351","author":{"steamid":"76561198120642113","num_games_owned":356,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":779,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":779,"last_played":1419891868},"language":"english","review":"Stop reading this review and get it.","timestamp_created":1436255231,"timestamp_updated":1436255231,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481204330921173096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16921393","author":{"steamid":"76561198234205568","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":272,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":169,"last_played":1589961533},"language":"english","review":"Falling will be your best friend...","timestamp_created":1436248080,"timestamp_updated":1436248080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.434782594442367554","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16920374","author":{"steamid":"76561198055743563","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":123,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":94,"last_played":1570865972},"language":"english","review":"Good Game But...

I just have to play it because I've beaten each installment in the second games series. I DO reccomend this game, but it's not as good as the second in my opinion.

L'environnement et l'histoire sont énigmatiques mais laissent une grande liberté d'interprétation pour le joueur, et d'anticipation pour les développeurs eux-même. Il suffit de voir à quel point Half-life 2 a un scénario qui, a priori, se détache de celui de son prédécesseur.\n\nC'est la marque de fabrique des jeux de Valve en solo, et je pense à Portal tout particulièrement (dans le même univers qu'Half-Life par ailleurs) : l'histoire sert l'environnement du jeu en étant discrète, ce qui permet l'élaboration d'un monde particulièrement attachant, constitué de beaucoup de questions sans réponses.\n\nAu niveau du gameplay, on a des phases de logique jamais frustrantes, des phases de tir parfois relativement difficiles mais incroyablement satisfaisantes, agrémentées d'un IA surprenante pour l'époque dans le bon sens du terme, et une exploitation variée des différents environnements du jeu (je pense notamment aux derniers niveaux). Les ennemis sont assez variés et la courbe de difficulté, bien qu'un peu saillante sur certains passages, reste abordable au commun des mortels.

И всё в ней тогда было замечательно - и сюжет, и геймплей, и графика, и вообще. Игра сразу заработала множество всяких наград, 40 изданий назвали её игрой года, а некоторые - лучшей игрой за всю историю. И вполне заслуженно.\n\nИтак, что же такого в этой игре? Как известно, игра вышла в конце далёкого 1998 года. Главное, чем на тот момент поразила Half-Life - это графика. Модели выглядели просто замечательно, текстурки были хороши, и, что самое интересное - игра вполне себе хорошо шла на большинстве домашних компьютеров того времени. Но не забывайте: Half-Life - это не Срузис, игра держится не только на одной лишь графике. \n\nАтмосфера. В Half-Life это далеко не пустой звук. Valve умело передали картину и настроение тех мест, в которых побывал Гордон. Это не какие-нибудь массовки с декорациями, как в других играх, а действительно настоящая атмосфера. Сложно передать словами то чувство, когда минут 10 блуждал по вентиляциям в надежде найти выход, а потом смотришь на эту вентиляцию со стороны.\n\nТакже достойны внимания сюжет и метод его подачи. Valve придумали нестандартный на тот момент метод подачи сюжета игроку: всю игру мы следим за историей глазами одного местного учёного, звать которого Гордон Фримен. Сценарий таков: накатавшись на вагоничках, включа сигнализацию и испортив еду в микроволновке, Гордон приступает к участию в суперсерьезном суперэксперименте с кристаллом из другого мира в суперсекретной лаборатории Black Mesa. По канонам жанра всё идёт \"ну как-то не так\": через новообразовавшийся телепорт из другого мира появляются эмигранты, стремящиеся навести здесь свои порядки. Правительство это не радует, после чего оно посылает в лабораторию армию - убить пришельцев и учёных заодно, чтобы никому не разболтали об этом инциденте. Фримену предстоит выбраться из Black Mesa, отстреливая военных и местную флору/фауну. Teh end. Да, сейчас сюжет может показаться весьма обыденным, но тогда, после \"кто-то, где-то, зачем-то\" игр, как Quake и Doom, сценарий Лэйдлоу смотрелся более, чем хорошо.\n\nВысокий уровень взаимодействия с окружающим миром - в игре можно безнаказанно включать сигнал тревоги в мирное время, портить еду в микроволновке, направлять авиаудар на самого себя и даже выключать свет в комнате! Развлекаться можно не только пострелушками.\n\nПерсонажи. Да знаю я, что полноценных персонажа всего два, но они тоже хороши. Играем мы за одного из них - Гордон Фримен, в свои 27 он является доктор философии. Полностью молчит, что вначале позиционировалось как способ большего углубления игрока в игру. Второй - G-Man, тот самый человек с синим чумаданом, который всё время появляется в разных моментах игры. Определённо что-то знает, но молчит. Стесняется, наверное. За что и любим.\n\nНу что ж, пора подвести итог. Игра замечательна, как ни крути. Так называемый \"Must have\" для всех любителей шутеров. \nОценка: 10 из 10.\n\nP.S. Я так и не нашёл места для шутки про Гейба, так уж извините.","timestamp_created":1435820668,"timestamp_updated":1435820668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16836550","author":{"steamid":"76561197998906127","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":117,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":117,"last_played":1427591466},"language":"english","review":"It's a half-life game.\nNo need for a review.","timestamp_created":1435801953,"timestamp_updated":1508426942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457317084074020386","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16835537","author":{"steamid":"76561197991173367","num_games_owned":649,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":95,"last_played":1627178842},"language":"english","review":"The game that started it all.","timestamp_created":1435795568,"timestamp_updated":1585442864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16834513","author":{"steamid":"76561198074922870","num_games_owned":2229,"num_reviews":67,"playtime_forever":1005,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":998,"last_played":1416775940},"language":"russian","review":"[i][b]Это не обзор, можно ставить дизлайк ;) [/b] [/i]\n\n[b][h1]Студии Valve снова удалось всех поразить!

Новая графика созданная благодаря движку Source 2. Долгожданное окончание шикарной истории не только серии Half-Life, но и серии Portal. Но самое главное в игре, это геймплей. Здесь Valve превзошли самих себя. Теперь Аликс будет по настоящему живая и иметь в своем арсенале портальную пушку, с которой будет вам помогать при преодолении сложнейших препятствий, а так же в бою. Но ещё мы можем переключить камеру на Аликс и указывать ей что делать. А взять двоих игроков с огромным арсеналом, портальными пушками и отправит блуждать по огромным картам… Просто потрясающий кооператив! А также мультиплеер с другими новыми фишками… Эх, а открытый мир в сюжетной компании…  Это новая легенда! Жаль, что вам придется ещё немножко подождать анонса(2 года), и релиза(+1 год).\n\nОй, это же обзор первой части… Хмм, что же сказать?

Not worth it, in terms of gameplay and plot.\n\nPlaying Half Life makes me really appreciate the huge strides that technology and the gaming industry have made. Not to diss on it, because I understand that this game had made great contributions to gaming, but 5 hours into the game, I'm tearing my hair out because of the controls. It's unbearable. I can't jump high enough, climbing ladders are a complete chore, tight-roping across pipes often leads Freeman to fall to his death...  There were so little directions I often find myself wondering where should I go, what to do, and what actually happened. The graphics were expectedly outdated so perhaps playing its remake, Half-Life: Source, would be a better alternative, one that I missed but was within the buddle. Too late now I suppose. I wouldn't want to replay the first 5 hours again. \n\nI have given up on finishing the game. I'm even considering skipping the expansions and hop on YouTube to watch the playthroughs instead. Maybe I'll install them and try them out. But I'd definitely give Half Life 2 a try.\n\nEDIT: turns out I can jump into Chapter 7 for HL:S. Maybe I'll give it a try!\n\nFor those who told me to \"git gud,\" I can honestly tell everyone that it's not worth it, personally speaking. I'm not one of those haughty gamers with great eye-hand coordination, or those who would choose to spend a lot of time gitting gud at maneuvering in old games but I've played my fair share of games, and if I still couldn't get used to these deficiencies, 5 hours in, I don't plan on improving - improving my skill of adapting to obsolete technology, skills that are not transferable, going forward.
