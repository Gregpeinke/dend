Qui ci troveremo davanti a molte insidie e ci saranno molti colpi di scena durante la nostra avventura.\n[b]Il Gameplay[/b]\nL'ho trovato molto fluido e divertente, non ci si annoia mai. Hanno aggiunto anche il sistema del mirino e il sistema del salto che se non vado errato non c'era nei precedenti capitoli. L'IA nemica è molto sviluppata e vi darà filo da torcere. Stessa cosa per l'IA alleata dove la vostra compagna di viaggio Elizabeth sembra una persona vera in carne ed ossa e vi aiuterà trovandovi armi, munizioni e medikit.

Se non l'avete già capito si tratta di una città sospesa nel cielo. Quindi si cambia totalmente dai capitoli precedenti che erano ambientati sott'acqua. Si potranno vedere anche molte differenze in questa città come per esempio i vari quartieri. Infatti si potranno contraddistinguere i quartieri poveri, ricchi e industriali. Inoltre si potranno vedere le persone passeggiare e parlare tranquillamente, come in una città vera.\n[b]L'equipaggiamento[/b]\nSaremo dotati dei soliti \"superpoteri\" come nei precedenti capitoli con la differenza che ce ne saranno molti di più (es: incenerimento, scossa elettrica, super-spinta e lanciare orde di corvi che divoreranno i vostri nemici). Inoltre potremmo utilizzare anche armi come pistola, mitra e fucile a pompa.\n[b]La Durata[/b]\nIo sono riuscito a finirlo in circa 8 ore.\n[b]Il Doppiaggio[/b]\nIl doppiaggio mi è piaciuto veramente molto e l'ho trovato azzeccatissimo con il carattere e le personalità dei personaggi.\nVOTO FINALE: 90/100\n","timestamp_created":1490310644,"timestamp_updated":1490310644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30694354","author":{"steamid":"76561198280627765","num_games_owned":91,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":2285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1068,"last_played":1503442495},"language":"english","review":"This is by far one of my favorite games of all time.

It still has similar themes, like the rulers vs the oppressed taking place in a beautiful but war-torn city in a strange location. We play as Booker DeWitt, a bounty hunter whose task is to bring back the mysterious Elizabeth, a young woman who can open portals to other worlds.\n\nThe fighting combines unique retro-styled weapons and superpower-like Vigors, which are the equivalent of Plasmids from previous games. Sadly, we cannot keep many weapons, we can only carry 2 as opposed to the previous games where we can carry everything. You can still have all Vigors, though. There are no melee weapons, but Booker can punch and execute enemies with his Sky-Hook.\n\nThe game's artstyle is its strong point. The colorful, steampunk-inspired levels are beautiful, and combined with a unique cartoon-like artstyle. Sadly, there isn't really enough time to enjoy since most of the game is like a fast-paced FPS and it changes from idyllic to war-torn pretty quick. Personally, I would've loved if there were less combat and the war started much later.\n\nThe biggest flaw of this game and the DLCs is the saving system. There is chapter select, but all the chapters are basically autosaves from your latest playthrough. So if you play on the hardest difficulty and one day want to play a chapter on an easier difficulty, you'll have to replay from start. There are also no quicksaves or manual saves. It's a major flaw on such a great game, and I hope no other devs will follow this saving method.\n\nBioShock Infinite was one of the earlier games I played on Steam, and re-writing this review almost 5 years later, the opening is just as beautiful as when I played it the first time.

I liked it overall, but I find it hard to see past it's major flaws. On one hand it's an insanely polished, slick and smooth AAA shooter with amazing visuals. On the other, it's hand-holding, repetitive and casual one with all the tropes and cliches of any shooter made within the last 10 years.\n\nThe gameplay and shooting are great. It feels awesome shooting enemies, but later on they become bullet sponges to the extreme. The reused environments don't help this at all and I could predict easily when a fight is about to break out. Fighting in the same arena three times so I can progress past some artificial boundry is just dumb. Combat is not challenging at all, there is nearly no penalty for death other than losing a bit of cash. If you die, you're right back into it almost instantaneously (with extra ammo to boot.) With no penalty for death all tension is lost and gunfights become boring. This game needs a harder diffculty with better AI that doesn't just increase enemy health. Playing on hard is barely a challenge.\n\n The only time this game shows any semblance of difficulty is when you are tossed into an arena crawling with bullet sponges and no ammo for your weapons. (Which happens more than it should and I doubt that  was fully intended.) A dedicated weapon stand would have helped this issue. Most of my deaths came from handymen who are the biggest bullet sponges of them all and sometimes the game doesn't provide you with the necessary cover/space to evade their cheetah speed attacks. Deaths from these guys always felt cheap to me.\n\n(UPDATE:) There is a HUGE diffculty spike in the last hour or so of the game. What the hell? I've never seen anything quite like this. Nine hours of straight easy, then you have to defend an airship from hundreds of attackers. It was quite jarring being to be honest, but a welcome challenge.) It's almost as if the devs are trying to extend the life of the game as far as they can by making the last stage so much more difficult. It sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nThe power ups and weapons are fun, but most of them are redundant. You can beat the whole game easily by using the carbine and shock jockey almost exclusively. The sniper rifle is too good when it's fully upgraded. Just shock everyone and shoot them in the head. The weapon upgrades are fine, but I hated how some of them are artificially locked until you progress further, it just feels like another linear element put in to give the player the illusion of choice.\n\nThis game also suffers from the same thing any game does that tells a linear story. There are far too many scripted parts that take control away from the character. I was stuck in one part for nearly 10 minutes because I wasn't looking at a book the right way to trigger a short cutscene. This game pretty much plays itself when you aren't in one of the many shooting gallerys. Some puzzles or other mechanics would really help to break up the monotony of the endless shooting.\n\nThe story itself is okay, but nothing really groundbreaking. It's very predictable at times and could really use a better villain with more \"screen time.\" It also seems to drag on way too long, I actually was hoping it would end a couple of times (which is never a good thing.) I'll keep this spoiler free, so I won't go any further. \n\nI can see the appeal of this game and there are parts I really liked in it. It seems I've played far too many linear action fps games ike it in the last decade to fully enjoy it. Maybe I am just spoiled.

Just don't go into this anticipating something attatched to the former two Bioshock games. Rapture does not play a factor in this story at all, not even as a prequel. Which is frustrating. It feels much more like an anthology story with its own world that just so happens to be attached to the Bioshock game title. Remove the Bioshock name and this game honestly could have done perfectly well standing on its own. I am not sure about you, but that frustrates me a bit, since I feel like Rapture could offer a great deal more storytelling. The 'look' and 'feel' of Infinite is so wildly different from the previous two... It really does not feel appropriate to label it as 'Bioshock'. Instead it's more like 'Bioshock if everything was changed completely and also there's wormholes in space and time'.\n\n\nStill... That being said. It's a great game. Great graphics, great voice acting, great story and gameplay. I do recommend it overall. But it does not feel satisfying to call it a 'Bioshock' game.\n\n\n*Update, for clarification and a mild spoiler. I've played the whole game, and the DLC. 2 seconds spent in Rapture at the very end of the game still doesn't grant this much credit under the Bioshock title. And DLC shouldn't be where a game is made relevant to its title series.\n\nI don't hate this game in the slightest but there were some very odd choices made here.","timestamp_created":1490205600,"timestamp_updated":1490307880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30672562","author":{"steamid":"76561198239990950","num_games_owned":160,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":410,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":409,"last_played":1454597981},"language":"russian","review":"Хорошая игра.Особенно концовка.","timestamp_created":1490205455,"timestamp_updated":1490205455,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30671537","author":{"steamid":"76561198157407753","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":146,"last_played":1491113603},"language":"schinese","review":"第一次开头就被牢牢吸引的游戏","timestamp_created":1490201741,"timestamp_updated":1490201741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30671433","author":{"steamid":"76561198198870539","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":645,"last_played":1490200326},"language":"russian","review":"Чуваки, всем рекомендую, концовка просто нереальная.","timestamp_created":1490201361,"timestamp_updated":1490201361,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30671084","author":{"steamid":"76561198306732744","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":559,"last_played":1571374651},"language":"schinese","review":"游戏画面运用童话风格加上游戏时代背景的音乐，这代的剧情和DLC剧情应该说是给整个系列的完整性做了交代。","timestamp_created":1490200039,"timestamp_updated":1490200039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30671039","author":{"steamid":"76561198180458501","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":573,"last_played":1587246790},"language":"polish","review":"It`s an amazing game with great graphics and low computer requirements, which let`s you discover the amazing city of Columbia and make the most bad-ass plays with your super powers and weapons. 9/10","timestamp_created":1490199833,"timestamp_updated":1490199833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30670845","author":{"steamid":"76561198288834440","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1084,"last_played":1648394768},"language":"russian","review":"просто офигеная игра !!\nя с этой серией игр познакомился в 2010, когда вышла бэта версия BIOSHOCK INFINITE .

game. Yes, it is not the game of the early trailers which is unfortunate but the end product is still overall pretty good. The story is definitely one of the best I have encountered, better than the original Bioshock in some regards. My main complaint is the combat can feel pretty dull and repetitive. There's vigors (same as plasmids basically) but they don't really seem to be as useful in combat as they were in Bioshock 1 & 2. You can absolutely beat the game without using them so I wish they felt more useful. The same can be said about the gear you collect, I didn't use but maybe a quarter of it. I don't mind linear games but I prefer games where strategy is key to progressing through the levels and I felt like most of the time I could just run and gun and still win without much difficulty.

I would put it at the level of Half Life in those aspects. I mostly bought the game for the story and the style/graphics but I would say that if you are a fan of FPS games then this is also a game for you. I know I am a little late and all with playing this game, but if you are reading this review I would argue that you are too so u can't get me there. I would definitely put this as a must play, but everyone has their own opinion. I will also answer the most crucial question: Do you have to play the previous 2 games to understand the story? The answer is a simple no, although I would recommend either reading up on the story or watching some story videos on YouTube if you are interested. I would give this a 10/10 even though I haven’t finished the game if it wasn't for one thing. This game shamelessly promotes doing bathsalts and accepting drinks from strangers in a way that worries me, however this can be overlooked by pretending that you are some magical superman person, but I don't like fooling myself and accepted this unfortunate decision for what it is. I think that anyone that thinks about playing this game so long after it's relevancy in the gaming community definitely should.
