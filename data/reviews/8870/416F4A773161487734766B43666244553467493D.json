The Game play was based more around a lot more running around and being less of a tank for bullets even during the late game, The story was confusing at first, but started to make sense later in the game even though in the end its hard to compare with the first and second game of the Bioshock Trilogy. If you like the Bioshock universe you will still like the third in the Trilogy as they all link together as one, but if you prefer more interesting game play and environment I preferred the other two more than the third. \n\nThe Pieces I could not appreciate was the annoyance of having the ability to only pick up 2 weapons at a time, which felt wrong with how many times I needed to use a specific weapon at a certain time, to which I did not have it. The shield was interesting, but I preferred having the ability to hold med packs on me as I fought to which there became an advantage in looking around for extras. Also the hacking was useless as before you can make an army of defenses turn to your side, but instead they just decide to work only for a couple seconds to then be shooting you in the back of the head afterwards. The Alternate Reality was the only piece that was interesting, but it came up dry as you can just spawn in the same pieces over and over again until the area was cleared of foes, I saw potential but in the end I preferred relying on my own ability instead of Elizabeth. Elizabeth constantly throwing ammo, salts, health, money, etc... at me was also quite annoying even though helpful, I would have preferred to rely on what I found instead of her just generating such ammo and equipment out of thin air making some areas where I should have died less of a challenge.\n\nThe only piece that was fun and enjoyable was the connection of Rapture to this whole Bioshock Universe and the fun world they built up, very creative and original.\n\nFinally the Downloadable Expansion Chapters was interesting as well. The first Chapter was similar to the Main Game and still yields the same results, the second Chapter being a sneaking around style game had much potential, but fell short of games like Dishonored and Thief that have a better vibe. In the end I played through all expansions just to have the nostalgic trips back into the amazing universe of rapture that I once survived through long ago.\n\nIn the end I still would suggest this purchase as It does finalize the Bioshock Trilogy even if this game does fall short from the other two. 6/10","timestamp_created":1622773465,"timestamp_updated":1622773465,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93142231","author":{"steamid":"76561198273515154","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1280,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1111,"last_played":1623460537},"language":"english","review":"Not as good as the first or second Bioshock games, and you don't need to play those to understand the storyline of this one.

Najlepsza gra z serii Bioshock, niezwykle wyróżniająca się na tle poprzednich dwóch, a jednak z nimi bezsprzecznie związana i spójna - poprzez mechanikę, ale i opowieść. Infinite wygląda i brzmi obłędnie. Jest czarujące, hipnotyzujące, a wspaniałe widoki jeszcze silniej kontrastują z poznawanym dystopijnym światem i tragedią, jaka spada na głównych bohaterów i zwykłych ludzi. Bioshock zawsze poruszał trudne tematy społeczne, więc i w trzeciej odsłonie od nich nie stroni - rasizm, religijny fanatyzm czy ideały, które przeradzają się ostatecznie w źródło cierpienia. \n\nW Infinite gra się też o wiele przyjemniej niż w pierwszą i drugą część, bo nie dość, że zachowano świetny pomysł na plazmidy/wigory łączone z tradycyjną bronią, to jeszcze rozwinięto tę mechanikę i dopieszczono do tego stopnia, że możliwych kombinacji przy wykorzystywaniu tych narzędzi jest cała masa, a każda szalenie satysfakcjonująca. \n\nNie zapomnę nigdy emocji, jakie towarzyszyły mi podczas pierwszego odkrywania opowieści i poznania jej finału. Porywająca i poruszająca fabuła to znak towarowy Bioshocka, ale Infinite pokazało, że twórcy gry są geniuszami, którzy nie tylko stworzyli ciekawą treść, ale też odpowiednio ją przedstawili - wszystkie informacje dawkowane na tyle, by wzbudzać ciekawość z każdym kolejnym zdobytym puzzlem, a i tak nic nie przygotowuje na finalne uderzenie. Tak, Bioshock Infinite porwał mnie i kupił całą. Jest wiele znakomitych gier, ale to takie tytuły udowadniają, że gry to medium dojrzałe, potrafiące wstrząsnąć umysłem i sercem do głębi równie mocno, jeśli nie bardziej niż inne media.\n\nPS Sekwencja otwierająca grę: światło i dźwięki zasypujące wieżę oraz przejście przez świątynię można zaliczyć do czołówki najlepszych otwarć w grach czy w historiach wszelkiego typu w ogóle.","timestamp_created":1622760141,"timestamp_updated":1622760141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93132328","author":{"steamid":"76561198964243160","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":485,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":482,"last_played":1630167315},"language":"english","review":"Brain fucked","timestamp_created":1622756963,"timestamp_updated":1622756963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93131170","author":{"steamid":"76561198297387059","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1636864255},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy bueno. jugabilidad satisfactoria y una historia de locos","timestamp_created":1622755281,"timestamp_updated":1622755281,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93130751","author":{"steamid":"76561198076511166","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":722,"last_played":1622754411},"language":"english","review":"Dunno why I had this sit on the shelf for all these years, this game is a gem!","timestamp_created":1622754734,"timestamp_updated":1622754734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93130515","author":{"steamid":"76561198385701312","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":813,"last_played":1622755143},"language":"spanish","review":"No es infinito, es puro marketing, pero esta piola","timestamp_created":1622754427,"timestamp_updated":1622754427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"93128351","author":{"steamid":"76561198052694676","num_games_owned":405,"num_reviews":77,"playtime_forever":996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":996,"last_played":1622750335},"language":"english","review":"7/10\n\nGood game, it delivers what you expect from Bioshock family.

loved this game so much, it's absolutely on par with how phenomenal Bioshock 1 was in terms of gameplay and story! The world building was fantastic, and it's very easy to lose yourself in the city of Columbia because of how detailed and gorgeous it is. I would definitely come back to this game just to spend a little more time exploring the city and the audio logs. Overall, the story was compelling and you end up getting really attached to the characters too (not to mention the jaw-dropping ending)\n\nAside from the story, I really enjoyed the weapons in this Bioshock more than the other games. I found myself picking favorites, especially in combination with the different vigors (plasmids) you're given access to. You don't even need to play the other Bioshock games to enjoy this one, it rarely references the others and it has a totally different story.
