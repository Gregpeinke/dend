I remember hearing about how good this game was until I thought, \"Okay, I gotta play this game...like, NOW.\" I can truly say that I don't regret spending even a cent on this game one bit. Though the graphics are a little outdated, the game mechanics are very good and the story/plot is VERY intriguing. Everything about this game, from the different worldly settings and unique characters to the broad story line, is awesome and very well-made. I truly admire how Valve's employees really wanted to kick off their growing company by making such an immersive game. Thank you for helping me see the \"great beyond\" in its true reality, Valve!

More details were noticeably added to polygon graphic along with more actions performable by characters, including mouth movement while talking. Enemy soldier AI had also become revolutionarily smarter as they were able to take cover when underfired and to dodge grenade when tossed.\n\nMany parts of the game may be dulled as this game is all about survival, pathfinding and fighting monsters. Occasional combats against enemy military soldiers do add more challenge and excitement to the game.\n\nEven though new players are advised to play the remake version, Black Mesa: Definitive Edition, alternatively for better experience on the same storyline, this original version has already been remembered by old timers as one of legends.","timestamp_created":1632541936,"timestamp_updated":1645022618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99916360","author":{"steamid":"76561198141687337","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":1033,"playtime_last_two_weeks":18,"playtime_at_review":791,"last_played":1660473793},"language":"brazilian","review":"Jogo ótimo","timestamp_created":1632541371,"timestamp_updated":1632541371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99915106","author":{"steamid":"76561198802406358","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":173,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61,"last_played":1632940754},"language":"english","review":"its half life.","timestamp_created":1632539158,"timestamp_updated":1632539158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99914681","author":{"steamid":"76561198385740297","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":949,"last_played":1610301133},"language":"turkish","review":"I have recommended your services to my e-e-e-e-employers and they have authorize me to offer you a job they agree with me that you have limitlessss potential.","timestamp_created":1632538404,"timestamp_updated":1632538404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99912127","author":{"steamid":"76561199089752627","num_games_owned":44,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1648891654},"language":"english","review":"remember to play half life","timestamp_created":1632533697,"timestamp_updated":1632533697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99910844","author":{"steamid":"76561199011886100","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5630,"last_played":1659092462},"language":"english","review":"One of the best fps ever made, Its just unbelievable to think that 5 years after the original doom game was this.","timestamp_created":1632531155,"timestamp_updated":1632531155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99907507","author":{"steamid":"76561198235081252","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":664,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":298,"last_played":1633284934},"language":"english","review":"Classic","timestamp_created":1632524478,"timestamp_updated":1632524478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"99904058","author":{"steamid":"76561199112547531","num_games_owned":59,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3094,"playtime_last_two_weeks":215,"playtime_at_review":1595,"last_played":1660588126},"language":"spanish","review":"Un juego que a pesar de ser publicado en 1998 logra revolucionar las aventuras en 3D, gran catalogo de NPC's y de equipamiento, una trama diferente a la de los demás juegos de la época, y añadidos como conversaciones con aliados, y puzzles que van mas allá de buscar llaves para puertas como en Doom o Quake, diseños de niveles casi realistas, aunque innovadores para la ciencia ficción, sin duda mejores que los de Doom, a la par con los de Quake 2.
