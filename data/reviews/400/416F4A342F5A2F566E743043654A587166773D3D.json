Nous contrôlons le personnage de [b]Chell[/b] et nous devrons donc réussir à passer les tests de GLaDOS, à l'aide d'une arme emblématique du jeu-vidéo, le [b]Portal Gun[/b], qui permet de générer des portails et se téléporter à différents endroits du test. Notre but est d'arriver au bout de ces tests, et de sortir de ces labos, en vie.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nUn jeu de réflexion d'un nouveau genre, qui se joue en FPS, et dont les seuls mouvements possibles sont : Générer des portails, marcher, et porter des objets. Ces mécaniques simples nous permettront d'avancer dans les salles de test, qui se compliqueront au fur et à mesure. En effet, plus on avance dans les tests, et plus on voit de nouvelles technologies apparaître et à assimiler. Les barrières qui désintègrent les objets, les sphères d'énergie, ou encore (et ça c'est de la physique), se servir de notre vélocité pour atteindre des plateformes beaucoup trop lointaines.\n\n[h1]GRAPHISMES[/h1]\nLe jeu commence à dater, il s'approche en effet des 10 ans (s'il ne les a pas déjà), les graphismes prennent donc un coup par rapport aux différents jeux que l'on peut sortir. Mais pour Portal, on est tellement bien plongé dans l'univers (qui est le même que [b]Half-Life[/b]) que les graphismes nous importent peu, et qu'ils sont largement suffisants pour profiter pleinement du jeu.\n\n[h1]DUREE DE VIE[/h1]\nMalheureusement, c'est là où le jeu a du mal. Pour finir l'histoire principale, il faut compter entre 2 et 3 heures, ce qui est vraiment peu. Le jeu essaiera tant bien que mal de se rattraper avec des salles de test avancées (qui sont les mêmes salles que celles de l'histoire mais en plus compliquées, avec des contraintes supplémentaires), et les défis. Ces fameux défis. Ils reprennent les salles de test 13 à 18, en obligeant le joueur à faire le moins de pas, le moins de portails, et le moins de temps. On en reparle dans le point suivant.\n\n[h1]DIFFICULTE[/h1]\n\"PUTAIN ! MAIS POURQUOI CA M'A COMPTE UN PAS POUR RIEN?!\" ou encore \"ALLEZ, J'AI FAIS 11 PAS POUR 10, PUTAIN DE JEU DE MERDE\". Voilà les différentes répliques que vous pourrez utiliser lorsque vous essaierez d'avoir tous les défis en Or. J'ai préféré ne pas tout consigner ici. Pour avoir les médailles d'or, il faudra recommencer, encore et encore et encore, pour faire ce qui est demandé, ce qui pousse à sauvegarder dès qu'on a franchi une étape d'une salle et que notre nombre de pas est potable. Pour ce qui est du jeu principal, la difficulté s'accroit au fur et à mesure, mais rien de bien exceptionnel. Les salles de test avancées pourront parfois donner du fil à retordre.\n\n[h1]AVIS[/h1]\nTrès bon jeu de réflexion, mais surpassé (et c'est tout à fait normal) par [b]Portal 2[/b], qui reste, selon moi, indétronable.\nUn peu court à mon avis, mais c'est compensé par l'humour présent dans le jeu, à travers les répliques de GLaDOS et des tourelles.

Although the pros outweigh the cons (and because, when buying the Portal Bundle on sale, the game costs maybe 40 cents), there are some things that make me want to slap the developers across the face.\n\nBut let's start this off with typical [Attribute] [Score] system.\nSound and Music: 7/10 - Sounds are completely uninteresting. Music, although rather scarce and definitely not something I could listen to out of context, creates a rather claustrophobic, unsettling atmosphere. Where the music's present it fits and sounds well, however for the most part there's barely any music playing. Still Alive remains one of my favourite songs in games to this day.\nVisuals: 7/10 - I wouldn't call this game pretty, but I wouldn't call it ugly, either. Just like with sounds, it's implemented well, but the game's design doesn't create any places where I could say \"Ooh, pretty\" or \"Ugh, ugly\".\nGameplay - 9.5/10 - This game is made in Source engine, just like almost all Valve games (this includes titles like Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Portal 2), so if you've played any of them, the controls will be familiar to you. The main gameplay component of the game, Portals, is incorporated well, with pretty much the whole game being the tutorial, constantly presenting you with new gameplay mechanics and letting you get accustomed with them, all the while presenting you with more complex and difficult puzzles.\n\nKeep in mind that the game is quite short. Playing through the game once will take no more than 2 hours, while getting every achievement will take about 10 hours (or a lot more, if you decide to not look up guides for the challenges), and, unlike Portal 2, it doesn't have access to fanmade content, so the replay ability is nearly non-existent. The main game is entertaining from start to finish, and the advanced chambers (of which there are six) provide an extra challenge and finishing them feels rewarding. There is another addition to the game, though, which consists of 6 test chambers with 3 different challenges; Least Portals, Least Steps and Least Time, all of which have three different medals (and 3 achievements associated with those medals), depending on how well you accomplish them. This part of the game made me want to post a \"Not Recommended\" review. Am I just too bad to complete these? I consider myself \"in the middle\" when it comes to skill in this game, meaning I'm not good, but not bad, either. The problem isn't that some of these are hard puzzles - the problem is that many of these require either glitches, or solutions so elaborate, that you'd need an IQ of 150 or higher to come up with them without help from online videos and guides. For example, the Least Time challenge for Chamber 16 requires you to use a glitch (not a trick, a glitch) that makes you go through walls and skip 70% of the puzzle. How do I know that it [b]requires[/b] you to do that? Because when you do it, you're not left with a lot of extra time - you can actually fail quite often, if you're just a second or two too slow. The challenges for Least Footsteps and Least Time in Chamber 18 require you to... use a computer case available in a semi-hidden room to jam the exit door, so that you don't have to retreive the box, skipping about 50% of the puzzle. Not all challenges are like that, some of them just require elaborate moves and clever thinking, but some of them just take it too far and require you to exploit glitches or use mechanics not even touched upon in the original game to have any chance of getting a silver or gold medal.\n\nOverall, if you're a casual gamer who won't try to complete the game in 100%, then buy this game and enjoy it. However, if you like getting every achievement, then this game will test your patience and resourcefullness to its limits.","timestamp_created":1500152013,"timestamp_updated":1500152013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33568442","author":{"steamid":"76561198160502548","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1482622385},"language":"english","review":"Its a good game :P Lots of fun and plotwists xD 7/10 (Buy it on sale xD )","timestamp_created":1500151970,"timestamp_updated":1500151970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33567115","author":{"steamid":"76561198080924277","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":123,"playtime_forever":145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":145,"last_played":1500135901},"language":"english","review":"The game that started \"The cake is a lie\" meme.

It's a game worth digging up every few years, replaying the levels and enjoying the narration.\n\nThe puzzles are wonderfully logical, yet require a pinch of dexterity and timing. With every level, the complexity increases incrementally so that finding and executing the solutions holds a good balance between challenge and success. After completing certain levels of the main game, advanced versions of those levels with revised conditions or levels with goal-based challenges can be played.\n\nSubject to its setting, Portal builds a visually and aurally dense atmosphere. Besides the fitting ambient sound, the voice acting is superbly done. Thanks to the witty dialogue written for her, the narrator and antagonist GLaDOS is hilarious. Also, the catchy credit song “Still Alive” still gets to me on a monthly basis ...\n\nThe only nitpicky nuisance in the game is the typical Source engine carrying technique. Accidentally letting go of picked up items because of jumps or weird collision detection can be mildly frustrating. Apart from that though, Portal is perfect.\n\nPortal should be in everyone's library, as it's nothing short of a timeless epitome of PC gaming.","timestamp_created":1500040337,"timestamp_updated":1500040337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531835198402404785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33535444","author":{"steamid":"76561198123210172","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":403,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":245,"last_played":1583701215},"language":"turkish","review":"Oyun gerçekten güzel bir oyun.Bilgisayar oynarken azıcık beynime destek vermek iyi oldu :D.\nOyun gerçekten kısa sürede bitirilebilir ancak bu güzelliğini etkilemiyor.","timestamp_created":1500037237,"timestamp_updated":1594694787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33534603","author":{"steamid":"76561198104970096","num_games_owned":626,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":704,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":329,"last_played":1556015979},"language":"schinese","review":"PORTAL 格拉多思  still alive","timestamp_created":1500034350,"timestamp_updated":1500034350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33533872","author":{"steamid":"76561198113977027","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":198,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":198,"last_played":1499650398},"language":"english","review":"One of the bests conceptual games I've ever played!
