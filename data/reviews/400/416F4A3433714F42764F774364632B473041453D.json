The replay value is high, especially with the fun achievements and brain twisting extra challenges. The story, although very interesting, you actually can't understand all of it from just playing the game, which is frustrating because the story is REALLY good.

Portal est vraiment beau pour son age.\n\n- Une histoire a couper le souffle. Portal a ce que d'autre puzzle game n'ont pas : Une bonne histoire, que dis-je, une excellente histoire.\n\n-Et dans une histoire, il y a des personnages.

Luckily, there are numerous maps for puzzle verterans [/h1]\n\nRecently, one of my friends (and a writer here) and I have taken up a bit of a co-op technique for going through shorter games. No, not playing the typical multiplayer style, but rather playing games we’ve never played over discord calls. This allows us to have company, while getting feedback from each other on the game. Sometimes even helping each other through certain parts (although it’s usually him helping me 😂) (how cute😊)\nThis time, we played through Portal. \nI will be referencing my 10 game commandments, alongside Bootyous’s review style today.\n1. Gameplay\n2. Story\n3. Characters/World\n4. Graphics\n5. Sound\n6. Optimization and bugs\n7. Price Value\n8. Replay value\n9. Memorability \n10. Of course, enjoyment and fun!\n\nI’ll have to say, funny enough, since this is one of the most renowned aspects of the game, the actual gameplay itself for me, was not my favorite. But honestly, I’m not too big a fan of puzzle games, so that’s another big reason. Most normal intelligence people will certainly find enjoyment in Portal. The game guides you through fairly gently, but eventually has quite challenging puzzles. Related to the gameplay, I have my own biggest reason for not fully enjoying this game, but I will get to that later. \n\nI love how the world and characters of this game are so wonderfully subtle, it makes you really want to know everything this game has to show you. And oh gosh, the “characters.” Despite the best interactions being with inanimate objects, I have not had such memorable connections with video game characters in a long while, and golly it is refreshing. In fact I think I’ll buy my own companion cube and turrent soon..The world, is also very fitting, having that painfully sterile air to it, but for being a test subject, it makes sense. \n\nPortal uses the GoldSrc engine, same as Half-life, so it uses many of the same assets, so the graphics are just as good as the engine, which was amazing for its time. (And I think still is)\nI don’t remember much of the music during the game itself, my brain was too busy getting racked around puzzles, but the ending song. Oooooh\nEven after a couple of days after playing the game, IT’S STILL STUCK IN MY HEAD! AND I LOVE IT! I’m adding it to my mixtape-\nAlso just going to note, I did not find any bugs, so that’s great! And it of course ran a crispy 240 fps on my computer. \n\nGetting a lovely score of 90 on meta critic, shows this game is a bit memorable and innovative like most Valve titles. Including what you unravel in the world and experience, it is quite unique. As for replayability, the sequel does have Steam Workshop, (this one does not) but it does have bonus levels in the game, and if you got the Orange Box bundle that comes with Portal: Still Alive, which I believe has 14 new bonus stages. Now for the price. For some, spending $10 on a 5-hour experience may not be that amazing, but Steam with its legendary sales and all, definitely includes their own titles which get discounted to a dollar. If you buy em’ for console physically at let’s say GameStop, they are definitely going to be that cheap as well. Great value! Overall, I enjoyed every aspect of the game, except some parts of playing it. A bit weird huh? Well, I (and probably many others) sometimes experience nausea or lightheaded-ness playing certain games. It was very prevalent here for me. While it took a good 3 and a half hours for it to set in, it was not pretty. That was the only reason I couldn’t finish this in one sitting with Bootyous (props to you man for beating it in one go)\nAs Bootyous mentioned before about me, It really sucks that a glaring flaw in a game is experiencing physical suffering when it’s not really its fault. In conclusion, every aspect in the game may not be the best ever, but there is certainly good enough in every corner of the game for a gamer to enjoy. Highly recommend for puzzle-lovers, casual gamers, game history-lovers and even us backlog brawlers with so much to fight! 👍 (Also, you guys should try playing single-player games with your friends, it’s a blast!)\nSee ya’ll! Imma rest in my homemade pod, until GLaDOS comes to try and eat my soul again. \n\nPROS-\n-Unique and Innovative puzzle gameplay\n-Dark humor and cute inanimate objects\n-Subtle story that leaves you wanting more\n-Glorious Goldsrc engine\n-Still Alive\n-No bugs found\n-Bonus levels\n-Frequently cheap\n\nCONS-\n- Strict on method of puzzle solving\n- Story does not go very in-depth\n- Crusty character model\n- Not much other music through the rest of the game\n- Can potentially give certain gamers nausea/light-headed-ness\n\nJERSIE’S GAME RATING: 8.9\n\nRating specifics:\n1.
