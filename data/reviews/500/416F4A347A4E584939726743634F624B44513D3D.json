Ultimately one of the most fun games I’ve had with friends is so amazing to just mess around in, meet new people, challenge one another in versus, try for the achieves, etc. Although this game is quite old and has seriously lacking content compared to L4D2 which is seemingly L4D1 but better in every way possible I would recommend not buying this game and getting L4D2 instead as it has all the maps from L4D1 and more…\n\n+4 player online co-op\n+Campaign where you have to survive against countless zombies and various special infected progressing through levels trying to escape in the end\n+Special infected certain zombies have special abilities making them more deadly than the normal zombies\n+Very team dependent and using teamwork is very important making it a lot more fun with how cooperative it is\n+Survival where you can try and survive as long as possible in a single map with limited supplies\n+Versus where you can do a 8v8 PvP gamemode where one team is the infected playing as the special infected and the other are survivors. Survivors have to try and get as far as possible in the level as the infected have to try and kill them asap. Whoever gets the farthest gets the most points and lots of fun.\n+Tons of campaigns\n+Funny characters and you can vocalize them often\n+Sprays :)\n+Steam Cloud\n+$2 on sales\n+Stats\n+Modded servers allowing you to use all kinds of fun cheats like being invincible, flying, being able to build bases, being infected, having 10+ survivors, etc. \n+Can enable cheats in public matches as the host lol\n+Able to play as the tank is so awesome\n+Can shove zombies away from you\n\n-As you can expect for a 10+ year old game with a much better sequel this games player base is lacking and finding games is relatively low let alone having others join is very rare. You are lucky to see more than 5 games in any gamemode category let alone having anyone actually join you mid match. This game is very old and the majority of the playerbase is playing L4D2 instead. I would recommend to not expect to find many games or to have many join you but to play privately instead or to just not expect any other players\n-This game states that it has remote play which I’m already telling you does not work. L4D2 has no split-screen capabilities even though it’s hidden within the games files it takes way too much messing with the games files to get to work. With that I can only assume that this game is the same. Do not expect to be able to do split-screen nor remote play in this game. You could on the Xbox but not on Steam. \n-This game is actually really pointless to buy due to the fact that the sequel Left 4 Dead 2 has everything in this game and more. L4D2 has all of the L4D1 maps, characters, and weapons. Including all the new maps, mods, new gamemodes, and bigger playerbase, etc. Therefore this game isn’t worth buying when the sequel is everything and better. \n-Several times when punching a car as a tank the car will just freeze in place and will never be able to be moved\n\nL4D is a classic zombie and co-op game and honestly I made so many friends in this game. It is one of my favorites because of all the memories and people I met playing this. However this game isn’t worth buying due to the fact that L4D2 has everything this game has and more. Still though nothing wrong about this game besides its dying playerbase still top tier though. \n\n","timestamp_created":1344197149,"timestamp_updated":1624721740,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5185942","author":{"steamid":"76561198046113271","num_games_owned":673,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":2145,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1832,"last_played":1653167195},"language":"english","review":"Back in 2010, I used to play the living hell out of this game on my Xbox and I probably have more than 100 hours on it.
