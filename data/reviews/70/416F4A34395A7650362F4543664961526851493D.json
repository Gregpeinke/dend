The addictive yet simple combat, atmospheric music, engaging setting, and old, yet pleasing visuals always leave me to come back for playing this game over and over again. Half-Life was one of Valve's first games, but it's also still one of their best, and that says a lot.","timestamp_created":1588491686,"timestamp_updated":1588491686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510638296604156494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68477537","author":{"steamid":"76561198987464129","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":40,"playtime_forever":2547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":7,"playtime_at_review":1562,"last_played":1660502084},"language":"english","review":"1","timestamp_created":1588489593,"timestamp_updated":1603602715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68476062","author":{"steamid":"76561198122559512","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1262,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":723,"last_played":1645142052},"language":"japanese","review":"1998年のゲーム・オブ・ザ・イヤーを総なめにし、その圧倒的な没入感と臨場感でFPSの歴史を作った名作・ハーフライフ。HL2に続いて遅ればせながらレビューさせていただく。\n\n[h1]グラフィック[/h1]\n22年前のゲームを現在のものと比べるのは流石に酷である。しかし、引き込まれる雰囲気のゲームと相反するようにディテールが粗いところは気になった。しかし、研究所、屋外、異世界といった景色の変化は楽しむことができ、モンスターの造形は工夫されているように感じる。\n\n[h1]ゲームプレイ[/h1]\nこのゲームの魅力は敵を倒すことだけではない。これまでのFPSは言ってしまえば高い火力で敵をなぎ倒していくようなものが多かったが、主人公は1人の研究員。時には敵から必死で逃げ、時には隠れ、時には回りを見渡してギミックを活用しなければいけない。ギミックとは言っても難しいパズルのようなものは無く、「漏電していて通れないのでスイッチを切る」など。説明が無くても現実世界の理屈が通用するようになっている。\nそれでも迫力の戦闘シーンも忘れてはならない。異世界からやってきたモンスターに追い詰められる切迫した状況や海兵隊との大規模戦闘と、手に汗握る戦いがゲームを通して展開される。\n戦闘、アクション、パズル、そして後述のストーリーがバランス良く融合したゲームプレイはプレイヤーを飽きさせず、気付けばゲームの世界へと引き込まれる構成になっている。\nゲームの難易度は新しい武器が手に入るごとに上昇していき、新たなギミックも登場する。これにより長編ゲーム特有の「中盤がダレる問題」を感じることはなかった。モンスターたちは倒しやすいが強力、海兵隊は秀逸なAIでプレイヤーを襲撃するといった特徴があり、全体的にチャレンジングだった。異世界のエネルギーや兵器に対峙する研究員という構図を忘れさせない難易度だったともいえる。\nちなみにUIもボイスも日本語化されておらず、字幕もない。Modを入れることで日本語化できるが、バニラでプレイする場合は多少の英語力が必要になるかもしれない。\n\n[h1]ストーリー[/h1]\nプレイヤーが主人公のゴードン・フリーマン研究員としてブラックメサ研究所の通勤トラムに乗るところからゲームは始まる。ムービーではないので辺りを見渡すことができ、主人公視点からブラックメサの日常を垣間見ることができる。以降もゲームは全て1人称で進み、リアルタイムにストーリーの展開を目撃することになる。演出をすべてプレイヤーの目に焼き付けるそのスタイルが、高い評価を生んだともいえる。\nストーリーに話を戻す。研究室に到着したフリーマンはハザードスーツに着替えて実験室に入る。手順通りに実験を進めると、異世界との扉が開いてしまった。爆発する装置と飛び出してくるモンスターを横目にフリーマンは意識を失う。意識が戻ったフリーマンが目にしたのは死にゆく同僚と異形の生物たち。生き残った研究者たちと共闘して地上を目指す。そこでフリーマンが見たのは、事件をもみ消すために救助を求める同僚を撃ち殺す海兵隊員たちの姿だった。\nブラックメサ vs エイリアン vs 海兵隊という三つ巴の戦い。それだけで十分厚みのあるストーリーなのだが、それを全てリアルタイムで見せられるとボルテージが最高潮に達すること間違いなしだろう。\n\n[h1]敵・味方・武器[/h1]\n前述の通り味方はフリーマンの同僚たち。大きく分けて研究員と警備員の2種類がいて、セキュリティを突破してくれたり警備員は戦闘に協力してくれたりする。決して頼れるとは言い切れないものの、研究員と共に生き残るという意識を持つことができる頼りなさだと感じた。結局フリーマンはただの一般研究員で、軍隊のリーダーなどではないのだ。\n敵はこちらも既にご紹介した異世界のモンスターそして海兵隊。ゲームが進むほど強力なモンスターや兵器が登場するが、それでも隙を把握すれば倒せる絶妙な強さになっている。\n武器もゲームが進むほど強力になる。ハーフライフの代名詞となった「バール」の初登場シーンもお見逃しなく。\nここで余談だが、効果音が1998年のゲームにしては非常にコミカルなのが気になった。古いゲームだから慣れないだけかもしれないが、20年以上経ってもこのゲームの効果音でネットミームが出来るくらいにコミカルなのだ。死にかけのお婆さんのような声を出すモンスターや、「ノォーゥ」「スターップ！」を連呼する研究員など。ちょっと恐ろしさが削がれてしまったように感じた。(ちなみに続編でも、ガッポイと言う兵士やヤバイしか言わないゾンビが登場する。こういうネタに事欠かない会社がValveなのだろうか？）\n\n[h1]総括[/h1]\n壮大なストーリー、頭を使うパズル、大迫力の戦闘・アクションシーン…それらすべてを1人称視点で体感できる劇場型FPSの始祖となったHalf-Life。今となっては古めかしさがぬぐい切れないが、それらに目をつぶると手に汗握る世界が体感出来た。今からでも、このゲーム史に名を残す名作を手にとってはいかがだろうか。","timestamp_created":1588487203,"timestamp_updated":1588487920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540933430194854736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68474748","author":{"steamid":"76561198878019734","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":48,"playtime_forever":619,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":616,"last_played":1610850123},"language":"latam","review":"Soy un cagon de mierda me re asusto con la skin original de los cientificos lpm que traumas, pero el juego bien, reconocido, para la epoca es una leyenda.
