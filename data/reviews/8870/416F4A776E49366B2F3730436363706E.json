Estamos diante do melhor jogo da geração? Do Ano?  Ou apenas mais um jogo interessante onde as escolhas dos desenvolvedores  acabaram por limitar o potencial do mesmo?\n\nVeremos a seguir.\n\nResumo da ópera: Bioshock Infinite tenta ser um dos mais ambiciosos jogos da geração e entrega um universo carismático, interessante e profundo, mas entrega também um FPS com vários problemas de mecânica, escolhas ruins e linearidade crescente conforme se progride no jogo. Deixando claro que o jogo foi apressado da metade para o final.\n\nQuando somos inseridos em Colúmbia é assustador como aquele universo consegue nos transmitir uma pulsação, como aquele universo parece rico, vivo e variado. Até os trausentes são interessantes e você pode se interessar em ouvir as conversas alheias, observar  como uma cidade nas nuvens é bonita. Além do conteúdo ser completamente interessante, com suas escolhas, direção de arte e pesquisa. Tudo parece tão bem montado. Mas um jogo não é um filme e o gameplay e suas respectiva mecânica são tão importante quanto a ambientação.\n\nDaí que Bioshock parece apenas um jogo médio. Não há mais estratégia de combate variada como nos anteriores, não há escolhas relevantes para o jogador como antes. Não importa o que o jogador faça, o final será o mesmo. Não é um problema de gênero, e sim um problema de artesanato. Criou-se um universo interessante, conteúdo com potência de ser grande, mas não se lapidou as arestas, não se projetou mapas para se explorar, não se aprofundou nas possibilidades da batalha( como um uso melhor de vigor com os tears). Inclusive, as armas são reflexos dessa falta de esmero para polir o jogo( simples e sem inovações, como um mundo onde exista vigors pode não haver munições variadas ou uso da tecnologia dos vigors no armamento). Sem falar de limitar o arsenal a duas armas, tirando qualquer possibilidade de planejamento mais profundo das táticas de batalha. No final, aquele universo interessante, aquele roteiro magistral com twist shakeasperiano mostra-se um jogo extremamente linear e scriptado.\n\nO jogo é uma resolução opaca e estranha de um potencial que não se cumpre. Muito bom jogo, mas os desenvolvedores poderiam dar mais atenção no polimento do jogo. Entramos num restaurante caro e nos entregam um fast food onde deveria existir um refeição completa, nutritiva e saborosa.","timestamp_created":1365996007,"timestamp_updated":1385407071,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"292435","author":{"steamid":"76561197967812514","num_games_owned":324,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":3206,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2308,"last_played":1370593359},"language":"english","review":"GREAT GAME EVEN IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED THE OTHERS","timestamp_created":1365993106,"timestamp_updated":1365993106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4049322","author":{"steamid":"76561198031305089","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1478,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1441,"last_played":1388323058},"language":"english","review":"Honestly, it's everything a video game should be, and more.

Well, 'A step in the wrong direction' is a start. Coming on the heels of Bioshock and Bioshock 2 (which was indeed coming on the heels of System Shock and System Shock 2,) Infinite is comparable only in the combat, which is a carbon copy of the other Bioshock games. The guns really lack a realistic feel and damage seems to be arbitrary. The Vigors, formerly known as plasmids, have prettier skins, and only two or three are useful, but that's about it. All of the minigames are gone: lock picking has turned into a single button press which Elizabeth automatically does for you, provided you have a pick. Movement is clumsy, inventory is non-existent and I swear to God that stealth just doesn't work. The graphics are as good as they get (I hope you like blinding white lights) and the animations are top-notch. But honestly, no one cares, because no one plays Bioshock for gameplay. People play Bioshock for atmosphere. Unfortunately, here it's at an all time low for two reasons: the city and the girl.\n\nColumbia is beautiful but shallow. Gone is the depressing, destroyed world of Rapture – which indeed seemed like a vibrant world at one point. When you first go to Columbia, you actually see what it's like on an average day and it... Is entirely empty. People are motionless and scripted. It never feels lived in; it always feels like a set piece. Even when it starts getting destroyed, stores look like they haven't been maintained in years, and houses don't even have rats living in them, nonetheless people. Some people praise this, as Columbia clearly can't exist in reality, but no one had these delusions that Rapture could be real either. In fact, a great deal of Bioshock 1 was spent exploring why Rapture was doomed to failure from the start. Colombia, on the other hand, is really just a cool locale and nothing more. It's Olde Timey for the sake of being Olde Timey, opposed to Rapture that had a Fritz Lang look to it because it was about the failures of a utopian society, especially one that ignores its laborers. Rapture as a city was a graveyard: a final resting place for Andrew Ryan's totalitarian Libertarianism and it's drug-addled residents. Columbia feels like someone put a dead body in a tuxedo and brought it to a dinner party, by comparison.\n\nThe other element that really damages the atmosphere is also it's greatest success: Elizabeth. She prevents the sense of dread that both the Bioshock and System Shock series are famous for, and because of her constant, although never annoying, presence you simply feel like you're trapped in The Land of the Crazies. Sure, it's interesting and fun, but you never get the feeling that you're the world's last hope for sanity, as you did in Bioshock 1, and your sanity is never thrown into question (This is why the surprise twist at the end of Bioshock 1 worked so well.) In addition, she frequently becomes the exposition and in all honestly, is a rather flat character. Both her and Booker see their fair share of tragedy, and surprisingly I was far more sympathetic to the terse, insensitive, protagonist than I was this clearly Lowest Common Denominator device to pull at my heartstrings. Sometimes she's as helpless as a little girl and sometimes she's as powerful as a demigod with no clear reasoning or development one way or the other. Her development screams of Hegel's self-actualizing introspection and ends up being the culmination of a Hegalian Absolutist Idealist nightmare. But I really don't want to get invested in the metaphysics. Technically speaking, she's mostly well written, her AI is tolerable and her facial expressions are phenomenal. She tends to pop around, which a fool might believe is a part of the commentary. I believe it's lazy path finding.\n\n[Continued in the comment section]","timestamp_created":1365980458,"timestamp_updated":1385419913,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4215181","author":{"steamid":"76561198034010793","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":705,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":703,"last_played":1393103641},"language":"english","review":"AMAZOG","timestamp_created":1365976236,"timestamp_updated":1365976236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4658120","author":{"steamid":"76561198040443677","num_games_owned":98,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1245,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1218,"last_played":1384646529},"language":"english","review":"The Best Game I Have Ever Played.","timestamp_created":1365974393,"timestamp_updated":1365974393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1023330","author":{"steamid":"76561197984653907","num_games_owned":442,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1920,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1171,"last_played":1430969400},"language":"english","review":"Beautiful, enjoyable, captivating.

This is one of the few games to include a sidekick that actually helps you out and doesn't weigh the player down, so thats a big plus.

In Columbia; the citizens are still cheerful and greet everyone with a smile, the city itself is as clean and pristine as the day it ascended up into the clouds, and the Great Prophet Comstock watches over his flock pure white with an all-seeing eye.\n\nThe city isn't all that's new; gone is the old tried and tested weapon and health systems, instead, Infinite tries to hang with other big-boy FPS titles by striping away the stockpile of Medkits and Salts (EVE) and weapon wheel, and replacing them with a shield and ONLY 2 WEAPONS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. Although ammo and upgrades do carry over even if said weapon isn't equipped at the time, the need for having more than 2 weapons makes itself blatantly apparent when coming fresh out of an encounter with a small army of Vox, only to get ambushed by a Handyman (Big Daddy/Big Sister) and his Fireman (Brute Splicer that's on fire) buddy. Suddenly, that Machine Gun/Carbine combo is just as effective as using a BB gun against an angry rhino. The Sky Hook, the wrench/drill's replacement, plays a double roll, in being both a melee weapon and the means in which to rapidly explore Columbia via Sky-Line...not to mention give the game its \"M\" rating by allowing the execution of weakened enemies (neck-snapping, ripping up their chests, grinding it into their necks before casting them aside, and full-on squeezing their heads till they pop).\n\nThe way Vigors (Plasmids) are acquired is a mixed blessing; while Vigors can be upgraded in different ways, one can only FIND them (not that that's a bad thing) as there are no Gather's Gardens. The upsides to this are that ADAM (no equivalent) is never an issue as everything is bought with Silver Eagles (Columbia's currency) and each Vigor can be charged up to create its own unique trap. The game does compensate by giving larger payouts while looting through bodies and various containers. Pieces of gear are found in the same way as Gene Tonics in the first two games, only now they can be dropped by killing a Handyman as there is a lack of a Research Camera and Gene Banks. The only way to change gear is when acquiring a piece that goes in that same slot (of which there are 4: hats, waist coats, pants, and shoes) and seeing which one is more is going to be more useful in the long run as another piece of the same slot may not present itself for some time (EDIT: Turns out \"O\" is the default inventory button and allows you to change your gear at any given time, not that there's any indication).\n\nAll in all; Bioshock Infinite is an amazing game that, while making some unnecessary and ultimately stupid design choices, still lives up to what a Bioshock game aspires to be...and the ending made my head explode rainbows of \"WHAAAAAAAAAT?\", but in a good way.","timestamp_created":1365929139,"timestamp_updated":1365929139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3607898","author":{"steamid":"76561198025202373","num_games_owned":198,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":7116,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":930,"last_played":1581443193},"language":"english","review":"People are magic and racist.\nWould be a dead clear winner for Game of the Year if there were dinosaurs.","timestamp_created":1365926441,"timestamp_updated":1365926441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1479531","author":{"steamid":"76561197993626138","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6964,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4179,"last_played":1399801904},"language":"english","review":"Wonderful visual, Solid gameplay, Mind-blowing storytelling, what else is needed?","timestamp_created":1365926422,"timestamp_updated":1365926422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3904501","author":{"steamid":"76561198028848263","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":4580,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4336,"last_played":1566986404},"language":"english","review":"Beautiful, thrilling, immersive.\nI had to play and finish it 3 times because i wanted to enjoy every detail.\nAnd i would play it again without a doubt.\nI still think that the 1st BioShock was \"better\" mostly because at that time i couldn't believe such an incredible game could exist, and this one is the perfect piece to continue that legacy.\nThe only thing i didn't like so much is the fact that you don't need so much preparation before a fight, in BS 1 and 2 you needed to set lots of traps and find good spots to fight only 1 Big Daddy, here (even in 1999 mode) you can pretty much run into any scenario and fight without using any traps.

The gameplay is tight, smooth, and pleasantly crafted in it's own style.

I'd definately pick this game up. 9/10 \nBtw, I played through the entire game and played a good portion of it before posting this review so ignore the amount played it shows.","timestamp_created":1365813602,"timestamp_updated":1405549226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2850140","author":{"steamid":"76561198013559819","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":619,"last_played":1387410754},"language":"english","review":"Excellent game.

The reason I do not consider Infinite a Bioshock game is because I don't get any feel that I had from the first game. This game is more action than thriller, and there's nothing horrifying about this game. My final conclusion, though, is this is definitely worth playing through, and it'll surely make any shooter/action fan happy. 9/10","timestamp_created":1365794126,"timestamp_updated":1365794126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3828565","author":{"steamid":"76561198027893322","num_games_owned":1584,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":847,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":603,"last_played":1468195909},"language":"english","review":"The story is far more enjoyable than the game play itself and the ending will make your brain hurt\nbut that said the story is SO DAMN GOOD that it's worth it","timestamp_created":1365791831,"timestamp_updated":1365791831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2232503","author":{"steamid":"76561198004410106","num_games_owned":723,"num_reviews":193,"playtime_forever":1663,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1014,"last_played":1505613555},"language":"english","review":"Greatest shooter of all time... It is a difficult thing to consider. I have played many shooters (Half-Life 1&2, FEAR, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Crysis, Bioshock, Deus Ex, System Shock 2, and many others) and they are all simply fantastic games. But Bioshock Infinite... it is above everything else. The setting is so fresh and inovative. Not only is it a beauty to look at but it adds to the gameplay. On the topic of gameplay, this game nailed it. The weapons, abilities, melee, and sky-hook fights are always exciting and I only wanted more. The enemies are challenging and the 'bosses' are very unique and interesting, each one requiring a different approach to overcome. The graphics, while not technically the best (but still no slouch), are a feast for the eyes. But the big draw to Bioshock Infinite is the story and Elizabeth. Your mind will be blown by this game and you will wish so much that you could just experience it for the first time over and over. Buy this, do not get it in a deal, pay the top amount and make sure that Irrational Games gets as much money as they deserve every bit. Bioshock Infinite has replaced Crysis as my favorite shooter of all time and it has replaced Planescape: Torment as my favorite game of all time.\n\nEasiest 5/5 ever.","timestamp_created":1365790557,"timestamp_updated":1385414252,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6138876","author":{"steamid":"76561198059822817","num_games_owned":413,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":768,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1391185937},"language":"russian","review":"BooooM !!!","timestamp_created":1365786591,"timestamp_updated":1365786591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3838846","author":{"steamid":"76561198027983187","num_games_owned":674,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":5285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3204,"last_played":1408091819},"language":"english","review":"Играть всем :)","timestamp_created":1365786287,"timestamp_updated":1365786287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6708948","author":{"steamid":"76561198072988549","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":588,"last_played":1368989667},"language":"english","review":"This game is amzing and it throws you into the world of columia so well with the graphics, sound, voice acting and animations.

What I didn't like, was the lack of gun customization, and that the game only has about 6-7 guns In total. The lack of Vigors (laziness) also known as Plasmids from Bioshock 1-2. And the notion that Elizabeth throws you money every time you exit a vending machine (Complete Bollocks). I've spent about 20 hours playing the campaign on the hardest difficulty, and I must say It was a great experience.
