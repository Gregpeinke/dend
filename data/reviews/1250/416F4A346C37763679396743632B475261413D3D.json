Shooting zombies feels good and there is a vast variety of maps available. You start out being able to complete the maps on normal difficulty and as you gain perk (what classes are called in KF) levels you can start tackling the higher difficulties. This does require to a certain extent having friends to play with though, as winning on higher difficulties require solid teamwork. The main downside lies in the perk progression and the repetitive nature of the game. Getting perks to lvl 5/6 (which is almost required to beat the game on the higher difficulties) can take quite a bit. This is fine if you enjoy playing the same perk, but it does prevent you from switching out roles freely unless you spend a lot of time getting all the perks up to a good level. The repetitive nature mostly comes from the fact that the game is more or less the same regardless of the map you play on. Each game consists of shooting zombies for a certain amount of waves until the boss, the patriarch, shows up. Your tactics and team make-up will only rarely change across maps which means that the game can get samey.","timestamp_created":1480095053,"timestamp_updated":1480095053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27504854","author":{"steamid":"76561198107854119","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2353,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1588,"last_played":1511468026},"language":"russian","review":"Круть!)","timestamp_created":1480094898,"timestamp_updated":1480094898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27503361","author":{"steamid":"76561198003786509","num_games_owned":176,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":11702,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":11700,"last_played":1480094569},"language":"russian","review":"Огонь!","timestamp_created":1480094467,"timestamp_updated":1480094467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27503284","author":{"steamid":"76561198043483022","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2124,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2124,"last_played":1438940512},"language":"english","review":"There are 3 ways to play this game:\n\n1.The scary way, in which you play solo and repeatedly forget to look behind you.\n2.The cool way, in which you join a random online game and you see that it's pretty fun.\n3.The great way, in which you get your friends Killing Floor and lose hours upon hours playing this.\n\nThis game is fun, and the graphics will last for quite a while.

Да, сколько можно играть в одну и ту-же игру. Я сам чуть было не ушел поиграть во вторую часть, но у меня стояла 32-битная система и , хотя я прикупил ее почти сразу как она вышла, я до сих пор играл именно в первую часть. Все ожидали улучшения графики, но игру завезли совсем другую - там стало больше красивого треша, но отсутствуют два основных класса из первой части - снайпер и берсеркер (отсутствие уникального геймплея за них). \nЗеды первой KF более медленны и менее подвижны, что дает раздолье хорошему стрелку ставить им всем хедшоты. В арсенал стрелка помещается несколько пистолетов и арбалет или винтовка, что, в дополнении с намного более быстрой перезарядкой обойм, чем у других классов, дает при точной стрельбе останавливать целые волны любых противников. Дизайн карт более минималистичен, что позволяет более спортивно относиться к истреблению мутантов, не отвлекаясь на красоты окружения. С классом берсеркера можно достаточно свободно побеждать даже на адовой сложности в одиночку, в т.ч., если набить скилл, и патриарха. Берсеркером можно свободно бегать по карте, порой зигзагами с прыжками, уходя от зарядов хаска-огнеметчика - медик и берсеркер могут убежать от любого мутанта, но берс обладает свойством пониженного урона от физических атак и сверхспособностью быть настолько юрким, что клоты не могут его остановить, зацепив, что позволяет прорываться из большинства неловких столкновений живым.\nЧто касается других классов - то они хоть и скучнее  для меня в плане геймплея, при хорошем закупе ничем не хуже. Для новичков саппорт и огнеметчик будут лучшим выбором - достаточная убойная сила оружия, соответствующего классу и достаточно широкая зона поражения. Медик может не только лечить и быстро перемещаться, но и за счет вдвое более мощной брони подставляться под удар отбивальщика, если у других игроков мало здоровья или защиты. Ну а коммандос, он-же специалист по скорострельным винтовкам избегает неожиданного появления перед носом сталкера, видя их заранее, также на близком расстоянии может эффективно поражать очередями и вдалеке одиночными.\nВ настоящее время игроков не так много, но есть ряд обитаемых групп кастомных серверов с уникальными наборами мутантов, оружия, перков и классов, что делает геймплей более разнообразным и интересным. Лично я, после первых 800 часов, устал от стандартного геймплея и начал играть на кастомных (неофициальных) картах и серверах. На одной карте KFO-HauntedHotel от MrRobot я наиграл более 200 часов. Жаль что с патчем, изменившим спавн мутантов сломались старые стори и кфо карты и их поудаляли с большинства серверов - я на них наиграл много часов, но некоторые, в частности, RE-Mansion обновили и модифицировали ( создатель карты на своем сервере ее до сих пор тестит и играет там иногда, хотя карте несколько лет). \nВ целом, мне эта игра напоминает COD:MW первый, в котором было множество любительских карт и режимов игры и в который я играл иногда даже после того, как уже MW2 в альтеривнет начала терять популярность.","timestamp_created":1480074970,"timestamp_updated":1480076345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"27435208","author":{"steamid":"76561198006392048","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":630,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":630,"last_played":1480074663},"language":"italian","review":"Ottima giocabilità e molto intuitivo.
