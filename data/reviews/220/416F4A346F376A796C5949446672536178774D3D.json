The story is absolutely lovely, and really makes you feel like you are Gordon Freeman fighting to take back the world that the Combine's have taken over. The gameplay is also masterfully done, having new firearms and tools at your disposal as you progress through the story keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting. The same can be said about the enemies, while of course having your usual Combine soldiers and headcrabs, the game also introduces new enemies that have weird gimmicks which forces you to adapt your playstyle, like the antlion rising from the sand when you step in it, forcing you to either play safe and walk carefully to make sure not to step sand, or just grab your shotgun and just gun em down and feel like a badass. The puzzles were also pretty simple so you won't need to use a guide to get through them. Achievements are also fairly simple for completionists if you're wondering.

2 delivers one of the best single player experiences out there. It's excellent story telling, game play, characters and soundtrack all deliver a thrilling and badass experience. With Gordon back at it again, 20 years after the events of Half-Life, he is woken up by the G-Man into the now infamous \"City 17\" ruled by the \"Combine\" a multidimensional titan who now has control over earth. Gordon must join forces with the Resistance, made up of old allies from Black Mesa, & some new comers. Now fighting through Xen creatures once again, & the Combine's forces. Game play feels a little slower pace than Half-Life 1, movement is slower but sprinting is an option, only for a little bit however. New weapons are added such as the Pulse Rifle & Gravity Gun. Graphics & audio, for 2004, look & sound absolutely incredible. While today is nothing much, for it's time, it is way ahead. The Soundtrack is incredible, all giving a trilling vibe that really puts you into the action.

My verdict: Apart of some good visuals and groundbreaking physics technology utilized with the gravity gun, HL2 is a rather mediocre experience. It is not really bad, don’t get me wrong, but from a game that is hailed as the best of its genre, I expect far, far more than what I got here.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed was that there is not much HL in HL2. The look and atmosphere are different than HL1, and there are not many HL-elements except head crabs and head crab zombies (now in several pseudo-variations). The one-eyed aliens make an appearance here and there, and there are some characters from HL1 I completely forgot about. \n\nSome of the new elements are quite nice though. I like the design of the dropships and the robot striders, for instance. Generally, the graphics are pleasing, but also rather dull. Everything is of a light yellowish and blueish color, and you will see many shades of white and light grey.\n\nAll in all, there is not much variety. Your standard enemy are just army-type guys with different variations of face masks. Later in the game they wear white uniforms for some reason. Put the mentioned head crab (zombies), some annoying \"I fly in your face\"-robots and some bugs from Starship Troopers into the mix and you basically have all the basic enemies in this game.\n\nThere is also not much weapon variety: a pistol and a better magnum, a submachine gun and a better assault rifle, a shotgun and the crossbow as your sniper rifle, grenades and rocket launcher. And, of course, the gravity gun. (More on that later). Apart from the pistols, all of them have decent feedback and sound nice. But it's also absolutely standard stuff. In the first game you also had (not counting the gravity gun) two prototype weapons, an alien weapon, alien grenades, satchel charges and laser trip mines.\n\nSwapping these weapons is cumbersome until you find the fast-swapping option in the menu. I only realized that in the next to last chapter, of course... This is a pity because you the game inspires you to swap weapons. The placement of exploding barrels for instance clearly motivates you to specifically use the gravity gun often. But in the heat of battle, I just did not have the time to choose that weapon. See, the better weapons versions are on the second spot in a \"weapon category\". The gravity gun is below the crowbar on “1”. With fast-swapping turned off you have to press \"1\" twice and confirm your choice to get \"the better crowbar\". Or I just stick to my assault rifle and kill everybody efficiently anyway! \n\nWhy didn’t they just use the number keys from 1 to 0? There are 10 weapons in the game plus one thing to control bugs during exactly one segment of the game which you could have easily put on a special button. Or put the grenades on a special button, like Halo did years early. Or you could just put the better of the two weapons on the FIRST slot, because it's more likely you want to use the better version, right?\n\nFrom a level design perspective, I have to say that many levels are based on cool ideas. Some tell of a bigger world, especially those that take place in the city, where you can see the citadel in the background and sometimes have a sense of wonder and awe. An issue for me is that all levels are very, very linear. This usually serves a better level navigation and flow, but they somehow messed that up often enough it becomes a problem. Multiple times I ran into dead ends or was searching for some ladder or door I was supposed to use to proceed. Especially in bigger levels and those with vehicles a marker where to go next, as it had been established in other games at that time (Halo for instance) would have helped a lot. \n\nOften enough I wasn’t doing what I preferred, but what the developers wanted me to do next. My problem with that design philosophy is a little hard to explain, but it has to do with organic level flow and just a sense of a natural way to complete a level. It often feels artificial and forced.\n\nOverall, this game is heavily \"directed\", as it has a \"now the XY section\" structure. There is the hoverboat sequence. Then there is the horror sequence. Then there is the car sequence. Then there is the control bugs sequence. Then there is the place turrets sequence, followed by the command troops sequence. All these sequences are based on nice ideas and work, some better than others. For instance, I did not feel the need to place those mines once. And I was irritated by my troops, because they blocked my way, pushed me into enemy fire or off ledges. The bugs were fun and driving the boat was, too. But most of these sequences, especially the vehicle sections, were way too long. There was one turret section (because the game has those too, of course) where I really got bored by robots flying at me. It was trivial, it took forever and I just wanted it to stop already.\n\nWhenever there is a mini boss, say a dropship or a robot strider (or a big mother bug), the game puts rocket launcher ammo in front of you. It’s also the only way to kill them. There is no creative way of dealing with those enemies, no way of tricking them, playing with the environment or just use different guns. At one point later in the game you kill a strider with the gravity gun for a change. That's it. Because in this game you always do what the game wants from you. \n\nBut this design philosophy stands in clear contradiction to the story of the game which is about revolution and fighting against your oppressors. It is about acquiring freedom and getting rid of dictatorship. Yet here you are, only following implicit orders.\n\nThis brings me to the story. (Spoilers ahead, duh) It’s not original in any way, to say the least. And it had not been back then. Aliens have conquered the world (we never see those, by the way) and installed an old white guy to run things. You get in touch with the resistance (of course!) and meet Alyx, an early 2000s female game character whos only trait is that she opens locked doors, has a cheap looking haircut and leather gloves (so you know she's tough). Alyx is the daughter of some scientist (yawn) who (surprise!) gets caught by the bad guys because there is (surprise!) a traitor in your midst and your secret base is (surprise!) overrun. After driving somewhere and doing stuff I did not really get why, there is a time lapse of one week, because the writers needed the showdown to begin. You storm the old white guy's big wizard tower, Alyx got caught in the meantime, Freeman also gets caught – and immediately freed by the traitor who redeems herself (surprise!). Time to confront the old white guy on the rooftop of his big tower. Or not, because you actually only destroy some generator and never defeat the antagonist in this story.\n\nTo be clear: Except the story, nothing is really bad, but also nothing is particularly great either. Everything had been done better at that time. Despite my constant references to Halo, I am not a big Halo fan, but Halo 2 did better vehicles, including flying ones, NPCs that did not stand in your way, and had a more interesting weapon variety in the same year! \n\nHowever, there is one thing that HL2 does very great. And that's the physics technology and their utilization with the gravity gun. This was a unique thing back then and is still fun now. It probably paved the way for several puzzle game ideas that came along during the following two decades and is still a super-cool game element. If the whole game was just about that gun, it might have been awesome. And you can see the developers probably thought so, too, because in the end they steal all your weapons (yawn) except the gravity gun which they crank up to 11 and let you insta-kill enemies (which makes the climax of the game rather trivial but is a lot of fun).\n\nFor me, HL2's success is similar to that of Star Wars Episode 7: Everyone wanted it to be great, so it was declared to be great.

te gusto Half-Life, Half-Life 2 te va a gustar el doble, los gráficos han envejecido de buena manera, asi mismo las físicas del juego se sienten realistas y acordes con el momento, el mejor ejemplo es la pistola antigravedad, es de las armas más divertidas, versátiles y originales que he visto en un videojuego, a pesar de ser shooter no evita que haya momentos en los que toca resolver un pequeño puzle o lo que es mejor de todo, de un capítulo a otro el juego se convierte en un juego de terror y de verdad pasarse aquel capitulo únicamente con la pistola antigravedad es un auténtico reto, también Gordon ahora camina en vez de correr como en el primer juego, sin embargo el juego no es perfecto y estas son algunas quejas mías.\n\nEl repertorio de armas tuvo una reducción drástica, sobre todo en las arrojadizas, pasamos de tener c4, minas de proximidad y los mini aliens a las típicas granadas de fragmentación de toda la vida, solo que con un aspecto futurista, se extrañan armas como los cañones experimentales de Black Mesa, a esto súmale la escasa munición que ahora puedes recoger y el juego tiende a volverse repetitivo con las mismas armas, porque la mayoría del tiempo iras con la escopeta y el subfusil, en cuanto a la munición total es un agregado interesante, ya no hay esas grandes bodegas con un montón de munición, botiquines y baterías para el traje, aun asi creo que reducir la munición de armas como el revolver, la ballesta o el lanzacohetes era algo innecesario, en el primer juego puede que podías ir sobrado con 10 granadas para el subfusil y un montón de cartuchos de escopeta, lo cual en este juego se limitó a 3 y a 100 respectivamente, aun asi tener apenas 12 balas de revolver y 10 virotes de ballestas considero que no era necesario, ya que esa munición escasea en ambos juegos, en cuanto a la linterna pues que decir, que este asociada al aguante de Gordon es ridículo, hay secciones que son completamente a oscuras y no querrás estar esperando a que se recargue el aguante (estamina) porque estuviste corriendo 5 segundos antes, menos mal lo cambiaron para el capítulo 2, otra cosa negativa son las actuaciones de voz para el español, se sienten terribles y sosas, mejor juégalo en inglés y con subtítulos hazme caso.\n\nEn general Half-Life 2 es un excelente juego, a pesar de las cosas que dije anteriormente es un juego que vale la pena, es una digna secuela de Half Life, además Steam los pone a precio rebajado en sus ofertas, 9/10.","timestamp_created":1658595845,"timestamp_updated":1658595845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119331984","author":{"steamid":"76561199229394220","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":347,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":190,"last_played":1658769278},"language":"turkish","review":"sarıyo","timestamp_created":1658594789,"timestamp_updated":1658594789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119331686","author":{"steamid":"76561199136398117","num_games_owned":11,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":242,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":192,"last_played":1658692648},"language":"brazilian","review":"jogo
