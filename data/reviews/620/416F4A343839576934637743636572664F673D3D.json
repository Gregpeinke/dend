因为我觉得这个游戏十分的有趣 在某一个地方打开一个光圈然后在另一个地方打开一个光圈 实现一种空间的移动 听起来很有意思\n\n这是系列的第二部作品 即Portal 的续作 首先得提到官方肯定听到了玩家们关于Portal的反馈 : 整个游戏流程太短了！ 于是Portal 2 的游戏流程就变长了 但是个人感觉比较生硬 被强行拖长的感觉 这点个人觉得是一点点瑕疵 游戏整体很不错 保留了Portal的玩法 并且新加入了多人模式 合作破解关卡谜题 这些都很棒  画面方面我想不出怎么评价 跟半条命2没什么差别 说差有点牵强 但是画面党人看着画面好想也不满足 姑且算中上吧 操作性方面 ... 这并不是一个考操作的游戏 所以我觉得可以绕过 音效方面挺不错 故事剧情还算有意思 不过就如之前提到个有点被生硬拖长的感觉 游戏性很好 你只要能接受这种玩法 应该就可以很愉快的继续玩下去\n\n另外本作有创意工坊的支持 也就是说玩家可以自己做些地图上传到创意工坊给其他玩家或者下载其他玩家的地图来体验 也算一直给游戏补充新鲜血液吧\n\n DT的评测仅供参考 请理性消费.

The portals are useful for solving the puzzles. Cubes to Wheatley and other cores. The player has to think through the story with pieces of evidence by Wheatley and GLaDoS. As Chell advances through the test chambers, more chapters of the story of Portal starts. And then it's Chapter 9 and the last chapters where Wheatley attempts to kill you. But Chell uses her portal gun to defeat the evil core and end the game. It also has a level editor, which players can make their own test chambers and post them to the world, where the world tries attempting the user-created test chambers. Portal starts with Valve thinking the ancient Hoopity the Hoop would be a meme, but the cake was a meme which grabbed the Portal series attention. You play from the 2x fast version of Still Alive (the radio song at the start of Portal 1) and you trapped in a glass box with a timer that will run out and place a portal on the wall to destroying Wheatley. I really recommend this game just because of the level editor and a core appearing throughout the chambers (Wheatley is a object so you have a chance to grab him. I just use noclip to grab him).
