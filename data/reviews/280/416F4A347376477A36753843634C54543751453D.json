provato l'originale Half Life inizialmente e poi la versione \"Source\" rimasterizzata appena ho scoperto la sua esistenza. Nella versione \"Source\" abilitando le texture ad alta definizione nelle impostazioni, permette di migliorare la qualità dei modelli del gioco, ma le texture dei livelli non cambiano molto dalla versione originale; però la qualità dell'acqua e dei riflessi sono molto belli, che al contrario nella versione originale non sono granché. \nIncredibile come un gioco del 1998 (Source 2004)  possa sbalordire un videogiocatore oltre 20 anni dopo la sua uscita, e diverte molto più dei giochi odierni !\nCertamente la versione del 1998 non ha una grafica mozzafiato, un audio sensazionale e modelli ultra dettagliati; però devo dire che per quell'anno i modelli sono fatti anche abbastanza bene, ma la cosa che mi ha stupito, è l'esistenza della gravità negli oggetti inseriti nel gioco, che apparentemente sembrano semplicemente modelli statici.\nHalf Life include cinematiche in-game, effetti speciali abbastanza dettagliati e una storia molto coinvolgente.\nIl gameplay offre meccaniche da fps con una vasta esplorazione della mappa di gioco; spronando il giocatore a trovare soluzioni per proseguire con la storia, senza che siano troppo guidati. Quello che voglio dire è del tipo: \"Ma se corro fin là  e faccio questa cosa cosa qui, forse riesco a uccidere quel nemico. proviamo !\"; oppure \"Chi lo sa se posso spostare quella scatola per salire su quel piano che non posso raggiungere\", ecc...\nSono molto soddisfatto di aver giocato questo titolo, e dalla mia esperienza ho capito il perchè della sua fama.\nIl gioco non si può definire di certo facile, anzi: Io l'ho giocato a difficoltà normale e, nonostante questo, certe situazioni si sono rivelate ostiche da superare. Per questo l'unico punto negativo ( ma per certi versi anche positivo ) è che certe situazioni si sono rivelate frustanti, dalle continue morti che subivo; però questo mi spronava di più per continuare a provare !\n\nConclusione basata sulla versione Source ( con valutazione di un gioco del 1998  con grafica del 2004 ):\nAudio: 7\nSoundtrack: 8\nGrafica/dettaglio: 8.5\nGameplay: 9\nStoria: 8.5","timestamp_created":1581634105,"timestamp_updated":1581634105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63452537","author":{"steamid":"76561198207943981","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":625,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":458,"last_played":1590202709},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1581626245,"timestamp_updated":1581626245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63437049","author":{"steamid":"76561198134426365","num_games_owned":870,"num_reviews":62,"playtime_forever":174,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":174,"last_played":1581203060},"language":"russian","review":"Уета.

Either bosses can't be beaten or missing or broken animations and models.  So much potential for a remaster was wasted on this to begin with. They could have updated textures, increase the fidelity of models, allow items to be picked up, recompile the maps with increased lightmap fidelity, etc... to make this better than what it is now (I'm just saying the things they could have done at release to make this better, I'm not advocating them to do the aforementioned changes (except bug fixes) now). \n\nIt feels like Valve deliberately avoids this game whenever they go about their rounds to issue bug fixes for their older titles (which is rare on its own). Just look how many open issues are for this game on their Github issue tracker and compare it to their other games: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Half-Life%3A+Source%22+\n103 as of writing. Don't buy this game unless you just want the assets or you just want to own the whole Half-Life franchise. \n\nThis game has its highs, the gibs are fun(ny at times) (albeit annoying that they sound like plastic rather than flesh), the ragdolls are entertaining, easier for speedrun practice or Machinimas since there is a chapter selection menu (albeit less relevant since maps can be loaded directly via console), but other than that it falls flat. The reason why I have over 47 hours on this is due to fucking around or trying to do playthroughs with different play styles.\n\nTL:DR\nBuy the original Half-Life.
