Take an old game and remake that game but in the Source engine this time. The unfortunate part is that Day of Defeat Source does not seem as well developed or as much improved as Counter Strike Source. CS: Source looked better, bodies and weapons could fly into the air thanks to explosions so well the Source engine i guess i should say, it added a really nice AI support where you could make your own games with your own AI on both teams and on any map you choose, the explosions looked better too. Day of Defeat Source does some of these things but not all. The graphics are improved including how explosions look. The game looks great and weapons, bodies etc can fly into the air thanks to these explosions so thats pretty nice. But do you know whats missing? The AI. The AI in here is really similar to the AI in the original Day of Defeat. In the original DoD just like in the original CS you could not add AI or bots to your games. In original DoD you had to go and find a server with bots in it so you could play with bots. They were a bit unfair but eh not much you could do at least there was some fun to be had with the interesting shooting mechanics that game had. But in here? The shooting feels incredibly dull. The guns don't have the same feeling they had in original DoD. I can't tell when i'm being shot, when i'm hit and when i'm hitting someone. There is just no response the guy takes a bullet and keeps going. I take a bullet, my character maybe makes a sound and thats it. It feels like only the graphics improved and nothing else...\n\n+There is AI but its just like the original Day of Defeat. You'll have to go into a server with AI. You can't just make your own offline server.\n+Works on a class based system just like the original DoD. Snipers, machine gunners, rifleman, assault guys... The usual.\n+The maps are good. Pretty sure most of them are from the original DoD anyways so yeah.\n+Gameplay, sounds and graphics are all nice.\n+You can pick up grenades and throw them back to the enemy.\n+Seeing bodies and guns fly thanks to the Source engine is pretty fun.\n\n-The gunplay is really meh. Its not awful but its just like Counter Strike Source. I suppose the Source engine is just bad at making you feel like you are shooting something. Like the guns work fine and its not as brutal as the original DoD which is kinda sad but whatever what sucks is i cannot tell if i'm hitting an enemy or not. If i'm being hit or not. There is just nothing. If you don't one shot the enemy and see him fall down and die then you'll just feel like you are shooting at a wall or a sand bag or something. It sucks.\n-Reloading a weapon like the K98 is... it pisses me off. You fired all 5 rounds? Good you reload with a stripper clip as you should. You fired 1 round and wanted to reload while your gun still has 4 more shots in it? Oh alright you load a single bull...et...in... Oh... You put in an entire stripper clip instead... Huh... We are kinda doing the COD Vanguard thing... The sniper variant might be even worse... You cannot load stripper clips into the scoped K98 so that checks out thats right but lets say you fired 3 rounds. You want to reload so you have the full 5 shots instead. You press R to do the reload and your character should put 2 rounds in manually because the K98 has a maximum of 5 rounds right? Your character places the 1st round, the 2nd round, the...3rd...round, 4th... And oh my god even a 5th one? But... It holds a maximum of 5 shots anyways and i already had 3 more bullets in the gun why'd you do the animation to load 5 individual shots? God fucking damn it... So yeah you gotta waste the entire magazine if you don't wanna tear your hair out during the reload animation.\n-The AI is brain dead. They will do the same things over and over again. Take the same paths over and over again. Too predictable. So how do they balance that out? You guessed it! The AI has aim bot. They can come out of a corner, sprinting, far away from you and even when you are lying down ready to shoot them as soon as they come out of that corner they will blow your head off with a single shot. I have seen the AI do a 180 as soon as it runs out of a corner just to dome me in the head with a single shot from a pretty long range. Long enough where that shouldn't have happened. So its just like the original Day of Defeat AI. Oh and you better not stay in front of your AI too. Your own friendly AI will shoot at everything even if you are in his gunsights. He will shoot through you just to hit an enemy. Your own AI will, constantly, kill you if you are stand in their gunsights. Unfortunately you cannot move away. You have to be on the frontline because your AI sucks. But you have to stay behind because the enemy AI cheats and your own AI wants to kill you. The AI is awful.\n-Not many players.\n\nCounter Strike Source actually improved on the original CS. Of course the graphics and physics engine improved because it was made in the Source Engine. But it had another huge advantage... proper, good AI support. This game has the same bonuses that a Source engine gives. Better graphics, physics etc. but it doesn't have the AI support. It doesn't seem to have the same amount of players either. I've only seen a handful in here while in Counter Strike Source i saw an almost full server. Its not a bad game and if you get the Valve Complete Pack you'll get this anyways too so it doesn't matter. But compared to the original? It may not be that good... It doesn't improve that much... And some very important things are still missing. On its own i would not recommend this game. But with the Valve Complete Pack... well you don't really have much of an option do you?","timestamp_created":1656841897,"timestamp_updated":1656841897,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466101676225662231","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118119194","author":{"steamid":"76561198417849908","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":658,"playtime_last_two_weeks":15,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1660042020},"language":"russian","review":"Заебок\n","timestamp_created":1656841895,"timestamp_updated":1656841895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"118108729","author":{"steamid":"76561199028740379","num_games_owned":49,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1656166423},"language":"english","review":"Source

Analítico: \"Day of Defeat: Source\"[/h1]\n\nEs la transición esperable del Day of Defeat de la era de Gold Source al motor de la era de Half-Life 2. Todas las mecánicas se conservan, y los mapas fueron recreados, similar a lo ocurrido con Counter-Strike: Source, de modo tal que la mayoría de los problemas y las virtudes del título original persisten. Quizá se podría hablar de su interfaz, más límpia, o de la estamina más permisiva, pero no hacen la gran diferencia.\n\nActualmente según SteamDB hay un total de 170 jugadores activos, con un pico de 567 el día de hoy. No está tan deshabitado como otros clásicos, quizá a causa de pertenecer a una época más moderna que Ricochet o Deathmatch Classic, no obstante sigue siendo un título olvidado y jugado más por la curiosidad que por interés en el juego per se.\n\n[b]¿En conclusión?[/b] Es un muy buen juego, recomendable con
