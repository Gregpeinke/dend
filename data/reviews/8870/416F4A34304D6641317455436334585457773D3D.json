Что же тут можно сказать. Игра поначалу впечатляет, спору нет. Но... 11/10? Игра века? Вы чего, ребят? Неужели все просто закрыли глаза на это однообразное рубилово длиною во всю игру?  Единственное, что спасает игру от отрицательного отзыва — это разрывающая шаблон концовка и атмосфера, этого не отнять. Если конкретно, то:\nГрафон: тут бесспорный плюс. Я никогда не считал графон главным критерием, но тут это дело обойти нельзя. Игра просто поражает своей картинкой с самых первых секунд. Час-полтора я просто с открытым ртом рассматривал Колумбию, любовался этими парящими зданиями, красивыми людьми...\nГеймплей: тут-то и скрывается самый большой прокол. Основная часть игры, то бишь начинка, это просто глупое рубилово и мясцо. Ладно если бы этого мясца было умеренное количество, но перестрелки каждые две минуты — это уже слишком. А что же мы делаем в промежутке между рубиловом? Лутаем. Стреляем-лутаем-стреляем-лутаем...\nСюжет: образно игру можно поделить на три части: полет в Колумбию, основной замес, концовка. В начале сюжет затягивает: для игрока все ново и поразительно, история обещает быть захватывающей. Сердцевина — просто ряд линейных квестов с перестрелками в главной роли. А вот концовка — это дело особенное, но, думаю в других обзорах эту часть вспоминали и отзывались о ней крайне лестно, и я присоединюсь.\nАтмосфера: да, тут есть своя изюминка. Как и в подводном Восторге, тут все проработали до мелочей: музыка, реплики, персонажи создают незабываемые воспоминания.\nИтог: 7/10 из-за прокола с геймплеем. У меня все, желания покупать дополнений нету.","timestamp_created":1467570401,"timestamp_updated":1467570401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24056597","author":{"steamid":"76561198070053443","num_games_owned":523,"num_reviews":154,"playtime_forever":1101,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":720,"last_played":1652659733},"language":"english","review":"Booker catch !\n\n10/10 Would catch again","timestamp_created":1467569569,"timestamp_updated":1467569569,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24056201","author":{"steamid":"76561198065672406","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":535,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":533,"last_played":1560094115},"language":"french","review":"Un magnifique moment.\n","timestamp_created":1467568779,"timestamp_updated":1467568779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24056200","author":{"steamid":"76561197967121772","num_games_owned":497,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":271,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":271,"last_played":1448407212},"language":"dutch","review":"Game begint goed, maar vervalt snel in een generieke shooter","timestamp_created":1467568778,"timestamp_updated":1467568778,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.401459872722625732","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24055682","author":{"steamid":"76561198029843828","num_games_owned":493,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1777,"last_played":1395957788},"language":"english","review":"I played Bioshock, and found it interesting, but wasn't a huge fan of it.

Part of it was the change in health and Eve/Salts system, where you could no longer keep extra health kits and eve syringes which I found made me utilize my plasmids far less than I would've liked to. Another big part of it was how bright and cheery Columbia felt, with friendly townsfolk all around... When I think BioShock, I'm thinking about a desolate city where everyone you see is trying to kill you. Although the DLC Burial at Sea *** EXTREMELY VAGUE SPOILER ALERT *** does tie Rapture and Columbia together, I honestly feel like I would've liked this game more if it was simply \"a new game by the creators of BioShock\", not necessarily \"a BioShock Game\".\n\nStill, a great game, strongly recommended - Just don't expect to feel the way you did in Rapture.","timestamp_created":1467562728,"timestamp_updated":1467562728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24052818","author":{"steamid":"76561198297786135","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1032,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":804,"last_played":1473183961},"language":"english","review":"Oh my fucking God this game was the best movie ever, a sentence that will make sense once you've already finished the game. Which you already have. Now onto the serious review.\n\nFirst of BioShock Infinite is a shooter at it's core. This not an open world experience and you will be driven down a very linear path and simply progress throught the story. Now that is exactly where this game shines, I am not exaggerating at all when I say the story is actually mind blowing like damn.\n\nThe shooting mechanics are excellent however I did have a few flaws with it. Now I am writing this review straight after finishing the main campaign. Throughout the campaign however there were times when I ended up getting lost during combat so to speak. There is no minimap present so often there would be times where I would have enemies left on the map but not know where they were and had to spend quite a bit of time finding them. \n\nVigors are a unique gameplay element of BioShock Infinite but I personally feel the game basically forces you to use them. I was playing on the medium difficulty and realized early on that not using them made the game all the more punishing. This isn't a mark against the game however but something that should be noted for those expecting a typical run of the mill shooter.\n\nAll in all this game is a must have and I feel good value for money as I purchased it on sale with all the DLC's available which I'm sure that I'll start playing soon. \n\n10/10 for me in all

Но, запустив в первый раз, и играя в последующем, ощущал себя пятилетним ребенком, которого заставляют играть в XCOM на хардкоре. Поясню: я нихера не понял, без ознакомления со стороним контентом, типа видео, в которых лор данной части разжевывается для самых маленьких. Ну ладно, может я такой тупой, другие игроки таких проблем не испытывали. Но тут вклинивается абсолютно не цепляющая история и довольно скучноватый геймплей. Об атмосфере я вообще молчу. Повествование сюжета не дает ни мотивации пройти игру до конца, ни сопереживания главным героям. Ах да, персонажи. Более ли менее прописаны Элизабет, и Комсток. Все. Для чего Букер ищет Элизабет, ради чего он устраивает целый геноцид на Колумбии, что это за метка на его руке, и откуда она? Именно. Хрен его знает. Может это и обьясняется в процессе прохождения, но мне никак не хочется что-то делать, чтобы узнать этого персонажа поближе. Ну, и тут мы подходим к атмосфере. \"Что с ней не так?\" - спросите Вы? Ее тупо нет. В первых двух Биошоках ты чуствовал, что ты заперт в разваливающемся городе под толщами воды в компании на голову отмороженных психов/мутантов. И это держало за яйца сильнее, чем невыплаченная ипотека. А что тут? ну не чуствую я погружения, не могу я ни сопереживать героям, не ставить себя в одну шеренгу с ними. В общем, основной сюжет я пройду до конца навряд ли. Есть еще два DLC, именуемые как \"Burial at Sea\", в которых действие происходит в том самом Восторге. До них я пока не добрался, и не могу сказать, будут ли они в духе тех самых Биошоков. Посмотрим.

A game that is truely artistic and a very well made bon voyage to the last generation of consoles when this master piece came out, not for PC, however. But this quiete hefty game that holds serious undertones of xenophobia, religion, racism, and even scientific theories such as multiverses etc. is a great experience that anyone should play. \n\nThe gameplay is great. Any lack there of, is nit picking at something that is very well polished and plays well on all platforms. This game is a nice ending to the story of the previous games. It is great and holds fast the aura of the first two with such precision that it is hard to mistake Infinite with some other game.   \n\nI have played the other two, and quite frankly, Infinite nods at the other quiete well. I really recommend playing the first two, not because you will miss out on the story explanation, but because they are just as good as Infinite.\n\nThis game gets a 10/10. \n\nA great buy and really worth your money. I hope that those who read this review take into consideration that this is an instant classic, a masterpiece. \n\nCant wait until more Bioshocks release. \n\nPeace my lovely people.","timestamp_created":1467497539,"timestamp_updated":1467497647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24028842","author":{"steamid":"76561198195614473","num_games_owned":271,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":454,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":408,"last_played":1467495482},"language":"english","review":"9/10\n\nBest in the trilogy\nCant wait for the remaster :D","timestamp_created":1467495597,"timestamp_updated":1467495597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560445249080657959","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24028707","author":{"steamid":"76561198144201988","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1093,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":601,"last_played":1470391999},"language":"english","review":"10/10 story\n10/10 gameplay\n10/10 music\n12/10 Elizabeth\n\nOVERALL:10/10","timestamp_created":1467495249,"timestamp_updated":1467495249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24028649","author":{"steamid":"76561198031665957","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1579,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":672,"last_played":1471654477},"language":"english","review":"What an amazing game!
