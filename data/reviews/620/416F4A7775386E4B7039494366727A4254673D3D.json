But I found that \"Portal 2\" didn't just do better than the first game, it exceeded it. It maintained what made the first game work in the first place, and added some new features and more story to make it even more of a fun ride. And it really manages to maintain the quality standards that were set by the first \"Portal.\"\n\nOnce again, this game uses the Source Engine, just as the original did. And given how this engine has aged very well, it works very well in this context. The graphics are still very gorgeous. You are again in the Aperture Science Labs, albeit, ones that have seen better days. Once again, this environment feels very fresh, while at the same time, familiar to returning players who've played the first game. The Old Aperture areas are a very nice addition to the game, with their style aesthetics from each section's respective time. \n\nThe gameplay is unchanged from the original game, and the game's challenges are equally as challenging and engaging as the original game. But I'm glad the game has some additions to the gameplay, such as being able to see which portal is where, so you can more easily keep track of which portal you've used in one location, and you can use the other one in the proper manner. The tests aren't hard if you're smart, but at the same time, they've added some new challenges, such as using the gels. The gels can be fun to use (my favorites are the acceleration and repulsion gels) and they add new dimensions to the gameplay in tandem with the portals.\n\nThe voice acting once again shines in this game. Ellen McLain outdoes herself as GLaDOS in this game, while Stephen Merchant as Wheatley really steals the show at times. Wheatley is such a lovable idiot, you really look forward to every moment he appears. GLaDOS still manages to be funny as well, especially when [spoiler] she is forced to be powered by a potato battery and has to spend a large portion of the game attached to the Portal Gun [/spoiler]. But then there's Cave Johnson, voiced by J.K. Simmons, who really steals the show during the Old Aperture section. Johnson is such a colorful joy to listen to. The game's voice acting does a great job of not taking this game too seriously, it makes you want to come back just to listen to it. And even the turrets are still funny.\n\nThe game maintains the immersive nature that the first game had. It lets the game unfold before you as it did in the original. This of course, made the plot less predictable. It worked in the first game, and it works in this game. And I liked how they were able to make this game twice as long as the original was.\n\nI have fewer complaints about this game than the first one. This game reduced the dependency on using Portals to make some of the jumps. Of course, it's still present, but it's not as big a deal as in the first one. Also, at times, it can be a bit easy to get lost in some of the Old Aperture sections. \n\nThis game was a good ride and definitely worth revisiting in the future. It's still a game you want to come back to and try again. Again, you'll think up new ways to solve all the tests, and the learning curve is simple enough for first-time players, and there's enough challenge for experienced ones. This game has improved greatly on the original in that respect to challenge. The voice acting makes the game more fun to enjoy, and overall, the game avoids changing it's formula too much so that it still feels like the game it started off as. When a sequel is able to outperform the original, you know it's doing something right. I will be playing this again.\n\nEdit: And yes, \"Funniest A.I. Characters\" is a legit reason why I would award this. GLaDOS and Wheatley....priceless.","timestamp_created":1453119051,"timestamp_updated":1511442359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"20603019","author":{"steamid":"76561198116785642","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":564,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":312,"last_played":1590327759},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 is not a first person shooter as some of the other reviews might suggest.

More levels, more story, more humour, more puzzle mechanics, more atmosphere, more achievements and more campaign modes to play in (AKA the new co-op mode). The singeplayer campaign is a blast to go through with the intriguing story, witty dialogue and puzzles that are tons of fun and the co-op is just as fun as you use the things you learnt in singeplayer for co-op but expanding on much more possibilites on level design with the use of four portals as apposed to two. What I love about this game so much is how even when I'm stuck in the game I still have fun using my brain to figure the level out and there's no other game that comes to mind that is so consistently fun even in situations when confused on what to do. If you do not have this game I really, really, really, really, really recommend for you to get it. It is not only my favourite game in my Steam library but possibly my absolute favourite game of all time.
