One of the best FPSes out there. Varied enemies and weapons. The game feels like a movie, and, when you are on the run from the Combine I actually felt like a fugutive running from an overpowering governent. The game scales in difficulty also, as you will die a bit more at the end than at the start. Amazingly, the games still looks decent today (though nothing compared to the modern FPSes we have today). Just doing one playthrough took me 20 hours, and, thats not including Half Life: Episode 1 and Epiosde 2, which combined, has takne me about 7 hours so far (and I havent even finished Episode 2!). The only complaints I have are mainly about the story, since we never really know why there are things like antlions in the countryside. However, thats one nitpick in a great game that has deserved all the accolades it has received. Play it, and find out why it is ALWAYS in the discussion for the best videogame in the 2000-2010 period. \n\n9.8/10","timestamp_created":1348884673,"timestamp_updated":1348884673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4806532","author":{"steamid":"76561198042035707","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":1673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1672,"last_played":1385258410},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1348702225,"timestamp_updated":1348702225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4492841","author":{"steamid":"76561198038036067","num_games_owned":319,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1265,"last_played":1369430924},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life 2 + Episodes 1 & 2 = MASTERPIECE.","timestamp_created":1348614600,"timestamp_updated":1348614600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2994567","author":{"steamid":"76561198015607752","num_games_owned":108,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":1932,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1932,"last_played":1442956915},"language":"english","review":"This game has dam loads of stuff modern games don't have the phyics are amazing, puzzles and combat too it's probably best its singeplayer because you want to play at your own pace.

That is not say that it is in the second place because it is almost impossible to choose between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. And that would be unfair as well. These games are from different centuries but both are great, equally great. So what makes is so great? Let's find out... \n\nFirst and foremost I'm absolutely blown away by the story. Maybe not by the story itself but by the way it's told. The first game made me feel in the center of attention and action. It felt like it was very important to complete the mission but without making me feeling some sort of superhero that will win anyway. It may sound strange but I can't better words for it. And it continues here with one of the best intros I have seen in a game. Do you remember how the first game ended? Yes, it ended with a monologue of a man in a blue suit after which you agreed to work for him without really knowing who is working for. This game start with another monologue saying that the time has come for you to unleash all your skills and complete another very tall task. It all feels amazingly tense and even though you're ready to spring into action you are not a superhero so don't expect being handed a machinegun and go around shooting. \n\nAs I said the narrative is outstanding throughout the game series and it makes it feel very realistic and natural. I don’t want to spoil it for you so I'll let you see it for yourself. What I can tell you though is the way I felt when I started playing. Let's continue then, shall we? \nSo you awake several years after the end of the first part. It is somewhere in the eastern Europe from what I can tell by the architecture, well by what is left from it. The atmosphere is very grim and depressing and you're alone in a unfamiliar city trying to figure out what you need to do and if there are any friends of yours. The first thing you notice are the screens with propaganda and giant tower that you can see from any part of the city. And all of that really put me in the mood to fight. Because clearly someone is controlling the city and most likely the earth.  \nAll of that is backed up by incredible ambient sounds and music. I don't know if it really makes sense to talk about music in this game but if you read review on the original game you'll know that it is something. It follows you around submerges you entirely into everything that is happening around. I first played the game in headphones and that was very wise decision and I'd recommend that to you as well. \n\nWhat kind of atmosphere can be there without proper visuals. And graphics are certainly there. And not just any graphics. Probably the best for the time. For me that is. But considering that it has been more than 10 years since the release of the game you could argue. But if you're into more realistic visuals you can find a mod online that will turn the game into eyecandy. \n\nSo this game has amazing sounds, graphics and story. How does it play then. Well, it pays absolutely fantastic. It is a true sequel and it carried over everything that made the original such a great game. Suit is there, crowbar is there, awesome guns are there to accompany dynamic and fast-paced shooting action. Even if you're not shooting you can still feel the adrenaline. Guns are fantastic to use, blasting through the enemies. And there's variety of enemies ranging from headcrabs to helicopters and giant striders. All of them have very good AI and they never made me feel an overpowered protagonist putting down handicapped enemies. It's complete opposite because I found myself many times low on ammo and low on health hearing suit AI saying \"User death imminent\". What Half-Life never lacked are the unusual weapons and you'll some this time as well. For example Pulse Rifle which is my favorite and something very special - Gravity Gun. The latter really helps to get out of sticky situations when you're low on ammo or being overpowered by zombies. It has so many uses and every time I figured out something new I felt real scientist. By the way this time you're not doing everything alone. You have friends that will aid in the battle. I would characterize their AI as limited but sometimes they are really helpful. In my opinion their role is to make you feel as a part of Resistance more than anything else. And they certainly succeed at that. \n\nYou will come across quite a few puzzles. What would Half-Life game be without puzzles. They are not that hard but require you to see the big picture. Gordon Freeman went to MIT so those puzzles should be not a problem.  \n\nAs with the original game I played Half-Life 2 more than once. I played few times just didn't feel like playing something else and then I played it once again to unlock every single achievement and then I played it prior to Episode One and Two to refresh memories \nThis game is definitely worth picking up even though it's more than 10 years old but it still has that tense, action packed gameplay, immersive music and graphics that hold up today in my opinion.\n\n[url=store.steampowered.com/curator/36040796]More reviews from Gameaways Curator[/url]","timestamp_created":1346658649,"timestamp_updated":1577176681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530066072940826416","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"6175436","author":{"steamid":"76561198060603430","num_games_owned":473,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1804,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":632,"last_played":1628956661},"language":"english","review":"Eternal hope for a quick sequel.","timestamp_created":1346611454,"timestamp_updated":1346611454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4218517","author":{"steamid":"76561198034071467","num_games_owned":1271,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":11763,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6635,"last_played":1647087765},"language":"english","review":"My child hood.","timestamp_created":1346590364,"timestamp_updated":1346590364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559748470783233643","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5991666","author":{"steamid":"76561198056783802","num_games_owned":323,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":3367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2127,"last_played":1613922484},"language":"russian","review":"Самая, на мой взгляд, лучшая часть из серии игр Half-Life 2.
