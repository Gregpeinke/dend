Now, this is a lengthy review, so if you want it brief, here it is: [u]Portal 2 is well worth your time and money![/u]  And now, our feature presentation\n\nFirst off, we have the structure of the game itself.  The level design is very impressive.  I have played many puzzle games, and when I play Portal 2, the effort put into it and the stress on quality is obvious.  The assests (interactive objects) are easy to find despite all of the detail of the battered-down facility, and the use of portals, the game's iconic feature, is incorporated effectively (and enjoyably!) throughout the game.  I would like to say Portal 2 is glitch-free, but if I ever clicked the mouse as it was loading, I would lose my ability to look an any direction and would have to restart. It may however be exclusive to Macs?  Despite that, it works fantastic and co-op is seamless.\n\nThen we have the story.  Portal 2 has an outstanding plot, nicely woven with its prequel.  I often found myself laughing at the dialouge, tapping my foot in suspense, and gasping in the uncovering of certain secrets.  (I couldn't help talking to the characters, as if they could hear me!)  Also, there are many easter eggs scattered throughout the game revealing stuff about the story, if you're observant (or interested) enough.\n\nConcerning the art side of it, the music could basically be used as soundtrack for a major film! The graphics are wonderful, and the detail is prodigious! (Thank you, thesaurus) The sound effects and voice acting perfectly convey the whole theme of the game.\n\nBut now I must adress the cons.  Here is the elaborate list if things I dislike: \n[list]\n[*]The credits song was not nearly as good as the song for the first Portal. \n[/list]\nThat's it, that's the only thing I don't like, and it's not even that I don't like it I just [i]prefer[/i] the other song.\n\nPortal 2 is a 10/10 game that I would recommend to anyone (except young'uns, it's not exactly all cheery and full of sunshine).  It is, in a word, phenomenal.  This game is not a waste of time or money!\n\n\nThis is a buy you won't regret!","timestamp_created":1487288858,"timestamp_updated":1487288858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29973044","author":{"steamid":"76561198091940464","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":6310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5733,"last_played":1648760308},"language":"french","review":"Tout premier jeu de mon compte Steam et aussi mon jeu préféré.

Si no te has jugado al Portal deberás jugarlo primero, es obligatorio. La personificación de una máquina que a medida que avanza el relato recobra una humanidad arrebatada, esto se llama personaje redondo. Algo que es digno de admirar en cualquier tipo de historia.

Y si quieren transformar a una máquina de una tonelada en una patata lo van a hacer. ¿Y sabes por qué?Porque en ese mundo en el que estas jugando es normal y te lo hacen creer sublimemente.\n\nComparando a Bioshock Infinite, su historia liaba el hilo, allí la historia intentaba que la creyeras.
