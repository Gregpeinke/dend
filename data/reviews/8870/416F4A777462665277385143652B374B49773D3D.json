На мой взгляд этого вполне достаточно, чтобы с игрой ознакомился каждый. Если стрелять по противникам совсем уж в тягость - просто выберете низкий уровень сложности. Хотя лично я проходил на высоком, кроме трех эпизодов, которые оказались мне не по силам, поэтому пришлось выставить \"средний\" уровень сложности. Помимо сюжета здесь прекрасная графика - очень рекомендуется большой монитор, а еще лучше большой телевизор, динамичный геймплей - нас постоянно держат в напряжении и чрезвычайно скрупулезно переданная атмосфера стимпанка с примесью старой америки, которую мы любили еще в Fallout. Если же прошли эту игру и вам она не понравилась - пожалуйста напишите мне почему. Мне правда хочется это знать.\n\nДобавленно: что касается DLC - их оценить, пожалуй, может лишь тот, кто играл в первую часть игры. Во время прохождения мне было если честно скучно, мне было странно и может даже неприятно видеть Элизабет в ее новом \"суровом\" облике, мне было непонятно наблюдать за развитием событий в Burial at Sea 2, но ознакомившись с сюжетом первой части (без этого что-то пытаться понять просто бесполезно) я пришел к выводу, что происходящее имеет смысл. Махатме Ганди понравилась бы Элизабет. А вот что не понравилось мне, так это дизайн \"сестричек\".В первых двух частях они были похожи на детей, а тут черты лица какие-то утрированные, словно разработчики намеренно хотели разграничить сестричек и обычных детей. Но смысл от этого теряется.

Lutece, Barriers to Trans-Dimensional Travel, 1889[/i] \n\nЭта игра - ещё одна из тех, что подтверждают - игры могут быть произведениями искусства. Рекомендую поиграть всем, независимо от того, играете ли вы в шутеры. Да что там - даже независимо от того, играете ли вы вообще в игры. Это не просто игра. Это произведение искусства, которое заставляет задуматься.\n\nСобытия игры являются альтернативной историей, не связаны с событиями первых двух частей серии BioShock, но происходят в той же вселенной. По сюжету, в 1900 году в США, находящейся на пике технологического развития, построили огромный летающий город Колумбия, который должен был стать гордостью американской нации и чудом среди творений человека. Однако, как сказал ДеВитт...\n\n    Just cause a city fly doesn't mean it ain't got its fair share of fools.\n\nПоэтому через некоторое время город начал вести свою, крайне экстремистскую политику, направленную против всех «не американцев», чем вызвал недовольство «земного» правительства. Президент США предъявил ультиматум, на что Колумбия под руководством некого Пророка... набрала высоту и исчезла из поля зрения высоко в облаках. И начали её жители жить изолированно в своего рода ковчеге, отделившись от содома внизу. Ибо:\n\n    What is Columbia if not another arc, for another time?\n\nСобственно, протагонист игры - бывший сотрудник «Детективного агентства Пинкертона» Букер ДеВитт. Человек сложный, потрепанный жизнью, достаточно циничный, но не потерявший в душе надежду на лучшее. Нравятся мне глубокие и хорошо прописанные герои. За ДеВитта приятно играть. Да-да. За бывшего пьяницу и игрока, не гнушающегося обыскивать трупы. Думающего, что он умеет только убивать (а еще есть всё, что лежит в ящичках стола и даже мусорках и давно стухло бы в реальности). Но его боль не наиграна, характер прописан так, как иногда и в книгах не прорабатывают - и хочется, чтобы у него был кусочек счастья. Вот так просто. Чтобы он не ждал везде подвоха. Чтобы не приходилось первым выхватывать пистолет.\n\n    One thing I've learned - if you don't draw first, you don't get to draw at all.\n\nВ 1912 году к нему обращается довольно странный клиент, знающий местоположение Колумбии, и под предлогом списания его долгов просит освободить заточенную в башне на протяжении всей её сознательной жизни девушку по имени Элизабет, обладающую сверхъестественными способностями. Вот такая завязка. И тут же игра слов (вообще говоря, даже двойная, но это понимаешь позже). Bring us the Girl and wipe away the debt». И тебе простится долг? В общем-то, да. Вот только у слова debt есть еще одно значение, так сказать, библейское – «грех». И оно тут еще как к месту.\n\nА. Да. А еще запомните - начинается всё всегда с маяка. И города. И человека.\n\n    Мы плаваем в разных морях, но выходим на тот же берег.\n\nПолный текст рецензии (без спойлеров, много текста и скриншотов): http://core-rpg.ru/forum/113-872-63062-16-1377775200","timestamp_created":1393935943,"timestamp_updated":1393935943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.668954193592071533","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9339372","author":{"steamid":"76561198022399449","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1621,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1121,"last_played":1422810645},"language":"english","review":"Never have I played a game where the accompanying AI character is so awesome as this one! 10/10 would play again!","timestamp_created":1393922985,"timestamp_updated":1393922985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9338805","author":{"steamid":"76561198053284521","num_games_owned":364,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2001,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":887,"last_played":1397927365},"language":"english","review":"Wow... this game is amazing.

Un je ne sais quoi qui flotte dans l'air et qui promet une expérience hors des sentiers battus. Bioshock Infinite fait partie de ces jeux. \"\n\nNos premiers pas à Columbia nous laissent profiter de la richesse de l'environnement. L'univers est riche, détaillé et on a qu'une envie, flâner dans les rues de cette cité volante. Mais pas le temps de rêvasser, il faut trouver la mystérieuse Elizabeth. Si à la base, la ramener servira à effacer les dettes de Booker De Witt, il s'avèrera rapidement que la jeune fille a plus d'importance qu'escompté. Fuir Columbia avec la demoiselle sera alors l'occasion de multiplier les scènes épiques où la contemplation de l'environnement laisse place aux combats nerveux. Notre arsenal est relativement restreint mais le plus amusant reste de jouer avec les Toniques, sortes de pouvoirs permettant de se sortir de situations délicates. \nAu final, le seul point négatif du jeu est sa fin. Non pas qu'elle soit mauvaise, mais elle nous laisse un goût amer dans la bouche, celui d'avoir raté quelque chose. Car, ne jouissant pas d'une durée de vie énrome, la fin va un peu vite mais permet l'interrogation, ce qui nous laisse méditer sur les évenements vécus durant notre épopée.
