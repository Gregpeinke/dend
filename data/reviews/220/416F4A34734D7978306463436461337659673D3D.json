With that said, most of the game holds up very well. The gunplay is okay, with very few weapons being accurate at a distance. The gun variety is very good though, so if you want to play it as a traditional duck and cover shooter, that's a possibility. The things that make this game a true joy to play and a cut above the rest are the physics and, specifically, the Gravity Gun. Anything and everything that isn't bolted down can be used as a weapon, so long as it isn't obscenely heavy (a washing machine is about the largest thing you can toss across a room). The physics puzzles throughout are fun and rewarding to complete, and the Gravity Gun adds an extra dimension that features in several of the middle chapters. \n\nAs with most First Person Shooters these days, there is plenty of time devoted towards vehicles, which includes an airboat and a buggy, both of which are effectively on rails but are still fun for the limited time and give enough control and leeway to not have rage inducing spots that you just can't get by.\n\nAnother facet is the inclusion of squad commander type sections, where you can tell a group of 4 constantly respawning allies to go lay down their lives for Aiur. In some parts it can be very effective, and some parts they just seem to be there for cannon fodder and to get in your way. Alongside this, there is are a few small Tower Defense segments. The variety of gameplay elements in the game has a wide breadth without any segment becoming stale, with the physics and shooting apparent throughout the entirety of the game.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1] \n\nAs I didn't play the original Half Life, the story didn't make much sense to me at all. After playing through the game several times in a few days, it still doesn't make much sense, but it was told in a way where not knowing won't cripple your enjoyment of the game. The final boss is rarely mentioned for much of the game, while the overarching enemy is completely faceless, which bothers me. I thought it was interesting, but didn't explain nearly enough for my tastes.\n\nOne thing that can't be overstated is that the missions don't overstay their welcome. Some games can just drag on and on and go from being fun to a grueling mess, but Half Life 2 is a solid 10 hours full of interesting content.\n\n[h1] Overall / TL;DR [/h1] \n\nIt's been a little over 10 years, but Half Life 2 is still a very solid game in this day and age. The gameplay can stand against the best of the FPS genre today and hold its ground, and the Source engine allows the physics elements to shine. The story is okay, neither amazing in and of itself nor a hindrance. I give it a 9/10 and highly recommend giving it a go for anybody like me who hasn't played it yet and is skeptical of all the hype.","timestamp_created":1476744101,"timestamp_updated":1476827971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26090323","author":{"steamid":"76561198285597232","num_games_owned":1002,"num_reviews":55,"playtime_forever":942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":874,"last_played":1504037689},"language":"english","review":"My review for this game is going to be a bit different from most. I had never heard of this game. I didn't play it when it first came out, and I have no fuzzy nostalgia feels to wrap up in while playing. I discovered this game 3 weeks ago, solely because of it's popularity and gave it a go. Here's a review from a non-fanboy who played it in 2016 for the first time.\n\nIt's a pretty fun game. I can definitely see how this game was ground breaking for it's time, and it has aged fairly well. My complaint? Very linear gameplay. \"Open world\" is definitely not very existant in this game (unless by \"open world\" you mean endless exploring to figure out how an obscure platforming section is supposed to be passed). Additionally, the car/boat driving levels were a bit excessive and definitely dragged on (I know lots of people love that part of the game, and I'll most likely get death threats over it, but one of the first missions of the game is a 30 min boat drive = not fun).\n\nTo the person who loves this game and has loved it since it first came out, why are you reading a review?\n\nTo the person like me who had never played it and is considering buying it: Don't buy it at full price. While it's a fun game, it really isn't \"the best game ever\" or \"amazing\" like so many here have said. It's an older game that was, at one time, really unique and fresh but now is a bit stale and cumbersome. \n\nDefinitely a fun game, but I would not say it's a great game.\n","timestamp_created":1476728033,"timestamp_updated":1476728033,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26089477","author":{"steamid":"76561198046571728","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":958,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":767,"last_played":1612621210},"language":"english","review":"This has to be one of the best games ever made...

It is this one. However for all the call of duty fans out there I come with a warning, this isnt a mindless shooter requiring no skill what so ever.
