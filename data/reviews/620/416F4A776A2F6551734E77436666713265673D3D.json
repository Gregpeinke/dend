A solid, enjoyable experience of relatively easy and sometimes moderate puzzles.\n\nThe single player is very cinematic at times, linear and story driven, all the while adding new elements into the game's puzzles, accompanied by voices of GladOS and Wheatly, the latter being a silly little comic relief ball who decided to help free you from Aperture's decaying facility. The characters and environments all have a certain charm to them, all the way down to the little turrets that try to kill you but scream helplessly when they are flying left and right after being knocked over by some flying companion cube. Sounds silly right? Portal mostly is.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the visuals easy to read, the soundtrack variable and appropriate; sometimes haunting, othertimes calm, pensive or even tense in some situations. The story is alright, I'm not going to say stellar, because for me personally, the pacing is a little off in places and characters are annoying and old [b]fast[/b].\n\nThe issues with pacing come in so far as the middle section of the game where you find yourself exploring the lower layers of Aperture's facility which predate GladOS etc; the setting is different and unique, but the game just feels SO SLOW at this point. I remember my time on my first playthrough thinking \"I wish I could get back to the modern stuff\". I don't know about anyone else, but the contrast between old and modern aesthetics really contributed to a sense of boredom within me, even though you are getting backstory to Aperture in an amusing way all the while.\n\nThe issues with the characters merely depend on how much you like the characters and their personalities, because GladOS is, well, GladOS; taunting, condescending, dispassionate and amusing. Meanwhile Wheatly is supposed to be funny, clumsy, bumbling, stupid (fact, not opinion), and interfering. While I enjoy the feeling of GladOS watching me go about my merry way in puzzles because there is usually some quip that is a little left-field and as such surprising and amusing. Whereas Wheatly is silly by design and there is only so much \"Oops I made a mistake, lets break things to make it better\" humour before it gets really old, REALLY FAST.\n\nThese latter criticisms of Portal 2 have a common theme; an element of boredom. Even with the interesting environments and things happening within the story, ultimately it boils down to the same actions over and over again, to a very linear, single-solution puzzle solving experience where at times it feels a little more like 'Do what you're supposed to in order to progress' than straight up puzzle solving. The locations can feed into this as well as aesthetics get boring (hence why they probably felt the need to change it mid-game. Equally, the characters are very limited in their interaction with you, and it really depends on your sense of humour as to whether you will either love or hate Wheatly. But with a style of humour quite so divisive, you will either find yourself bored or enthused for much of the game.\n\nThe game does come into it's own though in 2 ways; the process of changing the status quo (i.e. running amok in aperture outside of established puzzle rooms) as this gives you backstory and fleshes out the world in a variety of ways, and in the co-op wherein the potential for puzzles are magnified because of a second pair of portals flying around. There are some really creative and different challenges in co-op which are unlike anything you will have come across in single-player and is defintely worth exploring with a friend - as long as you can cope with many a foolish death from both of you.\n\nThere is now even support for community made puzzles in the workshop and these can provide some of the most challenging puzzles you will probably ever try to solve with portals - orders of magnitude better and more difficult than in the game itself. Sadly this only feeds into the contrast and a feeling that the game is just too easy and is less puzzle solving and more \"Put the portal where you are told like a good little human\". \n\nOverall however, most definitely worth it's asking price based on the inclusion of co-op and workshop support. Might want to give the first portal a go first though, to get you up to speed with what is going on in the world before you begin. Plus, it's a nice nostalgia trip into old-game land, introduces you to portals and GladOS, and is a short, compact experience.","timestamp_created":1496563000,"timestamp_updated":1496563000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32170032","author":{"steamid":"76561198116659822","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":44,"playtime_forever":520,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":456,"last_played":1648101848},"language":"english","review":"hella good song at the end, only thing i really remember\n","timestamp_created":1496561529,"timestamp_updated":1496561529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32169234","author":{"steamid":"76561198103049714","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":528,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":528,"last_played":1387048325},"language":"english","review":"I have the ending song memorized.

It's pretty good and like its sequel the primary means of gameplay is built around portals, or gateways you control. The execution of this concept is what carries the game. \"Portal 2\" also mixes up the formula nearly every other \"level\" to keep players on their toes. \n\nThe story, presentation, and music are great too. Areas tend to keep a particular theme, with the humor and commentary playing off areas implictly and blatantly. Unless you're a cyborg with a particular humorless OS or a guy/gal with bad taste, you'll chuckle or snort at least once. \n\n It's a fantastic way to spend an afternoon or life, depending on how clever you are. \n\nHighly recommended. It's usually on sale too, so no rush.","timestamp_created":1496264186,"timestamp_updated":1496264307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"32094125","author":{"steamid":"76561198083802307","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":987,"last_played":1555336421},"language":"english","review":"Portal 2 Is a Fantastic Game it is so worth £14.99 it tests your mind and heart to challenging levels and portals are awesome\n\n","timestamp_created":1496263670,"timestamp_updated":1496263670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj/eQsNwCffq2eg=="}
