Of course, the game has aged, but it truly is a memorable experience, with great gameplay. I will say, the ending is a little questionable, but in a good way. When it comes to the story, you will likely be a tad confused. To me, the story is a bit simple, but the way it is expressed makes it quite interesting. You may find yourself wondering how the world ended up this way and how on earth you'll make it through. But of course, gameplay happens and through your journey, you'll get a variety of weapons to choose from, but you may find yourself attached to the gravity gun. The gravity gun may not always be practical, but it certainly is fun. Lastly, the character range from, \"who are you?\" to \"hey, I know you\". But, in all seriousness, you'll like the main crew of people and MY GOD, the facial expressions are better than most modern games. To wrap this up, play it for the experience.","timestamp_created":1621839950,"timestamp_updated":1621839950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92507226","author":{"steamid":"76561199105648929","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1380,"last_played":1638729911},"language":"english","review":"why are you reading this?

Not incredible or anything, just good. This game however, improves on mostly every aspect the original game did. I think I'd still prefer the lonely, claustrophobic feel of the original, but that's just me.\n\nFirstly, gameplay has seen a vast upgrade in every department. There is so much nuance to the combat that it would be difficult to explain well in my limited review, but just know that every fight feels unique and satisfying with much more awesome weapons at your disposal. The movement feels so much better than Half-Life one. The game also throws in some different vehicles to spice up the gameplay. And while I think these sections go on for far longer than they have any right to, they can still remain somewhat fun. Puzzles are also very satisfying and exploring the world is also a treat.\n\nSpeaking of the world, the world and story might be my favorite thing about Half-Life 2. Without going into spoilers, Half-Life 2's story is very satisfying to see play out, even if it doesn't try anything new on the surface at least.  Half-Life 2 shows its characters, story, and world all through visual storytelling. Sure, there are those sections where stuff is explained to you but those pale in comparison to how the game truly lets its tale play out, Half-Life 2 is a huge fan of [i]show[/i] don't [i]tell[/i] (most of the time), and I love it. The combine are never stated to you to be actually awful aliens, but you can tell how fucking repulsive they are just by looking around. I heard the devs wanted you to experience the story without ever taking control away from you, and that approach worked 100%.  The gameplay is constantly in your control allowing you to experience rich gameplay with incredible visual storytelling. It amazes me that the game is able to do this without ever having a single cutscene.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a landmark title in gaming. It's not without its faults (mainly the sometimes wonky pacing), but these faults are [b]easily[/b] overshadowed by a game that feels so perfectly crafted. You owe it to yourself to play this.","timestamp_created":1621722020,"timestamp_updated":1657189261,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92433685","author":{"steamid":"76561197994070564","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1097,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":938,"last_played":1621796945},"language":"german","review":"Absoluter Klassiker, der auch von Nutzern mit veralteter Hardware genossen werden kann.","timestamp_created":1621719400,"timestamp_updated":1621719400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92431640","author":{"steamid":"76561199139580461","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2747,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2628,"last_played":1639245161},"language":"english","review":"...","timestamp_created":1621716617,"timestamp_updated":1621716617,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92430897","author":{"steamid":"76561198978993397","num_games_owned":47,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":533,"last_played":1659728588},"language":"english","review":"This has to be the best game i have ever played","timestamp_created":1621715544,"timestamp_updated":1621715544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"92429851","author":{"steamid":"76561199127683790","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":219,"last_played":1621954720},"language":"spanish","review":"Hermoso juego, un shooter genial, disfrutable, con una historia interesante, unas gráficas avanzadas para su época, el gameplay está muy bien trabajado es fácil de aprender, rápido.
