Never before has a puzzle game been able to capture players' attentions through both its storyline and presentation.\n\nTaking many of the gameplay elements introduced in Nuclear Monkey's \"Narbacular Drop\", Valve manages to perfect the formula with the use of their Source engine.  Each test chamber teaches the player a new way to progress the game, making them well prepared for their eventual escape and battle with GLaDOS.\n\nAnd, while we are on the topic of the world's angriest CPU, let us discuss just how masterful the writing is in this game.  While short, the story of Portal shines almost solely through the game's main antagonist.  With equally eerie and hilarious dialogue, GLaDOS shines as one of the best characters in video game villain history, and the ending fight with her shows her true colors quite epically.\n\nWhether you're a fan of puzzle games, first person shooters, or Valve games, this game was made for you.  On that note, I recommend that everyone should play this small nugget of gold.  The game is fairly cheap (you could buy lunch for more money than this) and goes on sale very frequently.
