A campanha possui 19 câmaras de testes, sendo impossível determinar em quanto tempo você levará para resolver cada uma, já que umas são mais difíceis que outras. Existem modos para quem já zerou. Modos como completar determinadas câmaras antes de determinado tempo, completar determinadas câmaras dando menos passos e completar determinadas câmaras em menos portais. Esses modos dão notas de bronze a ouro.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n É um FPS onde você pode apenas andar e pular. Você usa uma arma chamada Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, ou apenas Porta Gun. A Portal Gun é capaz de criar uma conexão entre dois pontos distintos, onde entrando em um ponto, você aparece no outro. Não funciona em todas as superfícies, sendo específico onde você deve colocar os portais. Existe o portal azul e o portal laranja, não importa qual portal você use primeiro ou por último. Funcionará do mesmo jeito.\n\n[h1]HISTÓRIA:[/h1]\n Chell acaba de acordar de um sono de tempo indeterminado, mas quem é Chell? Você é Chell, a principal personagem do jogo, que não fala. É guiada apenas por uma voz robótica feminina chamada GLaDOS, onde ela diz para completar as câmaras pela ciência! A história do jogo não é rica em detalhes, não possui cutcenes ou textos revelando algo, a única voz que ouvimos é a de GLaDOS. A história também não é clara, existe uma relativa dificuldade para entendermos, sendo necessário dar um certo esforço para entender. E no decorrer do jogo, você começa a desconfiar que talvez… É bom parar por aqui.\n\n[h1]PUZZLES:[/h1]\n É talvez o principal atrativo do jogo, os puzzles. É neles que ficaremos presos, nos matando para passar. É obrigatório que sejam bons, e são. Uma forma inovadora no estilo, portais para resolver puzzles? Alguém além dos desenvolvedores já pensou nisso? Puzzles estes que ficam cada vez mais complexos com o decorrer do jogo.\n\n[h1]CONCLUSÃO[/h1]\n Se vale comprar? Claro que vale! Criou uma das melhores antagonistas dos jogos, inesquecível para mim, só a experiência de conhecê-la já vale. Com todos estes pontes positivos dependerá de seu gosto, claro. É um estilo de jogo que nem todos gostam. A maioria que compra, compra pelo seu preço extremamente baixo (quando em promoção fica por dois reais). Veem como um pecado mortal não comprar um jogo tão barato. Compram e nunca jogam.

I love the humour, I love it so much I frequently use the Glados anouncer in Dota. You have a great villian by your side (so to speak) the entire game, and the difficulty curve goes up in a very consistent way. \n\nSide note: this is also a fantastic game for getting to grips with a Steam controller. And also for testing out various modes and functions in it. \n\nRecommended for people who like solving puzzles, gentle challenge curves that definitely do go upward, solitery game worlds, oodles of atmosphere, and humour so dry and dark that rubbing sand paper in the night would feel like silk. It's subtle story telling at it's finest. \n\nNot recommended for people who need to shoot big guns, blow lots up, don't enjoy puzzles or physics, are not contemplative, or really really do love

Es scheint zwar schon ein paar Jahre alt zu sein macht aber immer noch spaß und sieht auch noch angenehm gut aus. Ich mein die Spielmechanik, des Spieles ist einzigartig und hat damals frischen Wind auf den Markt gebracht, der bis heute nicht abgeklungen ist. Die Story des Spieles muss man sich selbst zusammenreimen, sie ist zwar nicht die tiefgreifenste aber reicht vollkommen aus um am Ball zu bleiben. Das liegt auch an dem Twist des Spieles rund um den Kuchen, der einen dazu ermuntert die Rätsel zu lösen um doch endlich seinen heißgeliebten Kuchen zu bekommen. Das Gameplay ist dabei grandios und mit Hilfe der Portalgun eine ganz besondere Erfahrung, die auch für pädagogische Zwecke wie in der Schule durchaus einsetzbar ist.\nKurz um, Portal ist was es ist: Ein gutes, wenn auch nicht großartiges (Dafür fehlt mir einfach mehr Tiefgang) Spiel, das Videospielgeschichte prägte und ein muss für jeden ist, besonders aber für die, die Kuchen mögen.","timestamp_created":1485728241,"timestamp_updated":1485728241,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29573433","author":{"steamid":"76561198000783570","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1485674686},"language":"english","review":"A unique and very entertaining game that you can easily play through in one sitting.
