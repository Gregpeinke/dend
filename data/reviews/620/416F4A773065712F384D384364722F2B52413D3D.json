I recommend getting the portal bundle so you can play the first one (if you haven't already, also the pack is a great deal) too. I have 100 hours on this game due to 7 playthroughs and all of the user-made levels to play.\n\nIf you like puzzles, then you'll LOVE this game. I really recommend not using ANY walkthroughs or spoiling anything for yourself before you play it. This review is short since I really would hate to spoil anybody's fun time in this game.\n\nEDIT: 100%'d, hard but fair and rewarding.[/strike]","timestamp_created":1443127717,"timestamp_updated":1579103698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18176332","author":{"steamid":"76561198121040868","num_games_owned":157,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":7753,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3028,"last_played":1644676170},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores jogos que já joguei.
