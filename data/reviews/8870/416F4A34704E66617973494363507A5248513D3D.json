Taking everything you love about Bioshock and making it new again without relying on what they've done with that game, Bioshock Infinite is one hell of a ride. \n\nCombat is similar, gaining magic powers and utilizing a variety of firearms (or the skyhook, if you prefer melee), Infinite does one better by allowing deep customization of these abilities, meaning you can find the ones you like and then broaden their appeal as opposed to constantly switching to adapt to a situation. Of course, that's always an option too.\n\nThe story is wonderfully crafted with three very well developed characters keeping you interested and a host of secondary personallities. Music has been incorporated into the game as you'll find familiar tunes playing or being sung by various background characters. At the center of this, Booker and Elizabeth, their relationship an ebb and flow of dialogue and emotion that you simply cannot put down.\n\nIf you're the sort of gamer who enjoys the experience, narrative and characters that are possible within our wonderful interactive medium, then this is exactly the sort of game you'd want to play.","timestamp_created":1385606170,"timestamp_updated":1385606170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7797895","author":{"steamid":"76561197969627334","num_games_owned":364,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1470,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":899,"last_played":1518143042},"language":"spanish","review":"Awesome game.

Combat is fast-paced and exciting, Skylines and Tears add so much to everything you do.  Booker and Elizabeth are well crafted characters that really make you care for them.\nThe Story is fantastic, I keep finding myself thinking about this game, and playing it more just to do every little thing and rediscover the immersive narrative.\nThere are far little drop backs that anyone can really see without doing heavy nitpicking, it's definitely a must own title.\nGrab it when you have the chance, and if there is a sale grab it now!\n\n(CLASH IN THE CLOUDS)\nFun mini-DLC to tide us over until Burial at Sea came out, and by god it is hard as hell!  Getting all the Blue ribbons in the arena is a huge challenge.  If you wanted to know what kind of fun you could have with the mechanics of Bioshock Infinite, this is the place to test them out.\nArena-based DLC, so those of you might not like it on it's own, but it is a great deal in the Season Pass!\n\n(BURIAL AT SEA)\nExcellent DLC, I was floored seeing the new environment with all the old quirks of the first Bioshock game.  The updated graphics and mechanics really mesh the two games beautifully.  The new weapons and plasmid added are also amazing!

At first this game was trash to my eyes: it made my sight hurt because of the art style, it bored me in the beginning, it made me want to bite my thumbs off and spit them straight to the screen. But after giving it a second chance it really grew on me. I started playing more and more until I finally loved it.\n\nAll in all, it's still not a 10/10; I see MANY defects in the game. But the story is so... so... I don't know which words to use to describe it. It's so goddamn good, and more. It is, after all, Bioshock. \n\nThe whole setting of Columbia, bright and open, is a high contrast and big change from the dark depths of Rapture. There are no more mutant monsters; this time, you're the enemy. \n\nThe gameplay is fair with a controller, though I really hated playing it with the keyboard and mouse; it was really obvious they didn't have those in mind when they stated the mechanics of the game. Specially in Hard difficulty; I died a lot with mouse and keyboard, but died a lot less with controller. It's the first time I see a shooter where you can aim better with a controller. Anyway, after making the switch to my trusty XBOX 360 controller, all got better.\n\nAND THE STORY FEATURES A MULTIVERSE AND TIME-TRAVEL, INCLUDING PARADOXES! I LOVE THOSE!\n\nIf you've played all the previous Bioshock games (or at least the first) and loved it then this is a must have for you. You'll love the story. The gameplay is not as good as the first one, but still after a few tweaks it's still enjoyable.\n\nAnd don't forget to grab the DLC as well if you can afford it, you will see a lot of old friends.","timestamp_created":1385604597,"timestamp_updated":1385638753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537754654884338379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7796985","author":{"steamid":"76561197981204501","num_games_owned":604,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":449,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":449,"last_played":1367132400},"language":"english","review":"Its good, but after first playthough its just another shooter. story is the selling point","timestamp_created":1385601418,"timestamp_updated":1385601418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525569796562194824","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7796762","author":{"steamid":"76561198014836751","num_games_owned":576,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1483,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1402,"last_played":1411602043},"language":"english","review":"One of the most important games of this generation.

Moments of respite and tender introspection are robbed of effect when they are sandwiched by corridor and arena gunfights; the weapons and enemies are tastefully exaggerated and hint at deeper character, but behave in clumsy and predictable patterns.  When following its own animated routines, the cloud-borne city of Columbia hums with life; yet the game almost audibly clicks into a different gear when combat begins, rushing the player along past remarkable scenery to the next grind of banal enemies.\n\nIt looks so good, yet it really offers so little at its core.\n\nFor fans of prior BioShock entries, there is a good mix of familiar near-historic grounding and paranormal abilities and foes.  Steampunk construction with old-time conservative values, dehumanizing elite societies and... Well, classic petty rivalries that unmake the best plans.\n\nThe game doesn't stand up nearly as well as its forebears upon subsequent playthroughs.  Its effect is spent on the first tour; the few presented 'choices' throughout the game fail to resolve in a meaningfully divergent fashion - though this could be in service to the game's subtext: it doesn't matter what you choose to do, there is always another possibility.\n\nMechanically speaking, there are few activities other than taking cover, scrounging for ammo and pulling the trigger.  Bullets hit enemies with satisfying splatter, former Plasmids (now Vigors) allow you to cheat and disable enemies with colorful forms of alternate damage and specialty foes are best circle-strafed to death.\n\nExcellent voice acting and delivery on the part of the cast, good lighting effects and textures, and it's a sincere pleasure to explore pieces of Columbia between the gunfights.\n\nElizabeth, an NPC companion for much of the game, was a labor of love for the team -and it shows.  One of the first times in an adventure shooter where a compatriot did not get in the way, provided useful in-game mechanics and had a distinct personality all in one package.  Sure, there are ways to break her behavior, but this leading lady makes a fine centerpoint for the game's plot developments.  She will be there to supply you with money, weapons and loving sutures, depending on what she finds scattered about the floor.  She'll offer perspective, comment on your (admittedly monstrous) behavior and even sing a song if you're lucky.\n\nAlso maybe warp and rend reality with cataclysmic powers.  You'll just have to play and see.\n\nThe story DLC is yet to be completely unveiled, but the theme remains the same: excellent setting, poor fit of action stylings.\n\nThe game is still a recommended purchase, but be aware what you're going into it for:  An interesting take on a fictional place with wonderfull wallpaper but poor wiring.

You get a shield that absorbs damage until it's broken, then you must get behind cover and not get damaged to get your shield recharged. You're also arbitrarily limited to a grand total of two weapons, not counting your melee, which is just a button you hit and not actually selectable. Aside from that, the combat itself is very poor consisting entirely of \"shoot these guys.\" Sometimes you can get Elizebeth to summon an unlimited item cache or an automated turret from an alternate reality, but the turret dies pretty quickly and is pretty much useless, as are the item caches since Elizebeth is a fountain of free items, but I'll get to that later.\n\nStory: The story is the most nonsensical convoluted garbage I've ever had the displeasure to endure. I'll try not to spoil anything, but this game makes use of alternate realities as a plot device, which can be really good if done well. Sadly this is not the case. The alternate realities are just a convenient excuse to explain away anything that doesn't make sense, essentially the equivalent of \"a wizard did it.\" The antagonist of the game, Comstock, is an evil, radical, super racist, psychotic religious leader and self-proclaimed prophet who built a flying city whose whole reason for being all that is literally the fact that he got some water poured on him, otherwise he would be a poor, drunk war veteran living in a cheap apartment regretting his actions in the civil war. I am not joking, that is literally the whole reason he's evil. The final moments of the game consist of twenty minutes of exposition because the entire plot is such a tangled mess that this was the only way the writers could attempt to make sense of it. And they failed. Miserably.\nElizebeth has these powers to open \"tears\" or portals to alternate realities and as you jump from reality to reality over and over you lose track of which was the original, but the charcaters don't seem to care at all, despite their entire world changing each time.\n\nLevel Design: Each and every level in this game consists of two things. You either get a mob arena, or a small enclosed area for some story to happen or poorly written exposition. I've really got nothing else to say here.\n\nCharacters: I feel all the characters and their motivations are poorly written in this game, especially the antagonist, Comstock, who I've already talked about. Without spoiling anything, Booker is looking to pay off a debt he owes...By bringing them this girl, Elizebeth. I'm sorry, but what kind of good guy takes a woman he doesn't know to some seriously shady people to pay off a debt? Literally all other characters are cardboard cut outs. You've got greedy corprate shill who shows up for five seconds, strong independent black woman who don't need no man and mysterious duo who are mysterious for shits 'n giggles.\n\nEnemies: 90% of the enemies you face in this game are generic soldiers who use guns. Sometimes you will face a pyromaniac, a dude who sends flocks of ravens at you and a giant part mechanical man who is a bit of a tank, he's essentially the replacement for the Big Daddy, but you don't have a choice of fighting him, he just shows up and attacks you. Last, but not least, you have this annoying ghost-like banshee that makes literally no sense, she ressurects anything in the area and constantly sends them after you.

This game had both amazing mechanics and an incredible story. Only when I first open the game and was in the menu I was excited about playing it because of the amazing graphics, the realistic, alive looking characters and the whole enviornment. The game start of very basic and you get to explore the amazing looking city of Columbia. It's not so long before you get to use your first gun and the Vigors was very fun to use and very basic. The further you get into the game the gameplay gets a more fun to play, you get to explore different universes and the story evolves into something incredible and by the end you will be mesmerized about the gameplay, the story and what is there for you to explore. This game has a lot, and I mean a lot when I say it, amazing reviews and there is absolutely a reason for it!

Os dois primeiros Bioshocks foram uma das melhores experiências em FPS da última geração, o primeiro tinha uma história ambiciosa, jogabilidade sólida e divertida, poderes variados, uma enorme gama de armas e plasmids que tornavam o combate variado. E o segundo, apesar de ter uma história BEM mais fraca, melhorou ainda mais a jogabilidade e teve uma conclusão satisfatória.\n\nBioshock infinite joga grande parte da ótima base que foi desenvolvida nos últimos jogos pela janela e torna o jogo em um enorme corredor com inimigos retardados e pouquíssima variação. A limitação de armas é ridícula e desnecessária, forçando jogadores a aderir a apenas poucas combinações/estratégias. Inimigos basicamente não fazem nada, apenas atiram parados e tomam 4 cartuchos de balas na cara até morrerem, isso nas maiores dificludades. No Normal e Easy, eles são ainda mais fracos e quase fazem nada. O sistema de Salts é outra limitação desnecessária que força você a ficar correndo atrás de maquinas de venda ou torcer para elizabeth te jogar mais no meio da luta.\n\nA história começa promissora, porém logo se mostra um desastre a nível narrativo, Se perde em vários pontos, tem que dar várias voltas para continuar e é bem claro que tiveram que reescrever em vários pontos, já que vários fatores como Songbird,  Os garotos fone, etc foram retirados do foco da história. Os poderes de Elizabeth também quase não fazem diferença na maioria das vezes já que em dificuldades maiores, o que quer que ela faça aparecer é quebrado instantaneamente ou não possui o mesmo nível de utilidade.\n\nPara ser justo, o jogo possui alguma coisas boas, os personagens em si são bem interessantes e razoavelmente bem desenvolvidos, as skylines são uma adição bem interessante ao jogo e Columbia é linda.\n\nInfinite está longe de ser um ótimo jogo, é no máximo passável, e um desapontamento quando comparado a seus antecessores.\n\nJogue Bio 1 e 2, melhores jogos, e devem ser bem mais baratos que esse jogo.","timestamp_created":1385579554,"timestamp_updated":1385579826,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.371261417865753174","comment_count":32,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7789363","author":{"steamid":"76561198017893198","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1686,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":843,"last_played":1594704603},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buen juego .

For some that may be great, for others its tiring and rehashed. If you have played Bioshock 1 and 2, and are a fan of its combat system and dystopian society storyline you should get it. If you want fast paced sharp combat and aren't much interested in getting immersed in a  story I would look elsewhere. \n\nOn a sidenote, the save system is an attrocity. There is no way to manually save, neither quick save nor menu save. The checkpoints are often times spread out, forcing you to keep playing or lose sometimes 20 minutes worth of progress. Put a huge damper on my fun, as I absolutely loath checkpoint systems like this. Nowadays it should not be a problem to add such a functionality, but I suspect it might be related to consoles.

It mirrors a dark side of history and has you stare into the eyes of violence and what a man can/must do.

Es handelt sich zwar um einen First-Person-Shooter, denoch steht das schießen nicht im Vordergrund. Zu entdecken gibt es die fliegende Stadt \"Columbia\" im Jahre 1912. Als Privatdetektiv und Ex-Pinkterton Booker DeWitt, der bis zum Hals in Schulden steht, erhält man den Auftrag, die junge Elizabeth aus Columbia zu retten. Die Einwohner Columbias lassen sich in zwei Gruppen einteilen: Die weißen Bürger, die nach Columbia gekommen sind, um ihrem \"Propheten\" Zachary Hale Comstock zu huldigen und die schwarzen Sklaven, die eine Revolution planen. Der Protagonist gerät zwischen die Fronten und muss sich der neuartigen Technologien bedienen, die es in der fliegenden Stadt gibt, um seinen Auftrag zu erfüllen.\nMan mag die geringe Waffenauswahl kritisieren, aber die Technologien der Stadt machen dies mehr als wett. Als erstes wäre da der Sky-Hook. Diese Waffe wird zum Nahkampf-Angriff, bzw. zur Exekution verwendet. Ursprünglich entworfen um an den Sky-Lines von Columbia von einer fliegenden Insel zu nächsten zu kommen, kann man ihn hervoragend im Kampf einsetzen um an den Sky-Lines mit hoher Geschwindigkeit den Kugeln und Geschossen auszuweichen, um sich schießlich auf einen Gegner herabfallen zu lassen. Als nächstes wären da die soganannten \"Risse\". Was diese genau sind wird hier aus Spoiler Gründen nicht genau veraten, aber durch sie kann man sich im Kampf enorme Vorteile verschaffen. Die wahrscheinlich spannenste Technologie sind die genverändernden Kräfte. Durch sie hat man nicht nur ein permanentes Magnetschild, das bis zu einem gewissen Maß Kugeln abwehrt und sich nach einiger Zeit wieder auflädt, sondern auch noch 8 verschiede Fähigkeiten, die aktiv eingesetzt werden und sich sogar kombinieren lassen um Gegner effektiv zu beseitigen. \nErwähnenswert ist auch Elizabeths Eigenschaft, den Protagonisten von Zeit zu Zeit während eines Kampfes mit Munition, Verbandszeug oder Salzen (benötigt zum Einsatz von Kräften) zu versorgen. Ein Nachteil an diesen Features ist, dass das Spiel dadurch relativ einfach ist und man als erfahrener Spieler selten in Bedrängnis kommt. Diese Stellen sind dann meistens die Bosskämpfe, bei denen leider die Bossauswahl sehr begrenzt ist.\nGameplay ist natürlich nicht alles am Spiel. Die Stadt Columbia ist wunderbar atmosphärisch in Szene gesetzt, und nutzt dazu auch eine passende Grafik, mit ihrem eigenen Stil, und einen passenden Soundtrack. Es sei zu erwähen, dass es leider nur wenige unterschiedliche Charaktermodelle gibt.\nDas bei weitem beeindruckenste ist die hochkomplexe Story, die bereits am Anfang damit beginnt, viele Hinweise auf das Ende zu geben, das dadurch aber immer noch nicht zu erraten ist. Man kann in Bezug auf die Story zurecht den Begriff \"Mindfuck\" verwenden, denn nach dem ersten Durchspielen ist es quasi ausgeschlossen, alles zu verstehen, weshalb das Spiel für ein zweites Mal durchspielen motiviert.\nWer vom Gameplay oder der Story nicht genug bekommt, dem sind die DLCs zu empfehlen. \"Clash in the Clouds\" ist ein Arenamodus, der eine große Herausforderung bietet, und denjenigen eine Freude bereitet, die von den Kräften und Sky-Line-Kämpfen nicht genug bekomment konnten. \"Burial at Sea\" ist ein Story-DLC, das den \"Mindfuck\" aus dem Hauptspiel nocheinmal aufkommen lässt.\nBioshock Infinite ist ein herausragendes Spiel, das für jeden Story-Liebhaber geeignet ist, der sich von Gewalt in Spielen nicht abschrecken lässt. Diejenigen jedoch, die auf einen stumpfsinnigen Standard-Shooter aus sind, sind hier fehl am Platz.\nUnter diesen Vorraussetzungen eine absolute Kaufempfehlung.","timestamp_created":1385560003,"timestamp_updated":1385560003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7783624","author":{"steamid":"76561197967967456","num_games_owned":3984,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3370,"last_played":1470622743},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is an unusual game. If measured by technical standards, one could say it is an above average shooter. But there is a lot more than just the gears that make gameplay - it is a triumph in narrative, as well as a bold move by creator Ken Levine in leveraging the idea of an auteur game. He pulls no punches in playing with taboo themes such as prejudice (which most publishers would avoid to guarantee the biggest possible demographic) and throws some potentially offensive/unpopular moments. But this is a game that will stir a lot in you.\n\nIt should be noted, the game is very different from the trailers/previews shown months before release. The game had to be entirely retooled because of its overambitious goals, so if you are expecting something like the old E3 demos, you are in for disappointment. But if you came for the same brilliant ambiance seen in the original Bioshock, an emotional rollercoaster and thought-provoking steampunk storytelling, you are in for quite a ride. Just \"pardon the dust\" on the not-so-polished gameplay, probably a leftover from the game's last-minute deconstruction and reconstruction. All things considered, the final product is still impressive, even if the playability isn't nothing to write home about. It's how the game tugs at your heartstrings that counts.","timestamp_created":1385555609,"timestamp_updated":1385555609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712488174438477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7783086","author":{"steamid":"76561198047185677","num_games_owned":601,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":5764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1936,"last_played":1657664290},"language":"russian","review":"Интерестная игра советую","timestamp_created":1385552515,"timestamp_updated":1385552515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7782809","author":{"steamid":"76561198021178990","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":352,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":106,"last_played":1385422734},"language":"english","review":"Am I the player or has the game played me.

Honestly, going into it, I wasn't sure what to expect. Singleplayer games haven't really hit home for me since I played games like Sly Cooper on the PS2. But good lordy was I wrong. It may sound ludicrous to consider this game's story to be better than that of a blockbuster film, but it IS. From the very beginning, Infinite begins to reel you into its vast and convoluted story, which constantly revolves around themes of religion, secularism, and corruption ingrained within a society which secludes itself in a city in the sky. I truly felt connected to the characters, but above all, the dynamic between Booker and Elizabeth is awe-inspiring and incredible to experience. The gameplay is fantastic, whether in a skirmish with Columbian police across a deserted market place, or a frantic firefight with a fireman. And of course, the integration of \"tears\" and the skylines as means of transportation in and out of battle flows seamlessly. Elizabeth, rather than a burden in battle, holds her own, and will even keep you supplied on both ammo and money. And at the very center of it, is the peculiar character of Booker Dewitt, whose personality is unfolded before the player's eyes, as they play as him. He is the only player character that I've seen with successful voice-acting, and it really adds something I don't think can be found in other games.\n\nAs a whole, Bioshock Infinite is many things. It is a perfect example of why I CONSTANTLY defend video games as an art form. In short, it IS the best single player game of 2013, and delivers an experience unlike any other. 10/10\n\n-Butters\n\n","timestamp_created":1385511006,"timestamp_updated":1385511006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7776952","author":{"steamid":"76561198039556881","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1148,"last_played":1531513258},"language":"english","review":"s'good\n\n\n\n\n\nbuy it.","timestamp_created":1385510969,"timestamp_updated":1385510969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7776948","author":{"steamid":"76561197995673694","num_games_owned":694,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":843,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":843,"last_played":1385809644},"language":"english","review":"This is truely a great game.

Эта игра оставила мне столько позитивных эмоций, что о таком приключении и забыть невозможно. 10 из 10 баллов, не меньше.","timestamp_created":1385490422,"timestamp_updated":1385490422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":935,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.904231727123260498","comment_count":25,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7770277","author":{"steamid":"76561198010543576","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":845,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":845,"last_played":1374092905},"language":"czech","review":"Povodny Bioshock bola nuda, toto je ovela,ovela lepsie.
