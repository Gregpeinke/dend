They all had their problems but I could not enjoy the 3rd instalment. \n\nOverall the game is too easy, it won't let you choose the hardest difficulty from the start and the hard setting can be cleared even by a monkey. Hard is supposed to be hard, period.\nAmmo is literally unlimited, never had to buy any at all. The shield is busted, all you have to do is take cover until it regenerates and carry on killing enemies by said tactic from afar. In very few instances you get forced to play close and if so you have some overpowered builds with charge and so on. It reminds me of Tomb raider where I had to drop since it literally was holding my hand. If you like Uncharted/Tomb Raider holding hand difficulty Bioshock Infinite is the same. Not my cup of tea. \n\nAt least you don't have to solve these annoying puzzles like BS1 and the turrets are way less (DLC included).\nAlso, I find it frustrating that you have to keep spamming interact to collect the overabundant items hidden all over the place. This game style hasn't been fixed since the BS1 and I mean fixed because I find hard to believe that anyone enjoys collecting 5 different items repeatedly on small area spaces. \n\nStory is a mess. I dislike time/space relate stories because everything is open to interpretation and you can get away with it. Bioshock infinite was advertised as a different game, different story but eventually for some reasons we got a different game.\n\nOn the dlc Elizabeth tends to bodyblock you a lot. On an instance she bodyblocked me while I was crouching waiting to ambush 2 enemies. Had to jump to get out revealing myself and dying...\n\nI hope if BS4 is a thing, that the overall gameplay is improved.","timestamp_created":1658930433,"timestamp_updated":1658930635,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.434782594442367554","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119577740","author":{"steamid":"76561198436695494","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":606,"playtime_last_two_weeks":19,"playtime_at_review":546,"last_played":1659868820},"language":"english","review":"grabbed this as my first bioshock game lol, this game is beautiful, and fun","timestamp_created":1658930383,"timestamp_updated":1658930383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119571958","author":{"steamid":"76561198287970887","num_games_owned":51,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":656,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":609,"last_played":1658924901},"language":"english","review":"Story too rich, made me feel poor.","timestamp_created":1658922652,"timestamp_updated":1658922652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119569701","author":{"steamid":"76561198015265428","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1062,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1062,"last_played":1658883448},"language":"spanish","review":"¿Qué no decir bueno de este juego?

This forces players to unnecessarily choose between weapons while in the previous games we could have sizeable arsenals at all time. At one point it really hurts the experience. Without spoilers, there is this one enemy that is a major bullet sponge. A few extra guns would really make a world of difference.\nThe ending is pretty out there, even for Bioshock standards. I wasn't fully satisfied with how the game ended. It, and the final boss fight felt rushed. All of those things drag the game down a notch or two below B1 and B2 (yes, I'm saying it: Bioshock 2 is better than Inifinite, in both story and game play :D).\n\nAll the above aside, this is still a great game, well worth playing. While the ending may not fully deliver, it's not out right bad. And for the most part the story is quite fun to follow. I also like the characters, especially Elizabeth. She is very well written and portrayed during the game. Also, as AI managed companions go, she is quite useful in fights :). Her mid-to-late game ability is really fun to use. Too bad it's limited to scripted locations.\n\nI also very much like the setting. Rapture is awesome, iconic underwater city, but to me personally Columbia, a city in the sky, beats it hands down.

While the shooting itself feels a more crisp, the aspect of resource management from the first two games is completely gone. Instead of having a health bar with medkits, you just have one massive health bar and restorative items are used immediately upon picking them up. The game showers you with ammo, meaning you don't really need to think about how you're using it. This also means that money is pointless except for buying the major upgrades for your guns and vigors. There's also a new shield mechanic that works the same as Halo, except it's pretty pointless as it barely blocks anything. The vigors (which are the replacement for plasmids from the first two games) just aren't as fun or creative as the plasmids from the first two games, as I don't feel like I need to use them creatively. Additionally, the basic enemies are just a huge downgrade from what we had previously. Splicers in the older titles were aggressive and had good AI, while the soldiers in Bioshock Infinite feel more like braindead mooks from a Call of Duty campaign. Honestly, a whole squad of soldiers in this game is less threatening than a single splicer from Bioshock 1 and 2. As such, the game really isn't challenging until nearly the end of the game (and I was playing on Hard BTW). Level design is also a lot more linear with not much opportunity to explore off the beaten path.\n\nIt's not all bad though. While the basic soldiers are boring, when the game throws special enemies at you, they are fun to fight. The automatons, patriots, handymen, and firemen are all fun to fight. The combat also flows fairly well. I also enjoy the sky hook mechanic, which adds a cool dynamic to fights. The tear mechanic adds a hint of strategy to the game, allowing youu to make choices such as sky hook points for faster traversal, extra weapons and restorative items, friendly machines to fight alongside you, etc.\n\nThen there's the story. There are some things I love about it. The city of Columbia is a really interesting setting that I absolutely adore. Another high point are the characters, who are interesting and well written, and I especially love the dynamic between Booker Dewitt and Elizabeth. However, the actual plot is a complete mess. it pulls in way too many directions at once, trying to focus on many things but succeeding at virtually none of them, and it only gets more confusing the longer it goes on. After beating it, I had to look up explanations on the internet just to [strike]enjoy[/strike] understand what was going on, and even then I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around it, mostly because about halfway through the game, they decided to bring in multiple universes into the plot for some reason. Also, besides one throwaway scene of absolutely no significance, this game does not connect to the other games in a meaningful way.\n\nTL;DR: Bioshock Infinite takes many steps back from its predecessors in terms of gameplay and story, but it's not entirely bad, as I enjoyed it enough to actually beat the game. I'd say get it on sale if you're interested, but don't expect it to be as good as the first two games.","timestamp_created":1658703439,"timestamp_updated":1658703746,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119409369","author":{"steamid":"76561199055251391","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":691,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":583,"last_played":1658934667},"language":"turkish","review":"Elizabeth için oynanır","timestamp_created":1658700854,"timestamp_updated":1658700936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119406732","author":{"steamid":"76561198065141131","num_games_owned":151,"num_reviews":37,"playtime_forever":1716,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1445,"last_played":1658793771},"language":"english","review":"Great Game, Maybe someday we will get more!","timestamp_created":1658697386,"timestamp_updated":1658697386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119405593","author":{"steamid":"76561198075429111","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":5515,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5515,"last_played":1651363781},"language":"english","review":"[h1] 3 out of 5 [/h1]","timestamp_created":1658696011,"timestamp_updated":1658696011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458768874406814575","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119402556","author":{"steamid":"76561198375753063","num_games_owned":125,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1234,"last_played":1658692104},"language":"english","review":"90% of it was amazing, but crashes all the time under win 10. but i finished it anyway.","timestamp_created":1658692323,"timestamp_updated":1658692323,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"119391519","author":{"steamid":"76561199193017259","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":259,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":259,"last_played":1653075643},"language":"schinese","review":"[h1]真正的第九艺术[/h1]\n深刻难忘的剧情，如梦如幻的天空城，生动鲜活的人物形象，伊丽莎白就像一个活生生的人出现在心中，[spoiler] 却又悲伤的离去......

The unused content would probably make the game even better. Hopefully bioshock 4 will be good, and will implement the good things that 1, 2, and infinite did. Anyways, quite a good story and graphics, the battles are fun and the powers are cool, the performance is good with lowres on lowspec computers. Like everything, it has flaws. Not a big fan of the elizabeth speech with the ghost mother and it certainly could use some subtitles for the voxophones.
