Em tempos onde tal aspecto é tão cobrado, mas pouco compreendido, Portal aproveitou da melhor lacuna para aplicá-lo com perfeição: utilizar de uma ideia, mecânica ou base já existente, mas com roupagens e pontos de vistas totalmente novos que reestruturam toda a base do gameplay. \n\nExplicando de maneira mais prática, o que Portal faz é pegar a perspectiva de primeira pessoa numa jogabilidade de FPS, mas mudando um aspecto básico do gênero: a arma que o personagem possui não dispara projéteis e sim portais. Uma mudança única, mas que redefine toda a estrutura do jogo e abre portas (ou seria portais?) para inúmeras outras ideias. Como o uso de incríveis elementos de puzzle a partir da criação de portais, e a elaboração de um level design com formato de plataforma. Mesclando assim três gêneros em um só: FPS, puzzle e plataforma. A junção de três estruturas de gameplay absolutamente estabelecidas no mercado e imensamente populares (e que já foram utilizadas à exaustão), mas que quando conduzidas por um conceito próprio, criaram um jogo absolutamente inovador. Como complemento a isso, uma narrativa simples, mas muito bem contada, alicerçada no extremo carisma da vilã GLaDOS numa performance absolutamente espetacular, mesmo se resumindo a apenas uma voz ao longo de quase todo o jogo. \n\nJogo obrigatório e que entrou para história, mesmo sendo uma experiência curta e relativamente simples se comparada a outros grandes títulos AAA que foram seus contemporâneos.
