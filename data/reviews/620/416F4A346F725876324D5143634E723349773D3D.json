You feel so dumb up to the point you figure out the puzzle chamber and it’s like a spark of satisfaction that feels good up to the point you walk into the next chamber and have ABSOLUTLY no idea how to solve it. The voice acting is fantastic as well, every character sounds EXSACTLY how you would expect and it really makes this game worth the money. One thing i did not expect when this game came out was the multi-player. Having an extra mind in the game with you solving puzzles that are impossible to complete alone is more fun than i have ever had in any multi-player game ever.

В ней нужно решать множество задач с помощью всего двух порталов (вход и выход). Игра проходит, как в замкнутых комнатах, так и на открытых пространствах.\n\nВ отличие от первой части в игре значительно увеличилось количество различных механизмов, лазеров, добавились гели со специфическими способностями. Всего и не описать. И чем дальше, тем головоломки становятся сложней и изощренней.\nИгра разбита на главы. Которые принципиально отличаются друг от друга, что придало игре разнообразия и неповторяемости головоломок.\n\nХочется отметить юмор игры. Как и в первой части, приходится постоянно слышать речь роботов. А она, поверьте мне на слово, очень забавна, будь это робот, контролирующий всё помещение, или, просто, робот-охранник. Также присутствуют юморные головоломки, которые поднимают, и без того хорошее, настроение.\nЗвуковое сопровождение отличное. Звуковые эффекты нареканий не вызывают. Музыки не много, но она здорово поддерживает атмосферу происходящего.\nТакже в игре присутствует возможность построения комнат. Так сказать, блеснуть сообразительностью и создать, почти, неразрешимую головоломку и послать в сеть. А можно играть уже созданные кем-то комнаты, загрузив из той же сети в Стим.\nМожно играть и вдвоём, но я не пробовал, поэтому сказать ничего не могу.\n\nДостоинства:\n* Большой плюс для ума\n* Потрясный сюжет\n* Хорошая современная графика\n* Уникальный геймплей\n* Доля хорошего юмора(черный юмор в том числе)\n* Харизматичные персонажи\n* Добавлены новые испытания\n* Появился кооперативный режим\n* Мультиплеер\n* Много разнообразных уровней\n* Удобное управление\n* Система диалогов\n* Незабываемая атмосфера\n* Качественная озвучка\n\nНедостатки:\n- Как и все подобные игры - затягивает\n- Достаточно требовательна в плане железа\n\n\nЯ нисколько не пожалел о сделанной покупке. Эта игра отлично подойдёт людям, желающим пораскинуть мозгами. Я с большим удовольствием играл в нее.\n\nС всего выше сказанного  я ставлю игре 5/5","timestamp_created":1394703218,"timestamp_updated":1410376270,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519685029983520508","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9445789","author":{"steamid":"76561198054986993","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":2234,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1369,"last_played":1615328867},"language":"english","review":"LOVE THIS GAME!!
