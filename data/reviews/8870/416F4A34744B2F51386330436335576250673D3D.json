Starting with the plot twisting madly and ending with Mozart's music playing at some location (exactly my favorite - Requiem) - everything is simply perfect. \nThe burning world of cruelty where it is impossible to recognize friends or foes: people, machines - everyne wants to kill you because they were told to. But there is the only one. A young beautiful girl, her pain becoming man's anger, her dreams becoming man's goals. The story is so beautiful... I can't wait to know the end, but i'm stuck with a battle difficult as hell.\nI always believed that games are like mirrors of reality. And holy ... I'm so right. Yes. This game is the ugly truth about the world of false morality whatever the sourse is. Humanity and love are the only true morality. \nI love the characters - they are so classical, but so fresh and mystical! Increadable. \nFine system of hints. Also I like that Elisabeth helps with health, money, ammo and salts and also makes some hints.

Finished this game and it is by far, one of the best games I've ever played. Beautiful story, great gameplay, and it definitely makes you get the feels. I loved having Elizabeth as my companion and I don't think any game I'll play from now on will ever make me feel connected to someone as well as Elizabeth and Bioshock Infinite did. Everyone should play this game at least once in their lives.","timestamp_created":1434184630,"timestamp_updated":1434184630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16349879","author":{"steamid":"76561198089189552","num_games_owned":340,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":617,"last_played":1434197950},"language":"japanese","review":"SALEの時ちょっと前から気になっていたので購入\n\nマジで面白かった\n\n10/10点","timestamp_created":1434181640,"timestamp_updated":1434181640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51871258020401001","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16349065","author":{"steamid":"76561198134923871","num_games_owned":363,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1465,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1465,"last_played":1433707961},"language":"spanish","review":"final kl rompe craneos .-.\n","timestamp_created":1434178559,"timestamp_updated":1434178559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16347766","author":{"steamid":"76561198014611578","num_games_owned":265,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1045,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1045,"last_played":1395417189},"language":"english","review":"Brilliant.
