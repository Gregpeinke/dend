Good or bad?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask 'what'...\"\n\"...when the delicious question is 'when'?\"\n\"The only difference between past and present...\"\n\"...is semantics.\"\n\"Buys, bought, will buy.\"\n\"Plays, played, will play.\"\n\"If we could perceive time as it truly was...\"\n\"...what reason would grammar professors have to get out of bed?\"\n\n\nThose professors would still have to get out of bed, because Youtube comments are still a thing.  Snark aside, this is an excellent game. \n\nThe gameplay is tight, if somewhat repetitive (shoot these guys, move along, shoot some more), and moves along quickly enough that you never really have time to get bored.  The exception to this formula are the segments with Skyhooks; these provide for some of the most visually impressive and entertaining fights in the game. Bottom line is that if you liked Bioshock 1/2, you'll like this, since it's essentially those but IN SPACE--uhh, in the sky.\n\nThe story...Ah, the story.  Probably the major selling point of the game, and while it can get a bit muddled at times, it definitely does not disappoint.  There are plenty of twists and turns along the way that, when combined with some well-placed references and one heck of an ending, make for one of the more memorable games in a while.  The atmosphere is great...and a bit disconcerting at times, especially when you stop for a second and just watch and listen.  As far as characters go, Booker is likeable enough and a welcome change from the Generic Bald Marine™ we see so much of these days, while Elizabeth makes for a fantastic change to the traditional escort mission with her complete invulnerability and ability to help in combat (although she does have a habit of throwing money directly at your head).  Both are well-developed, and you should find yourself invested in seeing what happens to them in the end.\n\nAll that said, I definitely recommend this game, and since you can usually catch it on sale for a crazy-low price, there's really no reason for Infinite to not be in your library.","timestamp_created":1374954046,"timestamp_updated":1419359738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514644384384155273","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"127042","author":{"steamid":"76561197962662071","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2446,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1156,"last_played":1565016904},"language":"english","review":"if  you have play bioshock one and two this is a must :D","timestamp_created":1374947467,"timestamp_updated":1374947467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2059138","author":{"steamid":"76561198001619989","num_games_owned":263,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":667,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":667,"last_played":1365490800},"language":"english","review":"Nice tits.","timestamp_created":1374944700,"timestamp_updated":1374944700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1121671","author":{"steamid":"76561197987202538","num_games_owned":733,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":852,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":852,"last_played":1374943088},"language":"russian","review":"Прекрасная история длинною в 14+ часов.

While it was hard for me to appreciate at first, replaying it really gave me a lot of perspective for why it is held in such high regard.\n\n+ A blast to play through on Hard difficulty.\n+ Elizabeth is one of the best companions in gaming. She provides you with indirect support, such as passing you ammo and health or opening tears. The game is quite smart about when Elizabeth has some extra ammo, health, or money to give you.\n+ Tears in combat are neat and unique. You can change the environment to suit your needs. This supplements the already great level design.\n+ The shotgun is the best gun in the game (especially when upgraded), and it's very fun to use.\n+ Great graphics for the time as well as the excellent art design make this one of the best looking games of 2013, and probably the best looking game on Unreal Engine 3.\n+ Well optimised. Looks great on both the lowest and the highest settings, and in both cases, the performance is buttery smooth. Plenty of graphics options as well.\n+ Very punchy and satisfying weapon sound effects.\n+ Comes with a built-in benchmark tool.\n+ A unique and nearly unmatched combination of atmosphere, artistic direction, and setting.\n+ Good story with many elements of environmental storytelling and plenty of additional audio logs to collect.\n\n~ The story provides some choices to the player that have no consequences throughout the game, and even then, they are few and far in-between. It's better than having no choices, but it still feels half-assed.\n~ The ending is a mind screw. It feels like it's confusing just for the sake of being confusing. However, it is deep and after the end of the game, you will think about it a lot.\n~ The iron sights are toggled by MMB, instead of holding RMB like most FPS games. Fortunately, they're not necessary, most of the time.\n\n- Most of the animation in the game is pretty mediocre (worse than BioShock 2, but better than BioShock 1), except for Elizabeth.\n- The upgrade system is very expensive.\n- Many of the vigors are highly situational, and you'd probably be best sticking with two (in my case, Possession and Devil's Kiss)\n- Built-in aim assist that cannot be disabled by default. The aim assist forces your camera to center on the nearest enemy when you aim down sights. To disable it, you either need a controller (to access the controller settings in-game) or you need to tweak the game files (which didn't work for me).\n- Some PC specific issues, such as [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomP7Qf_tc4]textures loading in an infinite loop[/url]. I guess that's why they called it BioShock \"Infinite\".\n- [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muJYTeQlvC4&list=FLyujXAa6fwmYF2M6utdPccg&index=219]Several promises were made by the dev team before release didn't come to fruition[/url].\n- The \"Infinite\" in the title is misleading, the game does actually end.

I found it interesting that they still tied in water into this game even though it doesn't take place underwater.  It's a very interesting tie-in to its namesakes although it appears that this \"story line\" is over.  One could argue that it goes on indefinitely though that doesn't mean they'll do anything like it again, unless Ken Levine just wants more money.  The combat is on par with previous Bioshock games which means its good and its hard where it should be, but its not ground breaking.\n\nAs someone who has played System Shock 2, the combat and powers are good but I'm ready for something less dumbed down and I would hope that in the future, the consider something again with a more complex inventory system, something less consoley.  At this point it just has \"shock\" in the name but that's about it.  You do get cool powers but I didn't really feel a need to change them.  (Warning Pun)  Everything was more \"watered down\" (hah!)  in that you don't really need certain powers for any reason and you don't need different weapons for any reason.  I like armor piercing ammo for armored heavy targets.  Is that really too \"hard\" for people?\n\nThe ending I was able to call before I got to it, but I do admit I didn't know until toward the end.  I liked the female character but I couldn't figure out why my character was such a retarded jackass.  I fealt they forced you into decisions more so in this game than any other, probably because they wanted to set up a certain ending.  This is why I think they game is actually over, the story is done.  So on its own, it would have been really cool but it also just felt forced.  A shame because the Ken and his team (even if it evolves) does a really good job at telling a story.  The ending at least explains why you are forced in the direction you are.  Any other ending could potentially end up in the gross zone.\n\nI would say play the game and have fun with it because it is a fun game.
