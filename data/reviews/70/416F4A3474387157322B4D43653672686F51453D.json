At all.\n\nYes it was difficult (especially the final boss, where the only good thing that came out of my hour long rage was a bit of entertainment for my friend who was watching my suffering), yes the game is glitchy and yes knowing what to do next in order to advance can be difficult, especially when you accidently kill a NPC because you mistook them for an alien.\n\nBut that being said, a lot of those frustrating elements actually made the game enjoyable for me. The difficulty was challenging but I liked the fact you can save at any point and pretty much retry the difficult bits over and over. I liked the lack of hand-holding in this game since a lot of games that I've played tend to walk you through everything, and I liked the overall feel of the game and the story progression. \n\nNow, as I said before, my review on Half-Life is pretty meaningless and I have no idea what i'm even talking about since this isn't my usual genre, but I do recommend this game and I had fun playing it","timestamp_created":1528821071,"timestamp_updated":1555720446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42676733","author":{"steamid":"76561198028480834","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":2993,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1422,"last_played":1657799742},"language":"english","review":"I've been playing deathmatch for over 1200 hours on my WON version please help I haven't seen my kids im scared","timestamp_created":1528813100,"timestamp_updated":1528813100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42675934","author":{"steamid":"76561198236988646","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":372,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":328,"last_played":1571942235},"language":"english","review":"Много впечатлений от игры!","timestamp_created":1528810832,"timestamp_updated":1528810832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42671267","author":{"steamid":"76561198135280050","num_games_owned":482,"num_reviews":124,"playtime_forever":307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":307,"last_played":1527497643},"language":"russian","review":"Классика!","timestamp_created":1528794881,"timestamp_updated":1528794881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42664735","author":{"steamid":"76561198212757944","num_games_owned":204,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1237,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":864,"last_played":1635439360},"language":"turkish","review":"Nostaji anlamında hala kanser eden bir oyun oynaması zevkli düşmanları tam bir orospu çocugudur hala kanser olmayan varsa durmasın","timestamp_created":1528762117,"timestamp_updated":1528762117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42660369","author":{"steamid":"76561198267937586","num_games_owned":124,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1608,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":851,"last_played":1571276661},"language":"english","review":"This is my faviorte game of the minecraft series :tm:, I like how they made the cobblestone blocks only breakble via human skulls, overall the graphics are pretty nice liquidly.

Even if the puzzles look hard, they never seem overwhelming. I also loved how nerve-wracking the game can be. Often, I found myself peaking around corners to see if a creature was waiting for me. I also felt suspense when a creature would spawn in right next to me or behind me. Because of this, I had to stay alert every time I'd ride up in an elevator, pull a switch, or hit a button. While a lot of this game is linear, it doesn't feel that way as there's a lot of freedom in terms of roaming around in a section of a map before you figure out how to advance to the next section. In addition, I liked how the marines had a really smart AI as they're programmed to react to every move you do. This can make fighting them quite a difficult task. I also liked the little touches such as walking in a room or around a corner to see a scientist or a security guard get killed. And, of course, you can't forget about the G-Man. I've seen multiple people create theories on his character, but my issue with most of them is that they feel more like speculation and loose connections based on certain set pieces. I'm sure we can assume he isn't human, but other than that, there isn't much to work with. I prefer to just appreciate the mysterious beauty conveyed by his presence as I find the game more interesting when I do that as opposed to searching for loose theories on him.","timestamp_created":1528653068,"timestamp_updated":1560394510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42634622","author":{"steamid":"76561198114563111","num_games_owned":432,"num_reviews":206,"playtime_forever":219,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":215,"last_played":1654117219},"language":"english","review":"It's certainly true what they say ...This [i] is [/i] one helluva game. \nTruly [b] legendary!
