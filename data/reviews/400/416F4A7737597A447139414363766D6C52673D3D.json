Es de valve y me encantan los juegos de la compañía.\n2. Estaba de oferta con su secuela a 6 dolares.\n3. Lo había jugado anteriormente y me gusto bastante.\n\nSin embargo, este juego es mucho mejor de lo que parece.\nPuntos positivos:\n-Es del genero puzzle (rompecabezas) y basicamente tenemos que rompernos la cabeza para superarlo. (sin ninguna clase de guía claro) Esto se aplica a la primera vez que lo juegas. (Aviso es una muy buena experiencia si no eres muy impaciente que digamos). Por lo tanto, la jugabilidad es muy buena aunque sea en una primera impresión.\n-A parte, al finalizar la campaña podemos seguir divirtiendonos completando los logros que nos quedaban, haciendo pruebas con un nivel de dificultad más alto y haciendo desafios de tiempo, de pasos, n° de portales para destruir completamente nuestra cabeza :DD\n-Con respecto a la historia, parece bastante simple. Pero en cierto momento eclosiona creando un giro de trama bastante interesante... Aunque es algo predecible :/\n-batalla final bastante epica la verdad. Vale totalmente la pena vivirla :)\n\n\nPuntos Negativos: \nEstaría esto ultimo, la ausencia de una historia desde un primer momento (aunque esto lo va a compensar su secuela, creanme).\n\nPuntos Neutrales: \n-el soundtrack (vamos no es la gran cosa)\n-los graficos.

Using a portal gun, you can shoot blue and orange coloured portals which link to eachother. By thinking carefully about how these portals interact, you can travel vast distances with speed, transfer objects like boxes from one place to the next and much more. \n+ Most of the (limited) dialogue featured in the game is humourous in nature, providing a few laughs. \n\n[h1]Mixed:[/h1]\n\n~ The graphics are ok, Portal is fairly old as of 2015 so this isn't surprising. Not the main reason you buy a puzzle game to begin with, but it still forms part of the experience. \n\n[h1]Negatives:[/h1]\n\n- The majority of puzzles are quite easy, the first 14 of 19 are a complete breeze, with the others being somewhat difficult and a bit more lengthy. Only the advanced chambers pose any sort of cognitive challenge and can be a little frustrating, but achievable. \n- Around 10-15 hours of content, including the advanced chamber puzzles and challenges. The normal base game can be finished in around 3-4 hours, which is pretty horrendous.\n- Non-existent story. A computer program called Glados, from the Aperture Science Laboratory, puts you through a series of puzzles before attempting to kill you. For what reasons, nobody knows. Why you're in Aperture Science in the first place is not explained, there is no back-story at all. \n\nOverall Score 6.5/10\n\nPortal is not deserving of a 90/100 metacritic score and it seems to be hugely overrated by the Steam Community. It's not a bad game, but it's far from flawless. It's a very intriguing game that introduces some new concepts to the puzzle genre with the portal gun. In this way it is rather unique. With that said, it's pretty short in duration, has no plotline whatsoever and many of the puzzles are not taxing on your mind.\n\nMake sure you get this on sale, it's absolutely essential that you don't pay full price.","timestamp_created":1445181490,"timestamp_updated":1486617940,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468063235282897949","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18543284","author":{"steamid":"76561198138546153","num_games_owned":1712,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":309,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1446863204},"language":"schinese","review":"很好的游戏，就是太短了，开发者注释模式好评，结尾的歌好评","timestamp_created":1445153175,"timestamp_updated":1445153175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18539513","author":{"steamid":"76561198179013523","num_games_owned":76,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":2401,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":945,"last_played":1577206926},"language":"brazilian","review":"Me Surpreendeu!\nEu pensava que esse jogo iria ser meio \"blé\", mas eu até que curti bastante!\nApesar de não ser um fã de jogos em 3D, esse sim é um jogo bem dahora que me viciou* do nada!\n\nBem, em relação a Portal, não cabe a mim te dizer se vai gostar ou não do jogo assim como a maioria das pessoas que jogaram.

Команда студентов из колледжа DigiPen, вошедших в состав Valve благодаря игре Narbacular Drop, смогли на основе концепции двух связянных порталов создать удивительное по своей природе развлечение.\n \n Это одна из немногих игр, содержащих в себе черты серьезной головоломки и захватывающего приключения. Сюжет (пусть его и мало) создан со свойственным Valve вкусом и очень бережно вписан в игровой процесс \"одна тестовая камера за другой\". Да и техническая реализация такого заведомо непростого проекта как Portal, как всегда, на высоте.\n\n Теперь же, после прекрасной Portal 2, очевидно, что первая игра была своего рода \"полигоном\", или, если хотите, \"проверкой концепции на жизнедеятельность\". Гейб Ньюэлл и компания поступили очень разумно - сначала выпустили игру не отдельно, а в составе сборника The Orange Box, ведь никто не мог бы заранее догадаться насколько успешной будет идея с порталами.\n\n И, наконец, Portal - игра, которую можно рекомендовать абсолютно всем, - каждому, кто способен управляться с мышью и клавиатурой.","timestamp_created":1444845441,"timestamp_updated":1446847535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18470670","author":{"steamid":"76561198089162144","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1513,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":775,"last_played":1644533043},"language":"english","review":"It's Portal, it's a good game, just buy it.","timestamp_created":1444833119,"timestamp_updated":1444833119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18464498","author":{"steamid":"76561198099242984","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":675,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":430,"last_played":1645745240},"language":"english","review":"The cake is a lie.","timestamp_created":1444792424,"timestamp_updated":1444792424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18460377","author":{"steamid":"76561198202798404","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":210,"last_played":1503791869},"language":"english","review":"Portal (por-tahl) noun.
