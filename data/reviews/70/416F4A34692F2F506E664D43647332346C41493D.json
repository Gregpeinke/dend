The story for this universe is very cool and knowing what happens in half life is useful but the gameplay was infuriating. I can recognize that this game was amazing for the time, especially in terms of realism and story-building, but the actual experience of going through this game was like pulling teeth. Enemy placement is designed in such a way that you WILL take damage no matter how cautious you are, enemies will spawn behind you and they will hide behind corners lying in wait. I had to resort to saving constantly because you have to make sure you have enough health to make it to the next health station and some areas REQUIRE you to know what is about to happen or you will take damage from something.\n\nTL;DR: Story is worth knowing, actual gameplay experience is agonizing. Read about what happens then play Half Life 2.","timestamp_created":1594502499,"timestamp_updated":1594502499,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.470948010683059692","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72521008","author":{"steamid":"76561198286365829","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5331,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2585,"last_played":1657576049},"language":"turkish","review":".","timestamp_created":1594499533,"timestamp_updated":1594499533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72520091","author":{"steamid":"76561199021063197","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":926,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":500,"last_played":1617271764},"language":"german","review":"Toll","timestamp_created":1594498325,"timestamp_updated":1594498325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72519514","author":{"steamid":"76561198360311390","num_games_owned":130,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2036,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":415,"last_played":1657555868},"language":"spanish","review":"half life, un juegazo en todo su esplendor, innovo con su mecanica, jugabilidad y en la ia de los enemigos, aunque este un toque viejo y con varios bugs (que me hicieron reiniciar 2 veces toda mi partida xD) sigue siendo la mejor mierda que existe.\nyo nunca lo abia jugado, pero cuando compre el pack completo de valve me dio intriga probarlo, no tenia confianza pero me lo termine pasando entero y ahora estoy pasandomelo en modo dificil.\nsu historia sin cinematicas largas y aburridas lo complementan porque le dan una jugabilidad dinamica y entretenida y aunque tenga pocas narraciones (las de los cientificos) se da a entender.\naunque solo me jugue este titulo de la saga (planeo jugarme el resto) le doy un 10/10 si o si comprenlo, este o no en oferta, no te vas a arrepentir.","timestamp_created":1594497615,"timestamp_updated":1596423342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72518525","author":{"steamid":"76561198102401608","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":642,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":642,"last_played":1652864194},"language":"schinese","review":"神作的开始，无需多言","timestamp_created":1594496347,"timestamp_updated":1594496347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72515273","author":{"steamid":"76561198976254920","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2007,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1302,"last_played":1594946423},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games ever!!!","timestamp_created":1594492130,"timestamp_updated":1594492130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"72514829","author":{"steamid":"76561198971617424","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1928,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":707,"last_played":1609867091},"language":"ukrainian","review":"Half Life чудова гра яка колись зробила революцію в ігровій індустрії.
