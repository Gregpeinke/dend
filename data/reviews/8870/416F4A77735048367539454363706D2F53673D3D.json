When people ask if games can be art, this is one of the strongest examples I can cite. \n \nThe story and certainly the ending are perhaps the most unforgettable I've ever seen in a video game. Yes, I have played Fallout, Mass Effect, and The Walking Dead.\nElizabeth is an incredible character. Her character arc, from the start of the game to the end of Burial at Sea (seriously, get the season pass; Burial at Sea Episode 2 is the best DLC I've ever played) is fascinating to watch. She grows and changes like a real person. I have never cared about the welfare of a video game character as much as I've cared about keeping Elizabeth safe. THE best game character I've ever encountered.\nThe graphics in the first game, released eight years ago, are still impressive to this day. This game is a quarter of that age, and holy hell, it's more than frequently a jaw-dropping spectacle to behold. There were countless moments where I just wanted to stand and look at something for a few minutes. \nThe combat is a bit simple; perhaps a bit more than it should be for a game with a story this complex, but it's still plenty fun, highlighted by Clash in the Clouds. The vigors are fun and weird, with great animations. \nCan't remember encountering a single glitch, or even a framerate dip, and I was playing on console because I'm a dirty casual. \nThe weapons feel great. The Hand Cannon is exactly that. One headshot will turn a bad guy's dome into a cloud of red meat, the sniper rifle fires high-speed trains in place of bullets, and firing the shotgun is not too different from hitting your enemies with a car. \n\nSo basically what I'm saying is, this game is fantastic. One of the greatest games ever made. 10/10. The plot, character development, graphics, and ending are mind-blowingly fantastic. This was one of the key games that defined the last generation. Buy it. Seriously. Cannot recommend it highly enough.","timestamp_created":1449895944,"timestamp_updated":1449895944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19643452","author":{"steamid":"76561197976257774","num_games_owned":225,"num_reviews":90,"playtime_forever":949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":903,"last_played":1449889504},"language":"english","review":"While I preferred the setting of Rapture to Columbia, I did find myself more emotionally invested in this game than either of the first two.

无限 第一次接触生化奇兵系列，当年我对这款游戏的印象就是，漂亮，够爽，神优化！哦，还有 真特么大。\n\n在玩完无限之后不禁惊叹于编剧的脑洞，同时也促使我下载了系列的1,2两作。\n\n然而并没有玩完。。。\n\n一直到今年秋冬特卖，我一口气入手了系列全部内容，同时在2015年11月30日，开始在熊猫TV直播，直播的正是生化奇兵系列，一共用了4天打穿了全系列。\n\n该系列的特点，漂亮，够爽，脑洞大。脑洞大在乱七八糟的人际关系，在各种活灵活现的人物塑造，布克，伊丽莎白，方丁，雷恩，等等等等。每一个人物都无法简单的用善恶来评价，当游戏人物无法简单地用善恶来评价时，我觉得这些人物的塑造就称得上“丰满”了，生化奇兵系列的人物相当“丰满”！\n\n他们构建了一个神奇的世界，亚当质，异能，小萝莉与大老爹，海底或天上的城市，女儿或别人的女儿。。。\n\n每个人物与世界观相融合，他们的存在造成了世界的改变，世界的改变改变了他们，仿佛他们就是整个世界，就像是人类永恒的论题，是人类生于世界还是世界生于人类？\n\n以上是我瞎扯的。\n\n好吧，这一系列游戏都有着极强的代入感，同时各种游戏中的细节，比如路（xiao）人（guai）的对话，收集到的录音，都将玩家的思维带入到其独有的世界观中 -- 一个在海底/天空生活的有异能的上/上上个世纪的人类社会。\n\n游戏中的人与现实中的人有着相同与不同，虚虚实实之间莫名其妙的生出了一种反差与近似，这大概就是我所说的代入感，以现实中的人类代入到游戏中必然有着不同，而将不同与相同的平衡做到极致的，大概就是生化奇兵了。\n\n其实我还是在扯。\n\n不过这一系列的世界观之惊奇，人物塑造之丰满，代入感之强都是无可厚非的。\n\n而能将这三者涵盖，串联的一个词，大概就是 故事 ，一个每一位玩家都能经历的故事。\n\n飞机坠落，到达灯塔，坐进潜水球，被迫看一段中二视频，眼前林立的高楼与其间穿行的五彩鱼群、庞然巨鲸，都将投影幕帘撤走时的那一句“销魂城”刻入脑地，今生难忘。这，是故事的开始。\n\n乘一艘小舟，到一处灯塔，敲五响银铃，回漫天洪音。杀入高塔，救出少女，逃遍天地，战遍红蓝。纯情少女终成神，幡然悔悟溺己死。\n\n你以为这是故事的结束？你肯定没买海葬。。。\n\n在此友情提醒，一定要买海葬！一定要买海葬！一定要买海葬！\n\n海葬将无限与1，2代的剧情串联，把这一切有限的故事变成了无限的回味。\n\n而为什么我没怎么提2代？\n\n因为2代是对我震撼最大的！\n\n海葬起始帧帧美如画，美不过水中的倒影。\n\n1代主角与5位小萝莉度过了余生，布克被一群女儿摁水里溺死，都是美好的结局，却哪里比得上与女儿合体的二代！\n\n不需多言，生化奇兵系列是游戏玩家不容错过的神作，而如果你还在为是否错过了什么好游戏而烦恼，请进http://panda.tv/157924，我将为您排忧解难。\n\n这广告打得我自己都笑了。\n\n毫无人气的新人小主播请各位原谅。\n","timestamp_created":1449574409,"timestamp_updated":1449574409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19562941","author":{"steamid":"76561198132068269","num_games_owned":141,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2155,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1909,"last_played":1590137498},"language":"english","review":"Plays,

It follows Ex-Pinkerton Booker Dewitt on an employ to retreive a girl named Elizabeth, in the 1912 city of Columbia.\n\nIt's clear from the start that the developers of Infinite knew what they were doing. Opening with a thick atmosphere and an alarming amount of detail in the environment. The game plays on conventions in clever ways that manage to hold true to the important bits of plot structure, whilst still managing to surprise even the most observant of players.\n\nThe action is quick and precise, with a nice sense of style, but with little reaction from enemies before death it feels a little bit too cut and dry. There's a decent effort to spice it up with powers and mele, along with upgradable abilities and gear, but none of these qualities make for much of a solution. \n\nLuckily, the action still remains varied, with the ability to glide around the arena on rails, and a nice assortment of different enemies and ammo lying around. And your partner throughout the game manages to be a saving grace rather than a liability, providing you with ammo while still keeping themselves safe.\n\nThe story and presentation are cinematic, but always move at the pace of the players, allowing for in depth exploration of the games world, along with audio diaries and upgrades to find in the more reclusive parts of the levels. There's a decent amounts of twists and turns before the big reveal in the final act, and this constant change of pace may be disorienting to some, but still does a great job at mantaining the players interest throughout the playthrough, which lasts about 40 hours at most.\n\nThis is a game with character and precision, it manages to feel beleivable with even the most bizarre of plot points, and the finale manages to stick in the players head long after finishing the campaign. I couldn't recommend it enough.","timestamp_created":1449532981,"timestamp_updated":1449532981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4995688796043396","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19555060","author":{"steamid":"76561198043407602","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":301,"last_played":1451869837},"language":"spanish","review":"Es de esos juegos que dices lo comprare para jugarlo cuando termine los que estoy terminando de jugar; pero te terminas este primero y dejas los demas aparte.","timestamp_created":1449525275,"timestamp_updated":1449525275,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19554735","author":{"steamid":"76561198205920280","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1300,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":656,"last_played":1522953707},"language":"german","review":"fesselt von anfang an","timestamp_created":1449523973,"timestamp_updated":1449523973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19553958","author":{"steamid":"76561198131847231","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":463,"last_played":1501405043},"language":"russian","review":"В первые два часа эта игра мне казалась ни о чем,но как только нашел Элизабет,мне она понравилась,а как только я ее прошел,то понял что это игра просто шедевр))) 10/10","timestamp_created":1449521035,"timestamp_updated":1449521035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"19553419","author":{"steamid":"76561198078609446","num_games_owned":102,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":551,"last_played":1453329892},"language":"brazilian","review":" Sem duvida um dos melhores jogos com historia perfeita .
