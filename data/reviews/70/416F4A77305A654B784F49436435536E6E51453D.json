Now while I'm not the hugest fan of Half-Life, I cannot give you the best in-depth analysis of the characters, nor about the story, but one thing is for sure - Gordon Freeman and his trust ol' crowbar sure are a good mix!\nI won't even get to the story too much to not spoil anything, but basically you fight a ton of mutants and get yelled at by funny sounding professors.\nAnd don't worry, the game mechanics are top-notch realism at its best. For example, bunnyhopping and item boosting are only a few examples of that.\nThis game is still known and still relevant mostly because of it's notable speedrunning scene. It's why most people still get up and play this game, but to me that has never been appealing.
