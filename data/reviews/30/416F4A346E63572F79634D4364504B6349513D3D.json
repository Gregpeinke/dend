Half life, CS 1.6 and TFC look far better than this, and they are much older. Trees, Barbed wire, and various vegetation textures are glitched, and will somtimes not be transparent as they should be. effects are also, unreasonably crappy, as grenades do not show an actual explosion, unlike most older HL games (keep in mind this game runs on another engine, though), and gun fire creates and unjustifiably large, half-assed light effect.\n\nGameplay is not terrible, though certain effects form jumping, running, and going prone can be annoying. There are many diverse classes with unique weapons, and sometimes even map specific weapons and gamemodes. Most maps are conquest, while some are search and destroy. Unlike CS there is respawning, but on wave timers. Controls are ok on default, but I would recommend some custumization, as some keys, like flashlight, are stupidly placed (it's \"n\"). Some maps are poorly lit, quite a few are unnecessarily large, and most are designed so that the battles of WW2 end up more like WW1. A bloody stalemate in the middle of the map that shifts forward occaisionally, only to be stopped by someone in a bottleneck with an MG.\n\nWhile there is still a community, there are alot of empty servers, so lukily there are mods for bots. While playing can be pretty frustrating at times, it's still a fun game to play, and is far better than it's source counterpart.
