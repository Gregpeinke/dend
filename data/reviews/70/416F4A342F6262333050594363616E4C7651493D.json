Right up there with other masterpieces such as Halo: CE, Goldeneye, or Doom, Half Life innovated the genre.\n\nNow, that is what pretty much anyone will say about this game, and I'm only about halfway through. I think that this common assessment of the game has held up so far, and it is quite interesting to play one of the founding fathers of the modern FPS. With that being said, however, I definitely would call this game very dated. It has aged poorly (especially on controller) and lacks the fluidity of newer releases (or anything not made in the 90s). Comparing the overall movement, gunplay, and feel of the game, I would say a game like Halo CE blows it out of the water. Where Half Life excels from what I've seen is level design, narration, and puzzle solving aspects. \n\nI would definitely recommend this game for 99c during a sale, but so far I don't think its quite as good as it is praised for. Its awesome for a shooter from 1998, but in 2020 it can feel like a slog to play through at times.","timestamp_created":1609103644,"timestamp_updated":1609103644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83327953","author":{"steamid":"76561199091117945","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1197,"last_played":1627312669},"language":"turkish","review":"bu

HALF LIFE [/h1]\n\nNo se puede decir menos de un juego como este, no te preocupes si no lo conoces, es como tu abuelo veterano el cual ves como un ídolo, y te cuanta un montón de historias increíbles, este juego puede parecer uno mas pero cuando te enteras de cuando salió y lo sentó te darás cuenta de que puede ser uno de los juegos mas revolucionarios de todos los tiempos. Este juego hizo que no se estancara el genero y tiene un gran compañerismo junto al mítico DOOM de 1993, solo que el Half Life 1 salió en 1998 y obtuvo mas de 50 nominaciones al juego del año que en esos tiempos era algo impensable e increíble.\n\n[h1] Mecánicas y Contenido [/h1] \n\nHalf Life te puede parecer el típico shooter que copia al Call of Duty pero este juego es mucho mas, al ser lanzado en 1998 tuvo un desarrollo complicado debido a que tuvo muchos problemas de presupuesto y ambición, el juego tenia una forma muy peculiar en esos tiempos de contar su historia ( en esos tiempos la historia era algo bastante secundario ), técnicamente solo podías enterarte de la historia por pequeños detalles u conversaciones en tiempo real, esto provocaba que el jugador tuviera que ir mas lento y tomarse su tiempo para enterarse de los eventos importantes en vez de disparar a lo loco como se hacia en esos tiempos, el juego en general tiene bastante contenido y una calidad tremenda, gráficos revolucionarios para su tiempo, jugabilidad muy simple pero buena y un sistema de interacción con npcs revolucionario para esa época, básicamente sin y Half Life no existirían los npcs amigos, entre un montón de cosas que sentaron todo lo que son los shooters actuales. Lo malo de todo esto es que tuvo mucho contenido recortado debido a diferencias creativas o presupuesto. Esta lleno de armas y enemigos diferentes donde cada uno tiene una estrategia diferente, esto hace que el jugador se plantee que armas o sitios usar para ganar la pelea sin salir muy perjudicado.\n\n[h1] Gráficos y/o Aspecto Grafico [/h1]\n\nA día de hoy siendo sinceros los gráficos son muy muy mediocres, pero en un juego de 1998 fueron unos gráficos prácticamente impensables, pero no todo es color de rosas, el motor GoldSrc era muy experimental y causaba varios glitches y bugs que podían llegar a arruinar la partida, es uno de los muy pocos puntos negativos del juego pero hay que recalcarlo, a pesar de todo esto el juego sigue teniendo diseños de enemigos muy bellos e impresionantes hoy en día, además de que el videojuego esboza una creatividad fascinante y modelados aunque un poco mediocres muy bien animados en la época.\n\n[h1] Historia [/h1]\n\nAquí empieza lo mas increíble y genial del juego a mi parecer, no tocare casi nada la historia porque es muy buena pero puedo decir que la forma de contarla, conversaciones e incluso eventos en tiempo real están muy bien desarrollados y casi nunca se sienten forzados en el juego, el juego para su tiempo tenia una historia muy increíble debido a que los shooters de esa época no solían profundizar en la historia o sus personajes, pero acá da bastante importancia si quieres saber adonde ir o que hacer, esto motiva a los jugadores a tomar atención e ir con calma, además como ya menciones antes tener momentos que se te quedan grabados en tu memoria, otra cosa es la inspiración y cosas que toman de muchas obras audiovisuales o literarias de terror o ficción para crear una atmosfera prácticamente irrepetible, una de las mejores historias de videojuegos de todos los tiempos y una increíble y revolucionaria forma de contarla\n\nEn conclusión: Estamos ante uno de los mejores y mas revolucionarios juegos de la historia, el cual marco los precedentes de la cual se cree la época dorada de los fps, cada vez que vean una conversación o evento en un tiempo real recuerden que gracias a Half Life eso es así.\n\n[b]\"Gordon Freeman en carne y hueso, bueno, en carne y traje de protección.\"[/b]\n\n [b]Altamente Recomendado.[/b]\n\n Puntaje:[b]9.7/10[/b]\n\nEsta es mi opinion, si a pesar de todo lo que dije sea bueno o malo aun quieres comprar el juego, te animo a hacerlo si quieres y que lo puedas disfrutar!","timestamp_created":1609034043,"timestamp_updated":1609034952,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83253905","author":{"steamid":"76561198366304409","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1508,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1505,"last_played":1620144569},"language":"english","review":"EPIC vov game.
