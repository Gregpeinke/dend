after Half Life 1 i now finshed the base game of Half Life 2 (The DLCs Episode 1 and 2 are following).\n\nHalf Life 2 amazes by a goerge orwell-ish atmosphere like in 1984. In the beginning it feels like you walk on a thin legal line and just one step in either direction turns you into a terrorist in the eyes of the ruling combine. It doesn't take long until exactly this happens. The immersion and atmosphere of a hunted revolutionist sticks on you like sweat. The level designs are unique and offer a variety of features.\n\nGraphics are still okay, sounds are even better. Every sound effect or music track matches the scenery and atmosphere perfectly. Physics feel like the first testing ground for the portal series. They are nice but sometimes chaotic and frustrating. You can easily pick up a crate but it's nearly impossible to push it. Sometimes you have to be fast in HL2 and this kind of obstacles are unpleasent. Which leads to my greatest critic of Half Life 2: the controls. It's to much information to discribe every issue i experienced and tested. But it's not so well designed and intuitive like in Half Life. Another... question mark the game leaves for me is the somehow abrupt (but mysterious) ending.\n\nDon't get me wrong. My critics are complaints on a high level.

Нам, новым игрокам из 2020-ого, остается только завидовать и догадываться какие ощущения она вызывала полтора десятилетия назад. Недостатки также есть. Последние уровни слишком однообразны и затянуты, их можно было укоротить на треть. Не помешало бы добавить в опции возможность отключения напарников, они только раздражают и ничем не помогают (вообще вся концепция с ними не работает от слова совсем). Также, по моему мнению, минусом можно считать то, что без изучения лора за пределами игры не понятны происходящие события.\n9,5/10","timestamp_created":1588509246,"timestamp_updated":1588509246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68490976","author":{"steamid":"76561198410662247","num_games_owned":71,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":512,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":502,"last_played":1610633535},"language":"russian","review":"класс","timestamp_created":1588508495,"timestamp_updated":1588508495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68488612","author":{"steamid":"76561198082980748","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1208,"last_played":1588505233},"language":"spanish","review":"Probablemente uno de los mejores juegos de la historia.
