The graphics improvements of this port are hardly noticeable but it does drop FPS noticeably.\n- Valve, why are you making ports of previous titles instead of making Half-Life 3?\n\nIn summary, if you are a hardcore collector of valve games and need this to complete the collection, then go ahead, don't expect anything amazing though.","timestamp_created":1488400538,"timestamp_updated":1488400538,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30262317","author":{"steamid":"76561198320534668","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":356,"last_played":1500606619},"language":"brazilian","review":"A valve melhorou o que já era ótimo.

There're a lot of bugs that were absent in the original Half-Life, some of them can be funny (levitating scientists in the game's prologue), but I stopped laughing after I encountered game breaking glitches (most of them were scripts that didn't want to trigger). HL: Source also lacks official expansions, Opposing Force and Blue Shift, and the modding community for this game is practically non-existant.\n\nThe only positives of this version that I can think of are improved lighting, water effects and the skybox in Surface Tension that was replaced by the area actually made in the games engine. Some of the weapons finally use animations cut from the game but left in the files, tho I'm not sure if this was done intentionally.\n\nOverall I wouldn't recommend this game over it's vanilla counterpart. If you want to revisit Half-Life with newer graphics you better spend your money on Black Mesa.","timestamp_created":1486385027,"timestamp_updated":1553087292,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29705708","author":{"steamid":"76561198015911184","num_games_owned":315,"num_reviews":189,"playtime_forever":148,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":88,"last_played":1646635864},"language":"koreana","review":"어려워","timestamp_created":1486250800,"timestamp_updated":1568083567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29698702","author":{"steamid":"76561198119574271","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":87,"playtime_forever":481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":25,"last_played":1529756903},"language":"brazilian","review":"SIMPLESMENTE UM DOS MELHORES JOGOS JA FEITOS!!","timestamp_created":1486229626,"timestamp_updated":1486229626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29656868","author":{"steamid":"76561198281808097","num_games_owned":226,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":634,"last_played":1588185006},"language":"english","review":"[h1] POSITIVE DIFFERENCES WITH NORMAL HL [/h1]\n\n                         1) GRAPHICS\n                          2)GORDON LOOKS MORE HANDSOME \n                          3)SOURCE 1=HL2 SOURCE 2 =HL3\n                       \n                      [h1] NEGATIVE DIFFERENCES WITH NORMAL HL [/h1]\n \n                      1)YOU CAN'T MOD THE SH*T OUT OF IT\n                      2)It's very buggy actually if you want to play HL in better graphics play Black Mesa","timestamp_created":1486069737,"timestamp_updated":1589234932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501742184162139893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29641495","author":{"steamid":"76561198297637465","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":818,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":566,"last_played":1493651313},"language":"spanish","review":"un juego remasterisado por valve c:","timestamp_created":1486007882,"timestamp_updated":1486007882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29640213","author":{"steamid":"76561198090762700","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1308,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1108,"last_played":1492876889},"language":"english","review":"This game is a fun game at times but the last boss hard all and all good game 4.5/5\n","timestamp_created":1486001352,"timestamp_updated":1486001352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29627255","author":{"steamid":"76561198087677543","num_games_owned":82,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":104,"last_played":1590365071},"language":"portuguese","review":"esse jogo é mais ou menos nao compensa eu particulamente prefiro o hl1 normal","timestamp_created":1485954498,"timestamp_updated":1485954498,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46370968222618103","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29625835","author":{"steamid":"76561198056260607","num_games_owned":276,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":628,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":628,"last_played":1416629373},"language":"english","review":"This game makes me scream with how awesome it is.
