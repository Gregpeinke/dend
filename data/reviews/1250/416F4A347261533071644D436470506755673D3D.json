It is now a classic. The game feels a bit old and unpolished at places, but some levels are very fun to play. One of the best cooperative online games ever. It is playable under GNU/Linux and still has an active player base. If you like gameplay over graphics this probably will be more fun than a lot of other newer games. This is nothing like L4D2 if you are wondering. This is straightforward, brutal and requires skill on harder modes.","timestamp_created":1459529947,"timestamp_updated":1459529947,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22178197","author":{"steamid":"76561198014012675","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1181,"last_played":1466169555},"language":"russian","review":"поставиль на мониторе точу маркером во времена ксс и сейчас пригодилось\n10 хедшотов из 10\n","timestamp_created":1459517941,"timestamp_updated":1459517941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22176782","author":{"steamid":"76561198283831107","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":12316,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":878,"last_played":1650618564},"language":"thai","review":"หนุกมากกกกกกกก","timestamp_created":1459511935,"timestamp_updated":1459511935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22167644","author":{"steamid":"76561198281497117","num_games_owned":34,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3210,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":991,"last_played":1617737994},"language":"english","review":"Great game and it works perfectly on my laptop (ASUS w/ Windows 10 Free upgrade)","timestamp_created":1459458769,"timestamp_updated":1459458769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22163324","author":{"steamid":"76561198020863639","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":11518,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8723,"last_played":1638571775},"language":"russian","review":"Эта игра была просто разбита в пух и прах профессиональными критиками, но очень тепло воспринята игроками. Сейчас объясню, почему.\n\n[h1] Прокачка  [/h1]\nНе смотрите, что тут всего шесть уровней. Система прокачки очень обманчивая: сначала вы думаете, что быстренько все откроете, но не тут-то было. Ниже приведу примерные сроки прокачивания.\n1 уровень: получите за 5 минут\n2 уровень: получите за 10 минут\n3 уровень: получите за 30 минут\n4 уровень: получите за пару дней\n5 уровень: получите за пару лет\n6 уровень: скорее всего, его получат только ваши правнуки. Так что не забудьте указать свой профиль Steam в завещании.\n\n[h1] Игроки [/h1]\nПожалуй, нигде, как тут, вы не поймете, что значит командная игра. Вам может повезти, и вы наткнетесь на опытных бойцов, которые будут держаться вместе, хилить и прикрывать вас. А можете попасть к [strike]конченым дебилоидам[/strike] неопытным игрокам, которые разбегутся по карте на 7 волне и быстро умрут, оставив вас наедине с двумястами батарейками. И плевать, что это легкий уровень, такие ребята найдут способ умереть.\n\n[h1] Оружие [/h1]\nЗдесь представлен обширный ассортимент самого разнообразного оружия: от Дезерт Игла до неведомых штуковин вроде Уничтожителя монстров или Влада Пронзителя (да, это не псевдоним порноактера, а ствол). Даже есть оружие массового поражения, запрещенного ООН: ручная противотанковая термоядерная 500мм гаубица, почему-то скромно именуемой в игре ружьем. Году в 2013 было добавлено множество пользовательских пушек, за что разработчикам отдельное спасибо.\n\n[h1] Озвучка [/h1]\nПеревод и озвучка здесь просто восхитительны. Некоторые фразы вгонят вас в краску, например \"Тебе ведь нравятся большие пушки, правда?\" или \"О боже, какой у него здоровенный тесак!\", а некоторые застявят вас лежать под стулом от смеха. При каждой перезарядке вы орете на своих товарищей: \"ДА ПОДОЖДИТЕ, ПЕРЕЗАРЯЖАЮСЬ!\", \"ТЫ ЧТО, НЕ ВИДИШЬ, Я ПЕРЕЗАРЯЖАЮСЬ!\", \"МИНУТОЧКУ, ПЕРЕЗАРЯЖАЮСЬ!\". Я специально беру дробовик и перезаряжаюсь после каждого выстрела, чтобы насладиться этими криками. Около 100% фраз из Killing Floor вошли в мой повседневный словарь.\n\nKF - это когда вы \"спешите купить себе хороший ствол\", а \"упыри готовы к вырубке\".\n\nKF - это когда вы вшестером вооружились до зубов, накидали кучу взрывчатки, а Патриарх ресается за заваренной дверью. Вы веселитесь, ваш друг сообщает \"Я его в окошко вижу\", и вы уверены в своей безопасности. Но Патриарх одним махом выбивает дверь, гонит всю команду на собственную взрывчатку и уничтожает вас в рекордные сроки.\n\nKF - это когда бежите после магазина к своим товарищам, а перед самым носом у вас заваривают дверь. А сзади две батарейки.\n\nКF - это когда вы в пустом коридоре на секундочку заглянули за угол, а за спиной у вас появилось 2 мясника и сирена.\n\n10 громовых палок из 10","timestamp_created":1459443291,"timestamp_updated":1460058276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538303732872009277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22159752","author":{"steamid":"76561198133559226","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":8876,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8200,"last_played":1481384671},"language":"russian","review":"Толпы поклонников рвут на части.

Also you can literally be the Pyro, suit and all from TF2 without any DLC and that's pretty funny.","timestamp_created":1458367532,"timestamp_updated":1458367532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21914776","author":{"steamid":"76561198198620699","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":24102,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24102,"last_played":1585799973},"language":"english","review":"si","timestamp_created":1458354492,"timestamp_updated":1593367110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21909237","author":{"steamid":"76561198052670145","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":9201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":7907,"last_played":1590250785},"language":"english","review":"Very interesting game ;)","timestamp_created":1458331228,"timestamp_updated":1458331228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21900979","author":{"steamid":"76561198235884312","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":42477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":16644,"last_played":1644781749},"language":"english","review":"Love this game its super fun","timestamp_created":1458298178,"timestamp_updated":1458298178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508011341094970703","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21899657","author":{"steamid":"76561198287819933","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3057,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2495,"last_played":1458279434},"language":"english","review":"Before I played:\n＼＼ ＿\n　　 ＼( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) \n　　　 <　⌒ヽ \n　　　/ 　 へ＼ \n　　 /　　/　＼＼ \n　　 ﾚ　ノ　　 ヽ_つ \n　　/　/ \n　 /　/| \n　(　(ヽ \n　|　|、＼\n　| 丿 ＼ ⌒)\n　| |　　) /\n`ノ )　　Lﾉ\nAfter I played:\n／ﾌﾌ 　　　　　　 　ム｀ヽ \n/ ノ) 　）　ヽ \n/ ｜　　( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°）ノ⌒（ゝ._,ノ \n/　ﾉ⌒7⌒ヽーく　 ＼　／ \n丶＿ ノ ｡　　 ノ､　｡|/ \n　　 `ヽ `ー-'_人`ーﾉ \n　　　 丶 ￣ _人'彡)","timestamp_created":1458289809,"timestamp_updated":1458289809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21896701","author":{"steamid":"76561198039186510","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":10486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4700,"last_played":1610689707},"language":"english","review":"IMO a much better game than the second, one of the most fun I have had in a game ever.

As for a survival game it's pretty floorless to be perfectly honest: the weapons have good balance, quite some cool looking designs and a decent variety Except some classes could do with a bigger more varied selection like Firebug which has a flamethrower, flare akimbo pistols, and a fireball launcher which come off the top of my head. But then you have Commando class where they have a huge selection of sub-machine guns as well as assault rifles like: the Scar rifle and MP40 to just name a couple.\n \nOther classes such as Demolition, Beserker. Sharpshooter, Medic and Support Specialist all have their own unique things about them such as: Medic having the ability to heal team-mates with their weapons as well as being more durable to damage when leveled up and used properly. Then you have Demolition which can deal big damage with weapons such as the M32 grenade launcher, Rocket launcher and some other sweet stuff. Bezerker I have used a little BUT that doesn't mean it's not a great class, it just takes time to get better at it with melee weapons such as a longsword which is very nice to other stuff more brutal such as a chainsaw then you even have a axe if that swings your way. Sharpshooter is my most used class in this game and the reason for this is becuase it is great to use for me, from things like the big muma which is a heavy sniper that deals some serious damage to other weapons such as the lever action rifle then you have akimbo pistols which are pretty good to say the least. You have stuff from the old western pistols to solid handcannons which are beast then the Desert Eagle which is pretty damm good to have as a spare. Last but never forgotton is the Big class what's that you ask? Why I am talking about the Support Specialist class which is DAMM FINE, you have everything from a simple pump action to a tac 12, then to the combat shotgun which is a semi-automatic monster. Last but not least is the AA-12 This IS OBLITERATION at it's finest now don't get me wrong this weapon is damm expensive if your low level but after leveling up which can take some serious time but is worth it as all classes are it will destroy a Flesh Pound in a near instant even on hard difficulty.\n\nMap variety is pretty good as you have custom map servers as well as a big selection of normal maps, with one's ranging from London, to a underground train station then a hospital and then to sewers so that's great. \nParticular classes can be difficult to level up depending on your skill level such as Beserker (getting completely swarmed as you had a cocky team-mate who thought he was invincible) and Demolition. (skill needed such as not blowing your self sky high as it happens a lot)\n\nA last thing to mention is the difficulties this game has which is something that always varies depending on what game your playing, now let me start out by saying if your a newbie and you play Beginner difficulty then there is something seriously wrong with you as it is soooo boring, I mean the only thing I can think of is why it was there in the first place was for people to scew around in other then that I would never ever recommend starting on that difficulty. If you want to scew around with your friends not wanting to even bother taking shit serious for a second then by all means play it  but mark my words you will get complacent which means you will get so used to playing it when you go to normal you will get shredded and be like WTF happend, what happend was you made the biggest mistake in this game: Never, Ever, Get, Lazy because you will regret it. Now if your playing/starting out on normal then work out a plan don't ever say ahh fuck it I'll just YOLO it man, because even on normal not only will you get your team killed you will be a disgrace to your friends or something like that. Suicidal and Hell on earth only do when your max level as otherwise you'll have no chance as they will be the end of you literally they are very challenging difficulties so don't be a idiot and automatically go to that until you have truely practised enough first.","timestamp_created":1458029277,"timestamp_updated":1458029351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504587173461914063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21846566","author":{"steamid":"76561198019642494","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":34568,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33716,"last_played":1644570179},"language":"english","review":"Wads a cash, grabbit while you can.
