Now let's go to the good side of this game.\n\n[h1]Let's start with the story.[/h1]\n\nThe story is very simple and yet interesting. 4 random people meet up together and try to survive hordes of zombies by going from point A to point B. Yes, that's it...that's the whole story. Each character is well written and interesting in their own perspective and as they progress to safety they interact with eachother. \n\nNow that we got story and character out of the way let's start talking about game modes that this game has to offer.\n\n[h1]Campaign mode[/h1]\n\nThis mode is just like single player but with people who can join you during your game progress and help you survive or shoot you in the back. I recommend this one as your first mode because this is where you will get used to game mechanics and how they work. You will get introduced to special infected and how they work aswell. There are 6 official campaigns created by valve.\n\n[h1]Versus mode[/h1]\n\n\nThis is a competitive mode between survivors and special infected. Survivor players try to make it to the saferoom and gain as much points as possible while special infected players try to stop them because points determine which team wins at the end of campaign. This is without a doubt the most toxic mode in gaming history. 9 out of 10 games you will meet all in one:toxic people, tryharders, ragers, rage quitters, griefers, kickers, split screeners if you play on console, friendly people. I recommend playing this with atleast one friend so you don't get kicked for reasons like:\nleaving the saferoom too early\nstaying away from your team more than 10 meters\nsaying \"hi\" and they don't like your voice\nfailing to save your teammate\nfailing to kill one of the special infected\nfailing in general\nnot being helpful enough into killing survivors\nnot enough damage playing as the tank\ni could go on and on but i guess you get the point...\n\n[h1]Survival mode[/h1]\n\nThis one is simple and fun. You arm yourselves, start an infinite horde and try to survive as long as possible.\n\n\nThis game has tons of action,gore,rage and overall fun. You just have to accept this game as \"fun\" not as \"winning\". It can run on low spec PCs pretty well and it's a perfect price. Best 8 bucks that you will ever spend in your life. Anyways i think i'm done writting this review. I might update it in the future.\n\nGoodluck...\n\n...have fun.\n\nP.S. sorry for grammar mistakes.","timestamp_created":1419955476,"timestamp_updated":1566840313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13707446","author":{"steamid":"76561198154877574","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1617,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":991,"last_played":1578432955},"language":"brazilian","review":"recomendo, muito bom :)","timestamp_created":1419922649,"timestamp_updated":1419922649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13703135","author":{"steamid":"76561198086668410","num_games_owned":882,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3215,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2908,"last_played":1626522845},"language":"schinese","review":"求生之路是一个与侠盗猎车手同类的角色扮演类游戏。描写的是，金融危机全面爆发的2个星期后，4个无恶不作的歹徒的犯罪经历。Left 4 dead的意思就是让他们4个去死吧。\n\n金融危机，造成部分人仇富心理极度膨胀。其中，一个退伍的孤僻老头，在华尔街下岗的一黑一白两个经纪人，一个因身材太差、在红灯会无生意的妓女，4人集中一起仇视社会，心理变态的恶果就是觉得街上所有人都面目可憎，于是，持械在街上，见人就杀，制造了一幕幕惨剧。\n\n一对无助的恋人，为躲避他们的追杀，逃到教堂内，敲响警钟求助。4名歹徒依然不舍不弃，将闻讯赶来的无辜群众全部杀掉，再进屋杀死少女的男朋友，车仑女干少女致死。（教堂钟声局可进屋看见少女张开大腿而亡）\n\n警方毕竟是文明的，没有用枪。特别是敦厚的胖子警官包墨儿，冒险口头劝告歹徒。但凶残的歹徒，竟只因胖子警官的口水沾到他们的衣服，把胖子警官打得死无全尸。\n\n敦厚的胖子警官平时在社区深得群众喜爱。他的死，让人民群众奋起反抗。富有正义感的当地居民，在柔道高手亨特、擒拿高手斯冒克的带领下，向歹徒发起反抗。警察局也派出身穿防弹服特警坦克也参加了围捕。\n\n凶残的歹徒，面对一波波的人民群众的反抗，选择劫持交通工具偷渡到邻国。\n\n在这游戏里，既可扮演凶残的歹徒杀人，也可扮演正义的警官进行阻止。\n\n从这个游戏看到，很多玩家喜欢扮演正义的警察，特别是争相扮演特警坦克，享受一拳把一个歹徒打到趴下的快感。可见，正义，永存人民心中！","timestamp_created":1419904665,"timestamp_updated":1419904665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":248,"votes_funny":817,"weighted_vote_score":"0.739024758338928223","comment_count":48,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13702890","author":{"steamid":"76561198067210601","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":95,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":27,"last_played":1459560833},"language":"english","review":"Zombies!

It's old, simple and smooth.\n\nI have a powerful computer so this works perfectly for me. It seems to run with NO lag other than the Online lag obviously. It's a nice game to play with the basic mode of running and shooting through hordes of zombies to get to one safe house, to the other. This game is totally worth the money. Includes survivors that have their different choices of weapons, for example;\n\nZoey - Sniper Rifle (Hunting Rifle)\nFrancis - Shotgun\nBill - Assault Rifle (M16)\nLouis - Assault Rifle (M16)\n\nThis is also the same as each character's personality.\n\nZoey - Some negativity with a slight classic teenage girl personality\nFrancis - Hates everything except his shotgun and vest. Or bikes.\nBill - Tries to control the 'team' and complains when he reaches stairs (he's an old man)\nLouis - Loves Pills, tries to stay posotive and doesn't stop reminding Bill about 'good cardio' every time he complains about stairs.\n\nOnce you buy this game, you are bound to have a favourite character and gun.

Coming from a guy who spent a lot of time playing Left 4 Dead 2, I can personally say this game is actually really awesome. Some people simply don't play this game, because everything that's in this game is in Left 4 Dead 2. Which is true to a degree, however there are some differences. First of all, there are only Left 4 Dead campaigns (which is obviously expected). Second of all, There are no melee weapons either. Third of all, the community is almost dead.\n\nOk so why the hell would I recommend this game? Well, it feels like a better game. Let me explain. Valve wanted to create an amazing 4 player co-op zombie survival game and they did! It was pretty damn scary, it had great characters, the tone of the game was really dark, and it was a ton of fun! On top of that you could actually see your own legs! Left 4 Dead 2 just feels like an upgrade of the game by adding new campaigns, characters, and melee weapons. Left 4 Dead never got the attention it deserved (in my opinion) because Valve decided to release L4D2 way earlier than it was supposed to be released.\n\nhat I'm trying to say is, Left 4 Dead feels more like a classic Valve game and feels like a simple game compared to Left 4 Dead 2. Left 4 Dead 2 is a great game, but Left 4 Dead is simply a classic.\n\nTL;DR\nLeft 4 Dead is a great FPS game created by Valve that's taken place in the Zombie apocalypse. It's an amazing 4 player co-op game that anyone can enjoy! If you're still not satisfied of what this game has to offer, go buy L4D2.\n\nOverall rating 9/10","timestamp_created":1419839596,"timestamp_updated":1424129522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511686801910400391","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13666040","author":{"steamid":"76561198169362590","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3977,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":331,"last_played":1537055970},"language":"english","review":"So much replay value.","timestamp_created":1419782767,"timestamp_updated":1419782767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13663903","author":{"steamid":"76561198138941730","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1433,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1630273092},"language":"russian","review":"классная игра в которой можно весело провести время","timestamp_created":1419775770,"timestamp_updated":1419775770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13661765","author":{"steamid":"76561198027155926","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":4263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3183,"last_played":1652521179},"language":"english","review":"Brilliant game in either single or multiple player mode - whilst graphics and gameplay is superior in lf2, the atmosphere in lfd1 is so much better imo... gotta love the creepy witch music","timestamp_created":1419768174,"timestamp_updated":1419768174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13659379","author":{"steamid":"76561198018421747","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":157,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":151,"last_played":1430671461},"language":"german","review":"Have Fun with the Dead\n\nLeft4Dead ist zwar schon älter, macht aber immer noch einen riesen Spaß zu zocken.

Two weeks after the infection four immune survivors : Bill, a Vietnam veteran, Zoey, a college student; Louis, an IT analyst and Francis, an outlaw biker make their way through the city fighting infected, dangerous mutations. There are 2 types of infected, special infected like hunters, boomers, smokers and tanks and other type is common infected that aren't playable. There is one more special infected called 'witch', you can't choose her in Versus Mode. There are originally 20 maps and 10 weapons. Not all L4D1 achievements and maps are ported to L4D2. And not all of us play L4D2 as much as L4D1. So I recommend buying L4D Bundle, it better for you to decide which one is your type.\n\nSo there are 4 ways of playing this game : \n\n● Single/Offline Mode : You and three AI bots play through campaigns battling against hordes of common infected & 5 special infected through many chapters divided into smaller maps. \n\n● Multi/Co-op Mode : You and your 3 friends/online players play through campaigns battling against hordes of common infected & 5 special infected through many chapters divided into smaller maps. For the newbies, don't directly jump to expert servers as people there wouldn't care much to teach you what's right/wrong and will simply vote kick you. I'll cover this part at the end.\n\n● Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, either playing as a human trying to get rescued or as 4 playable special infected.\n\n● Survival Mode : You survive in a closed area and hold out against the infected horde and special infected as long as possible and compare your stats with your friends. There are 3 medals : Gold, Silver and Bronze based on your survival time. \n\nThis game requires you to work with your teammates and help them and get help in return. When you get pounced on by a hunter or get dragged by smoker or generally incapped by an infected, only your friends can revive you so make sure you treat them nicely. \n\nOnly thing I see people complaining here is that they get vote kicked for not doing anything. Here is a list of things you should consider and follow to not get kicked by others. \n\n● If you see an incapped survivor, based on situation if its possible and easy to revive them then help them, don't simply leave them there. I know its called Left 4 Dead :D \n\n● Make sure you don't hurt your teammates. In case you hurt them, heal them with your kits or give them your pills [Pills Here!] Least you can do is apologize before they call a vote. \n \n ●[i] Don't start the events. Events are those situations where you press a button or open the door and hordes rushes at you. Just wait for all players to arrive at that spot and make sure all are ready. If you really want to press those buttons then ask if they are ready and then start it.[/i]\n\n● In the Versus Mode, it is important to work as a team. Since it is 4v4 (or same level), all the players have to incap all the survivors at the same time. One survivor is enough to ruin others attempt. you will likely get kicked if you stay apart or just roam around as an infected.   \n\n● Don't change your team in Versus Mode, not just kicked, admin might ban you too. (Personal Experience :P) \n\nEven after following all the rules and you might still get kicked. Don't get disappointed if someone kicks you, even players with 1k hours still get kicked. Sometimes, people just kick you to help their friend get a slot or if you have very high ping.  \n\nIf you like my review, please upvote it so more people can read it.

Минимум оружия (и этого вполне достаточно для выживания) в отличие от второй Лефты, где много ненужного барахла (как по мне).\n2. Хорошие персонажи, которые мне понравились куда больше, чем персонажи второй части (я и во второй чаще всего играю в кампании из первой части, либо в сторонние кампании с Выжившими из первой части). Причём у каждого из персонажей своя история и свои взгляды на жизнь (чтоб это всё узнать, почитайте комикс \"Жертва\" от Valve (он официальный и переведен на русский язык, его можно найти в интернете) ).\n3. Никакой халтуры в плане Зараженных - боссов (ибо во второй части боссы атакуют примерно одинаково, как их предшественники из первой части, только сами атаки немного изменены - Плевальщица плюёт кислотой, Громила - с разгона раздает леща (мини - Танк), Жокей - прыгает как и хант, но не убивает жертву, а заставляет ее упасть и т.д.).\n4. Атмосферность, которую вторая часть утратила, ибо в первой чувствуется что действительно настал апокалипсис, а во второй - скорее настало время тира (дневное время суток, тонны зомби и т.д., несерьёзность персов и т.д.).\n5. Графон, который в первой части на максималках мне понравился больше чем во второй.\n6. Мультиплеер, в котором мало тупых школьников (ибо они ушли во вторую как в популярную часть). А те школьники, что остались, вполне обучаемые (если новички) и не выступают (по крайней мере в первой я таких еще не видел).\n7. Боты, с которыми играть одно удовольствие (у многих они тупые, а у меня умные были еще до того как поставил фикс, а с фиксом они еще больше поумнели). Во второй же части без фикса это не боты, а просто звиздец (если цензурно описать).\n8. Хорошая реиграбельность, прохождение каждой карты каждый раз разное, а всё благодаря Режиссёру.\n9. Разнообразные диалоги, которые не повторяются из раза в раз, временами, если повезет, можно услышать даже очень редкие фразы/диалоги (я например за все свои 800+ часов только один раз слышал фразу от Френсиса, которую тот сказал после того, как игрок за Билла в меня пальнул случайно - \"Отличный выстрел, Билл, это была моя задница!\").\n10. Звуковое сопровождение, которое не надоедает, как в других играх, а наоборот помогает вам, ибо элементарно по звуковому сопровождению можно вычислить какой босс заспавнился еще до того, как этого босса услышишь/увидишь (ибо у каждого босса свой уникальный эмбиент, который нельзя спутать), а еще помогает определить на какого из игроков нападать будут во время волны и т.д., вроде как у того, кто должен огрести леща, должна играть более динамичная музыка, а у тех, кто под раздачу не попадает - более спокойная).\n11. 6 (вроде бы) хороших кампаний (это если не брать в счёт сторонние кампании).\n12. Хорошие рейтинги и достижения в Стиме для этой игры.\n\nМинусы:\n1. Малая посещаемость по сравнению со второй Лефтой, из - за чего как правило в мультиплеере меньше десятка лобби люди создают в кампании, несколько (2 - 3) - в Сражении, а в Выживание вообще редко кто заходит. \n2. Во второй Лефте сложность увеличена не только из - за количества мяса, которое на вас пускают, но и из - за того, сколько это мясо урона наносит и т.д., словом на том же Мастере во второй Лефте играть куда сложней, чем на Мастере в первом. К тому же по факту реально интересно становится играть только на Эксперте, ибо только там Режиссёр вас не жалеет и даже если вы все с чёрно - белым экраном и мало хп у вас осталось, он скорее на вас толпу зомби нашлёт, приправленную несколькими боссами для гарантии. В лучшем случае даст таблетки, на аптеки даже не рассчитывайте, они есть только в убегах и в некоторых местах, где они обязательно есть (и то эти места вроде только в Похоронке (Похоронный Звон) на одной карте). Во второй же хардкора уже побольше и это чувствуется, едва начнёшь играть.\n3. Ну и пожалуй немного жаль что мало режимов (только сингл, кооп, сражение и выживание). А так с минусами вроде всё.\nОднозначно рекомендую игру, как по мне так она заслуживает оценки 9,5 из 10 (не 10, потому что есть недочёты, но они мелкие).\n\nP.S. Игра не затягивает, ага ([сарказм]).","timestamp_created":1418981579,"timestamp_updated":1453128153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13437201","author":{"steamid":"76561198085618210","num_games_owned":305,"num_reviews":167,"playtime_forever":60135,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1478,"last_played":1488045600},"language":"english","review":"IT'S FUCKING AMAZING!","timestamp_created":1418940977,"timestamp_updated":1418940977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13422998","author":{"steamid":"76561198056624333","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":526,"last_played":1434811728},"language":"spanish","review":"s'encillamente genial y con una jugabilidad muy comoda, la unica pega que le pondria es que los zombis llegan agobiar cuando vienen en massa XD","timestamp_created":1418858715,"timestamp_updated":1418858715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13422836","author":{"steamid":"76561198000636967","num_games_owned":170,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":168310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":73,"playtime_at_review":146214,"last_played":1659733302},"language":"english","review":"[b]My personal favorite game of all time.[/b] \n\nIt's absolutely fun when you play it with friends. Even if you don't have friends to play with, it's very easy to make a friend on Left 4 Dead by just being nice/using teamwork. That's all. \n\nTeamwork is key. Even when you join a random game on your own, people will still use teamwork. Just don't rush; you WILL die. A Smoker will lick your *ss. \n[b]You have to co-operate with your team![/b] That's what I like so much about this game.\nThe AI Director will try to punish you for going solo by having the (special) infected target you.\n\nLeft 4 Dead is a very dynamic game as well. It hardly gets repetitive because of the AI Director spawning guns, items, ammo and (special) infected on different places, depending on the situation. \n\nThe characters are perfect and the way they interact with eachother is a really fun and nice touch. I like them all, but my favorite is Louis. I mean, look at him. He's a handsome, badass, optimistic black man.\n\nThe game only has a few guns (6, with pistol included), but the gunplay feels silky smooth. \nEspecially because of the satisfying gore L4D has. Spraying with an autoshotgun through a horde of infected is nice.\n\nI don't know about you, but animations are a very important part in a game for me.\nThird person animations in L4D1 are smooth unlike in L4D2 whereas it is choppy. You may think that this is just a miniscule thing but you will definitely notice this if you've played both L4D1 & 2 for a while.\n\nI personally think that the Jockey in L4D2 is the most b*llsh*t infected. He has the dodgiest hitbox ever. The hitbox is WAY infront of him than his actual model. \nL4D1 doesn't have the Jockey so that's another reason of buying 1 over 2. (lol)\n\nPeople tend to think that there are no differences between Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2.\nA lot of them also say that L4D1 is not worth buying anymore only because L4D2 has L4D1's campaigns. And yes, this is true, but Valve has changed the layout of the original campaigns in L4D2. Certain buildings are gone/changed, certain pathways are gone/changed, certain holdout spots are gone/changed, etc. Also, L4D1 has this gritty and dark atmosphere and really embraces the feeling of being set in a apocalypse with the help of dark maps, whereas L4D2's atmosphere is brighter and less serious. Valve went with a more comedic style in L4D2. This is mostly noticeable if you listen to the quotes that the characters say in-game.\n\n[b]All in all, Left 4 Dead is an amazing co-op first person shooter that's fun, easy to get into, and takes a while to master. I've been playing this game since 2009 and I'm still playing almost daily. L4D2 is good, don't get me wrong. I just think that L4D2 is inferior to L4D1 and that people should give L4D1 a chance. Even though L4D1 has the same price tag as L4D2, it's so much worth it. Definitely recommended to play with friends.[/b]\n\n[b]Left 4 Dead - 10/10[/b]\n[b]Left 4 Dead 2 - 8/10 (Mods are fun though)[/b]\n\n[i]- dub[/i]","timestamp_created":1418857781,"timestamp_updated":1564068220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.674217879772186279","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13413824","author":{"steamid":"76561197971651421","num_games_owned":79,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":35974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33827,"last_played":1639438749},"language":"english","review":"From the day it came out, I love this game.
