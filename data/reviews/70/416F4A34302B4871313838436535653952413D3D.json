Even if I had a bit high expectations because of everybody praising the game, it didn't dissapointed me.\nHalf-Lifes setting is one of the main reasons this shooter stands out so much. It faces up with the threat of an alien invasion, and got many sci-fi and physic elements in it. The graphics ain't to bad, considering how old the game is, also the whole gameplay including the controls. It even got a multiplayer with -more or less- active servers.. The story is okay i'ld say, but the atmossphere is amazing! Crawling through the ventilating shafts, beeing alone in a abandoned laboratory filled with monsters gives you a cool mix of fear to wander around but simultaneously a brave exploring feeling!\n\nAlso other modern games are inspired by the half life series, for example Crysis. :)\n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1444413590,"timestamp_updated":1452100093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469798654317855835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18391082","author":{"steamid":"76561198042380227","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":565,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1586070484},"language":"english","review":"GMAN IS HOLDING HALF LIFE 3 CAPTIVE\nAlso facking amazing game.","timestamp_created":1444364343,"timestamp_updated":1444364343,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18387948","author":{"steamid":"76561198061490119","num_games_owned":409,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":996,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":996,"last_played":1441905485},"language":"english","review":"Pros: Super impressive for its time, good storyline\nCons: Not impressive for today's time, doesn't really connect at all with Half Life 2, not everything has an explanation","timestamp_created":1444340763,"timestamp_updated":1444340763,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.273229926824569702","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18384437","author":{"steamid":"76561198133067535","num_games_owned":397,"num_reviews":134,"playtime_forever":980,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":969,"last_played":1444332987},"language":"english","review":"run, jump, shoot , think, though enemy, mighty crowbar, and FREEMAN..! no FPS  game could do such thing right now","timestamp_created":1444322421,"timestamp_updated":1444335733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18368304","author":{"steamid":"76561198156039782","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":9769,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3791,"last_played":1577643297},"language":"english","review":"A 5/5 star classic, Half Life, a FPS FULL of action and suspense all about surviving an alien apocolapse and putting an end to it by going into space and confronting the boss responsible, if you haven't played HL1 yet this one is UNMISSABLE, go ahead and get a copy if you've never played it \"They're waiting for you Gordon, in the test chamber.\"\n\nOnto more detail, was released in 1998 shortly before the PS2 era, from the talking suit you wear that protects you and warns you of danger, killing aliens, escorting fellow scientists and working together with security guards, you'd think your chances of survival are good?

It is an understatement to call it great, it changed the first person shooter genre as it was in the 90s. The engine was built on Quake, a game that was, at the time, technologically advanced. VALVe built on the Quake engine, improving it so that it could handle different, more advanced, capabilities. The character design is on the attention of detail Team Fortress 2 has. They always talk about how easily distinguishable silhouettes help the players discern what threats they should worry about, this game has that too, a lot, in fact, with each entity having its own unique silhouette that usually isn't shared with other entities. The level design is well paced, there are quick paced action sequences, like in the chapter \"Surface Tension\", but also more methodical, slowly paced parts. You can always come back to this game with a fresh experience, it just feels good to shoot enemies, I mean no crap it's a FPS, if it didn't have that feeling, then why play it. \n\nBut whatever you do, don't play multiplayer unless you're prepared to have your ass kicked.\n\nTL;DR, Half-Life has many ground-breaking features for its time, and is still fun today.

Playing the role of Gordon Freeman, you must fight your way through numerous creatures from a planet named Xen, such as the Headcrab, Alien Controller, Alien Grunt, and many more! The atmosphere changes a-lot from time to time, bone-chilling, heart-wrenching, or just plain intense!You've got two enemies hopping onto your back in this game, The HECU & Xen, think about that. Getting shot at while having a Headcrab trying to jump on your head! There is also one giant mystery to this whole series, and that is - The G-Man, nothing is really known about this character, not even till this day! Countless theories have been made upon trying to crack the code as to why he's even there.\n\nGameplay:\nFor 1998, the gameplay is steady! Keep in mind that there are other games with steady game-play that came out in 1998, but this is Half-Life we're talking about! A wide variety of arsenal, Smg, Shotgun, Pistol, RPG, who CAN'T love that? I do admit, some of the physics are a bit off, such as sliding a box or jumping onto a box that has physics, it could throw you off! This game features moments where you could be caught or not, such as a helicopter flying over you while you're in a sewer tunnel, you could shoot & trigger enemies early or sneak past - It's the players choice and how they want to see the story as.\n\nVoice Acting:\nLet's be honest, most games around this time didn't have amazing voice acting, but I would give the Voice Acting in Half-Life 1 a pass. All the scientists sound the same, along with the security guards. But I could see why they'd re-use the same voice actor, budget-wise, etc. No further analysis needed for this section!\n\nSoundtrack:\nOh boy, the soundtrack is very intense! Every track played during sequences definitely fit the tone of that particular scenery/scene! One of my favorites is \"Drums and Riffs\". The soundtrack is a mix between Ambient & Dark Industrial!\n\nConclusion:\nAll in all, this was my one of my first FPS's I've ever played, and I've played it on the PC & PS2! I love both versions equally, thank you so much VALVe for providing us with such an amazing series!\n\n10/10 ♥","timestamp_created":1443899830,"timestamp_updated":1443899830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18308901","author":{"steamid":"76561198054240911","num_games_owned":120,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3956,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2035,"last_played":1648417663},"language":"turkish","review":"olm herkes oynadı lan çocukluğunda...","timestamp_created":1443884920,"timestamp_updated":1443884920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18307380","author":{"steamid":"76561198069044769","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":817,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":673,"last_played":1572905426},"language":"english","review":"It is Half-Life.

However, I'm reviewing this for the people like me who never played this game when they were younger. So I want to answer the question. Is this game still worth a buy and a play in 2015? \n\nSo, a problem I seemed to have from the outset is that this game just assumes you know things, or you know the games concepts and mechanics already. There is never a tutorial of any type and in fact I got stuck for a solid 10 minutes at the very start of the game because I simply didn't know you could press \"e\" on people to make them follow you. Like, really? The game never told me I could do that. That is just one example of the game just assuming you know how to play.\n\nSecondly, if you really look at this game. In essence, it is a very repetitive shooter. You pretty much do the same thing throughout the whole game from the first hour to the tenth hour. It didn't make me bored, but I can imagine it might make some people very bored.\n\nLet me just add, THIS GAME IS HARD. Like, really really hard. I played on normal, and, oh my god. Just expect to die a lot. Over and over again to the same section, and throughout many sections in the entire game. It was at some points frustratingly difficult as I would find myself saving progress every 30 seconds at some points just because this try I did a little better and didn't lose too much health.\n\nHOWEVER, that is the gem in this game. Because it was so difficult. It made me so happy to finally get past sections and eventually complete the game. I actually felt a sense of achievement beating this. Like a \"I beat half life!!!\" That is what gaming should be all about and it's a shame most AAA games lack that these days.\n\nSo, although this game has aged a lot, and elements are very outdated and in some circumstances, quite frankly, pretty awful. That doesn't take away from this game. This is a good game. I believe this game was enjoyable enough to still be worth a buy and play even in 2015.","timestamp_created":1443728924,"timestamp_updated":1443728924,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565058290958404541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18277655","author":{"steamid":"76561198104501407","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":155,"last_played":1486739126},"language":"spanish","review":"O lo jugás, o lo jugás, es el juego que empezó toda la saga de Counter Strike, Half Life 2, y muchas más.","timestamp_created":1443716373,"timestamp_updated":1443716373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18270809","author":{"steamid":"76561198121382803","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":668,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":406,"last_played":1485300798},"language":"english","review":"It's a great game.

But that doesn´t make the game bad. As I said, it´s still a lot of fun, packed with puzzles, boss fights, some platforming, and of course: A lot of shooting Aliens in the face. This combat feels a little outdated, especially because things like headshots don´t exist (at least it didn´t work for me), but it also comes with a lot of room for players, who´d like to take a more tactical approach, with things like mines or a crossbow to take out enemies more stealthly. Storywise there isn´t much to go by, it basically just explains the plot, so if you want to play the second game, you don´t really need to play this one to understand everything if you just read a summary or sth like that. But I would say you should play it to get the full experience. There even are a couple of scares and things like dark vents or the ominous G-Man doesn´t make things any easier for you. All in all it´s a great game if don´t really need good graphics, which don´t really matter at all people out there(!!!), it was amazing all the way through and I can´t wait to finish HL2 after playing it.\nIt is and will always be one of the greatest experiences out there!","timestamp_created":1443271990,"timestamp_updated":1443271990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18199037","author":{"steamid":"76561198207365405","num_games_owned":25,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":250,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":185,"last_played":1449922841},"language":"english","review":"it has \ngood voice acting \na compelling story \nit feels like you're actually the protaganist \nand a amazing soundtrack \n\nso go ahed buy this game  and be pulled into a world that revolutionised shooters forever","timestamp_created":1443258842,"timestamp_updated":1443258842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518828451633453369","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18191675","author":{"steamid":"76561198051902204","num_games_owned":60,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":99,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75,"last_played":1595296449},"language":"english","review":"This game is where it all started for me still a great game","timestamp_created":1443215330,"timestamp_updated":1443215330,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18175371","author":{"steamid":"76561198123751359","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1458777831},"language":"italian","review":"Un classico che non invecchia mai :-)","timestamp_created":1443118968,"timestamp_updated":1443118968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18172631","author":{"steamid":"76561198125270928","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1739,"last_played":1436003246},"language":"english","review":"HEY DICKHEAD GO BUY THIS GAME ITS AMAZING FROM THE MOMENT YOU START PLAYING IT.

These areas in the Black Mesa facility and the deserts that surround it are not asthetically pleasing by any means and we'll leave you very uninterested by your surroundings. Despite these complaints, the positive truly does outweigh the negative with this game. Experiencing this game is important for any FPS efficianado and does a remarkable job of providing challenge as well as immersing the player with the story so you'll be compelled to play until the end. If you can excuse the PS2-esque graphics and enjoy good gameplay, then it's defintely a buy. If you'd rather experience this game with up to date graphics and graphics more pleasing to the eye, I'd reccomend buying the fan made remake of this game, Black Mesa.

At first, I didn't think the game has aged well, but when I played it multiple times, I began to realize why this game was so groundbreaking. First-person shooters before Half-Life were mostly action first and story last. Games like Doom and Duke Nukem 3D gave you power-ups, no reloading and very little details regarding the story. Half-Life changed that, gone were things like secrets and power-ups. \n\nYou were presented with a realistic shooting game with realistic puzzles. The fact you have to reload makes you plan ahead as you don't want to be caught reloading in the middle of a gun fight. This game still manages to provide an interesting and detailed story with very few cutscenes. There are a couple cutscenes, but for the most part you see the entire game from Gordon Freeman's eyes and never see the game from another person's perspective, you don't even get to see what Gordon looks like in this game aside from looking at the games cover art. \n\nThis game also introduced characters who you can not only interact with, but will help you on your journey. You can ask a security guard to help you kill enemies or ask a scientist to help unlock a door, games before Half-Life simply didn't have such intelligent AI. It's sad that young gamers today will look at this and think the game aged badly. I didn't play Half-Life when it came out sadly. It took a little time, but it finally grew on me and it's one of my favorite first-person shooter games of all time. It's not only a landmark, but a masterpiece that changed the world of first-person shooter games forever.","timestamp_created":1441988440,"timestamp_updated":1529215815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"17981907","author":{"steamid":"76561198025253636","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1506,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1506,"last_played":1397293661},"language":"spanish","review":"Primer juego de la saga half life, ya escribi sobre su sucesor (half life 2 y sus episodios) este juego pesae a que tiene mas años que dios es buenísimo, obviamente tendremos a un protagonista en el cual tendra que atravesar sala por sala un intenso mapeado de carga con enemigos toca-pelotas, enemigos indestructibles y otras cosas como puzles, recojer objetos/ cantidad de armas inimaginables cada una de un tipo.
