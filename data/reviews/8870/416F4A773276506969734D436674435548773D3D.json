Spillet foregår i året 1912, i en fiktiv by, der svæver rundt flere kilometer op i luften. Byen er styret af en form for teokrati, med en \"Father\", der betragtes som den store frelser, og alt ser idyllisk ud på overfladen. Men i virkeligheden er det et samfund præget af dyb racisme, og afspejler på mange måder USA år 1912 i det hele taget.\nBioShock Infinite er mere historief0kuseret - som i øvrigt tager en masse uventede og interessante/spændende drejninger -  end f0kuseret på selve skydedelen. Og der er en masse lækre, grafiske detaljer, som man let kan bruge lang tid på at studere og nyde.\nSpillet er fyldt med politiske og historiske referencer, og inddrager også en masse naturvidenskab, som kvantefysik m.m.\nSå er du til FPS-spil, med stærk f0kus på historie, politiske referencer og science-fiction (jeg anser Steampunk som en form for science-fiction), så er BioShock Infinite anbefalingsværdigt.\nDen eneste umiddelbare ulempe ved spillet, er at spillet er ret kort. Det gør, at spillet går fra 10 og ned til 9,5. Men til gengæld er spillet fyldt med så mange detaljer, at det sagtens kan spilles igen.

The story takes place in the year 1912 in Columbia. A floating city in the sky witch is something diferent form the other two bioshock games. The main character in the game (witch is you) is Booker DeWitt,a veteran of the U.S. Cavalry. He's job is to birng a girl named Elisabet to somone he's in debt. The gameplay is fun but sometimes it gets repetitive at some point. The A.I. or Elisabeth is well responsive and she is very helpfull in combat. She'll throw you med kits,ammo,money,...(only if you want it). Like in the first two bioshock games you use different vigorous powers (a.k.a. plasmids) to use them on the enemy or set them as traps. The graphics of the game is BEAUTIFUL and well made. Just looking at the buildings of Columbia makes you feel like your back in time. Also the character models are well made.\n\nFor those of you who would like to know if is it worth buying it? The anwser is YES!
