Főleg a játékmenet! Az elején még új és érdekes, de túl lassan adagolja azt a kevés új eszközt, amivel talán nem fulladna unalomba az egész. Emiatt az összes játékmódban hamar lapossá válik. Fájóan lapossá.\nA singleplayer elmegy, nem nagy szám, a történet közepes. Azt várná az ember, hogy azt a kevés karaktert valamennyire érdekesre fogják írni, de Senki sem annyira érdekes vagy szimpatikus, hogy törődjek vele. Csak sodródtam a cselekménnyel, de végig unott fejjel mentem keresztül a pályákon.\nA hivatalos co-op pályák ugyanolyan üresek, nincsenek új eszközök, új lehetőségek. Annyi újítás van, hogy együtt kell működni a másikkal. Habár egy haver jelenlétében kicsit szórakoztatóbb, de az nem a játék érdeme, hogy tudok egy baráttal közben beszélgetni.\nA Workshopból származó küldetések közül a legjobbra értékelteket próbáltam/próbáltuk ki, és azok is nagyon unalmasak voltak. Ennek fő oka, hogy a játékmenet hibáin az egyedi pályák sem tudnak segíteni. Nem merem elképzelni, hogy milyenek lehetnek a kevésbé népszerű pályák.\nÖsszességében csak azok próbálják ki, akiknek első látásra bejön ez a kevés eszközzel rendelkező, minimalista játékmenet. Ha ezt imádjátok, akkor tehettek vele egy próbát. Nekem 17 óra elég volt ahhoz, hogy végigvigyem a singleplayert, az összes hivatalos co-op pályát és kb 20-25 letöltött pályát. Ezután viszont szinte biztos, hogy egyszer sem fogom elindítani, újra végigjátszani pedig pláne nem, mert már a gondolatától elalszok.","timestamp_created":1434275447,"timestamp_updated":1434275447,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.284553825855255127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16382394","author":{"steamid":"76561198181453541","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1143,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":805,"last_played":1588446132},"language":"turkish","review":"Hikaye 11\nGrafik 10\nfizik motoru 1000\noyunu hiç youtube dan kopya çekmeyerek bitiren adamın beyni 99999 99\n\n(puanlandırmalar 10 üzerinden yapılmıştır)\n","timestamp_created":1434274692,"timestamp_updated":1434274692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501848340034484863","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16382343","author":{"steamid":"76561198074640978","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":650,"last_played":1585604595},"language":"english","review":"love it","timestamp_created":1434274545,"timestamp_updated":1434274545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"16381457","author":{"steamid":"76561198058730894","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2490,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1902,"last_played":1452476918},"language":"english","review":"This is (maybe besides halo 3) the single greatest game I've ever played: witty diolouge, deep story, nothing is just thrown in your face (except a radio at one point but that doesn't matter), the characters a brilliantly though out, AMAZING music, massive community and fanbase, and the negative comment section has even become somewhat of a joke.

They felt like shameless padding, just stuck in to lengthen the game and justify a full price tag.\n\nPaint is by far the best addition to the game - it's satisfying to see it fly around and cover the level, it's fun to go fast and bounce high, and most importantly, it adds extra depth too the puzzles.  But, I get the sense that the designers might have been too afraid of players exploiting the paint mechanic, and as result, really railroad the player into the intended solution on those puzzles.\n\nAnyway, there's a lot of great stuff in this game, so I guess in a vacuum, I'd recommend it, but I just don't think they expanded enough on the portal concept.

Los 4,74€ mejor gastados de mi vida. Hay niveles en los que he tenido que recurrir a YouTube después de estar media hora dando vueltas sin saber como avanzar (un par o tres de ellos, tampoco muchos), lo que quiere decir, al menos a mi entender, que está todo muy pensado y trabajado y eso se nota. \nMe encanta porque es un juego que utiliza mucho el \"prueba y error\", prácticamente se basa en ello. Es ir probando hasta que das con la solución. \n\nEl primer juego se me hizo corto, muy corto, aunque teniendo en cuenta que me ha costado 1€ se lo perdono y mucho.
