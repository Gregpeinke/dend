Not that I thought this would be a bad game by any means, but I doubted that it could stand up to one of my favorite gaming experiences yet: [i]Portal[/i]. Although [i]Valve[/i] has always been beyond impressive with sequels, such as with [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i], both of which are superior to their previous releases, I was still expecting to find one game series in their catalog that didn't solely increase in quality with each release. I'm ecstatic to say, however, that I am in love with this game. This only adds elements and improves what the original [i]Portal[/i] introduced, there is no sort of lazy attempt to steal money from loyal fans, as [i]Portal 2[/i] is well worth what you'll be paying for it. Everything here is pushed to the limit, and there is much more content to take advantage of. There is not only the single-player, which consists of nine very quality chapters, but also co-op, which provides its own five chapters to play with a friend if you choose to do so. Though I have not played the later mode recently, years back I played it with my brother, and we had a lot of fun going through it. There is also plenty of community levels for a player to try out if they are interested, giving more life to this already full experience. This game's single-player took me six hours to beat, as opposed to [i]Portal[/i], which, with some prior experience, took only about two hours.\n\nThough I had played [i]Portal 2[/i] in a co-op manner years ago, I never fully experienced the single-player, which is the main portion of the game, or at least, the central one. Again, I have to say I was skeptical, I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to enjoy it nearly as much as the first, and so I went in with doubts. As soon as I actually started playing the game, however, I was hooked. This game is extremely funny, which I wasn't expecting, because although [i]Portal[/i] had its moments, it was a more eerie and semi-serious game in tone. This feels like almost the complete opposite, though in the best way possible, as there were many points that I just laughed or had to crack a smile as I became invested in these two (or more if you count prerecorded beings) very fleshed out characters that had extreme wit and conflict that just works. The game doesn't try too hard, it gives you just enough humor to keep you invested, but never to a point where you will be annoyed. The new, decrepit environments and out-of-bounds areas that were mostly absent from [i]Portal[/i] really help to flesh out the world, and the backstory behind Aperture Science helps one to better understand the facility they inhabit. The new additions to puzzles and masterful craftsmanship of the many levels here make not only an excellent game, but one superior to [i]Portal[/i] in almost every single way.\n\n[i]Portal 2[/i] is another masterpiece created by [i]Valve[/i], one that I'm surprised that I love as much as I do. This game is unbelievably cinematic and charming, it is awe-inspiring just how engrossed one can get in the dialogue, and invested in the truly groundbreaking puzzle gameplay. [i]Portal 2[/i] also feels so much more alive than a majority of games, and the only characters besides the silent protagonist, [i]Chell[/i], are robots, which speaks volumes on how intricate and well thought out these characters and their dialogue are. The game only gets better and better as it progresses, and when you already think the game has reached its peak, it surprises you with something that just makes it that much better.\n\n[b][RATING: 9.8/10][/b]","timestamp_created":1583272176,"timestamp_updated":1627207932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64471475","author":{"steamid":"76561198090904753","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":181,"last_played":1583281805},"language":"english","review":"Hilarious","timestamp_created":1583270632,"timestamp_updated":1583270632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64471274","author":{"steamid":"76561198138608470","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":693,"last_played":1561164427},"language":"english","review":"Whoosh from orange to blue","timestamp_created":1583270249,"timestamp_updated":1583270249,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64470829","author":{"steamid":"76561198981766292","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":1133,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":484,"last_played":1636420594},"language":"english","review":"yepeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee","timestamp_created":1583269457,"timestamp_updated":1583269457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64470549","author":{"steamid":"76561198154340448","num_games_owned":346,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":440,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":440,"last_played":1541184472},"language":"english","review":"Valve used to make bangers what happened?","timestamp_created":1583268932,"timestamp_updated":1583268932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64470119","author":{"steamid":"76561198369860961","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":6762,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4722,"last_played":1647213167},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um lindo jogo , amo o modo co-op e a história é magnífica,","timestamp_created":1583268122,"timestamp_updated":1583268122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"64470029","author":{"steamid":"76561198006405694","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":6681,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5046,"last_played":1642210344},"language":"english","review":"I think they changed the look of the game unnecessarily, it would be more realistic if it looked more like the old game.
