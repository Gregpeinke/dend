The level design all just feels broing and repetitive, its always just a centre part to the level with parts of it leading to different places, go to these places, kill some people and go back to the centre and repeat. The way you can only hold two weapons at once is stupid as you will not be suited out for all the different situations because you dont want to get rid of the gun you like. The enemies in general seem lifeless compared to the splicers and big daddies of the first two bioshocks, and thats without the handymen. The handymen are pointless enemies that jst waste all your ammo and are just really anoying to come accros, you dont even feel the sorrow you are meant to feel for them when you kill these humans locked in a robot body. The story for this game however is amazing with a great ending and the city of columbia is always pleasing to look at, it has some great characters as well, the lutece twins were my favourite but elizabeth just runs around and chucks ammo at you, she only gets more interesting towords the end of the game.

I enjoyed the pacing of the game and the general level design. As a Bioshock game, as far as ambience, overall tone, thematic complexity and lasting impressions go I would actually call it a massive let down.  However, taken at face value as its own thing Bioshock infinite is a really interesting, exciting shooter well worth your time and money. I found the story to be a bit weak and convoluted myself, it does its job well enough but just didn't really resonate with me the way bioshock 1 and even 2 did (played on PS3 back in the day). I could see a lot of the big twists coming quite far in advance and felt the usage of Elizabeth was very poor as opposed to the hype surrounding her. Maxed out the game is a gem, it's not too punishing on the hardware for the amount of eye candy Bioshock Infinite gives you. Sound is great too, everything pops, guns have a nice good punch to them and the music fits the mood in most areas. I was also well satisfied with the overall length of the game. I just rushed through the campaign without much in the way of extras or exploration but wasn't ever bored over the course of my 9 hours, going at an admitedly fast pace. Mechanically the combat is satisfying and offers you plenty of options with regards to how you want to deal with situations. This is why I recommend the game even if for me it fails as a Bioshock game, it succeeds very well as a steampunk shooter and particularly those into that style ought to enjoy this game.","timestamp_created":1508691746,"timestamp_updated":1508691746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35923453","author":{"steamid":"76561198255126330","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":971,"last_played":1502462632},"language":"german","review":"Eines der besten Spiele, die ich jemals gespielt habe! \nKauft es euch!","timestamp_created":1508685339,"timestamp_updated":1508685556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35923108","author":{"steamid":"76561198031232026","num_games_owned":197,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":940,"last_played":1514735497},"language":"german","review":"Eigentlich ein sehr geniales, optisch ansprechendes Spiel mit einer tollen Handlung, aaaber: ein Plotbreaker zu Beginn des Kapitels \"Hand of the Prophet\".

Per Ruderboot geht es direkt stimmungsvoll zum Absetzpunkt, während man noch den wirren Gesprächen der anderen Bootsinsassen lauscht, wird man auch bereits mit ersten Fakten konfrontiert und an einem Leuchtturm abgesetzt. In einem bizarren Leuchtturm startet unser Abenteuer ...\n\n2K Games erzählte in 2013 bereits abermals ein weiteres, echtes Bioshock-Erlebnis. Mit \"Infinite\" hat sich buchstäblich ein sehr würdiger Nachfolger entpuppt und hat mich ab der ersten Minute der Spielzeit wirklich abgeholt. Gestern - nach etwas weniger als 12 Stunden Spielzeit (es wirkt so wahnsinnig kurz) - saß ich hier und verlor mich im Ende und den anschließenden Gedanken dazu. Erwähnt sei, dass ich während des Gamings eine eigene Theorie entwickelt, wie es endet - ich lag total falsch.\n\nBugs hatte ich bei einem nun vier Jahre alten Titel keine. Das Spiel hatte an ein, zwei Stellen etwas Schwierigkeiten mit Content laden und Profil speichern ... aber einfach entspannt bleiben ... den Aussetzer von zirka vier Sekunden überlebt man - es ist kein BOD. ;)\n\nMusikalisch fand ich es sehr stimmig (in den Credits fand ich den Mini-Eindruck hinter die Kulissen sehr schön). Atmosphäre ist also ganz klar geschaffen - und davon lebt ein Titel wie Bioshock schließlich. Tropfen, Regen, Klappern, Waffensounds ... Biester, Mechaniken, Stimmen (gespielt auf deutscher Sync) ... das klang über die Studiokopfhörer sehr hörenswert wie beeindruckend.\n\nSo ... Action und Gameplay! Ich war nur irritiert von \"F\" statt \"E\" für aktive Nutzung etc. Ansonsten bedarf es null Konfiguration am WASD (jau, Geschmackssache - klaro!). Häufiger Probleme machte da eher die Sprint-Taste, welche \"plötzlich\" mal aussetzte (natürlich dann, wenn man das Weite suchen wollte; gern gegen einen \"Handyman\"). Aber auch darüber kann man wegsehen. Die Action ist variabel und es fällt nur bedingt auf, dass es sich wiederholt. Mit Stealth kommt man leider nicht immer voran - Konfrontation ist also immer gewährleistet. Also mal nicht so zimperlich und denkt immer an genügend Munition (blöd, wenn einem die metallenen Flitzer ausgehen und nirgends ein Automat hörbar ist).\n\nMimimi hier und da gäbe es (Linearität in den Waypoints, KI unbeholfen) ... aber als das Game zu Ende war (Achtung, Credits laufen lassen!) und man sich bewusst macht, warum es genau als Story so geschrieben ist ... fetter Daumen ganz fett nach oben! Hat mir seeehr gut gefallen und von sowas wünsche ich mir schlichtweg mehr.\n\nAls alt gewordener Gamer spiele ich bevorzugt Games mit starker Story. Ich brauche schlichtweg eine Handlung und einen roten Faden (vgl. guter Kinofilm). \"Infinite\" (der Name ist wirklich sehr gut gewählt) überzeugte bei mir primär mit dem Handling und unbedingt der Story. Wer von einem Spiel erwartet, unendliche Nebenquests zu bekommen, Dialoge mit Charakteren zu führen oder seine Waffen selbst zu basteln - nein. Aber es ist so stimmig in sich und auch so schön erzählt, dass man am Ende traurig ist, wenn es vorbei ist.\n\nDanke für Dein Interesse.\n","timestamp_created":1508493611,"timestamp_updated":1508493611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35859957","author":{"steamid":"76561197975365252","num_games_owned":207,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":512,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":466,"last_played":1522862951},"language":"english","review":"Awesoe story, action packed gameplay and a really great fellow for the first time in gaming history.\n\nfrom the first moment this game completely sucked me into it's beautiful, uique atmosphere and never let me go. \nholy dayum, i played through this game in just one sitting. and i basically rushed through the main story line because i wanted to know so badly what happend next. and i never got disappointed :)\n\nclearly the best game of the series and one of my alltime favourite shooters now with half life 2. will definitly play it again for all unlocks","timestamp_created":1508493389,"timestamp_updated":1508493389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35858491","author":{"steamid":"76561198303415476","num_games_owned":67,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":633,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":36,"last_played":1629472104},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is a masterpiece.\nThe game is a must for everyone who likes great stories.\nthe picture of game is very impressive .\n","timestamp_created":1508487248,"timestamp_updated":1508487248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35856405","author":{"steamid":"76561198138810534","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1131,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1048,"last_played":1508476776},"language":"english","review":"NOW LET ME JUST SAY HOLY SHIT.\n\nI loved the other two Bioshock games, this one 100% blew me away.

TÃO BOM QUANTO O PRIMEIRO!!!\n\nE consequentemente.....melhor que o segundo.\n\nBioshock Infinite não é exatamente a continuação dos 2 primeiros Bioshock. Na verdade, é uma história completamente diferente. Desta vez, a ação se passa na cidade de Columbia, uma cidade nas nuvens, literalmente, pois ela foi construída no céu, diferente da cidade de Rapture, que ficava no fundo do mar. O jogo também se passa antes de Bioshock 1.\n\nApesar de o jogo ser muito mais violento que os outros 2, ele é totalmente voltado para a ação, diferente do estilo Survival Horror do 1 e do 2.\n\nOs gráficos são os melhores da série, e estão muito mais atraentes ao jogar do que nas imagens divulgadas do jogo.\n\nMas o melhor do jogo é a história, pois na minha opinião, ela é melhor e mais surpreendente do que a do primeiro jogo, sendo um dos jogos com a melhor história que já joguei. E o final entrou na lista de um dos finais mais surpreendentes da história. Se você gosta de finais surpresa, não deixe de jogar esse jogo que é obrigatório para você.\n\nOs pontos negativos ficam por conta da dificuldade do jogo, ou melhor dizendo, da falta dela. O jogo é incrivelmente o mais fácil dos 3. Não há absolutamente nenhum inimigo que represente um perigo real, sendo o Handyman o único que chega a apresentar algum desafio.\n\nEm relação às armas, você só pode carregar 2 ao mesmo tempo, tendo que trocar as armas para jogar com outras. Os plasmids foram trocados pelos Vigores, que tem poderes bem distindos dos outros Bioshocks, mas são bem divertidos - é uma delícia atirar corvos ou eletrocutar os inimigos.

I'm usually a \"they overdid/ruined it this time\"-anti-sequel-tard.\n\n- Only having 2 guns at a time makes you want to experiment with new ones enemies carry even if it's only out of necessity/ammo savings.\n The spells are ALOT more fun and allow creative gameplay when combining with gear pieces you find.\n Elizabeth's power incentivizes you to use the whole combat area instead of hunkering down in a chosen corner until it's over (you can still do it but will find many reasons not to):\n \"Time to get ammo, time to get a healthkit, time to change location because of impedding doom so make me extra cover\" etc - so for many reasons, this tittle awards tactical and creative decision making alot. \n\n- Your adventure buddy is the most fun companion I ever had in a video game. It's a nice compromise between being useful and a welcome addition to the battle without being a combatant (doesn't take the action away from your barbaric hands).\nShe will ocasionally give you something that is actually needed but will also let you know if that is not possible at the moment so you don't hesitate and freeze waiting for her to find something, you do your thing and she will help when she can. Pro tip: if you feel combat is nearly over and she finds something like salts get it as you finish or before ending combat.\n \nIf we made a graphic for video games npc companions:\n\nwith X variant ranging between \"annoying\" and \"Very enjoyable\" \nwhile the Y variant ranges between \"Useless or even negatively impacting your team\" and \"Overpowered contribution that makes for boring fights\"\n\nElizabeth would have to be really high on X and on a nice middle to lower Y value. While RE4's Ashley would be a dot you can barely see near the X and Y intersection ( 0 )\n\n- If you are familiar with shooters do yourself a favor and unlock \"1999 mode\" from the go and see how you feel playing that, it is immensily fun. As soon as you get a pistol in your hand you will notice the big difference in visual responsiveness from enemies that are being shot. You will also notice how they alternate  between seeking cover and flushing you out and coordinate, they will not always do what you want so re-think how to lay those traps. It's above average combat A.I.\n\n- Don't overthink the story, it becomes pretty clear cut later and makes sense. But if you like imagining possibilities when reading or watching a mystery, then do!\n\nNice twist btw.","timestamp_created":1508296480,"timestamp_updated":1508296700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"35809432","author":{"steamid":"76561198044693896","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":911,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":866,"last_played":1420481619},"language":"french","review":"Un grand classique autant pour l'histoire que pour le gameplay qui change sur le 1, 2, 3.
