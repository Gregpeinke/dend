Turn off your flashlight int he dark with Alyx around, and one of the simplest yet truely awesome things happens (not that you pervert). It's the small details that are tended to in this simple piece that make me a little regretful to say that this piece might NOT be necessary to the Half-Life 2 experience.\n\nWhile it does offer key points showing Gordon's escape from the city, if you know he escapes, you have a pretty good idea what happens (Boom x300).\n\nHowever, I would honestly say, if its in your power, get this game.
