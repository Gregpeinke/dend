up in a small Wisconsin household I was always bored, I had nothing to do, but this game, half life 2, and team fortress 2 were all I had to goof around on. Half Life was Great, TF2 was amazing, but Portal stuck with me. It's a game you'll no doubt hear about from anyone who says they play video games, at least if they're an adult anyway this game is old. Even though it's 10 years young portal still is one of the only video games which has it's main theme in the name of the game, you shoot portals, woopty doo. The story is one of the main reasons people like portal, and anyone who came from portal 2 probably bought this game from the orange box, or alone just for the lore. The lore goes along as you'd expect from a valve game after half life, mute people have problems too. Chell, our favorite unfortunate test subject, must go through all the tests from the infamous Glados. As you work your way through the game you get the feeling something is off very soon, with hints left by our favorite labrat. The story was so well polished and bittersweet, it feels amazing when you transition into portal 2 after completion.\n\nSo thanks Valve, this game was my childhood, and I have you to thank for that. \n","timestamp_created":1522403747,"timestamp_updated":1522403747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.656940698623657227","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41148649","author":{"steamid":"76561198228335552","num_games_owned":156,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":530,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":530,"last_played":1523008348},"language":"russian","review":"Игра которая заставляет вас думать.","timestamp_created":1522402677,"timestamp_updated":1537768728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41147099","author":{"steamid":"76561198262606794","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":32,"playtime_forever":290,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":290,"last_played":1456340513},"language":"japanese","review":"神ゲーだが、やり込み要素がめんどくさすぎる","timestamp_created":1522396770,"timestamp_updated":1522396770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495238065719604492","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41146463","author":{"steamid":"76561198055301588","num_games_owned":1011,"num_reviews":203,"playtime_forever":233,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":105,"last_played":1527202584},"language":"french","review":"[h1]Portal ▸ Écrit[/h1]\n\nMonument du jeu vidéo et annonciateur d’un plus grand jeu encore, j’ai nommé Portal.

A sacada de usar portais para passar pelos puzzles torna o game genial, assim como o uso de física.\n\nEnredo: Praticamente inexistente (o que não faz falta no game)\n\nConsiderações finais: Um game com uma proposta diferente do comum, fechei em uma \"jogada\" e demorei pouco mais de 3 horas. Recomendo demais para quem gosta de games puzzle, ou mesmo para quem nunca jogou um, recomendo experimentar. Volta e meia o game está em promoção, então vale esperar um pouco.\n\nNota: 9/10","timestamp_created":1522347562,"timestamp_updated":1522347634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41135012","author":{"steamid":"76561198260058658","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":80,"playtime_forever":10,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10,"last_played":1522345964},"language":"polish","review":"GUT","timestamp_created":1522346003,"timestamp_updated":1522346003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41134516","author":{"steamid":"76561198136546909","num_games_owned":178,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":221,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":220,"last_played":1616475141},"language":"english","review":"its pretty good\n","timestamp_created":1522344448,"timestamp_updated":1522344448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41130942","author":{"steamid":"76561198327158043","num_games_owned":572,"num_reviews":98,"playtime_forever":1091,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1586971764},"language":"russian","review":"10 тортиков GLaDOS из 10.","timestamp_created":1522333200,"timestamp_updated":1522333200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129076480865479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41126567","author":{"steamid":"76561198294216649","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":279,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":279,"last_played":1522317012},"language":"german","review":"Das spiel hat eine mega geile storry.
