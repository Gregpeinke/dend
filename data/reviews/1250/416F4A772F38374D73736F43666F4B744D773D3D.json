Yes, it is a old game and will likely receive less updates with KF 2 on the way.. But at it's current state it's pretty nice imo. Try to play it with friends. Ofc you can play alone or with strangers, in fact, most of my gameplay I was playing with strangers against the zeds (zombies).

There aren’t a whole lot of bells whistles when it comes to Killing Floor. It’s just you, 5 other people, and a boatload of zombies. The game doesn’t try to bore the player with backstory or cut scenes. It is just a down-to-the-bone wave based shooter. Some may think these are negative qualities, but it just makes for a great game to pick up and play for a little with some friends. \nIt takes itself just serious enough without drying everything out. All the characters' dialoged lines are hilarious, easy to quote phrases that give the game its charm, but it is still a serious and difficult game. \nThe community and developers are great. This may sound crazy but I pretty much only play this game during the holiday events in December. They update the game so all the enemies are reskinned to be Christmas themed. There are also holiday levels and remixed Christmas music. It just shows that the developers behind this game aren’t trying to make you cry or uncover truths about society; it's just an extremely fun and unique game that will that will give you hours of entertainment.  \nAlso the game is pretty challenging, they offer difficulties ranging from beginner to Hell on earth, yet I still can get destroyed on medium without any hesitation.
