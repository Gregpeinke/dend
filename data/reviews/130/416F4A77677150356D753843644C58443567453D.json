It takes place during Black Mesa Incident and around the same time as Gordon Freeman's introduction to the facility. In this you play as Barney Calhoun, a regular security officer at Black Mesa who's main goal is to escape the facility with everyone else. Although, it is short (around 2-3 hours average for first timers) it provides a decent amount of content for the money.\n\nPros:-\n->Experience through the perspective of someone other than Freeman.\n->New Locations.\n->New Armor system.\n->Some interesting takes on the events of Freeman from og Half-Life\n->Great side-story\n->Everything else that made Half-Life great.\n->Little to no bugs.\n->Satisfying Ending.\n\nCons:-\n->A bit on the shorter side.\n->No new enemies.\n->No new weapons\n->No Boss Battles\n\nHighly Recommended for Half-Life fans such as myself. It is not recommended for players that are seeking solely for new content, just like there was in Opposing Force expansion. You will be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1578278121,"timestamp_updated":1578278601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61367718","author":{"steamid":"76561198990352453","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":12568,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":736,"last_played":1654886035},"language":"czech","review":".","timestamp_created":1578244193,"timestamp_updated":1578244193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"61361857","author":{"steamid":"76561198418546294","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":230,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":207,"last_played":1580339695},"language":"russian","review":"Неплохое DLC(если его можно так назвать) к оригинальной халве.

Hitscan opponents show up in places with minimal or no cover, forcing you to take damage.

Empiezas yendo a trabajar como lo harías cualquier otro día, pero las cosas rápidamente salen mal en Black Mesa. De repente estás bajo asedio, y como miembro de la fuerza de seguridad, tiene la tarea de defender a los científicos de la instalación de los extraterrestres y también de los soldados del gobierno, que han venido a ayudarlo. En la práctica, atravesará el mismo tipo de niveles peligrosos que se encuentran en el juego original. Durante el transcurso de Blue Shift, puedes encontrar un par de referencias inteligentes tanto a Opposing Force como al juego original. Estos, junto con algunos otros chistes, son las partes más divertidas de Blue Shift. El resto consiste en algunos tiroteos bastante directos, una excursión obligatoria a Xen (el universo paralelo de Half-Life), y varios acertijos de salto que logran ser lo suficientemente inteligentes como en lugar de molestos. No se pueden encontrar nuevos desafíos, todo termina muy rápido y no tiene mucho sentido volver a visitar los niveles.\n\nBarney Calhoun, tu personaje en Blue Shift, supuestamente no tiene la misma formación académica que Gordon Freeman, ni tiene el entrenamiento militar del cabo Adrian Shephard, el protagonista de Opposing Force. En el contexto del juego, no hay nada que lo destaque: Barney corre extremadamente rápido (al igual que Gordon y Adrian) y puede sufrir una cantidad excesiva de daño (al igual que Gordon y Adrian). Esto tiene sentido en Half-Life, donde estás protegido por un traje ambiental de última generación, así como en Opposing Force, donde eres un soldado altamente entrenado. En Blue Shift, es una exageración, y la única vez que tienes la sensación de que en realidad se supone que eres un guardia de seguridad realista es en una secuencia temprana en la que debes obtener tu arma y recoger tu chaleco y casco. Al igual que en Half-Life y Opposing Force, tu personaje nunca dice una palabra en el transcurso de Blue Shift. En Half-Life, esto te ayuda a sumergirte en el juego. En Blue Shift, es una lástima. \n\nUna expansión que no tiene mucho que ofrecer.

Nonetheless it's still Half-Life game done proper, and this time you play as Barney Calhoun, a security guard that would later make a reappearance in the sequel.\n\nThe premise is same as usual, you come to Black Mesa, bad things happen, now you gotta run for it. The plot is so much more straightforward, there's no detours to launch a rocket or deal with other problem like that. Hence the shorter length. Here it's, just, like, you come to work, appreciate the disfunctional infrastructure of Black Mesa before alien poop hits the fan, then traverse some areas until you learn of old teleportation system prototype, rescue the scientist who knows hot to operate it, get a short trip to Xen and to return power to the thing, and then you dash for it. Overall you get, like, 6 weapons total over duration of entire expansion, and there is no HEV suit - you only got guard vests and helmets to salvage. That's a nice detail to be honest, there are HEV chargers all over the place but since you don't have the suit they are useless.\n\nI probably would recommend AGAINST buying this, but even the default price is 4 euros/dollars tops and it goes down to 39 cents during sale, seemingly the lowest sale price on Steam, definitely worth it!","timestamp_created":1577290007,"timestamp_updated":1577290007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584775090217590332","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60526809","author":{"steamid":"76561198394077934","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":480,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":454,"last_played":1577286177},"language":"english","review":"NICE","timestamp_created":1577286098,"timestamp_updated":1577286098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60520718","author":{"steamid":"76561198385306369","num_games_owned":371,"num_reviews":630,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":9,"last_played":1577218094},"language":"turkish","review":".","timestamp_created":1577280078,"timestamp_updated":1577280078,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60517326","author":{"steamid":"76561198099473737","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":695,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":695,"last_played":1577276146},"language":"koreana","review":"요즘 놓쳤던 고전게임들 정주행중인데\n바이오쇼크, 데드스페이스, 둠시리즈, 헤러틱, 레드넥램페이지,아웃로 등등\n하프라이프까지 왔는데 재미는 있었지만 너무 불친절해서 하면서 불편했습니다.\n드럼통으로 전선 잇는거나 물내리고 드럼통으로 징검다리 만드는거나\n뭐. 20년전 게임이니 이해해야죠.\n덕분에 크리스마스 잘넘겼어요.ㅋㅋ","timestamp_created":1577276352,"timestamp_updated":1577276352,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60512938","author":{"steamid":"76561198968434663","num_games_owned":74,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":158,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":158,"last_played":1577261690},"language":"schinese","review":"三个主角最短的就是巴尼卡尔霍恩了","timestamp_created":1577270863,"timestamp_updated":1577270863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60511434","author":{"steamid":"76561198449804464","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":86,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":86,"last_played":1577268877},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1577268884,"timestamp_updated":1577268884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60505379","author":{"steamid":"76561198392672345","num_games_owned":648,"num_reviews":68,"playtime_forever":486,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":264,"last_played":1599303396},"language":"english","review":"I would say that this game is pretty good. but it can sometimes feel a bit unfair when the game auto-saves you in front of a massive group of bad guys and you have low health. so you have to perfectly kill them all with out getting shot. this game also has some fun problem solving.\n\nso if you like the format of Half-Life 1, this is more of that fun stuff.","timestamp_created":1577259405,"timestamp_updated":1577259405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60488911","author":{"steamid":"76561198020604091","num_games_owned":266,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":75,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":75,"last_played":1577231026},"language":"polish","review":"Bad level design 101","timestamp_created":1577231166,"timestamp_updated":1577231166,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"60485603","author":{"steamid":"76561198157729217","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":307,"last_played":1577226550},"language":"english","review":"I enjoyed Blue Shift.
