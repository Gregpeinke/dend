The game is extremely, extremely difficult on higher difficulties that cannot be overcome without amazing team work and skill.

If you don't, let me explain its draw. You see, it all started when Horzine's scientists created dangerous mutated clones. An outbreak occured, leading to London being overrun by these creatures and only a small six person force of various police and military to fight the hordes. A few updates later and the infection has spread to the rest of England, and new and intersting (DLC, Promotional, and Holiday) characters ranging from DJs to Welders, Chicken Costume Commandos to Mall Santas have joined to fight.\n\nHectic combat, interesting characters, cheap DLC, fun events, lots of weapons, varied maps, plenty of achieves, scary monsters. Co-op survival horror at probably its finest.
