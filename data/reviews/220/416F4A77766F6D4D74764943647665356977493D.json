And honestly, after playing it, this was one of the best games I've ever played. Guns were satisfying, controls were great, level designs are expertly made, story is spectacular, and the interaction between you and the world of Half-Life 2 felt better than games existing today.\n\nSome complaints though are within the floaty handling of vehicle sections and some parts of the game lingering longer than they should (not a terrible amount of them, but some).\n\nOverall, this is a MUST play for PC owners.
