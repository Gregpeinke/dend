Viszont mégis imádtam a játékot. Talán a hangulata miatt. Egy elhagyatott létesítményben, figyel minket egy mesterséges intelligencia, GLaDOS, akit nem is látunk, csak hallunk, és teszteket csináltat meg velünk. Közben szól az a fura zene, amitől a mai napig kiráz a hideg. A szűk, zárt tereivel, a nyomasztó zenéjével és azzal, hogy nagyon kevés infót árul el (gondolok itt akár a főhős kilétére, a létesítményre vagy akár GLaDOS-ra) a játék egy olyan klausztrofób atmoszférát teremt, amit az ember horror játékoktól vár el, nem pedig egy puzzle-platformertől. Viszont a játék emellett még sokszor vicces is, GLaDOS megjegyzései miatt. \nA Portal játékmechanikája olyan ötletes de mégis egyszerű, hogy az ember nem érti, hogy ez hogy nem neki jutott eszébe előbb, hiszen csak lőni kell két lyukat a falra, az egyiken bemegyünk, a máikon kijövünk, ennyi. Pályatervezés szempontjából is egészen remek a Portal, a játék elején megismerkedhetünk a portálok mechanikájával és fizikájával, illetve különböző tereptárgyakkal, mint például a kockákkal, az energiagolyókkal (vagy mikkel :D) és a mozgó platformokkal is, így mire oda jutunk, hogy először csak az egyik, majd később mind a két portált kedvünk szerint mozgathatjuk, már nagyon jól meg tudtuk tanulni ezek működését.\nA Portalt nagyon sokan hasonlítgatják a folytatásához, ami sok téren többet tud felmutatni, mint elődje: a tesztpályák sokkal nagyobbak és kapunk új játékelemeket, van benne többjátékos mód, online pályatervező, a történek is sokkal kidolgozottabb és hosszabb, e mellé kapunk több karaktert is, úgy összességében sokkal többet tudunk meg az Aperture Science-ről. A Portal 2 majdnem minden tekintetben többet tud az elődjénél, az egyetlen dolog, ami ha nem is rosszabb de mindenképpen másabb, az a hangulata. A Portal 2 hatalmas tesztkamrái, az Aperture Science végeláthatatlan ködbe burkolózó tájai, a játék zenéje és a humoros karakterek megléte egy sokkal felszabadultabb élményt nyújthat sok mindenki számára, a Portal 1 klausztrofób hangulatával szemben. \nÖsszességében a Portal első része még így is egy remek játék, ami egy nagyon különös játékélményt tud nyújtani, és akinek ez bejön, annak bátran tudom ajánlani.","timestamp_created":1484000732,"timestamp_updated":1587301660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"29150090","author":{"steamid":"76561198133391334","num_games_owned":262,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":540,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":324,"last_played":1541791579},"language":"polish","review":"Fabuła niezbyt rozbudowana, ale wciągająca, pod koniec po prostu czuć to napięcie.
