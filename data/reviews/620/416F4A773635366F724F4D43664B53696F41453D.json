Great puzzles, terrific dialog, lengthy campaign, fun co-op, a level editor, mod support... what more could you ask for? The gameplay is very unique, the portals especially lead to satisfying levels and very interesting interactions with the other game mechanics. The 'test chamber' premise works extremely well to make self contained levels that make sense with the story, but at times you also get the feeling of blazing your own trial even within the contained environments. The characters and quips are hilarious and memorable, and even people who haven't played the game have probably heard retellings of some of the jokes. The co-op campaign makes sure to force you to work together at times while also providing ample opportunities to mess with your partner. Even once you've played through the campaign twice and beaten the co-op with everyone on your friends list, you can still go back and expierience it all again through community made levels and mods (Thinking with Time Machine and Aperature Tag are ones I've played and really enjoyed). If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up (or wait for the periodic sales), it's well worth it.\n\n[quote]For more puzzle game and platformer recommendations,  check out [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/29932239/]my Curator page[/url][/quote]","timestamp_created":1526247707,"timestamp_updated":1528327256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653797686100006104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"42024013","author":{"steamid":"76561198334252967","num_games_owned":105,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1380,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":939,"last_played":1594657501},"language":"english","review":"Great puzzles, great graphics, fantastic writing, brilliant art direction.

If it had been a game with no storyline and endless test chambers, i would have been done with it in 3 hours. But this storyline is very engaging, with twists and turns and engaging puzzles and characters.
