You have a gun that creates 2 portals that are linked and solve puzzles with it. This Portal edition utilizes the same portal gun with a few additions including acceleration & bounce gel, lightbridges and a decent solo campaign. It's was suprising how they were able to flesh out the character of the AI that runs Black Mesa. After a while the solo campaign puzzles get insultingly easy as they transform into a sight-seeing tour instead, but the ride is a nice experience.\n\nWhen you're done with that, get a friend and explore the co-op missions! You can still hear Glados' condescending monologues while puzzling together. It is hilarious!

I like to be able to imagine I am the character in a game, in the scenario created, and escape into that world for a while. Half Life 2 failed for me, and Portal made the same errors. In this case: the game begins with you waking up. And you seem to have had radical surgery, with metal bolted onto your bones. Don't you think you would examine that? Check your legs? Is it bolted or strapped on? Could it be removed and you restored to a normal body, or are you permanently disfigured? Does it hurt to walk on it? To fall 50 feet and land on it? The game doesn't answer any of this, meaning I was immediately removed from the character. Either she had information that hadn't been shared with the player (making it difficult to _be_ her in the game), or she somehow doesn't notice or comment upon the fact that she may have been mutilated in her sleep (again, making it impossible to empathise with the character). This could have easily been rectified by a few seconds of close-up, maybe a wince; perhaps later a comment on it, or a sign about the surgery. To gloss over something that would be so major in a person's life is bizarre.\"\n\nI also noticed (which I don't remember from Portal 1) that picking up the portal gun now gives you X-ray vision. You can see where portals are even when they're out of sight, through walls. It is often confusing (sometimes they looked like the gun sights); unnecessary (it wasn't useful to me in the slightest); and it made no sense (the character wasn't looking through special sights on the gun or anything like that). I wouldn't have minded if it was a feature you could turn off, but I couldn't find any such setting in the menu.\n\nAgain, the actual puzzling is generally okay, but weird things like that kept distracting me.","timestamp_created":1476621838,"timestamp_updated":1476621952,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.259118646383285522","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26068579","author":{"steamid":"76561198268880653","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":764,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":521,"last_played":1590854229},"language":"english","review":"I'm just speechless. \nEverything about this game is just perfect.
