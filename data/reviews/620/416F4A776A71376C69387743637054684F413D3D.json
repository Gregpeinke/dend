Portal 2 is a wonderful puzzle game with a funny and heartwarming story.\nIn Portal 2 you learn more about Aperture Science in the past. And it's not like those mostly dull CW TV shows where you learn more about superheroes when they started. It is actually interesting because you learn more about GlaDOS herself (who she is and why she is insane). It is impossible to play this game without smiling from laughter as GlaDOS and the hilariously stupid Wheatley attempt to kill you. You will want to stop progressing through the game just to hear Wheatley try to \"hack\" a machine. Most of the time if you wait enough Wheatley will continue attempting to figure out how to get out of a certain situation. For example you will hear his hacking techniques where he makes a list of the objects in a locked room including a computer, the floor, and objects not in the room like pens.\n\nPortal 2 has levels but there are parts of the game where you get out of the test room number i formula and explore the back of the facility in search of a way out. The test rooms themselves are very accessible. To test a hypothesis you don't have to do alot of work, where in other FPSes with puzzle elements you would have to backtrack the whole level to find one stupid cracked wall that looks different from other ones that you have to shoot. They also give you alot of hints in the design of the level. It's kind of hard to describe but the design of the levels (like railings on certain platforms or black spaces on certain places) scratches off some theories with wrong answers on how to solve some of the puzzles.\n\nThere is also coop but I have not played it yet. I have looked at the level editor and the great thing about it is that you cannot submit a level unless there is a solution. That definitely means that all the levels in the workshop are genuine.\n\nThis is a game that everyone can play and would want to play to the end. I wish Valve would make single player games again.

Added mechanics which work nicely in sync with portals, a few fairly predictable plot twists, and an epic (at least compared to the lack of action in the game) final battle.

The soundtrack is great. The surroundings are great. The characters are great, including the voice-acting. The story is brilliant and well built-up. The nicely hidden easter-eggs that connect Portal to Half-Life. Controls are easy and the puzzles go from easy to not too hard to be annoying.\n\nAnd that's just the single player. The Multiplayer just adds to the game, which is something -in my honest opinion- that a lot of games do very, very wrong. The puzzles are, yet again, fun to go through. And if your friend/fellow traveler is cooperative and constructive, it gets even more fun. \n\nBut wait! There's more!\nThe multiplayer is even a continuation of the Singleplayer. Picking up somewhere after the singleplayer story, it builds on.\nThere's even a good replayability, also not present in a lot of games.\n\nMy son loves watching me, my wife or both of us play portal. He knows GlaDos, He knows Wheatley. He knows Atlas & Peabody. And, since he's five and loves the game and how it works & looks, I can't possibly think of a better way to end this review by saying: He would love another Portal-game.

Kind of. The dark humour of the original is still present, but rather than being a short campaign of concentrated excellence in the form of a puzzle game, Portal 2 is more of a typical adventure game with occasional flashes of brilliance. This isn't to say that Portal 2 isn't as funny as the original, but it's a far more laid-back story with more going on in the form of back story and hidden nuggets of insight. It would have been impossible to keep up that level of intensity for the entire duration of Portal 2, so it's a wise choice.\n\nPortal 2 is excellent, especially if you like Valve's typical dark sense of humour with quirky characters with questionable morals. It's far prettier than the original, and the dynamic music really adds to the atmosphere.\n\nThe biggest problem Portal 2 has is that the story and the game rarely meet. You can bet that if there's a section with exposition and narration, there won't be any puzzles for a while - there are very, very few parts where you have the two things together. This is an obvious decision as players would want the occasional breather between bouts of puzzles, and the pacing works well because of it. Although for me it did slow down quite a lot once you enter the salt mine, and didn't pick up until the first enrichment sphere...\n\nIt's still an absolute delight to play though, and well worth your time.\n\nI can't comment on the multiplayer aspect as I don't play multiplayer, but the single player campaign is excellent.","timestamp_created":1426418919,"timestamp_updated":1426418919,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48116600513458252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14898827","author":{"steamid":"76561198119693745","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":2730,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1038,"last_played":1533635309},"language":"english","review":"Good game fatty,fatty,fatty no parents -Wheatly","timestamp_created":1426411417,"timestamp_updated":1426411417,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14898171","author":{"steamid":"76561198029620615","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":802,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":802,"last_played":1397290311},"language":"french","review":"Portal était un chef d'oeuvre.
