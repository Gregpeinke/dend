You are a test subject within the science labs deep below the surface, used to test the \"portal gun\", a device which, funnily enough, allows you to make hot fudge sunday, well, only in an alternative universe, in this one however, it makes portals. Your goal is to beat each room, learning the mechanics of the game while getting messed around by a psychotic AI.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, you have a gun, it shoots a blue and a orange portal, allowing you to travel between them. Using this single mechanic and basic movement, you must solve reach room in turn. Where the game shines is the creativity of both the puzzles and the way it forces you to think outside the box, while inside a box. Each puzzle feels satisfying to beat and your reward for beating them, another puzzle, even better than the last. Later on the game gets more fast paced and forces you to use all that you've learned, and apply them offensively.\n\nWhere portal truly shines however is its humor. It starts off rather tame and slowly eases you into a range of odd ball humor, normally centred around insulting you, or just being mean in general. I rarely comes off as completely mean spirited however, and from my experience, rather light hearted and teasing whenever its aimmed at you, whenever its on a different topic its creative. The big star of the game, glados, is the source of all this banter, everything she says is golden, even if she is the main antagonist, she's lovable in the way only an entertaining bad guy can be.\n\nPortal also features a rather simple visual style, which is deliberate if you consider that the entire thing is based in a testing facility. This not only helps remove any enviromental confusion when solving puzzles, only allowing you to focus on the raw elements of each one, but really does help hammer home a feeling of isolation, not only due to a lack of other people, but a lack of sensory stimulation. There is an interesting aspect of psychology at play here and studies documenting the effects of sensory deprivation, something which this game does apply rather well to an extent. The game does have music, and when you focus on it the music is rather delightful, it has a very clean, syth style that does not use any traditional instrument. But its very easy to forget that it is even there at times.\n\nOverall, portal is a classic which deserves its place in gaming history, its a fantastic puzzle game and is nothing short of satisfying from start to finish. I would recommend this to anyone, as its perfect for people new to gaming, vets of the entire medium and will be able to keep the attention of just about anyone, regardless of taste.","timestamp_created":1479317082,"timestamp_updated":1479317082,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26627235","author":{"steamid":"76561198115161776","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":477,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":380,"last_played":1530558638},"language":"hungarian","review":"Nagyon jó 3 szor játszottam végig eddig :3","timestamp_created":1479287667,"timestamp_updated":1479287667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26626463","author":{"steamid":"76561198063129648","num_games_owned":850,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":164,"last_played":1527510078},"language":"schinese","review":"用了2个半小时通关，感谢V社带来这么一份美味的蛋糕！~","timestamp_created":1479280899,"timestamp_updated":1479280899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26623582","author":{"steamid":"76561198171296365","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":119,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":43,"last_played":1483408455},"language":"english","review":"good value. a must have.","timestamp_created":1479258442,"timestamp_updated":1479258442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26621201","author":{"steamid":"76561198013545003","num_games_owned":231,"num_reviews":69,"playtime_forever":1310,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1310,"last_played":1420295121},"language":"german","review":"The cake is a lie !!\nNothing more to say.\n\n10/10 Points\n","timestamp_created":1479244224,"timestamp_updated":1479244224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629074752330780029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26617092","author":{"steamid":"76561198181817990","num_games_owned":24,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1374,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1318,"last_played":1567257678},"language":"english","review":"Still one of my favourite games with unique gameplay and a lot of (very mean) humour!","timestamp_created":1479226478,"timestamp_updated":1479226478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26608981","author":{"steamid":"76561198247012700","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":73,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":58,"last_played":1509192910},"language":"french","review":"je trouve le jeu très dévelopé.\n\nBravo les concepteurs!!!","timestamp_created":1479174811,"timestamp_updated":1479174811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26606478","author":{"steamid":"76561198060842221","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":445,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":366,"last_played":1612099797},"language":"spanish","review":"Buenas se que esto no tiene nada que ver, pero he visto que Portal a avanzado una gran comunicacion con jugadores tipo VR y mas la cual me sabe mal que no pueda descargarlo por ser español, ¿puedo poner las voces?

Тот факт, что для преодаления комнаты не нужно было через неё бежать а достаточно поставить пару порталов и сделать 1 единственный шаг просто порожал воображение. Усложнявшиеся, с каждой новой комнатой, головоломки только разагревали во мне интерес, и какое было моё разочаровакине когда меня 2 раза сожгли как мусор, к моему стыду я начал думать что эим игра и должна закончится, хотя я только распробывал этот сладостный мозговой штурм! Но Valve только начала раскручивать весь потенциал Portal и все головоломки в заброшенных лабораториях старенькой APERTURE это самый смак игры, который пару раз заставлял меня психовать и выключать Portal (хоть всегото и на пару часов). \nА великолепный, злобный AI GLaDOS по праву занял своё место (в моём рейтенге злодеев) рядом с SHODAN. \nЕдинственное чего не хватало после прохождения Portal это возможности пройти это \"шедевр\" напару со своим другом, о чём видимо в самом Valve также задумались и создали ничуть не уступающее оригиналу а то и превосходящее его продолжение!","timestamp_created":1479139184,"timestamp_updated":1479139267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26601297","author":{"steamid":"76561198253128611","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":160,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":61,"last_played":1614515240},"language":"russian","review":"Ну так себе","timestamp_created":1479137900,"timestamp_updated":1479137900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49751242995262146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"26598905","author":{"steamid":"76561198239802292","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":588,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":308,"last_played":1588471937},"language":"english","review":"The Portal Bundle was the first thing I purchased on Steam and IT WAS WORTH IT.
