Да потому-что если раньше в далеком 2009 году ты стоишь отстреливаешься бедненький от двух зомбей еле-еле карабкаешься до убежища, то с опытом ты можешь спокойной заблеванных в толпе зомбей убить ведьму, двух хантов и при этом почти не теряя хп!!

А разница между ПРО и новичком настолько большая.. что новичку после первого захода в игру будет тяжко еще наверно 1.5 года :D если постоянно в нее играть.. Но в целом в л4д очень много изюменок..

Despite the love of Hollywood to turn games into movies, there doesn't seem to be a need for a movie based on Left 4 Dead, as it's already been made several times over, from George A. Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' to Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later'\n\nI will speak on the single player as thats all i have played so far. In the game, you and three survivors must battle a zombie apocalypse with a simple goal; SURVIVE\n\nLeft 4 Dead is about the dreaded zombie apocalypse turning the vast majority of the population into a mindless, ravenous undead hordes. \n\nA handful of humans remain immune to the zombie virus, and you play as a small group of them. There's Zoey, a young woman; Bill, the grizzled veteran; Louis, the middle-class office worker; and Francis, the biker. Armed with real and makeshift weapons, these survivors must battle their way to salvation. It's a simple plot that anyone can recognize, and Valve pulls it off with its trademark incredible attention to detail.\n\nYou battle through to a series of 'safe houses' that lead to a rescue point. The downside to single player is that the bots are passive; you always have to be in the lead, which is problematic when you're hurting. \n\nEach scenario is presented like a movie, complete with poster If you survive, the \"credits\" display the statistics for the game, like who killed the most zombies, who inflicted the most headshots, who delivered the most friendly fire, and the like. By now i thought i'd seen it all but what really got me was at the end it says how many zombies were killed in the making of the film. \n\nDont let the 'zombies' lull you into a false sense of security - these are based on the 'fast zombies' (think 28 weeks later) - they dont dawdle - they sprint at you with inhuman speed, scale fences, and bust down doors to get at you. Horde zombies aren't smart, but they are dangerous in large numbers. The real danger comes in the form of some special zombies. \n\nBoy you have to be aware of these... There's the hunter, which can leap across large distances to pin a survivor to the ground. (tricky little bastard to kill - think like a jack in a box with unlimited spring) Then there's the smoker, which has a frog-like tongue that can grab a survivor by the throat, and pull you into or up a building (always listen for the coughing). The boomer is a smelly corpulent zombie that vomits or explodes to spray survivors. Getting hit by the substance will not only temporarily blind survivors, but it drives the zombie horde into a feeding frenzy. (think like catnip for zombies) The tank is just that; built like a brick s*ithouse that can take an enormous amount of damage and dish out a fair amount. And finally, there's the witch, (NOT a old lady who eats little boys and girls); she's an enormously powerful zombie that can take down a survivor with a single swipe.\n\nThe game is paced almost perfectly so that you're always pushed to the edge. You'll run low on health. You'll run low on ammo or you'll run out entirely, requiring you to rely on pistols, which have unlimited ammo but aren't as effective as shotguns, assault rifles, and submachine guns. There are pipe bombs and Molotov bombs that you can scavenge, and you can turn propane tanks and gas canisters into weapons. The latter are particularly useful in the many \"crescendo\" elements in the game. These are points where you must initiate an action in order to open the way forward like having a van drive through a steel fence to open the route. The kicker is that the moment you initiate the action the zombie horde are going to come down on you like a tidal wave. \n\nThe good news is that you have time to prepare and place down gas and fuel canisters If a player falls victim to the zombie menace, you respawn at the last 'safe house' Supposedly as another survivor who has been found (though don't ask why the new survivor is exactly the same as the old survivor)\n\nAll in all - bloody brilliant Single Player - Multiplayer i have no experience of as yet","timestamp_created":1421282980,"timestamp_updated":1421282980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13988434","author":{"steamid":"76561197980314367","num_games_owned":900,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":367,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":367,"last_played":1367478000},"language":"english","review":"Great game!

Even though Left 4 Dead 2 is technically better, the original still manages to be a pretty awesome game in it's own terms. \n\nThe game is split up into a bunch of campaigns, each split into five chapters/levels (excluding two campaigns). The first four levels require a team of characters to progress to a safe house. Along the way, you encounter or are attacked/ambushed by hundreds of zombies, and while they are pretty to defeat, the sheer number of attacking enemies can be overwhelming. Teamwork is a key element when playing on normal difficulty or over. Adding to the enemies are a number of minibosses, which require different strategies to defeat. Some are pretty easy, while others keep you on your toes. The fifth and final level/chapter in the campaign is normally some kind of extraction from the area, which requires players to defend themsevles in a certain area for a set amount of time. It can get pretty intense.\n\nThere are four characters to choose from before the start of the campaigns. There's a computer guy, a biker, a war veteran, and a college girl. There's not much of a difference with who you choose, it's more of a personal preferance. But even so, there's quite a bit of dialouge for each character, some for scripted events in the campaigns, and a ton of comments/quotes for player use during gameplay. This is useful for players who don't have a microphone during multiplayer. \n\nSpeaking of multiplayer, there's an interesting versus mode, where some players play as the survivors, while the others take control of the game's minibosses. And not to mention a survival mode.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good. Even though this game is from 2009, it still holds up in today's standards. Lighting and flashlight mechanics are impressive. Textures are mostly high quality. Depending on your rig, the game maintains a good-maximum framerate, even when you have thirty zombies running around in your field of vision. I was surprised that the game ran so well, since I have a pretty bad graphics card for gaming. I managed to put almost all settings to max. On the negative side, I see black spots like a radius around fire ingame, although I'm sure it's just my graphics card (Intel 3000 integrated).\n\nAll in all, I think this a great game. I myself play mainly solo, but this is certainly best played coopertatively. Worth the money. 9/10.\n","timestamp_created":1420951942,"timestamp_updated":1420951942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13933946","author":{"steamid":"76561198005649979","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":63049,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":56439,"last_played":1645050406},"language":"english","review":"One of my favourite games of all-time.\n\nI recommend playing the custom 'I Hate Mountains' campaign.","timestamp_created":1420936814,"timestamp_updated":1420936814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13931303","author":{"steamid":"76561198066336768","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":228,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":227,"last_played":1417308703},"language":"english","review":"awesome","timestamp_created":1420925570,"timestamp_updated":1420925570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13926751","author":{"steamid":"76561198134808586","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":761,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":225,"last_played":1447294043},"language":"english","review":"Awsome game.

I WAS WRONG. This is the best zombie murder game ever made. I highly suggest single player. Your team ALWAYS has your back. You can't say that about real players. Sometimes they jump in your way but it's only because they are trying to get a better vantage point. I suspect you could sit back and kinda watch the game as your team sprays bullets and body parts but why would you? I should have figured Valve thinks of fans above profit. Speaking of, before Steam I had a PS3, two in fact, and wouldn't you know they both took a shit? I may never play another profit hungry console again.
