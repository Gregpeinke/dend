Portal conseguiu criar, com uma ideia simplória e muito divertida, um jogo diferente dos demais, um real jogo de puzzle, um real jogo que desafia a sua mente a cada nova fase que você entra. E em Portal 2 isso é levado ainda mais longe com a introdução do modo cooperativo, sem sombra de dúvidas a melhor experiência cooperativa que eu já tive a oportunidade de experienciar em um video game.\n\nCom puzzles e diálogos ainda melhores do que os do primeiro jogo, a campanha singeplayer do game continua sendo um prato cheio para todos que amam desafios e procuram dar mais algumas risadas com a Gladdos, mas, como eu disse, o grande destaque vai para a sua campanha e componentes cooperativos. Resolver todos esses enigmas e fases com um amigo e ver o quanto é possível criar fases onde realmente o trabalho em equipe é necessário fazem desse um jogo essencialmente obrigatório a qualquer um que aprecia um bom co-op.\n\nComo se o conteúdo original do jogo já não bastasse, o mesmo ainda traz uma ferramenta de criação de mapas, o que simplesmente torna a vida útil do game infinita. Existem milhares de mapas (tanto Singleplayer quanto Multiplayer) no Workshop e basta baixá-los para já começar a jogar, sem complicações de instalação ou qualquer coisa do tipo.\n\nEu não tenho dúvidas que a Valve criou um dos melhores e mais criativos jogos de video game da história, e qualquer um que gosta de ter sua mente desafiada deveria um dia experimentar essa obra prima!","timestamp_created":1325443577,"timestamp_updated":1434785904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.748640656471252441","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"364181","author":{"steamid":"76561197969673654","num_games_owned":132,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":968,"last_played":1325059200},"language":"english","review":"Puzzle solving at it's finest.","timestamp_created":1325443365,"timestamp_updated":1325443365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5292731","author":{"steamid":"76561198047518414","num_games_owned":224,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":651,"last_played":1353744000},"language":"english","review":"Great game, could've used a longer main storyline.","timestamp_created":1325442589,"timestamp_updated":1325442589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2112197","author":{"steamid":"76561198002486233","num_games_owned":529,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":3040,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1835,"last_played":1532390931},"language":"english","review":"Great puzzles and hilarious jokes","timestamp_created":1325442145,"timestamp_updated":1325442145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4213430","author":{"steamid":"76561198033980972","num_games_owned":267,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1971,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1478,"last_played":1639084822},"language":"english","review":"I love this game, it's so much fun and hilarious","timestamp_created":1325440438,"timestamp_updated":1325440438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2967027","author":{"steamid":"76561198015233704","num_games_owned":167,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":464,"last_played":1369391076},"language":"english","review":"lol","timestamp_created":1325432898,"timestamp_updated":1325432898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4730646","author":{"steamid":"76561198041220129","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":63,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":63,"last_played":1322726400},"language":"english","review":"En multiplayer es muy gracioso, el romperte la cabeza para resolver los puzzles con tu compañero, y en un solo jugador una delicia de juego, que sobrepasa al primero","timestamp_created":1325423980,"timestamp_updated":1325423980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"153234","author":{"steamid":"76561197963539250","num_games_owned":142,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1298,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1011,"last_played":1603748205},"language":"german","review":"Einfach ein geniales Spiel.
