To me, this game is an entire universe. Sometimes I can't tell the difference between Half-Life 2 and Real-Life when I play. The controls are spectacular, it never lags, the mouse control is smooth. This game is for skilled players, and new players alike. It's wonderful. Despite the fact that this game is 10 years old, It's a game good enough to compare to today's standards. Not so many cutscenes, combat at the right times, and characters you can come to love and care for. This game was partly an inspiration for me to make my own games, and I've made nine. The Source Engine is one of my favorite engines, and I think even the old version could be used to make so many good games even today. I definitely reccommend this game. It'll give you an experience that you'll want to see more of. Sort of like BioShock Infinite, you don't want to see it end. Buy Half-Life 2 and each of It's episodes and you'll understand why everybody makes such a big deal over gettng to see Half-Life 3. This game has affcected and given us so many other loved games such as Portal, Portal 2, Left for Dead and Left for Dead 2, and many more.

It's Half-Life 2, pretty much the perfect game. It has an interesting story that remains tightly focused on a core group of characters while never revealing too much to the player. It has ever-evolving gameplay mechanics that all use the same basic controls so it never gets too complicated. Everything from the environment design to the characters to the enemies looks absoutely beautiful even though the game was released a decade ago.\n\nThe only downside is the fact that Half-Life 2 was so revoultionary, so innovative, that if you still haven't played it yet, it might actually seem quaint and boring to you. \n\nYes, Half-Life 2 unfortunately suffers from the \"Seinfeld is Lame\" problem in that since its release, almost every first-person shooter released afterwards has copied the game's mechanics in one way or another. So even though you've never played Half-Life 2, you've almost certainly played some sort of derivative.\n\nBut don't let that discourage you. Half-Life 2 is still one of the greatest first-person shooter games ever made. I suggest you buy it on sale for the 2014 Steam Holiday Sale and play it all the way through in one day, preferably with some good headphones plugged in at 1080p with full settings on.

I advise you complete Half-Life before you play Half-Life 2 becuase if you go in without any knowledge nothing will make sense. So anyway back to the point. In 2004 when this game came out it really did revolutionise First-Person shooters. With the new source engine to run on Half-Life 2 has amazing new features and graphics that still compare well to modern games. One of the best games of all time is an understatement this game changed gaming history and for that it deserves more than a simple good review. There are so many mods to keep you entertained after you've beat the game as well. Half-Life 2 is immortal and will go up in history as one of the best video games of all time whether you like it or not. I'll give out of 10 Half-Life 2 a 9.5/10.
