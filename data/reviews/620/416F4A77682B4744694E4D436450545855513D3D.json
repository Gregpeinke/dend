You're no longer facing the same antagonist, but this time it's someone new. What's great about this is that you're pretty much sent to various different areas of this facility and it expands on the story of the first Portal. You learn what went into building this super secret science facility, but you can also see what went into building the portal gun. Getting to experience the early stages of this portal technology was truly great and I loved it. The gameplay in the first Portal was great, but I felt that the story was alright, nothing great. This sequel gives you a story that's richer and fleshes out what has already been established. \n\nIf you enjoyed the first Portal, then you'll absolutely love this one.

The game is filled with challenging puzzles as well as a brilliant storyline. There is also a cooperative mode so that you can play with your friends as well as a feature that allows you to create your own and test other people's test chambers. Because of my infatuation with the game, I've created a few of my own, which is a highly rewarding and enjoyable part of the game. Not only is it a fun game, but is also filled with humor. If you like sarcastic, dry humor, GLaDOS is definitely going to make you laugh. Once playing the game you'll realize that it's full of Easter eggs. You can find references to many aspects of the Half-Life universe, for the two games exist in the same universe. The lore of the game is fascinating and improves gameplay immensely.","timestamp_created":1456358874,"timestamp_updated":1456358874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21434561","author":{"steamid":"76561198127585753","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1823,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1368,"last_played":1496371399},"language":"english","review":"LORD GABEN FOREVER! \n\nBut seriously, yo- you should just get it.
