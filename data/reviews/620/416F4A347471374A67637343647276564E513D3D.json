Having always enjoyed the \"mysterious organization doing apparently pointless testing on humans\"-angle, from the Vault-Tech vaults in Fallout and the Dharma Initiative in LOST, Aperture Science and its apparent custodian, GLaDOS, tickled a nerve with me from the very beginning.\n\nAnd like all popular games, we got a sequel.\n\nFans of Valve's games have often made a point of discussion that the company is notorious for NOT making sequels to their games (beyond the 2. installment anyways). Half Life 3, Left for Dead 3 and Portal 3 are all games fans have been requesting for years now, with no announcements that they're even being worked on.\n\nThe reason I mention this, is because I think it's a testement to Valves integrity that they refuse to take the easy cash-grab route with their beloved franchises. Portal 2 is most definately a game that both builds upon the first game, keeping what was great about it, and adds enough new content to distinguish itself as something great all on its own.\n\nThe prototype of Portal 1 started life as a student-made Half-Life mod, and from those humble beginnings, Portal 2 retains that crazy indie-game feel and ambition whilst also shining with all the polish and production value of a AAA-game. The basic schtick of opening portals to play with 3D-space is complimented by the addition of three different gels that show up mid-game and add new layers to the puzzles. The puzzles range from the easy, introductory ones, to the \"what kind of mad genious DESIGNED this sh**?\"-variety. Some of the levels had me stumped for quite some time - but they never felt unfair or misleading, and because of that, progress brought with it a wonderful sense of accomplishment.\n\nAs I've already said, the story - though somewhat sparse - in Portal 1 was one of my favorite aspects of that game, and Portal 2 expands the mythology tenfolds. The new characters introduced are all engaging, interesting and funny - and GLaDOS remains a wonderfully entertaining, brilliantly executed and perfectly acted character. The graphics look great on my rig, the music is perfect, and the gameplay is brilliant.\n\nWith the stupendous backlog of games I have bought but yet to finish (or even \"play\"), there are only a small handful of games I play again after I've completed them. Portal 2 is one of those games. Maybe because I enjoy the gameplay, maybe because I enjoy the story, or just maybe because I am truly stuck in GLaDOS' compulsion to keep testing.\n\nAnd I have yet to try my hand at the very promising multiplayer-mode, or look into Steams workshop of player-made content.\n\nSo if you haven't already, I wholeheartedly reccommend you try Portal 1 and Portal 2.\n\nYou know...\n\nFor science!","timestamp_created":1421719149,"timestamp_updated":1421719430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502262473106384277","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14075565","author":{"steamid":"76561198090849913","num_games_owned":172,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":744,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":696,"last_played":1387686641},"language":"english","review":"Just play it; see for yourself.

Старый знакомый голос главного компьютера услышав который я чуть не прослезился. Юмор твоего напарника да и вообще все происходящее. Новые возможности с гелем хорошо расширили механику и это здорово. Игра стала длиннее, отлаженней. Кажется будто Valve отполировали до блеска 1 портал добавили еще изюминку и получили вторую часть ставшую шедевром.\nИтог 10\\10. Однозначно к прохождению. Позволяет великолепно провести время.","timestamp_created":1421687800,"timestamp_updated":1421687800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14068662","author":{"steamid":"76561198168404161","num_games_owned":5,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1011,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":337,"last_played":1424598445},"language":"english","review":"Pro game","timestamp_created":1421686961,"timestamp_updated":1421686961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tq7JgcsCdrvVNQ=="}
