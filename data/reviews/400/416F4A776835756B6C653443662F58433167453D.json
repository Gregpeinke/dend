После 4 раза захотелось попробовать поиграть в 1 часть. Прошёл я её довольно быстро для 1 раза(за 2 часа).В принципе игра мне понравилась. Конечно не так сильно, как 2 часть ,но тоже игра неплохая. Так рассмотрим её сильные и слабые стороны и отличия от 2 части.\n                                                                                      [h1]Сюжет[/h1]\nСюжет в Portal 1 не очень сложный , но очень затягивающий. Вы начинаете в камере консервирования. С вами связывается роботизированный голос принадлежащий GLaDOS. Это будет главный злодей истории. Сами вы играете за героиню по имени Челл. Вся игра состоит по схеме камера ,которую вы проходите, голос GLaDOS и конец камеры. В сюжете будет 1 неожиданный поворот и конец с намёкам на 2 часть. По ходу сюжета будут посхалки и намёки на ,что произошло в комплексе перед вашим появлениям. Сюжет построен легко ,но сам он интересен. Его я оценю в 7.8/10.\n                                                                                      [h1] Атмосфера[/h1]\nАтмосфера в 1 Portal сделана очень классно. Атмосфера в 1 и 2 части очень сильно отличаются. В 1 части атмосфера очень гнетущия и веет одиночеством. Всю игру вы не видите людей и не понимаете где вы находитесь. На заднем фоне говорит монотонный голос GLaDOS том ,как проходить камеры. Эта атмосфера затягивает и приковывает тебя и заставляет играть в эту игру. Атмосферу я оценю в 9/10.\n                                                                                      [h1]Графика[/h1]\nГрафика в 1 части не плохая ,но и хорошей её сложно назвать. Она неплохая. Она не принесла ничего нового в игровуюиндустрию и не сделала скачок. Она приемлема для того времени. Графику я оценю в 6.5/10.\n                                                                                     [h1]Левел Дизайн[/h1]\nЛевел дизайн сделан на хорошем уровне. Головоломки сделаны достаточно сложными. В каждый уровень детализированный до мелочей. В некоторых моментах ты удивляешься зачем так сильно детализировать всё. С неплохой графикой и хорошим движком - левел дизайн сделан прекрасно. Левел Дизайну Portal я поставлю 8.2/10.\n                                                                                     [h1]Персонажи[/h1]\nВ общем счёте главных персонажей в игре - 2. Это главная героиня Челл и компьютер GLaDOS. О Челл мы ничего не знаем и как её коллега из Half-Life - молчит.GLaDOS наоборот постоянно что-то говорит. Она не надоедает и история GLaDOS выглядит интересно, а вот про Челл мы ничего не знаем. Сами персонажи(благодаря GLaDOS) смотрятся интересно и за их взаимоотношениями интересно наблюдать даже в 1 части. Персонажам 1 Portal я ставлю 8.9/10.\n                                                                                     [h1]Сложность[/h1]\nНачало игры не сложное. Первая 10 камер проходится легко, да получения двойного портального устройства. После его получения игра становится довольно не простой, но назвать её очень сложной язык не поворачивается. Как я говорил прошёл я её за 2 часа, но у меня был опыт ,так как я играл во вторую часть серии. Сложности игры я поставлю 7.3/10.\n                                                                                   [h1]  Итоги[/h1]\nИгра интересная и стоит вашего прохождения. Она не без минусов, но и плюсов в ней навалом. Я советую вам эту игру. Она проходится быстро и хватит вам на 1,2 вечера.\n                                                                                  [h1]Итоговая оценка[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Сюжет: 7.8/10.\n    [*]Атмосфера: 9/10.\n    [*]Графика: 6.5/10.\n    [*]Левел Дизайн: 8.2/10.\n    [*]Персонажи: 8.9/10.\n    [*]Сложность: 7.3/10.\n    [*]Итоговая оценка: 8/10.\n[/list]\n[code]P.S.
