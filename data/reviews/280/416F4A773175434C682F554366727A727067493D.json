They promised an updated version of the Goldsrc version of Half-Life, and what we instead got was a diet coke version of the original masterpiece with a mile and a half long list of issues that ultimately make this an almost useless purchase. If you want to play Half-Life 1, just buy Half-Life. The only good reason to buy this trash heap of a release is for GMod assets, but there's an addon you can get that just gives you those anyway.

A poco que conozcas algo de videojuegos habrás oído hablar de este título, de su protagonista y de lo bueno que es y es verdad que es una joya aunque muy dura, muy de esa época en la que salió.\nTodo aquí sobresale aunque con ojos de hoy se queda atrás respecto a sus sucesores pero no hay que olvidar ni cuándo fue publicado, hace 20 añazos, ni que ha sido pionero en muchas cosas como incorporar una trama compleja a un juego de este estilo y que es contada sin cinemáticas ni nada, solo hablando con los NPC's que encuentres, escuchando a tus enemigos y deduciendo cosas, algo que hoy por hoy se diría que es muy Dark Souls pero es al revés, Dark Souls es muy Half Life en eso. Juego difícil, sin mapa, sin apenas pistas pero lineal así que es difícil que te pierdas pero tendrás que resolver algunos puzzles y no todos son fáciles o meros trámites. Hay disparos y hay plataformeo y aquí sí se le ven las costuras al juego, en esto flojea pero bueno, en esos años supongo que mejor era difícil hacerlo. \nEs un juego sobresaliente pero tiene pegas y yo destaco estas:\n-El control es complicado. Tanto Freeman como los protas de las expansiones se mueven muy rápido, tanto que se pasan de frenada y esto hace difícil el plataformeo. Con SHIFT apretado andas o si te agachas vas más lento pero es que cuando corren es exagerado y al principio cuesta dominarlo. Los saltos son caso aparte, muy imprecisos y falsos pero acepto que Freeman no sea un atleta y cueste obligarle a saltar y todo eso pero los protas de las expansiones son un soldado y un guarda de seguridad y siguen siendo así de inútiles. Te acabas acostumbrando pero el control es lo peor del juego.\n-Hay tutoriales pero no te explican todo como el salto largo y alguna otra cosilla que poco se usa pero en algún momento es necesario así que si no miras por intermet es posible que te atasques.\n-La IA es a la vez buena y mala. Si atacas a un enemigo desde muy lejos puedes coserle a tiros que ni se mueve, se queda ahí tragando balas hasta que muere, pero en cambio si se activan y son varios pueden hasta hacerte emboscadas y todo. Además, tienen el oído fino y no son ciegos del todo de modo que al final el juego te obliga a pegar tiros aunque con cierta frecuencia puedes tirar de sigilo.\n-Para mí es demasiado largo el juego madre, las expansiones están bien en esto. Tan largo es que va en contra de su narrativa que ya de por sí es tenue y avanza lentamente, no pasan muchas cosas a lo largo de la partida que sean relevantes y su larga duración puede hacer que hasta te olvides que no solo tienes que escapar sino que tienes un encargo que hacer.\n-En las expansiones todo va peor, tienen más bugs, sobre todo Blue Shift y sus muros invisibles que te empujan al vacío, y da la sensación de estar más descuidadas. Hay por cierto un fallo en el ratón que hace que no puedas mirar alrededor, se soluciona en las opciones del ratón marcando el último de la lista.\n-Por último decir que el enfrentamiento con los poquitos bosses que hay no son a tiro limpio sino que debes hacer cosas como activar algún mecanismo y demás. Hasta ahí bien, sin quejas, el problema es que no siempre es fácil ver qué debes hacer y en el caso de Nihilant, el boss final, su combate es un coñazo y muy aburrido, de lo más perezoso de hacer que he visto en un videojuego.\n\nEn fin, obra maestra y punto, no hay discusión de modo que el jugarlo se hace imprescindible para cualquier aficionado a los FPS y a los juegos en general, por ejemplo a mí este tipo de juegos no van conmigo en demasía y aún así lo disfruté y mucho a pesar de jugarlo en Difícil y sufrir como no está escrito.\nUna última cosa, yo jugué la versión Source y al parecer es una patata, se ve mucho mejor pero incorpora bugs como multiplicarse el escenario en determinados sitios o incluso variaciones en el manejo y efectividad de las armas. Yo esto último lo sé por comentarios así que no puedo confirmarlo pero al parecer es mejor jugar la versión original que, viéndose más feo y con unos NPC's deformes, va mil veces mejor pero eso ya que cada uno escoja.\n\nNota: 9,5","timestamp_created":1604322043,"timestamp_updated":1604322247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78571468","author":{"steamid":"76561198996092578","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1264,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":425,"last_played":1657721168},"language":"russian","review":"Переделали физику в игре сделали воду более реалистичной.

I died several times but not because I did something stupid or lost a fight, rather simply because some random thing happened out of nowhere and killed me with no warning.\n\nThen the thing that made me quit the game.  I came to a room with a bridge that falls out from under me and kills me.  Then instant death on respawn.  Doesn't seem worth starting over.\n\nGoing to skip to HL2.

They offer a choice of HD models but many of the weapon models and some other added effects and lighting look extremely out of place and the scientist models make me want to gouge my eyes out.
