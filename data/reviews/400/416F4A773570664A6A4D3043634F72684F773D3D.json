If you're not much bothered by story, I guess this would be the game for you.  For me, I wanted to know more, and a few secret areas wouldn't have hurt, either.

The introduction of additional game elements over time expands on the basic concepts in a thought-provoking way without patronising the player. Whilst short and strikingly linear, this is a minor price for such high quality design and implementation. \n\nNarrative: 9\n\nGlaDOS, our seemingly disembodied AI instructor, is a deeply imagined computer personality to rival any in even the best science fiction. As I'm moving cubes, circumventing turrets and opening portals, GlaDOS and the glitchiness of her communications unintentionally foreshadows future events in a darkly humorous and ironic way – and its not often you get to commend a game for effective use of dramatic irony. The suprisingly clever plot and wonderfully executed dialogue enhances immersion into the game and provides a satisfying experience as it plunges us ever deeper into its robust and claustraphobic world. \n\nAesthetics: 9\n\nAs I have already hinted, the voice acting is fantastic. The industrial-scientific environments and objects are polished and make the most of the Source Engine to create an iconic style of turrets, cameras, doors and  rooms – cameras that creepily turn to face you as you enter the room. The technology certainly looks like it was designed by a single science and technology corporation and the sounds all neatly fit this schema – Portal's aesthetic is cohesive and clear, enabling us to quickly grasp game play elements and find out about the world we inhabit by exploration rather than exposition. An example of how a stylised and holistic aesthetic is better than raw graphical realism.\n\nOverall: 9 \n\nPortal provides an incredibly slick and satisfying experience and should be played by everyone with the capacity to play a video game. A virtually flawless few hours in an undervalued medium that ought to be considered part of the canon, if not its creme.\n\n(Please note that I originally completed this game on the PS3 which is why I have only minutes of game time recorded on the PC).","timestamp_created":1431256599,"timestamp_updated":1431256777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15765070","author":{"steamid":"76561198001953169","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":464,"last_played":86400},"language":"english","review":"it's like skyrim with cake","timestamp_created":1431218815,"timestamp_updated":1431218815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15759298","author":{"steamid":"76561197973585200","num_games_owned":119,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":243,"last_played":1422564177},"language":"english","review":"great concept for a puzzle game, gets the grey matter working at times , looks good also","timestamp_created":1431192058,"timestamp_updated":1431192058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15758891","author":{"steamid":"76561198190031345","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":531,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":426,"last_played":1431141613},"language":"english","review":"I LOVE it!!!","timestamp_created":1431190489,"timestamp_updated":1431190489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15757943","author":{"steamid":"76561198175093537","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1010,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":576,"last_played":1479821127},"language":"turkish","review":"Kesinlikle efsane bir oyun yaklaşık bir iki ay önce bitirdim ama hâlâ oynamaya devam ediyorum çünkü bir zamandan sonra bağımlılık yapıyor.

This game is a real gem.  First, a little background.  Portal is a humorous first-person puzzle game where you use a device called a Portal Gun to navigate and solve problems in a giant underground research facility belonging to a megacorporation called Aperture Laboratories.  You are Chell, a test subject for the Portal Gun, and your tests(puzzles) are overseen by an insane AI named GLaDOS(Genetic Lifeform and Disc Operating System).  Portal was my first game on Steam, and I am just now getting around to writing a review, so forgive me if I am not very good at this.  Without further ado, the pros and cons of Portal.\n\nPros:\n+The whole premise of the game is brilliant.\n+the controls are, for the most part, simple enough for most players.\n+the actress playing GLaDOS has some really funny lines, I won't spoil them for you, but the acting and creative writing are dead on.\n+the level design is extremely well thought out.\n\nCons:\n-The graphics are old and haven't aged as well as other games.\n-The plot is funny, but the game is short and there is a lack of depth in the story.  If you are like me, and love good plots, than Portal 2 is better.\n-Test Chamber 17 is the most teary I have ever gotten because of a game.  I don't like tearjerkers.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is a very solid piece of work, and the good far outweighs the bad.  I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a great puzzle game and a hearty laugh.  Once again, thanks Valve for an awesome game.\n\n9/10 Would submit for testing again.","timestamp_created":1430688923,"timestamp_updated":1430715758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"15674726","author":{"steamid":"76561198041391297","num_games_owned":195,"num_reviews":105,"playtime_forever":4324,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4024,"last_played":1587843332},"language":"english","review":"I don't think you can talk about truly good games without mentioning Portal.
