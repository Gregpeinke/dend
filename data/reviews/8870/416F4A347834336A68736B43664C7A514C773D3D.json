What's this? There's colour everywhere.\" Or shinies. To sum and clear things: Bioshock Infinite is a shooter with \"spells\" aka vigors and melee. Player is free to choose how to survive in fights by using different kind of guns, vigors and melee. The freedom to choose and the freedom to use are the best things in Bioshock Infinite. In addition, one is free to upgrade guns/vigors/suit as one likes with (money/finding gear) limits, of course. Game itself has only few side quests and runs in a tunnel vision, but I was still able to spend +20 hours with this game (10h for runners) mostly because of shinies: \"sniff sniff, what's here? What's that? Shiny! Glimmering! Must search this box and that drawer.\" Because of this, I didn't really focus on the plot and I often missed the start of the fights. Anywho, the game has a plot and it is somewhat interesting. Skip this game if Hollywood-ish action games are not your thing.","timestamp_created":1413826630,"timestamp_updated":1413826630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519774019718170166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12584583","author":{"steamid":"76561198026393485","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":786,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":766,"last_played":1381676407},"language":"english","review":"Primarily speaking, this game is very well built, unlike most of the classic FPS games, the storyline achieves to keep your attention until the end while continiously offering twists and suprises during the gameplay. The plot is well written and I find the general atmosphere satisfactory. Special skills and sound effects are very well implemented. The colors and graphics are very good quality; not so dark and smothering unlike contemporary FPS games. Lots of effort has been made by the designers. Only down part would be the short gaming time but it depends mostly how you advance during the story mode. I would merit 4 out of 5 to this game and would say it worths your money.","timestamp_created":1413821816,"timestamp_updated":1413821816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12584304","author":{"steamid":"76561198080037726","num_games_owned":294,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1038,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":755,"last_played":1416416662},"language":"russian","review":"Bioshock Infinite обладает изумительным стилем, очень интересным сюжетом, великолепной озвучкой, чудесным видеорядом и хорошей режиссурой.

Наверное, с минусов. Слишком перемудрили с тайниками, я облазил почти всё, а по факту, большую часть тайников не открыл и не нашел. Всю игру не испытывал трудностей с деньгами и апгрейдами, а в конце часто оставался без патронов к любимым пушкам. Пушек, кстати не мало, но даже попробовать какие то новые абсолютно нет желания. Всю игру пробегал с автоматом и улучшенным карабином. С плазмидами та же тема, вроде их не мало, но какие то они одинаковые, в итоге пользовался двумя-тремя от силы. Главный минус - это сюжет. Точнее, он то в порядке, хоть и повторяется, как и в прошлых частях серии. Спойлер!!===Не знаю, видимо Кена Левина самого родители в детстве продали в рабство, ибо его эта тема не отпускает.===Интернет пестрил криками о невероятной концовке, о круто скрученном сужете и пр. Я этого не увидел. Обычная концовка в стиле научной фантастики, которая оставляет, быть может больше вопросов, чем ответов.(тут чувствуется влияние сериала Лост на автора игры)\nА теперь про плюсы. Да, сюжет не потряс меня и не впечатлил, как тех школьников, что сначала играли в Инфинит, а потом уже в предидущие части серии, но всёравно, играть было интересно и хотелось знать, что будет дальше, во многом благодаря хорошо продуманному миру игры и героям. Элизабет прекрасна, бегать с ней это одно удовольствие, чувствуешь себя, по настоящему, героем. Несомненно это удачная идея, добавить в игру вот такую харизматичную напарницу. Игра не успевает надоесть ни длительностью, ни врагами, ни безисходностью предидущих частей. Это яркий и красивый мир (моментами ловишь себя на том, что наслаждаешься красотой картинки, забыв про выполнение задачи). Удовольствие игра, полюбому, доставляет.

I loved the first Bioshock, the second one not so much. Was this another failed attempt to revive the Bioshock series? Nope, I love this game! The graphics are great, and the game has a intriguing story line. A different approach to the series. Shit, you are in the clouds! A floating city! In case you didn't know what this game is about, let me fill you in on the story line.\n\nBioShock Infinite takes place in 1912 in Columbia, a city suspended in the air through a combination of \"quantum levitation\" and giant blimps and balloons. It was built and launched in 1901 by the American government under President William McKinley's directive, to much fanfare and publicity. However, it was later involved in an \"international incident\" by firing upon a group of Chinese civilians during the Boxer Rebellion. The city was disavowed by the United States government, and the location of the city was soon lost to everyone else.\n\nAs a result of the city's isolation, a civil war eventually broke out on Columbia between different factions of citizens. At the time of the game's events, only two main factions remain. One group is the Founders, the remnants of those retaining power over the city led by Zachary Hale Comstock, which seeks to keep Columbia purely for American citizens while denying foreigners the same privileges. The other is a group named Vox Populi, a rag-tag resistance group, led by Daisy Fitzroy, formed from several factions with similar ideologies that fought to seize control and restore the rights of Columbia citizenship to all. However, years of war and struggle have driven Vox Populi to fight the powers-that-be solely out of blind hatred, resulting in more violent and brutal methods and leading to subfactions in the group.\n\nThe player in Infinite controls Booker DeWitt, a former disgraced member of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency to recover the girl Elizabeth from her captivity aboard Columbia for the last twelve years under Comstock. Booker finds the city in violent political strife and works with Elizabeth to understand why she was held captive and the secrets of Columbia's creation. The story is thematically linked to the previous BioShock games, and a scene within the game as well as upcoming downloadable content for the title revisit the underwater city of Rapture through this connection. The player augments weapons and abilities with Elizabeth's own to aid their escape from the falling city.\n\nI suggest you go ahead and get this game if the story excites you.

The combat is extremely boring/repetitive, and the battles feel so artificial and staged; it really removes you from the game.  The game is way too easy (on hard difficulty), until you get to one particular battle towards the end where you will die a bunch until you figure out how to corner yourself where you're not vulnerable (terrible game design).  The rails aspect seemed like it would be fun, but I found myself rarely using it.  Not a lot of depth in terms of the vigors and combining, although this was probably the most fun aspect of the game.  They changed the weapon system to only give you two at a time, which is fine.  However, because you pay to upgrade particular weapons, you either use those weapons you paid to upgrade the whole time, or spread your invest in upgrades because you'll get bored (or run out of ammo, though this didn't happen much) and keep switching weapons anyway.  It definitely seems like all the effort went into leading you through a particular experience.  The game is set up to just basically lead you through a scripted story.  Fine...\n\nSo was the oversimplied combat redeemed by the story?  No... This was one of the most convoluted plots of anything I have ever seen or played.  Why did it have to go down the philosophical rabbit hole?  Silly me, expecting them not to abandon what made the previous games great.  This game story-wise was so close to being great.  I guess it's just me (from seeing these positive comments) but I like when my actions in the game matter and amount to something.  Especially in a game like this where you get emotionally involved in the characters.  But the ending ruined this completely.  It was very clear (especially from the clip after the credits) that your actions mean nothing.  Why have a game with (minimal) choices at all?  A game is not the right medium for this story at all.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I applaud game developers and writers for trying something new.  But the end was just as bad as a Deux Ex Machina, but for the game series I loved.  Anyone who says this is a good \"game\" hasn't played a good game before.  You might as well just watch a movie like Looper or 12 Monkeys and save yourself about 8 hours.","timestamp_created":1413605568,"timestamp_updated":1413605568,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":32,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485306233167648315","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12534170","author":{"steamid":"76561198074111815","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":39,"playtime_forever":3697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1801,"last_played":1633185722},"language":"english","review":"A pretty good story, was a bit disappointed they abandoned the original mechanics for the game (Basically using Elizabeth abilities can result in her dying or good ending bad ending scnerio).

Para mi lo tiene todo, y por supuesto soy super fan de la saga Bioshock (todo hay que decirlo).\n\n\"Una cuenta que saldar\", es la excusa perfecta para que el programa nos envuelva y sumerja en su historia, en su mundo. Siendo esta a su vez muy compleja y solo hasta el final del juego recién atarás algunos cabos, y digo algunos porque el juego echa a volar tu imaginación y solo tú podrás interpretar de la mejor forma el por qué de los acontecimientos, las causas, las consecuencias.\n\nNo cabe duda de que el Sr. Ken Levine puso todo el sentimiento en esta su obra maestra, su joya (una pena que haya dejado Irrational Games).\n\nDesde los personajes; pasando por la trama, la música, la jugabilidad, los poderes (vigorizadores), los escenarios, los voxáfonos, los gráficos, etc. Todo apartado es de 10.\n\nElizabeth, nuestra compañera en la aventura y sobre quién gira toda la trama, es el mejor personaje secundario hasta el momento.

Existe una barra de salud y otra de escudo, las cuales se pueden ir mejorando conforme transcurre el juego; por tanto no existen botiquines, lo cual le quita ese toque extra de dificultad que si tenía el título original.\n\nSi mueres, puedes revivir en la misma zona y sin perder progreso alguno pero pagando el precio por ello: \"águilas de plata\". Si juegas en el modo 1999 y mueres, regresas al menú principal y reapareces en tu último checkpoint o partida guardada; este es otro punto que no me gustó (guardados automáticos) porque que en Bioshock 1 al desactivar la vita-cámara tenías que estar pendiente de ir guardando tu partida, si te olvidabas, la rabia que te daba de volver hacer todo de nuevo. \n\nA pesar de estos pequeños puntos negativos, el juego sigue siendo de 10 y totalmente recomendado para todo buen amante de aventuras fantásticas dotadas de una historia a la altura del infinito.\n\nProbablemente el mejor juego que he probado hasta la fecha, lástima que aquí muera la saga.","timestamp_created":1413592298,"timestamp_updated":1413592533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":118,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.877245187759399414","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12531836","author":{"steamid":"76561198021947399","num_games_owned":382,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1025,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":757,"last_played":1524162544},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I've played in a while.

Skipped Bioshock 2. SIMPLY BUY INFINITE 9/10\n\nBioshock Infinite is one of best story and action driven games ever made. The story itself is full of twists, logical challanges, humurous yet tricky dialogues, humor. This game will test your wits in combat and will challange your intellect to fully grasp what is going on. The game is definetly in top 10 of best games I've ever played. It's not boring. The main story is very interesting, has unique atmosphere and on top of that there are two story based DLC's entitled 'Burial at the Sea EP1 and EP2'. The spoilers will be skipped but this game is too good to be avoided. Everyone should play the game at least once to experience this something, that many games nowadays fail to deliver.\n\n+ Replayability value for STORY and gameplay\n+ A lot of action and combat\n+ Unique atmosphere\n+ Main campaign lasts for 10 hours (95% complete walkthough)\n+ Obviously not photorealistic graphic, nevertheless it's very pretty and colorful\n+ Sounds in game are plentiful but not messy, quite fitting music to the game world\n+ Two story DLC's that take place before Bioshock 1, kind of introduction.\n\n- Game tends to stutter and one has to find fix on google\n- Numerous bugs on 'Burial at the Sea EP2'\n- Antialiasing: dont enable it is FXAA which blurs image ruining its quality. Makes textures blurry and not clear to see, blurring hits negatively color palette and the worst thing, it's less effective than MSAA x2 in any other game.\n\nNeutral: There are some choices in the game, but it's linear. Nevertheless the game is not boring at all and is very enjoyable.\n\nTo sum up my review, this game is an unforgettable experience that may make one think about the plot or even replaying the game again and again. 9/10\nIt's best to buy the game with season pass in a bundle on sale for 16€. Even with the full price of 50€, the game is just worth it if you're fan of great and unforgettable story in games.","timestamp_created":1413425301,"timestamp_updated":1413425301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496614307165145874","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12505984","author":{"steamid":"76561198095388813","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":970,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":602,"last_played":1481126358},"language":"english","review":"Holy shit the ending will put your brain in mindfuck of a lifetime          get the game","timestamp_created":1413421967,"timestamp_updated":1413421967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508937239646911621","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12505960","author":{"steamid":"76561198059992570","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1967,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1265,"last_played":1576919113},"language":"english","review":"Good story plot if you understand the concept of time, space and dimension","timestamp_created":1413421792,"timestamp_updated":1437297627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12505753","author":{"steamid":"76561198118777256","num_games_owned":230,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":4194,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3125,"last_played":1602381974},"language":"english","review":"Amazing plot, beautiful graphics and fun gameplay.

There are less overall Vigors than in 1 and they seemed all around less useful than the plasmids of Bioshock.  The effects are minimal and I never felt like they contributed much in combat aside from minor effects like stunning an enemy or increasing how much damage the baddies took, which is a shame really.  Elsewhere, there are more types of guns but the amount of customization is much more limited.  There are no longer multiple ammo types and the weapon mods (upgrades) are very strict: each gun has 4 unique upgrades that unlock as you progress through the game but must be purchased.  Finally, tonics are mostly replaced by a new mechanic called Gear.  Gear can be changed at any time and confers similar effects to tonics.  Four pieces of gear can be worn at one time, but these pieces fill specific slots (hat body legs boots).  The effects of gear seemed to be expanded upon past the tonics of Bioshock.\n\nAs a warning this game is very story heavy.  The pacing is much slower at the start than it is in Bioshock and this is both good and bad.  I didn't feel like I was playing a game for a long time, and even after I was the actual gameplay was so divided by long story segments that I wondered if the gameplay was getting in the way of the story that Infinite wanteed to tell.  This clears up about a third to halfway into the game but that's a long time before it actually happens.\n\nThat being said I did enjoy the story even if it did get a little bullshity near the end.  While it's not the most original I applaud that the themes and ideas present were used in a video game, at least until the very end.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the ending but it seemed a bit contrived, defying sense and logic.  It did make me want to go replay the game and understand the significance of everything, but eh, lazy.  Ah, and the characters are fantastic as are there interactions.\n\nCombat is more or less the same as it was in Bioshock: you shoot things and then they die.  The enemy that replaced the Big Daddy is terrifying but it also only shows up a few times within the story.  Normal enemies make a lot more sense in Infinite than they did in Bioshock.  I understood why I was fighting what I was and why they were there/attacking me in 1 but the enemies in Infinite just fit a lot better.  Later \"normal\" enemies infuriated me at times because they would take more than an entire clip to their face at point blank before they would go down, but whatever, you get over it.\n\nThe sky line system is interesting but I would have liked to see it expanded a bit more as it rarely comes into play.  Sure, in some combat situations it opens up the battlefield a lot and creates for some cool moments but I never felt like the sky lines were fully implemented.  That is to say, they felt out of place in their own game: their existence in a lot of places didn't make a lot of sense and from a story point they didn't seem to frequent or connect enough areas.  Early on you use them to move from one area to another but after that they mostly stay confined to a battle arena.  Shame, really.\n\nOh, and the game is gorgeous.  The setting is ok; if it had been more open I would have received it better than I did, but you're never really given an opportunity to explore.  Everything is linear and you see exactly what the developers want you to.  Because of the linearity I didn't feel like I was exploring a city in the clouds so much.  In fact, I felt more confined in Infinite than I ever did in Bioshock, though maybe that is partially due to the ability to backtrack.  Ah well.\n\nYeah, Bioshock is a good game, possibily even great, but it's not without flaws.  You should almost certainly check it out and it's definitely a game that's worth talking about.","timestamp_created":1413315206,"timestamp_updated":1413315601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12491328","author":{"steamid":"76561198075606039","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":182,"last_played":1443376290},"language":"swedish","review":"Gr8 game love it! look at the graphics for example!","timestamp_created":1413312865,"timestamp_updated":1413312865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548527300357818604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12491070","author":{"steamid":"76561198013265180","num_games_owned":257,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1079,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":992,"last_played":1413569625},"language":"russian","review":"[h1] Бесконечность [/h1]\n\n[b] Очень неоднозначная игра...
