of maps to play on, it gets to the point where it's hard to tell the difference from custom to offical for some of them. Lots of servers to choose from, really epic instrumental music to slay hordes to, and this game goes on sale quite often.\n\nMy gripes are how repetitive and grinding the game is, that and there is no tutorial or a guide on how to fight the specimens. For instance the Scrake is 25% resistant to explosive damage, but nobody is going to tell the Demolition guy. If somebody buys this game they should take a long look through the guides section for this game and find out what classes are good at what.\n\nThe DLC can be fairly expensive, but they do add ACTUALLY newly made stuff for the game. E.g. the crossbow-like weapon does not perform similarly to the normal crossbow, or the ZED guns have a very cool alt-fire to play with. The skins vary, you can buy either 4 basic skins for $2. Or a single skin with a custom voice-pack for around $5. There are no map DLCs so pretty much all the maps are official or custom made.\n\nIf you're worried about the game running poorly you may be wrong.

Le match étant remporté lorsque le boss à la 11ème vague est défait. Pour y parvenir, les joueurs doivent endosser une spécialité : le commando, roi des fusils mitrailleurs ; le médecin ; le berserker qui ne jurent que sur les armes blanches ; le pyromane ; le duelliste qui manie les pistolets, etc.  Chaque ennemi touché rapporte de l’argent permettant d’acheter des armes parmi un vaste arsenal. La communauté est très active, cela se ressent sur le nombre de serveurs et sur le Steam Workshop. De façon globale, les joueurs ne sont ni les plus tolérants ni les pires raclures du monde. Il y en a des sympathiques (comme moi) et des crétins finis, donc tout dépend des jours et des humeurs ^^. Au fil des ans, le jeu s’est agrémenté d’un certain nombre de cartes rehaussant la durée de vie. Il existe en outre plusieurs modes de difficultés et deux types de parties : la première évoquée plus haut et une autre qui brise la monotonie de ce jeu et qui consiste à remplir une série d’objectifs en lieu et place des rounds. De plus, un soupçon de jeu de rôle est existant car plus vous jouez une classe particulière, plus vous progressez dans celle-ci en ayant moins de recul lors des tirs, en étant plus rapide, plus résistant face à certains ennemis, en somme vous devenez plus efficace. Etant chasseur de succès, je suis comblé mais je pense qu’il faut être un peu monomaniaque pour y jouer des heures et des heures. Cela dit, pour les persévérants, le steam workhop vaut la peine d’être parcouru car il comporte des pépites dont certaines deviennent officielles par la suite (j’en ai plébiscité un certain nombre lorsqu’elles étaient encore « à l’essai »). Les points qui fâchent : c’est moche et pour un FPS, ce n’est pas vraiment une bonne nouvelle (à l’origine, un mod pour Unreal 2004). Côté audio, les cris gutturaux des monstres, c’est très utile pour savoir d’où la menace arrive mais c’est aussi déplaisant à la longue.","timestamp_created":1389806546,"timestamp_updated":1389806546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8717168","author":{"steamid":"76561198114089003","num_games_owned":28,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1378,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1425061659},"language":"russian","review":"COOOOOOOLLLLLL!!!!","timestamp_created":1389799993,"timestamp_updated":1389799993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8716985","author":{"steamid":"76561197985354497","num_games_owned":1372,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":12,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":12,"last_played":1389798693},"language":"schinese","review":"视觉效果一般，很难相信是09年的游戏，不过一波波的僵尸来袭还是很紧凑和挑动恐怖神经，值得一玩，但不用浪费太多时间吧，国内几乎没有服务器，也让这款游戏没有那么吸引人了。","timestamp_created":1389798946,"timestamp_updated":1389798946,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8716798","author":{"steamid":"76561198053835433","num_games_owned":7,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18724,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1302,"last_played":1604460739},"language":"english","review":"Good Game :3. only those much DLC''s, and the prices of it..

And very hard on the higher levels of difficulty. And I just didn't see the point in participating in those silent, multiplayer battles. Everyone is trying to level up their characters and seems only marginally interested in supporting each other. \n\nI played with ZBane and his friends and that started out really, really good. But as we moved to harder levels of difficulty, even that group of good folks produced the occasional sour note as players sometimes grabbed kills for themselves that other players needed. (Most of us eventually moved back to favouring Left 4 Dead 2.)\n\nBetween rounds of killing monsters, you have to get to the randomly placed gunshop. THAT is the biggest part of the strategy in the game - figuring out how to get close to the gunshop before the round ends, so that you have time to go there, buy your guns and ammo, then race to the best close defensible spot before the next round starts. Again, that can lead to sour notes, as people get caught and killed going to and from the gun shop on unfamiliar maps.\n\nI hoped that when I'd maxed out a few classes to level 6, everything would be fun and cooperative, like Left 4 Dead. It was still kind of snippy now and then. Games are rarely the right level of difficulty - they are either too easy (with people just hanging around, letting others do all the killing until the final rounds of the game) or too hard (with people getting miffed at one another when their character dies, and they have no time to rebuild dangerous weapons before the game ends).\n\nThe voice-acting is fine, but there are far too few lines. For example, every player sounds exactly the same as they frequently repeat: Reloading!\n\nI think I would have loved this game, if I wasn't so familiar with Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. But I am, and they're simply better co-op games. Playing Killing Floor is like choosing Yahoo search when Google is available.

my favourite steam game that i own as of right now, A very British game in terms of humour and currency (also S10 Gas Masks and Bulpup weaponry) \nA perfect stress reliever on Normal and lower difficulties but a solid team based survival game on the higher difficulties.\nThe enemy design for both the default enemies and the holiday themed ones are both disturbing and humourous (killer gingerbread men)  I highly recommend buying this game as it is definately one of the games you can keep coming back to.\nGather some friends and have fun with the slow-mo ZED time as you use a whole

have very mixed feelings here. The game is fun, but repetitive as all hell. Multiplayer has a ton of awesome moments, but you'll want to shoot yourself trying to get multiplayer servers to work. You'll have a great time, but you'll give yourself a stroke in frustration.\n\nWhat's right with this game? Well, first of all, this game can get a pretty addicting, making you want to play more and try crazier stuff. The enemies are cool and creatively made. The guns are pretty well balanced (minus the price tags) and some are super creative (A incendiary grenade launcher that shoots the remains of your fallen enemies? Count me in!). Modding is a great experience anywhere and here is no exception. Upgrading your perks makes you FEEL stronger, not just like you're getting percentile upgrades. The mutator and Sandbox systems are really cool, the only bad part about them is that I don't think that you can make those work in multiplayer, though I could be wrong. The different perks are actually different and make you feel like you're feeling a unique part of a team, similar to TF2. The final boss, while kind of a pushover, is really creatively made, making you feel almost bad for a hulking monster that tried to kill you. The game is also really funny, having a ton of British humour in it that makes it stand out among other games.\n\nWhat's wrong? First of all, servers are hard to set up (Yes, I know about 3rd party hosting [I use team9000 when I want to play with my friends] but you shouldn't have to resort to that), a problem sadly shared by many PC games, the one leg-up consoles have on us. Secondly, guns are expensive, so if you're not a high perk level (which discounts certain guns, which ones depend on your perk specialty), prepare to grind out a lot or endlessly pester your friends to give you money just to get a decent gun. Secondly, some of the monsters are WAY too strong, the Fleshpound is stronger than the final boss! Clots aren't too bad, except they can grab you, and if they do that you're essentally out anywhere from 5-70% of your health, depending on difficulty and your armour. Perks, particularly the commando, take FOREVER to level up, even if they are markedly better than your previous level, not to mention how useless the Support class is. The difficulty is oddly done, with beginner being way too easy and normal being really difficult and hard being damn near impossible. This applies to the wave time as well, meaning that short is easy and normal is too long. Modding, despite being an amazing feature that should be in more games, is ridiculously easy to mess up. Don't get me wrong, I've been modding my games for almost 2 years now, but I've corrupted this game twice without doing anything, just downloading it and, while it's downloading, the game crashes and when I try to relaunch it it comes up with an error message telling me to reinstall the game, whereupon it works then. Finally, the worst sin of this game, if you die and respawn you spawn with NO equipment (unless you spend forever grinding out a perk level to 5 or 6) and a incredibly small pool of money (compounding the gun cost issue), meaning that you will almost certainly die again that round, and the next one, and the next one...basically meaning that you can't do anything more than be a human shield for your team if you die once, endlessly frustrating me (and responsible for a hole in my wall...).\n\nRead this and decide if you would like this. Me? I like it as a silly little game to play with my friends for a few hours, but the $20 price tag makes me question it's worth, it WAS worth my $5 during the winter sale, but a game should have a 1:1 dollar to hour of fun ratio and so far I haven't had 20 hours at all, let alone 20 hours that I enjoyed fully that were amazing, I'm fairly sure that I got 5 though.
