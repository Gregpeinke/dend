It looks great, has a very deep and engaging story, and can be a fun shooter. There was only one thing bad about the game.\n\nI am going to try to explain this without any spoilers;\n\nThe games ending was very disapointing for me. Not story wise. Game play wise. The story ending was actually amazing. The thing is that I felt that the game was too short for what it was making it seem. Not all good games have to be long. Many are short like undertale or pony island and are still great. But for the whole game, I felt like I was building everything up for something huge. But the ending came unexpectedly for everything that you do. You are constantly upgrading you vigors and weapons, and choosing the right gun layout for what might come next and the final battle doesn't even feel final or like a big battle. It was actually my least favorite battle in the game. None of the skills or special things that you learn throughout the game are needed in the final battle and it felt very anti-climatic.\n\nThe game makes it feel like there is going to be this whole big thing that you will need to use all your skills for at the end but it is just another level. My full first play through where I explore every nook and crany took 10- 11 hours. I felt that it should have been more but the gameplay and story make it amazing anyway. So I reccommend it.","timestamp_created":1474592744,"timestamp_updated":1474592744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25643606","author":{"steamid":"76561198077615906","num_games_owned":554,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":871,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1618529428},"language":"french","review":"Alors la mes aïeux!On a affaire a un doublage fr de QUA-LI-TE!!Avec un Guillaume Orsat (qui est le doubleur officiel de Brendan Fraser!!!!) au meilleur de sa forme et une Kelly Marot qui a touché la perfection!Voila et sinon le jeu?Bha tres simple:génial,c'est-à-dire un gameplay ma foi arcade mais tres sympatoche ET un scénar...Huuuuuuuuuuum s'en est presque sexuel bref une seul chose a dire!Prend le bon sang!!!!!Qu'est ce que tu attends????CLIQUE SUR CE BOUTON AJOUTER AU PANIER!Et a toi (avec les dlc délicieux) au moin 12 heures de jeu en tout :D","timestamp_created":1474592645,"timestamp_updated":1474592645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25643597","author":{"steamid":"76561198085902575","num_games_owned":306,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1166,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":494,"last_played":1588154034},"language":"english","review":"great game\n\nthe only real problem i had with it was that some sounds were awfully irritating. other than that, i highly recommend it. you don't have to have played the other Bioshock games before playing this, although it would probably help introduce you to the mechanics of this game.\n\nother than that, the game is a bit too short for $30, but luckily i got it on sale.","timestamp_created":1474592607,"timestamp_updated":1474593267,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536694347858428955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25643206","author":{"steamid":"76561197975788730","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":772,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":582,"last_played":1650834864},"language":"russian","review":"Сильная игра.","timestamp_created":1474589657,"timestamp_updated":1474589657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25643126","author":{"steamid":"76561198161095993","num_games_owned":95,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1391,"last_played":1640903993},"language":"spanish","review":"Recomendado al 200%\n\nUno de los mejores juegos que eh probado, si quieres disfrutarlo por completo no veas nada acerca de.","timestamp_created":1474589135,"timestamp_updated":1474589135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25642989","author":{"steamid":"76561198051367414","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1536,"playtime_last_two_weeks":35,"playtime_at_review":732,"last_played":1660034256},"language":"english","review":"This has to be one of the best games I have ever played, and I really mean that.

I can say without a doubt it is by far one of the best games I have ever played.\nEverything about this game is incredible. The combat, story, voice acting, tone, and message are all powerful and carry weight. Combat is satisfying gunplay with a variety of weapons, combined with the Vigor (think basic spell casting) system. Vigors are unique, from simply throwing a fireball to a telekinetic wave to a water tendril. All Vigors can combo with each other, and casting multiple vigors while using multiple weapons is satisfying and strong, without making you feel like a god. Enemy variety is also solid, with \"heavy hitters\" requiring you to adjust your approach and not use gameplay aspects like skyrails as a crutch (example, Handymen can electrify skyrails to knock you off). A simple upgrade system is also present, allowing you to slightly modify the Vigor’s effects, as well as the damage, ammo capacity, and recoil of weapons.\nThe story is incredible. Yes, of course there is a twist, but the real strength comes from the world building. Colombia is detailed, with audio logs and dialogue filling in gaps. Colombia feels real because of this. \nThere’s a ton of style, from the simply uniqueness of Colombia to the gorgeous looking weapons. It’s very steampunk, but weirdly colorful as well.\nIt should also be noted that the mood of the game is different than the Rapture games. It’s less horror-esque, and not as claustrophobic. Colombia is open, and lacks any type of fear that Bioshock or Bioshock 2 carried. Suspense is still present, simply through the multiple story arcs that I will not spoil here. Just know that social issues and moral conflicts are aplenty, from class conflict to the morality and necessity of violence to the dangers radical evangelicalism. \nVoice acting is incredible. The characters of Booker and Elizabeth feel genuine, and you can even notice character development and growth between them as the story progresses.\nThis wholesome experience is also enhanced by the emotionally powerful Burial at Sea DLC. This DLC is by far the single best DLC package I have ever played. It is masterfully executed, with a terrific story that hits hard, and gameplay that (while different from Infinite’s) brings back Bioshock’s original gameplay with limited ammo, and introduces a stealth based style with Part 2. \nYou have to play this game. It was worth it at $60 and it’s a steal at $30.","timestamp_created":1474480655,"timestamp_updated":1474480655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51776653528213501","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25623025","author":{"steamid":"76561198022351169","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":572,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":572,"last_played":1474478255},"language":"english","review":"This game is art.","timestamp_created":1474480348,"timestamp_updated":1474480348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25622779","author":{"steamid":"76561198107750910","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":458,"last_played":1451501080},"language":"english","review":"pretty good game","timestamp_created":1474479453,"timestamp_updated":1474479453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25622563","author":{"steamid":"76561198070415924","num_games_owned":317,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":54,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":54,"last_played":1427028828},"language":"english","review":"I like ducks","timestamp_created":1474478637,"timestamp_updated":1474478637,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.339187026023864746","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25622380","author":{"steamid":"76561198132422145","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":869,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":869,"last_played":1474554272},"language":"russian","review":"Если ты зашел на страницу этой игры, покупай не задумываясь.

I would recommend this game only on sale.  It was extremely linear in its convoluted and arbitrary story path.  You can only save games at checkpoints, but you can die pretty much infinitely with no real issues.  So, the save game restriction just makes it harder to stop playing when you want.\n\n-1, unskippable intro.\n+1, .ini fix for unskippable intro\n\n-38, 38 seconds of unskippable intro and the gaul to think ANYONE should need to see that intro EVERY TIME YOU START.\n\n+10 Stunning visuals.  Wow, amazing graphics.\n\n-3 Stunned at game progression.  Wow, can you say linear.\n\n-1 Save games.  1, and only 1.\n\n-1 Death?  Pah!  Who cares?  It doesn't actually negatively affect the game in any way.  Die, lose a bit of cash, and start in exactly where you left off.\n\n-3 Random item placement.  I have gathered 300 coins digging in dumpsters and just picking it up off the ground.  Not to mention other random items stuffed all over the place.  \"Not realistic\" doesn't quite apply to Bioshock games, but WTF?  It would be the equivilent of me finding 20 bills and stacks of 5.56 ammo every 200 feet while walking down a street.\n\n-1 Randomly placed gigantic voice recorders.  Why are they there? What possible reason is there for random joe to make a voice recording and then leave it in a random location?\n\n-1 Random placement of gigantic voice recorders that pop up in the same (exact same, not alternate universe same) place I've already been. Who put those there?  Angels?\n\n-1 Incredible shift of vocal tone.  \n      Female: \"I'm mad at you, you tried to kill me.\"  \n   5 seconds later, \n      me: Can you help with this lock?\"\n      Female: \"Sure, no problem!\"\n   What?  Weren't you just running from me and yelling to get away?\n\n+5 If stoned, this game would be awesome.  \n       Me: Why did X happen?\n         Stoned me: It just did man.  Roll with it.  \n       Me: Ok.. how about Y?\n         Stoned me: Dude.  Chill.
