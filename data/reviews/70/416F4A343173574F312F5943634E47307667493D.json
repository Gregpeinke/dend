I know Black Mesa exists but if you want the full 1998 experience, you could play this game. Trust me, it's worth your time.\n\n[h1] Gameplay / Structure [/h1]\nFor a game in 1998, it has surprisingly held up well to today's standards and I can see how it has influenced modern day First-Person Shooters. The gun-play is simple, rigid, and responsive, you can switch weapons easily, and enemy AI is good. The marines' AI is especially impressive for its time since they behave like actual marines (i.e. retreating, throwing and timing grenades, and also ambushes). Shooting all of your enemies with your standard full-autos / shotguns won't always work since some of them will act like bullet sponges. Usually they respond differently depending on the types of enemies. Companion A.I. is kind of wonky as they will sometimes stop mid-way or block your path, but it isn't a big problem since you will navigate the game all by yourself.\n\nDesign-wise, the levels are good and they aren't maze-like or brain-dead simple as you can navigate some of the levels with ease. Objectives can be a little difficult to work on your own if you don't pay attention as the game doesn't have any way-points, arrows or memos. So you might need to rely on the environmental design to traverse. But sometimes, it's difficult to figure that out by yourself so you might find yourself stuck in some areas. There are also a few times where geometrical bugs can get you stuck as the game loads or if you went in a secluded space. Enemy placement can be overwhelming and frustrating at times [i](looking at you, helicopter...)[/i] so you will need to stock up for the big parts in the game. \n\nXen is decent at best although a bit awkwardly designed. You might need some walkthrough guides to traverse and platforming here can be wonky. It's also shorter (an hour) than the Black Mesa parts but it doesn't drag on too far. \n\n[h1] Graphics / Aesthetics [/h1]\nThe world-building and atmosphere is phenomenal for its time. The huge complexes and rooms reminds you of warehouses you would often find inside factories but in a more sci-fi fashion. Outside areas and Xen are okay I guess, nothing more to say there. The pixelated textures and skyboxes aren't that impressive now but it helps bring out the vibrant yet oppressive atmosphere you're playing in the game. The particle effects and liquid physics are actually pretty impressive for its time, and there are some physics involved but it mostly involves some boxes.\n\nEnemies are cleverly designed and are easily distinguishable. The cloned scientists and guards can be a bit immersion-breaking at some times but I wouldn't mind it. Sound-design is also great although low-quality (as expected), and it complements the world around you.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nIt's pretty straight-forward and simple. You are a scientist and things go to hell in the Black Mesa complex so you fight bad guys and stuff like that. I won't spoil anything but there are also some pretty interesting lore behind the environments and situations you walk in, including the enemies you fight. \n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\nThis game served as a landmark for all the modern FPS games to come. Its immersive environments and tightly-packed gameplay is a big strength for a game. Although it doesn't come without its flaws, it's still great enough to play the game. I wouldn't really play the campaign again for long but it's your choice. I think it's a \"one-time\" experience for me since I don't want to experience the frustrating parts again, but you can always speed-run the game if you want. It's a solid game worth your time and you won't be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1609328621,"timestamp_updated":1609711358,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83557376","author":{"steamid":"76561198379655037","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":436,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":296,"last_played":1618818401},"language":"italian","review":".","timestamp_created":1609327036,"timestamp_updated":1617124967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83555781","author":{"steamid":"76561199073481037","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1505,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":1419,"last_played":1660033082},"language":"english","review":"for what it was, it was a fun game with an enticing story and some creative puzzles.","timestamp_created":1609325212,"timestamp_updated":1609325212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83555331","author":{"steamid":"76561199059566851","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":836,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":746,"last_played":1625655173},"language":"english","review":"It good, i like","timestamp_created":1609324719,"timestamp_updated":1609324719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83554348","author":{"steamid":"76561199008186620","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":666,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1639076292},"language":"russian","review":"\n","timestamp_created":1609323553,"timestamp_updated":1639837302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83553588","author":{"steamid":"76561198879896945","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":600,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":468,"last_played":1628165697},"language":"english","review":"Hunt down the Freeman","timestamp_created":1609322611,"timestamp_updated":1609322611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83553107","author":{"steamid":"76561198087709940","num_games_owned":31,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":329,"last_played":1608773234},"language":"german","review":"Immer noch ein absolut geniales Spiel.

is a 2001 American computer-animated fantasy romantic comedy film loosely based on the 1990 fairy tale picture book of the same name by William Steig. Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson in their directorial debuts, it stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow as the voices of the lead characters. The film parodies other fairy tale adaptations, primarily aimed at animated Disney films.[6] In the story, an ogre called Shrek (Myers) finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures who have been banished by the corrupt Lord Farquaad (Lithgow) aspiring to be king. Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to regain control of his swamp in return for rescuing Princess Fiona (Diaz), whom Farquaad intends to marry. With the help of Donkey (Murphy), Shrek embarks on his quest but soon falls in love with the princess, who is hiding a secret that will change his life forever.\n\nThe rights to Steig's book were purchased by Steven Spielberg in 1991. He originally planned to produce a traditionally-animated film based on the book, but John H. Williams convinced him to bring the film to the newly-founded DreamWorks in 1994. Jeffrey Katzenberg began active development of the film in 1995 immediately following the studio's purchase of the rights from Spielberg. Chris Farley was originally cast as the voice for the title character, recording nearly all of the required dialogue. After Farley died in 1997 before the work was finished, Mike Myers stepped in to voice the character, which was changed to a Scottish accent in the process. The film was intended to be motion-captured, but after poor results, the studio decided to hire Pacific Data Images to complete the final computer animation.\n\nShrek premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or,[7] making it the first animated film since Disney's Peter Pan (1953) to be chosen to do so.[8] It was widely praised as an animated film that featured adult-oriented humor and themes, while catering to children at the same time. The film was theatrically released in the United States on May 18, 2001, and grossed $484.4 million worldwide against a production budget of $60 million. Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. It earned six award nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), ultimately winning Best Adapted Screenplay. The film's success helped establish DreamWorks Animation as a prime competitor to Pixar in feature film computer animation, and three sequels were released—Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010)—along with two holiday specials, a spin-off film, and a stage musical that kickstarted the Shrek franchise. Although plans for a fifth film were canceled prior to the fourth film's release,[9] the project was revived in 2016 and has since stalled, with production and a potential release date getting pushed back.[10][11]","timestamp_created":1609293717,"timestamp_updated":1609293717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514955282211303711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83528967","author":{"steamid":"76561199110115729","num_games_owned":133,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":249,"last_played":1609300678},"language":"english","review":"Cant wait for HL3","timestamp_created":1609293541,"timestamp_updated":1609293541,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519841313362121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83528644","author":{"steamid":"76561198415074115","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":3318,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1117,"last_played":1649092284},"language":"turkish","review":"Götünüzde kurt varsa oynayın mükemmel oyun","timestamp_created":1609293201,"timestamp_updated":1609293201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83526672","author":{"steamid":"76561198298580311","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":679,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":679,"last_played":1609290850},"language":"english","review":"I played this to alleviate boredom during Covid-19 and damn it's good, easily one of the greatest FPS games of its time, i know Black Mesa is a thing but there's no denying the OG is pretty solid, too, aside from a few glitches here and there.\n\nNow on to Half-Life 2..eventually","timestamp_created":1609291155,"timestamp_updated":1609291155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83526575","author":{"steamid":"76561198415028249","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":65785,"playtime_last_two_weeks":33,"playtime_at_review":50299,"last_played":1660185216},"language":"english","review":"Have enjoyed this game since it was introduced in 1999.

I love the tension overall, and sense of dread and uneasiness from the presence of enemies at times, it's perfect for this game specifically. Unlike other single-player fps games like Doom or Metroid Prime you aren't playing as a trained soldier or marine of sorts, you're playing as Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who probably has never held a gun before in his life. This isn't a \"run and gun\" kind of shooter, but more so a puzzle shooter that requires you to think as if you were in Gordon's situation in real life, which definitely can make the game a little difficult as I feel it does not do a very good job of getting the player into that mindset with the saves you can use over and over. The game admittedly goes very downhill in the Xen chapter and everything after it. Let's not talk about the on a rail chapter too, that chapter was shit. Other than these discrepancies, the game is great and something any fan of the first-person shooter genre should

It could have been incredibly back in the day, but it isn’t so good now. There just isn’t much good about the game. I had my hopes up for the story, but it has been rather simple and not really good, though I haven’t been through too much to have a strong opinion. Gameplay is mediocre at best. A lot of the enemies don’t feel like they are taking damage, so it’s difficult to judge if you have hit your shots or not. Sometimes, the shots just simply don’t hit, maybe some small box got in the way but even when shooting point blank with a shotgun some enemies will still survive because it somehow “missed”. The mobs aren’t that fun to fight. They have small hit boxes, jump at you before you can react. Another one has hitscan weapons so it’s hard to fight them if you don’t have natural regeneration. The “puzzles” aren’t fun, but more frustrating. I often got stuck because I didn’t know what to do. I felt like I got softlocked multiple times. I even had to look up how to pass a certain level, which involved hitting a power switch which looked like some simple decoration and not the key to progress. The graphics are shit, I mean it’s 20 years old I knew what to expect, and the sound effects are also shit, yes I know it’s old but it still doesn’t help. The game also doesn’t seem to have a proper soundtrack, which is something I really dislike. It doesn’t have to be incredible or always present, but at least doing something like portal would have been nice. All in all, the clunky combat, bad parkour, no natural regeneration, confusing puzzles don’t mix well with the fact that the game is 20 years old. It might appeal to other people, after all I’m not a FPS guy, but I don’t really understand the hype of the game. Maybe half life 2 is better, I’ll give it a shot, but I think I will abandon or refund this game because I really was expected something good, I really only want to play a 20 year old game if it is an absolute gem, but unfortunately this game isn’t it.\n\n10 hours later, still don't like it. I found out that I was getting motion sick from the game so i messed around and changed some settings to make it less sickening. I always feel lost when playing, the game doesn't guide you to important areas like newer games such as hollow knight, lacking that great game design. I missed several important weapons that could have made it so much easier to continue. I had to watch a walkthrough to find directions and learn how to work through the stupidly confusing world. I always felt like I had to quick save every minute because of the terrible health design where you can lose half your health from a stray grenade that you cannot naturally regenerate. I haven't been enjoying it, maybe a remaster might be better, but I might be abandoning this game soon.","timestamp_created":1609257243,"timestamp_updated":1609865923,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83486746","author":{"steamid":"76561198981120707","num_games_owned":2,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":873,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":583,"last_played":1610409296},"language":"spanish","review":".","timestamp_created":1609256496,"timestamp_updated":1609256961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83485343","author":{"steamid":"76561198960579742","num_games_owned":912,"num_reviews":410,"playtime_forever":423,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":175,"last_played":1614603532},"language":"schinese","review":"传奇游戏","timestamp_created":1609255240,"timestamp_updated":1609255240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550758421421051025","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"83480070","author":{"steamid":"76561198162974012","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":594,"last_played":1609527391},"language":"english","review":"ALL TIME CLASSIC.
