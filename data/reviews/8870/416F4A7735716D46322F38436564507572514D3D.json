The developers clearly wanted the story to be about Elizabeth and the city of Columbia, but then they changed their minds and it becomes about multiverse and metaphysical reality. I presume that they wanted to make the game story interesting, but I feel like it ended up being a cheap twist. It would have been better if it was just save Elizabeth, beat the main villain and just go home. Instead of \"woah, there are multiple universes, but in every universe there is a light house and it is all connected somehow\". \nI also didn't like the combat in this game, maps feel pretty small in comparison with how it shows in the trailer. That's one other thing too, is that the game isn't what you would expect from the trailers. They definitely took things out during the production to make way for the big twists. I would say that the trailers were the best part of this

Here is my short summery of each game in the series:\n\nBioshock Infinite: Easily the most visually impressive game of the series in terms of art style & aesthetic, it's an absolute treat for the eyes and very immersive. The downside of this however is it paces a lot slower than the first 2 games and the default difficulty setting was stupidly easy, I didn't die until the last part of the game! It has the most creative enemy design of the game; Firemen, Zealots, Handymen and the Mechanized Patriots, which I thought was awesome. Sky hook combat was really fun. The story goes from a fever dream into a full blown acid trip, which is a bit hard to follow at times. I did enjoy the ending however, as I love a dark twist! DLC \"Burial at Sea\" was a great way to tie the trilogy together, the best part was experiencing Rapture before it becomes a giant meth den. You get to work with mad artist Sander Cohen, who was a brilliantly written villain from the first game. I also enjoyed the switchup with forced stealth gameplay from controlling Elizabeth. Overall a very impressive game to complete the series but I still think I enjoyed 2 the most. Only one glitch in this game but it was a frustrating one, I spawned into the floor of an elevator and couldn't progress or even reload an old save without it happening again. Found a weird solution through some old forums from back in 2015.\n\nBioshock: Most interesting characters of the series, mainly the villains (if you don't count some of them being reintroduced in the Infinite DLC). Game paces very well, short immersion into the world then straight into the action, loads you up with intuitive weps / powers as you go through. Level design was very well thought out. Final boss was a cool idea but way too easy which was kind of an anti climax. Remastered game crashed on me once and I also had a really annoying glitch involving the camera tool where an enemy didn't spawn and I couldn't progress any further. Google searched the glitch and found out it was a known issue (how the hell has this not been patched yet, in 2022?!?) I had to restart the whole chapter which was a massive waste of time.\n\nBioshock 2: The best game in the series IMO. Firstly, you get to play as a big daddy with charge drill. The default difficulty is way more ramped up than Bioshock 1, which is good because the first game was way too easy. The enemies will quickly overwhelm you and gun you down so you're forced to use the wide variety of weapon, plasmid, trap or environmental combos. The \"protect the little sister while she harvests\" element forces you into vulnerable situations where you have to use all these tricks to defend, bolt tripwires / plasmid traps etc instead of just running through each map blasting through everything like the first game. The \"Big Sister\" stalking you is also a thrilling element for the same reasons. The game also includes sections where you're hulking around on the ocean floor outside of Rapture, which I thought was really immersive. The DLC \"Minerva's Den\" was incredible, might even be my most enjoyable part of the game series. Remastered edition crashed on me twice so be prepared to do a lot of quicksaves.","timestamp_created":1648213095,"timestamp_updated":1648213095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112795537","author":{"steamid":"76561198849031059","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":2201,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2201,"last_played":1648208936},"language":"schinese","review":"对于海葬二部曲结局不是很满意，感觉伊丽莎白白忙活还搭上了自己小命，对游戏整体满意","timestamp_created":1648210137,"timestamp_updated":1648210137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112793480","author":{"steamid":"76561198029216361","num_games_owned":474,"num_reviews":54,"playtime_forever":565,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":176,"last_played":1648902031},"language":"english","review":"Overrated game.\nThe plot is nothing special. Multiverse plots overall are one of the cheapest sci-fi plots out there. The plot and ending is the same every time, no matter what you choose in what little choices there are. For a multiverse game and for a Bioshock game that is a missed opportunity. However I liked the part where they learned how to control the Songbird. The clue was very clever. \nPlasmi-- apologies-- Vigors are poorly explained. Where in Bioshock 1 and 2 Plasmids were integral part of the plot, in Infinite Vigors only exist, because it wouldn't be a Bioshock game without. The first time Vigors are introduced, the main character doesn't even question that maybe drinking a bottle of mysterious (and potentially poisonous) liquid found laying around might not be a good idea. I mean you either get super powers, get drunk, or die, a win-win-win situation. And, as mentioned previously, there are no moral decisions you have to make to acquire the fuel to use the powers. No \"should I kill this little girl and get all of the juice, or spare her but only get little\" choice. You just get it from the recharge station.\nAs a gameplay mechanic, Elisabeth is completely unnecessary. Her job is to pick locks and scour up ammo and health pickups, nothing that the player shouldn't be able to do themselves. There were times when she refused to pick locks, because she \"was busy\", just standing there.\n\nYliarvostettu peli.\nTarina ei ole mitään erikoista. Multiversumi-tarinat ovat muutenkin yleensä halvimpia tieteistarinoita. Juoni ja loppu ovat samat, valitsi sitten mitä tahansa niissä muutamissa valinnoissa. Multiversumi-peliksi ja Bioshock-peliksi tämä on hukattu mahdollisuus. Tosin pidin kohdasta, jossa päähenkilö oppii ohjaamaan Laululintua. Johtolangat olivat hyvin ovelia.\nPlasi-- anteeksi-- Vigorit on huonosti selitetty. Siinä missä Plasmidit olivat Bioshock 1:ssä ja 2:ssa oleellinen osa tarinaa, Infiniten Vigorit ovat olemassa vain, koska mitä olisi Bioshock ilman. Ensimmäisen kerran kun Vigorit esiintyvät, päähenkilö ei edes kyseenalaista, että oudon (ja kenties myrkillisen) litkun kulauttaminen kurkusta alas ei ehkä ole paras mahdollinen ajatus. Sitä joko saa supervoimat, itsensä humalaan tai heittää henkensä, voittoa joka tapauksessa. Lisäksi, kuten jo mainittu, ei ole minkäänlaista moraalista dilemmaa polttoaineen saamiseksi. Ei \"Tappaisinko pienen tytön saadakseni kaikki mehut, vai säästäisinkö hänet ja saisin vain vähän\" vaihtoehtoa. Sitä vain saa latausasemalta.\nPelillisesti Elisabet on täysin turha.

Öncelikle atmosfer ve karakterler ayakta alkışlanacak kadar iyi. BioShock'u BioShock yapan hikaye bu oyunda da çok iyi ama fazla geniş olduğundan hikayeyi çok iyi anlatamıyor. Oyunun sonu gerçekten etkileyici, gördüğüm en iyi 3 sondan biri desem abartmış olmam. Oynanış güzel ama bazı yerlerde biraz eksik hissettirebiliyor. Grafikler ve animasyonlar gerçekten çok iyi.

I really liked the time period in which the game takes place in. I like that you get to see city alive before it all goes to shit. \n\n[*]\tI really enjoyed the story. It might take a couple of play-throughs to fully understand. I like that the game explores concepts like religion, race, science, and the multiverse theory.\n\n[*]\tAwesome soundtrack. I like how the people of Columbia have heard these songs from the future through these tears and decided to do their own version.  \n\n[*]\tA nice selection of weapons from the time period. It’s a shame they didn’t add more. The weapons are also satisfying to use, especially the shotgun. \n\n[*]\tAwesome enemies like the motorized-patriot, the handy-man, and the fireman.  \n\n[*]\tI like some the new things they added like the sky-lines. I like how you can bring allies in using tears. \n[*]\tPlenty of collectables like voxaphones and kinetoscopes. \n\n[*]\tInteresting characters, like Elizabeth, Comstock, and Flint. \n\n[*]\tThroughout the game you will be using vigor’s in combat, which are basically plasmids. There are some pretty cool ones, like Bucking-bronco, shock Jockey, and procession.  \n\n[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]\n \n[*]\tYou are unable to revisit areas like you could in the first Bioshock.  \n\n[*]\tIt’s a shame you can’t see those modifications you purchase for your weapons.\n\n[*]\tIt’s lacking those scary moments which you got in the first Bioshock game. \n\n[*]\t There’s no research camera or inventing machine. \n\n[*]\tI wasn’t keen on the vox populi version of the weapons. There’s only one ammo type for each weapon. \n\n[*]\tI wish the game had more memorable psychos. I remember in the first Bioshock you had these awesome psychos like Dr Steinman and Sander Cohen. \n\n[*]\tI wasn’t keen on the idea of picking up clothes which had different perks. I much preferred the tonics from the first game. It would have been a nice to see what the clothes look like. \n[/list]\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\n \nI really enjoyed the story of Bioshock infinite; I prefer it to the original game. I liked the floating city of Columbia and the time period the game takes place in. I thought combat wasn’t as good as the previous games, but it was still good. The soundtrack is amazing.  It’s a shame the game didn’t have more gameplay features like the inventing machine, or research camera. The game is also lacking those memorable psychopaths the first game had. If you enjoyed playing the previous games or you like similar games like Prey or System Shock, then I highly recommend you play this game.   \n\n\n[h1]9/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1648042961,"timestamp_updated":1648043025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112695613","author":{"steamid":"76561198149561824","num_games_owned":112,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":1212,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1212,"last_played":1545215593},"language":"russian","review":"мегахарош.","timestamp_created":1648042002,"timestamp_updated":1648042002,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498321473598480225","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112686393","author":{"steamid":"76561198158728879","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1598,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1598,"last_played":1648027187},"language":"thai","review":"thats the best i ever seen and i need to say for my child in my future","timestamp_created":1648027324,"timestamp_updated":1648027324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5qmF2/8CedPurQM="}
