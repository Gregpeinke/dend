How this scored as high as it did is beyond me.\n\nTHE SPARKLEYNESS:\nYes the game looks amazing, it really does. So much so that there were times when you could just take all the scenery in and really try to immerse yourself into its fantasy world… that is until you realize that you run into ammo vending machines every 10 feet in the game, how convenient.\n\nTHE STORY:\nIt baffles me and hurt my brain to read all the “I beat the game but didn’t get the ending at all, explain it to me” threads on the forums within the first few weeks of this game’s release. Is this next generation really that dumb? I beat the game and fully understood the story along the way and the ending and to be honest it’s just a giant cop-out to sell more DLC for an alternate BioShock Infinite universes… which has already begun with the Burial at Sea DLC, what a shocker!\n\nGUN PLAY/VIGORS/GEAR:\nThe gunplay itself is pretty standard and ho-hum, nothing ground breaking or revolutionary as some people claim it to be. Each weapon gets the basic upgrades you would expect in the forms of increases damage and ammo clip increases. Most of the mobs in the game are just bullet sponges and eat up half a clip of ammo before biting the dust.\n\nThe Vigor powers, while looking cool… are all pretty much the same (including their secondary functions) with the exception of two or three of them. Honestly once you get Bucking Bronco and Undertow 90% of the mobs in the game become a joke and you can just waltz on into the end game credits.\n\nGear is actually fairly well varied and can make for some interesting choice combinations which can be downright overpowering. Burning Halo, Ammo Advantage, Last Man Standing, Vampire’ Embrace made me nigh invincible as I plodded through the game firing off Bucking Bronco and the Shotgun.\n\nTEARS/RAILS:\nThe “tears” that you can create with Elizabeth are actually pretty cool and one thing that can quickly change a combat encounter from being a dire one to a winnable one. \n\nThe rails you get to ride with the skyhook are straight forward and easy to navigate with the throttle button which makes riding the rails almost too easy. In the few instances where you actually get to ride the rails you’re again almost nigh invincible unless you’re in combat with a Handyman. The rails along with the tears are feel-good gimmicks that try and spice up a fairly boring FPS experience.\n\nLACK OF BOSSES:\nThere are no boss enemies to be encountered in the game, The Handymen, Firemen and Mechanized-Patriots are not boss type enemies… although it is debatable that Lady Comstock is the first and only boss you encounter about half way through the game. \n\nThere is no big one on one show down with the Song Bird chasing you throughout the game, nada-nothing. Even the final battle in the game is just a few waves of random generic enemies you’ve already encountered, nothing special in the slightest. There is so much wasted potential. On my initial play through I literally turned corners and entered into areas in the game where I was sure expecting something bad ass or OMG’y or EPIC’y would happen with some major boss battle… but nothing.\n\nPUZZLES:\nThe puzzles are a joke and the few that you do encounter require you to go do the following.\n\nA)\tFind puzzle.\nB)\tContinue on with game/exploring find key or code for puzzle.\nC)\tBack track halfway across the map back to A.\nD)\tClick on the puzzle, get loot.\n\nThere are also one or two instances where the puzzles will require you to shoot A with a specific Vigor to claim D. There is literally no skill or thought involved with the BioShock Infinite puzzles and they feel more like an afterthought. \n\nMULTIPLAYER/CO-OP:\nThere isn’t any, which is a shame because this game had a lot of potential for two player CO-OP.\n\n1999 MODE/CLASH IN THE CLOUDS:\nSure people will cry about 1999 Mode and say that is where the true hardcore FPS experience is, but the last time I checked this was 2013 and I expect more bang and oomph for my FPS buck rather than ramping up mob hit points/bullet spongeyness 500% and calling it a game mode when it’s just cheap filler and another gimmick in an already gimmick filled game.\n\nClash in the Clouds was released as one of the first DLC’s for BioShock Infinite, I don’t have much of a comment on it because I didn’t bother to install it or Burial at Sea… and I own the Season Pass. Should tell you how much replayability this FPS game has, which is none. \n\nMY VERDICT:\nI personally would rate this 2 out of 5, 5 being awesome GOTY material. I suck right?\n\nFlame me all you want, call me a Call of Duty fan boy all you want, call me ignorant, etc. It doesn’t bother me in the slightest. I bought BioShock Infinite, completed it the first time in a little over 8 hours and found over 80% of the Vox recordings on my first play through. The game is not difficult or challenging, maybe it wasn’t meant to be, I don’t know. What I do know is that it didn’t take me a ton of FPS skill to complete and I didn’t get any satisfaction of a job well done when the final credits were left to roll.\n\nThanks for reading.","timestamp_created":1385957880,"timestamp_updated":1390306179,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520057260990142822","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7875416","author":{"steamid":"76561198090272403","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":302,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":302,"last_played":1386002959},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1385957197,"timestamp_updated":1385957197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504727602005004883","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7875147","author":{"steamid":"76561198018121116","num_games_owned":161,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":517,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1385955392},"language":"english","review":"This game was fucking awsome!! epic story epic gameplay epic turn of events. every one should play this game.","timestamp_created":1385955536,"timestamp_updated":1385955536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7874925","author":{"steamid":"76561198012831206","num_games_owned":240,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1080,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":562,"last_played":1498881883},"language":"english","review":"I love the game but having no multiple save files with its terrible autosave design is a pain, why can't I have 2 characters going for different specializations ): and why do I lose 40m of playtime because of it? idk and I don't think the devs will explain and if they did I could imagin them dodging the question :/ and until they fix that I'll rate it a \"no\" or better yet a 7/10","timestamp_created":1385954218,"timestamp_updated":1385954218,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477417916059494019","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7874703","author":{"steamid":"76561198077897098","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":868,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":508,"last_played":1388023955},"language":"english","review":"this game is a true work of art.if you have the pc to run it its definately worth buying.","timestamp_created":1385952582,"timestamp_updated":1385952582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7874294","author":{"steamid":"76561198000905053","num_games_owned":1046,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":1356,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":714,"last_played":1451869413},"language":"french","review":"Jeu incroyable, avec une ambiance immersive et une histoire passionnante...

Unfortunately delving more into the story reveals this is nothing close to the real Bioshock series we've seen in the past years.\n The whole complex multiverse universe thingy plus the awfully complicated ending were totally disappointing.\n\n Gameplay:\n No weapon wheel ?\n Why was the weapon wheel returned in the latest DLC ?\n Wasn't it a really bad idea to remove the weapon wheel from the first place ?!?! For a real Bioshock nutfan like myself, YES IT WAS !\n Very limited types of enemies. You fight the same enemies over and over but with different uniforms. Don't expect variety as in previous titles.\n Nothing beats a carefully planned fight against a big daddy !!\n Using the sky rails was a HUGE AMAZING ADDITION, but not enough with all the removed classical Bioshock stuff.\n No more hacking ?!?! No more lock picking ?!?! Lousy choice of weapons and VERY FEW USELESS weapon upgrades compared to previous titles.\n I didn't even realize there were side quests !\n I personally believe this game should have been titled \"Booker Dewitt\" instead of \"Bioshock Infinite\", since it relates to nothing Bioshocky.\n\n Visuals:\n Beautiful in every possible aspect. \n I wish the gameplay was as good as the graphics.\n\n Sound:\n Amazing.\n I SO wish the gameplay was as good as the sound. \n\n Over all score ? 5/10\n Highly disappointing to a real Bioshock fan like myself who owns both previous Bioshock titles on both

Bioshock Infinite traz uma mecânica de gameplay excelente, é fluída e fácil de entender. Traz de volta o esquema de habilidades dos antigos Bioshocks, agora chamadas de vigores, que ajudam muito em batalhas contra um número grande de inimigos, e também contra os inimigos mais fortes. A variedade de armas é considerável, e todas as armas tem um estilo próprio. Você assume o controle de Booker DeWitt, e os primeiros 30 minutos são calmos e com momentos lindos, como a chegada em Columbia. Columbia, a cidade dos céus, a qual possui visuais estonteantes, mesmo se tratando de um jogo com gráficos cartunizados. Mas a partir do momento que você conhece Elizabeth, as coisas mudam. Elizabeth é A PERSONAGEM do jogo: é carismática, cativante, e não é como outros parceiros em jogos, os quais são extremamente burros e acabam só te atrapalhando, pois Elizabeth sabe se virar em batalhas, e na maioria das vezes te ajuda, com munições, sais, moedas e abrindo fendas para te ajudar com kits médicos, e até mesmo turrets. A história do jogo é fantástica e aborda um tema não muito fantasioso, pois a religiosidade ignorante é um mal que existe em nosso mundo. Mas tirando esse lado, a história é de longe uma das melhores que já vi, pois é original, e traz uma imersibilidade incrível. Um grande exemplo disso é quando Elizabeth é capturada por Songbird, e você fica simplismente desesperado para resgatá-la, é algo fora do comum nos jogos de hoje. A trilha sonora do jogo é simplismente sensacional, com músicas calmas e que contribuem ainda mais para imersão no jogo. O final , apesar de parecer confuso, não é. É bem direto e explicativo, mas nos deixa com um gostinho de quero mais, pois, ao meu ver, o ÚNICO ponto fraco do jogo, é a campanha que foi curta, pois com oito horas de jogo já dá pra fechar ele. Mas isso não muda nem um pouco meu pensamento sobre o jogo, é recomendadíssimo pra qualquer um, gostando de fps ou não, pois o ápice do jogo é sua história. 10/10","timestamp_created":1385928230,"timestamp_updated":1424028708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7869370","author":{"steamid":"76561197993933961","num_games_owned":148,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1487,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":697,"last_played":1401902199},"language":"russian","review":"Это совершенно безумная, невероятно красивая и очень увлекательная игра.

Also towards the end the game just felt like it was dragging on a bit with overexcessive apocalyptic horror elements.","timestamp_created":1385927009,"timestamp_updated":1385927009,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7869031","author":{"steamid":"76561197960776211","num_games_owned":250,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1816,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1727,"last_played":1400879938},"language":"english","review":"Assuming you have played the other 2.\n\nIts classic Bioshock in terms of its control and the score/voice acting is again the best youll see in any scripted game.\n\nThe story this time though is a little hard work as it involves a little bit of parallel universes and without spoiling the story in any way the second you see this happening or get an inclining of it, things start to happen with very little explanation leaving you to either search for the answers in the game and listen through the sequences, this of course you will do as its bioshock and this is the whole nature of the game.\n\nPlasmids make a return but are called something else and you get the usual weapons  . . or equivalents(and not too far fetched) for 1912 for when the game was set.\n\nYou get the upgrades through the vendors like in the last one.\n\nAs for the game, it plays point to point like the others with occasional crossover as you go back to get things the quest giver asks you to do but it doesnt do this that much and lets you get deeper into the floating city which is the backgrop to this game. Fighting is like the other 2 relying on you to combine your special abilities with the weapons you pick up. My only complaint is the combo nature of the weapons and 'vigours'(plasmids) there doesnt seem to be for the elite mobs a best course of action. \n\nMy only complaint - \nThis game if you play it on hard, is hard and gets frustrating. Its hard not becuase of the amount of enemys or anything like that but the amount of damage you do to enemys and their numbers. As i said above there are no specific combos (or none that i find are effective enough) so everything is a mass grind. If you get killed enemies get some health back, you lose cash and if ur down to the last weapons in the area or the ones you have are just trash, it gets really really annoying. Too many times did i run into areas with a volley gun and a pistol with barely any ammo, use all of the ammo around the arena it creates, and then have to fight one of the bigger enemy tank like enemies with 0 ammo, a melee wep and terrrible guns. The guns simply dont do much damage even when they are fully upgraded. Even though i found ways with the vigors and the guns i had, it just took too long and if you died . . .  sigh, too repetative and didnt place any skill towards the user only gave them one option just mass guns, mass shoot mass find ammo and shoot some more. \n\nThere are things in the area for you to use to help but its too slow. Ill always come back to halo here with the nubCombo. It was perfect, it gave a good balance to really good players and casuals alike with the 1 second switch nature to land the shots or be killed (legendary style) bioshock needs something like this or very particular ways of killing enemies which the game could control the mechanic of aquiring the needs to do it. \n\nThe other 2 games had an element of horror in them which is missing from this game. In rapture the story soon turned towards finding out why everyone went bonkers! In this game its set up to have you always in a hurry, to get to places fast, im not saying the game rushes you cos got it doesnt but it trys to give you a sense or urgency in what you are doing which i think is really really good this time around as in the last games you crept into every room searching the corners . . .you kind of do that in this one but this time to get loot! Its a great tone changer from the other 2 making it seem like a differnt game but at the same time having those elelements where you clearly know its a bioshock game.\n\nSo with that said, everything is the game is fluid and a 10/10 from me which i rarely give to many games (i think i gave all of the bio's 10/10 as the experience is unlike anything else). Im currently downloading the dlc which seems to be taking forever, but this game is well worth it. I missed this game on launch and only bought it now on the deals week and not only that, this game is best played in one sitting so you practically need a day depending on your skill if you do what i do and search every corner, listen to every audi file, interact with all the interacts and fully listen to the story and take the game in.\n\nExcellent game, and for under £7 from the store at the moment of writing you are silly if you dont have it in ur collection","timestamp_created":1385926905,"timestamp_updated":1385928766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503834009170532227","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7868890","author":{"steamid":"76561198044031157","num_games_owned":136,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1075,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":460,"last_played":1415188991},"language":"thai","review":"ＤＥＥＰ♂ＤＡＲＫ♂ＦＡＮＴＡＳＹ","timestamp_created":1385926451,"timestamp_updated":1385926451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580419540405273438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7868857","author":{"steamid":"76561197970667010","num_games_owned":548,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":544,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":542,"last_played":1395521996},"language":"german","review":"Am Angang wusste ich nicht so recht was ich von dem Spiel halten soll.\nDas Setting war wirklich nicht so meins (dachte ich).... doch dann kam Elisabeth..\n\nDas Spiel wurde nach kurzer Zeit spannend und Actiongeladen.\nMeine kleine Partnerin treibt die Story voran und zeigt immer tiefergehende Fasetten die zuweilen etwas paradox wirken.\n\nAm Ende fügt sich alles zu einem dann doch verständlichen Gesamtbild zusammen.\n\nEin Meisterwerk","timestamp_created":1385926324,"timestamp_updated":1385926324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7868535","author":{"steamid":"76561198073925199","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":5458,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1966,"last_played":1530990679},"language":"english","review":"From riding sky zip-lines to shooting enemies with magical powers, this game has it!

Es will an manchen Ecken mehr sein als es wirklich ist und verschluckt sich an seiner eigenen versuchten Komplexität. An vielen Stellen merkt man, dass man versucht hat ein bisschen System Shock 2 zurück zu bekommen aber es einfach nicht mehr in das \"Streamlining\" von modernen FPS reinpasst. Die Wiederholungen von Levels soll eine offene Spielwelt suggerieren, die aber in tatsächlich sehr linear verläuft. Die ständige Munitionsknappheit ist auch sehr gedrungen. Man kann einfach viel zu wenig tragen und muss ständig die Waffe wechseln, was es unsinnig macht, irgendwas aufzubessern. Die ständige Bedrohung, die von diesem Umstand getragen werden sollte, enfällt dadurch völlig. Man ist mehr ein Revolverheld als ein Kämpfer ums Überleben. In SS2 funktionierte das noch, da Munition selten war. Das Konzept funktioniert aber in modernen AAA-Titeln nicht, bwz. wird nicht so angenommen. Die Vorgänger, Bioschock 1 + 2, gingen in da cleverer vor und wirkten nicht so gezwungen.\nEin anderes Problem ist das Gegnerdesign. Die stärkeren Gegner sind nur nervig weil unfair. Durch das lineare Leveldesign sind die Begegnung mit diesen aber unausweichlich. Man soll Respekt und vielleicht auch ein wenig Angst vor diesen Gegnern haben, aber genau das Gegenteil passiert. Mit den Möglichkeiten einer viel offeneren und dynamischeren Spielwelt sowie den verdeckten Vorgehen hätte das funktionieren können, so ist es nur Ballast.
