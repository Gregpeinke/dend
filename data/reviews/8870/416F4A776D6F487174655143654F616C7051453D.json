The characters are very well developed and interesting, the level designs are gorgeous and the gameplay is brilliant. You would be fighting your enemies with deadly weapons, riding the Sky-lines like rollercoasters to strike a [i] \"Death from Above\" [/i] scene on enemies and you would also be spending your Salts on Vigors that can give you powerful advantages on stronger enemies. You are always protected with a human defense shield that will break before you even lose your HP while taking damage from enemies. You can upgrade yourself, along with weapons and vigors, to make things easier. These things in gameplay are rather fitting to become enjoyable. \n\nThe story is simply fantastic with a lot of plot twists to encounter. Prejudice, such as racism, sexism, nationalism, and religion, are all put directly in front of you, whether you like it or not. Playing as Booker DeWitt, you are hired to rescue a mysterious girl called Elizabeth who can open Tears for you to help you in combat. Opening Tears will give you a stack of medical kits or salts, a \"Patriot\" robot or gun turret ally and a wall for cover. The combat system is very amazing where you can do as much killing as possible. \n\nSoaring among the clouds of Columbia is a truly amazing experience to witness in BioShock Infinite. I would always recommend it. \n\nSeriously a masterpiece from Irrational Games. \n[b] Personal rating: 10/10 [/b]","timestamp_created":1531238022,"timestamp_updated":1531238181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43446541","author":{"steamid":"76561198291593191","num_games_owned":191,"num_reviews":64,"playtime_forever":1016,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1001,"last_played":1592557184},"language":"english","review":"+","timestamp_created":1531236369,"timestamp_updated":1608831879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"43445965","author":{"steamid":"76561198035804186","num_games_owned":99,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3187,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2956,"last_played":1576886042},"language":"german","review":"BioShock ist meiner Meinung nach die beste Spieleserie aller Zeiten und wird mit BioShock Infinite und deren beiden DLCs Burial at Sea 1 und 2 zu einem zugleich genialen und würdigem Ende geführt, das einem lange in Erinnerung bleibt.

Вперед к небесам [/h1]\n\n[h1] Предыстория [/h1]\n\nЗахари Хейлом Комсток в 1893 году, имея связи в конгрессе США, для Всемирной выставки создает воздушный город под названием Колумбия, чтобы показать другим странам мощь и технологическое совершенство Америки. Колумбия изначально была частью США, но со временем отношения между конгрессом и властями города ухудшились. В 1901 году, наперекор желанию американского правительства, Колумбия жестко расправилась с восстанием в Пекине, показав, что город в небе хорошо вооружен и может наносить катастрофические удары в любой точки мира. Американский конгресс потребовал вернуть Колумбию в состав и под власть США, однако в ответ было объявлено, что небесный город выходит из состава Соединенных Штатов и скрывается в неизвестном направлении. Освободишь из под гнета извне, Комсток полностью захватывает власть в городе и превращает \"город-выставку\" в теократическое полицейское государство. Под руководством Комстока в Колумбии сложилось псевдохристианское утопическое общество, которое поклоняется самому Комстоку считая его пророком и святым. В Колумбии можно наблюдать жесткие вспышки расизма и элитизма, которые провозглашены институционально. Представители расовых и национальных меньшинств представляют для Колумбии лишь дешевую рабочую силу подвергаясь жестокому угнетению.\n\n[h1] Основной сюжет [/h1]\n\nВ 1912 году частного детектива Букера Девитта доставляют на остров с маяком недалеко от побережья штата Мэн двое эксцентричных заказчиков, близнецы Роберт и Розалинда Лютес (двое ученных, которые экспериментировали с пространством и временем в небесном городе) поручают привести им девушку по имени Элизабет в обмен за оплату всех его долгов. Букера доставляют к маяку, в котором находится кресло-капсула и с помощью подсказок Лютесов поднимается в утопический город. Из-за клейма на руке главного героя, Букер вступает в конфликт с властями города, так как AD - некий символ \"Ложного Пастыря\", который, по мнению Комстока и всех жителей города уничтожит Колумбию.

I am really happy to see the story is changed after the trailers and demos coming out, it seems to focus more on the characters than what happened in Columbia.\n\nThe game does try to make a mind blowing ending, it does try to say something about oppression, but I think what really hits me is far more than those. It's about choices and regrets.\nThe story shows that the protagonist is a normal man, but at the same time an asshole, in every possible ways. And that's why the ending is so powerful, it doesn't just blow me away, it makes me think about all those regrettable decisions, and what kind of person I am, or I can be. \n\nI think the best kind of game is which really makes you look back on youself, think about your life choices and who you are, and that's what I can never get away from Bioshock Infinite. Along with the stunning visual arts, great performance, and those couldn't be greater use of songs and soundtracks,  I think Bioshock Infinite is the best one in the trilogy, and one of the best games I've ever experienced.\n\nAlso, there do are plotholes, but that doesn't hide it from it's greatness.

The story isn't my favorite, since it's really confusing and has some plot holes. The ending also feels like a bit of a cop out when it uses [spoiler] \"constants and variables\" to explain why some things remain the same in each parallel universe despite that going against the idea of infinite different worlds, hence the title. [/spoiler] Despite those issues, the story is entertaining and I like the characters, and Columbia is just as engaging a world to explore in the clouds as Rapture was in the sea. What really makes up for the lacking areas in the story is BioShock Infinite's gameplay. The guns and vigors are super fun to use and can be combined to make deadly combos. It feels great stunning an enemy with shock jockey and landing a headshot with the handcannon, or possessing a turret for a temporary ally while you're sending out crows to wreak havoc on a group of enemies and finishing them off using the carbine. Undertow is probably among my favorites for pushing enemies off platforms and bringing them to you so you can get in a few meatshots with the shotgun. The skylines also enhance the combat significantly, and are useful for making a getaway or ambushing an enemy with the skyline strike. Elizabeth helps too by giving you salts, health and ammo during gameplay. She gives you what you need just often enough not to feel like it's making the game too easy, so she provides some assistance while also not allowing the player to rely on her. If you're a fan of first person shooter games, don't pass this one up. It's a great time with remarkable and satisfying gameplay and a gripping albeit flawed story. The graphics, music, and presentation make the whole package that much better as well.
