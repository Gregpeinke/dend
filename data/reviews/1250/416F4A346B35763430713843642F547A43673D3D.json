The game brings out all the classic, well-known weapons of shooters into the mix. Killing Floor revolves and works around how many players are in the game (1-6) and each wave of enemies increases in numbers the further you get. The more people that are in the server, the harder the final Patriarch boss is to kill.\n\nThe game has many classes and plenty of characters to choose from and you can level them up from 0-6 as you play them more frequently. If you're looking for a game that has all sorts of classes that master in almost any type of weapon out there, Killing Floor is the game for you. Perfect for when your only objective is to just kill things with your friends!","timestamp_created":1306967446,"timestamp_updated":1306967446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.62765955924987793","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"952341","author":{"steamid":"76561197982926158","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":404,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":404,"last_played":1324972800},"language":"german","review":"Da Gewaltgeminderte Version ,letzte Dreck ,ergo woanders kaufen !!!!

The game origins from a mod for Unreal Tornament 2003 (another game I highly recommend for its awesomness) and thus runs on the older Unreal Engine. This does not detract from the game itself as it still offers hours of fun and possible fear! Also, it is set in England. Which automatically means the characters have strong Cockney accents.

It's a first person co-op wave-based survival shooter with a persistent perks system. Basically, you kill zombies, and by killing zombies you level up that method of zombie killing to assist your zombie killing abilities. Weapons and cash do not carry over from one game to another, but levels do. After the final wave, the Patriarch appears, which is a zombie that hits hard, does lots of damage quickly with a minigun, has a rocket launcher, and can even turn invisible when he needs to heal. After either your squad or the patriarch dies, you play a new map and start over again.\n\nThe best part is that the game is updated frequently, so there's always something new to attempt.","timestamp_created":1304236029,"timestamp_updated":1304236029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47486037015914917","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"532228","author":{"steamid":"76561197971683527","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":5968,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5192,"last_played":1450753785},"language":"english","review":"do it","timestamp_created":1304227192,"timestamp_updated":1304227192,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"686593","author":{"steamid":"76561197975477936","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":1976,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1909,"last_played":1373326240},"language":"english","review":"If you got some spare cash this kicks the crap out of L4D for fun factor.
