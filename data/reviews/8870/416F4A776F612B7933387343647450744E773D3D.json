Just when I was starting to give up hope on triple A titles, Bioshock Infinite came and blew my mind. The gameplay mechanics do get to be a bit stale by the end of the game, and the FPS combat is definitely not the best I've played, but it's still quite good. What really makes this game stand out is an utterly fantastic story though. The characters are fully realized people, not just carboard cuttouts spitting out contrived reasons to shoot the next baddy. Plus the subversive and satirical political undertones that run all throughout the setting of the game really added a nice layer of high-brow comedy to the whole thing. If you just want a COD clone, then this game probably isn't for you, but if you're crying out for an FPS that you can actually find compelling, then this is your ticket right here. \n\n10/10 Every game should take notes on the story and characters in this game.","timestamp_created":1425515464,"timestamp_updated":1425515492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14737268","author":{"steamid":"76561198116010504","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1106,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":235,"last_played":1448001624},"language":"english","review":"If the name \"BioShock Infinite\" was a reference to the infinite amount of lag my computer, then yes, \"BioShock Infinite\" caused an infinite amount of lag on my computer.  I would blame this on my computer being a nerd and not working out enough, but it seemed to handle the previous two BioShocks pretty well, along with Arma 3 and DAY FUCKING Z.  Now while I appreciate games taking me to new settings in their sequels, it seemed like, where \"BioShock\" & \"Bioshock 2\" had a cohesive theme of a psuedo-post wwII underwater city with dialogue and set pieces that added to this idea, \"BioShock InfiniLag\" just took me to \"old sky city\" where things are \"old\" and people are racist.  I did enjoy the social commentary and felt it fit right in with current events OF THE 1970s but at least they weren't telling me that the bad guys were bad \"just 'cuz.\"  Gameplay looked like someone had played \"BioShock\" and said \"I know how to make this better,\" but instead of going off and developing \"BioShock 2,\" they suffered a stroke and came back to work a few months later, not knowing that someone HAD made \"BioShock 2\" but no one had the heart to tell them that \"BioShock 2\" was made, so they let the stroke victim continue on working.

Když ale bylo na vyzkoušení demo Bioshocku 1, řekl jsem si proč ne? A po slibném úvodu, \"Would You Kindly\" frázi a počátku příchodu do Rapture jsem koupil celou trilogii. Kdo by čekal, že se to hned po Mass Effect universu stane mým druhým nejoblíbenějším herním pískovištěm? Na kompletní zrecenzování by bylo potřeba vzít všechny díly po pořadě (možná se k tomu časem dostanu), takže v krátkosti alespoň o Infinite. Jedná se v podstatě o klasické FPS v mírně rozšířeném koridoru, které je obohacené o používání Vigorů (jak jsou tady nazývány speciální schopnosti). Nečekejte tedy žádný stealth, skrývání se nebo časování pohybu stráží. Jede se jedna velká akce od začátku až do konce. Překvapivě jsem si ji ale po celou dobu užíval i přesto, že FPS hry nejsou za každou cenu můj nej žánr. Jedním z hlavních důvodů je dávkování tempa a wow momentů. Začátek hry se tak odehrává na malé loďce na moři, abyste vzápětí pomocí jakéhosi křesla přistáli v Columbii (obdoba Rapture posazená do oblak místo do akvária). Vaším úkolem je najít jakousi dívku a splatit dluh. Cože? Začátek a už máte dluhy? Z čeho a jak? Chmurné myšlenky se rozhodnete zahnat na místní tombole, kde se to vše ale teprve rozjede a ještě zhorší. Na nějaké dluhy nemáte pomyšlení, protože právě od tohoto momentu začíná, řekl bych, druhá a již o dost akčnější fáze hry, která je tím zábavnější, čím vyšší máte nastavenou obtížnost (na easy to fakt nehrajte, základ je normal a pro ty, co mají odjeté předchozí dva díly klidně i hard, nebojte 1999 je tu taky a to už je pořádná výzva). Když se tak nějak probojujete, kam je potřeba ocitnete se na místě, které samo o sobě nahání hrůzu. Tady si sice nezastřílíte, ale o napětí tu nouze nebude. A pak? Pak už přijde to, kvůli čemu se tuhle hru vyplatí rozjet. Nejhezčí a z paměti nejhůře odstranitelný pár očí v herní historii. Samozřejmě že Elizabeth nesedne každému, ale bezpochyby se jedná o velice silnou osobnost. Spolu s úchvatným dabingem Courtnee Draper, kdy se budete doslova rochnit v jakékoliv větě, kterou z jejích úst vyslechnete, tu tak máte kombinaci, která Vás u hry udrží až do konce. Že jsem trochu neobjektivní? Pokud Vás Liz nevezme, pak z toho asi opravdu bude nezáživná hra, kde jen střílíte, házíte vigory, posloucháte uřvané tele \"Booker catch\" a tak nějak už chcete vidět titulky. OK i tak se to dá vzít. Pokud se Vám ale přihodí první scénář, vězte že hru si užijete až do konce. Konce, který snad ani zamotanější být nemohl. Cokoli z něj vyzrazovat pochopitelně nebudu ale pokud lze na YT dohledat video o teorii konce, mající stopáž několika desítek minut, je jasné, že na nějaké \"navždy spolu, všechno dobrý\" můžete zapomenout. Že máte málo? A co DLC? O co že v něm jde? Zjednodušeně řečeno se první dva díly spojí s třetím v mohutný herní svět, kdy především Burial at Sea Ep.2, (kde hrajete za...no zjistěte si to sami), s úplně jinou hratelností a postupem jednotlivými levely působí velice svěže. A když na úplném finále vlastně zjistíte jak se to celé má s prvním dílem, dojde Vám, že jste právě měli tu čest s jednou z nejoriginálnějších FPS trilogií, která si místo po boku herních legend jednoznačně zaslouží. Všechna čest Kenu Levinovi a jeho týmu. Děkujeme.\n\n+Elizabeth\n+Silný příběh s důrazem na singleplayer, mulťák tady nehledejte a je to jenom dobře\n+Sky-Hook\n+Vigory\n\n-Občas repetitivní (což ale FPS bývají, zde okořeněno právě příběhem)\n-Díky konverzi z konzole je nemožné měnit mezi režimem běhu a chůze.

The gameplay is more than made up for by the story though, and I remember just wanting to get through a battle to find out what new plottwist the developers were going to throw at me.  \n\n9.5/10","timestamp_created":1425163626,"timestamp_updated":1425163626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14699849","author":{"steamid":"76561198004351979","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":727,"last_played":1419858778},"language":"koreana","review":"대다수 분들이 추천하는 게임이나, 나는 별로다. 화면은 아름답지만 만화같고, 이상하게 손맛이 별로다. 결말을 보려고 울며 겨자먹기로 꾸역꾸역 진행하여 마지막을 봤다. 바이오쇼크 1편도 하다가 때려쳤는데 바이오쇼크가 안맞는 사람에게는 별로네요","timestamp_created":1425163280,"timestamp_updated":1425163280,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14698690","author":{"steamid":"76561198083615980","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":2899,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":517,"last_played":1612797589},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock infinite a story about a man seeking a girl to wipe away the dept he owes, but as the story continues you will be sitting at the end sliently wishing there was any other way but the question you may ask is \"will the circle ever be broken?\" and to that i say \"god only knows, what i would do\"","timestamp_created":1425158783,"timestamp_updated":1425158783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14697469","author":{"steamid":"76561198174505018","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":455,"last_played":1466817138},"language":"english","review":"The game functions exactlly like the new Duke Nukem.

Indulge me, if you please. \n\n\t“Our followup to Bioshock will take place not below the swells of the mid-century sea, but above the clouds of industrial/spheres-of-influence era America. Set against the backdrop of a sky-bound cityscape, players will navigate a world formed by isolationist, fundamentalist ideologies, where the balance between ultra-rich and despondently poor, the corrupt and the desperate, God's chosen and God's untouchables, is about to be thrown into upheaval. The player, along with their mysterious and supernaturally-powerful CPU partner, must navigate not only the bobbing, sun-drenched land-above-land of Americana placed before them, but witness the human cost of prosperity, and participate in the dramatic renvisioning of a city set apart from, yet steeped in, the complex beast that is American idealism.”\n\n\tI mean, fine, it's not “Soap, the terrorists have already won unless you press 'F' to pay respects,” but to someone who is inclined towards a more story-driven game (and who loved the 'Shocks before it) Infinite sounds like a natural and appropriately “heady” progression for the series. \n\n\tSadly, while the art design is more than up to the challenge set up by this 'pitch,' the rest of the game is, well, a milk-toast mishmash of Bioshock 1's ideas and story twists, and an alarmingly stripped-down game world from what has come before from this studio. \n\n\tFirst, this game is beautiful. I loved Bioshock's art direction, and this, with the focus on beaux-arts architecture and turn-of-the-century design, is another gorgeous game world to get lost in. Not only that, but the player is allowed to simply wander about in certain areas in the game, playing carnival games, watching beach-side dancing, or fireworks above the skyline. It's beautiful, and quiet moments like these make the game feel more like an experience than the objective-laced steamroller that it actually is. \n\n\tWith that out of the way, it's difficult to express how disappointed in this game I was. Bioshock Infinite marks the first game in memory where I was genuinely exhausted with dispatching enemies. When the story is interesting, the characters are...serviceable, and the game world is gorgeous, I don't want to dispatch a standard ten enemies in each room, I want to progress the story. Infinite seems to realize this too, which is the only explanation of why the gun-play is so dull, repetitive, and...obligatory-feeling. The game utterly fails to make a legitimate case for you, the hero of our story, indiscriminately mauling untold legions of police officers and aging veteran soldiers. Sure, there are some robots, insane fanatics, or...or...or ghosts (19th-century spiritualism my eye, Ken Levine—a poorly padded-out scavenger hunt is what it is, you can call it that) that make a modicum of sense for their bloodlust and your wildly vicious actions, but it's impossible to shake the feeling that the creators of this game put an emphasis on violence not because it made sense within the world and the story they stitched together, but because horrific acts of close-up, slow-mo, unblinking savagery are simply what you're supposed to do in video games. Nevermind justification, nevermind story/character integrity, nevermind that the frequency and intricacy of the violence borders on farcical, it looks cool and it's integral because something-something-industry-standards, and our game would only be two hours long without it.  \n\n\tDon't get me wrong, Bioshock 1 & 2 were both super violent, but those games at least gave an effort to justify your actions. Splicers are insane, they're running beast-mode, and they've lost their humanity. Here in Bioshock Infinite? I dunno man, but isn't it badass how you can throw a baseball up in the air and turn a police officer's face into meatloaf with his buddy's weapon in one smooth cutscene? Isn't it badass that you can bound across the map, grip some working stiff's gut in your skyhook, grind his pancreas up, and throw him, like, ten yards while all his buddies just watch? Isn't it badass? Why haven't you bought the Clash-in-the-Clouds DLC yet? \n\n\tThe complex themes that are put forward in the first few scenes of this game are distilled down to a roller-coaster ride that basically says, “racism sure was a historical thing that was bad, huh?” Isolationism, exceptionalism, religious leadership and extremism, class, racial, and social unrest, military deification--every single interesting theme in this game is boiled down to an 8th-grade social studies textbook blurb that offends no one, challenges nothing, and brings nothing to the table except those stupid skyhook melee kills. \n\n\tNevermind that the (now expected) 'twist' in 'Shock games is here in full, and completely dumps everything that the game wanted to say in exchange for a Christopher Nolan-worthy complexity that derails anything that the first eight hours of this game built up to.\n\n\tAnyway, this review makes it sound like I hate Bioshock Infinite. \n\n\tI dislike Bioshock Infinite the same way I dislike a book by a talented and proven author that only amounts to an 'OK' weekend read. It's not pulp, to be sure, but the disappointment that stems from what should have been a 'book-of-the-decade' stings a lot more than some shlocky Star Wars novelization that I had no real hope for anyway. You can see the possibilities, what the media wants you to feel, but its goals are much higher than its reach, and that's less 'hate,' and more 'disappointment.' Bioshock Infinite had a long development time, some of the best brains behind it, huge budget, proven track-record, fantastic world...and it's 'blah.' That's the bit I hate.\n\n\t Do I recommend this game, Steam? Honestly, with three other great 'Shocks on Steam, this one should be your last pick. In that sense, no. No, Steam. I don't recommend this game.

But it's not just a pretty game the story is very good and has alot of depth albiet a confusing story but it will keep you thinking about it even after you finish the game.\n\n And as for the gameplay, the gunplay is quite satisfying but note that it is very graphic and gory but the gunplay does get rather tedious and seem out of place at times, the looting aspect of the game is quite satisfying too, having to search for food, money, ammo, and the collectibles and tonics and even looting safes. You also have the useful companion Elizibeth by your side to occationally keep you stocked on ammo and health and talk to you about various things relating to the story and enviroment. Also Bioshock does have a bit of replayability as when you complete the game you unlock a hardcore mode called \"1999 mode\" which is quite a bit harder to say the least.\n\n[h1] Conclusion. [/h1]\n\nSo in conclusion Bioshock infinite is a very good game to say the least. Beatiful graphics and world that's also deep and rich with life and story. Great deep story that keeps you thinking and isn't too confusing.
