I wanted to explore every inch of this beautiful world. The combat was good, but got very repetitive, especially when I was so into the story, just wanting to get to what happened next, but Irrational did a fine job of building the story to where every next step there was a even further step.

Esta vez, no estaremos dentro de Rapture, la ciudad submarina de los dos primeros Bioshock, sino en Columbia, una ciudad flotante en las nubes que se separó de los EEUU. Ciudades distintas, con un nexo en común.\nLa historia va sobre un hombre, Booker DeWitt (en esta entrega de Bioshock, vemos el rostro y sabemos el nombre real del protagonista), que acepta un trabajo para liquidar sus deudas. Así nos veremos en ese nexo en común de todos los Bioshock: el faro. A partir de ahí, se desarrolla una historia que gira en torno a recuperar a Elizabeth, una cautiva en una torre vigilada por un pájaro gigante metálico llamado Songbird (se podría decir que es el \"Big Daddy\" de Columbia). A partir de aquí, se desarrolla una historia que si bien al principio parece tópica y sencilla, se va complicando (y mucho) conforme vamos avanzado y sabiendo cosas. Los personajes están muy bien caracterizados, las diferentes localizaciones de Columbia muy bien ambientadas... en este apartado 0 pegas. Es más, hasta el final dá que pensar.\nEn gráficos a día de hoy sigue estando muy bien, usa efectos DX11 que hace que Columbia parezca una ciudad angelical. Y además tiene muchas opciones de configuración, cosa que en sus dos primeras entregas estaban más limitadas.\nMúsica, efectos y en especial el cuidado doblaje están a un nivel muy superior, insuflándole más vida a este juego que de por si destila calidad. Por poner algo negativo, es que cuando activas un voxáfono y empieza a hablar alguien, es imposible oir lo que reproduce hasta que la segunda voz termina de hablar. Pero esto es algo muy muy subjetivo.\nEl sistema de juego es como en los anteriores Bioshock. Los plásmidos se llaman vigorizadores (pudiendo hacer diferentes combos devastadores con ellos) y los tónicos son piezas de equipo (sombrero, chaqueta, pantalones y calzado) intercambiables que dan diferentes atributos de manera pasiva. También tendremos un escudo que nos ayudará a aguantar más antes de que nuestra vida empiece a disminuir y el uso de los aerocarriles nos hará tener ventaja táctica cuando nos veamos en peligro. Y como siempre, tendremos las máquinas expendedoras que nos venderán munición, mejoras para armas y vigorizadores...\nY respecto a los DLC's, Enfrentamiento en las Nubes es más o menos como las Pruebas del Protector de Bioshock 2. Panteón Marino (está dividido en dos partes) me parece el mejor DLC de este juego de largo, un guiño o despedida para aquellos que jugamos a los dos primeros Bioshock. Además conecta con la historia principal de Infinite. La guinda del pastel para este juego. Hay un tercer DLC, pero es basicamente un booster de armas, piezas nuevas de equipo y águilas de plata extra.\nEn resumen, si te gustaron los anteriores Bioshock este te debería gustar igual o más. Está cuidado en todos sus aspectos. 9/10.\n\n> [i]\"Siempre hay un faro, un hombre, una ciudad\"[/i].\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nSimply one of the best Bioshock games after the first Bioshock. This time, we are not in Rapture, the underwater city of the first two Bioshocks, but in Columbia, a floating city in the sky that seceded from the United States. Different cities, but with a common link.\nThe story is about a man, Booker DeWitt (in this installment of Bioshock, we see his face and know the real name of the protagonist), who takes a job to pay off their debts. Soon,  we will be in that common link of all Bioshock share: the lighthouse. From there, a story that revolves around recovering Elizabeth, a captive girl in a metal tower guarded by a giant metallic bird called Songbird (you could say it's the Columbia's \"Big Daddy\"). From here, a story that, while at first seems to be simple and topical, becomes complicated (much) as we advanced through the game and started to know things. The characters are very well characterized, the different locations Columbia are very well set... Moreover, even the end of the game will keep you thinking about it.\nIn graphics even today is still very good, it uses DX11 effects that makes Columbia look like an angelic city. And it features many configuration options, which in its first two deliveries were more limited.\nMusic, special effects and dubbing care are at a much higher level, breathing even more life to this game which in itself exudes quality. To say something negative, it is that when you activate a voxophone and someone starts talking, it is impossible to hear what plays until the second voice finishes speaking. But this is something veeeery subjective.\nThe gameplay is like in the previous Bioshock. Plasmids are now called Vigors (can make different devastating combos with them) and Tonics are pieces of equipment now (hats, jackets, pants and shoes) that give different attributes interchangeable passively. We will also have a shield that will help us endure more before our life begins to decrease and the use of \"Sky-line\" will give us tactical advantage when endangered. And as always, we will have the typical vending machines that sell us ammunition, weapons and Vigors upgrades...\nAnd speaking about the DLC's, Clash in the Clouds is more or less like the Protector Trials of Bioshock 2. Burial at Sea (it's divided into two parts) seems to me the best DLC of this game by far, a wink or a farewell for those who we played the first two Bioshock. Besides, it connects to the main Bioshock Infinite main story. The icing on the cake for this game. There is a third DLC, but is basically a booster of weapons, new equipment and extra silver eagles.\nIn short, if you liked the previous Bioshocks, you will like this one even more. It has been cared in all its aspects. A masterpiece. 9/10.\n\n> [i]\"There’s always a lighthouse, a man, a

Everything you see if kind of BS, yet, the game makes you believe it.\n\nHowever, you can only carry 2 weapons, so ammunition management is hardcore in the game if you want to play harder difficulties. But don't be upset, how can you forget the fact that you're a \"Magiciain\"? You can use special powers and combine them into a deadly combo which not only save up your ammo but make your fight less troublesome.\n\nAnd keep in mind to look around for \"Special clothing\" that give you additional bonus. Like increased total ammunition for all guns, increased stats for yourself, and gain temporary immunity when you just get off the roller coaster track. Some are useful against right enemies, so make sure you get the right choice.\n\nAnd your lovely companion, Elizabeth, she will provide you all the avalible support as she can. So make good use of her special abilities, like tear, which she can warp in weaponry, consumables, battle advantages, and friendly killing robots to aid you in the battle.\n\nYou will collect money all the way through, but try to save as much as possible and invest them either in your magic power effectiveness or guns' deadliness. As the longer you proceed, the stronger and powerful your enemies are. So try not to spend too much on consumables, you can find hp kit and mana potions almost anywhere, as long as you don't just \"OMOMOMOMOM\" everything up when you just have small chunk of hp loss or mana used.\n\nIn total: The game is just as amazing as Half Life series, a must for everyone who loves good story telling and visual designs.","timestamp_created":1474080221,"timestamp_updated":1503184908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482316911220550537","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25537910","author":{"steamid":"76561198120362161","num_games_owned":475,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":5924,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1644,"last_played":1581989984},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores jogos da minha vida","timestamp_created":1474075772,"timestamp_updated":1474075772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523622035980224609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25537166","author":{"steamid":"76561198122592692","num_games_owned":179,"num_reviews":124,"playtime_forever":2398,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":749,"last_played":1627319999},"language":"spanish","review":"BioShock Infinite must be the closest a game has ever been to be perfect, everything from its sound design, gameplay, mechanics and breathtaking atmosphere makes it a complete masterpiece.
