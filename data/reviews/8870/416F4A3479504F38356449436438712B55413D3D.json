You'll always have the rubbish like Air Control that seeps out from some unknown orifice; those will always make people shake their heads and offer a, \"No; of course not,\" in response to that question.\nBut then, every once in awhile, something like BioShock comes along and resolves most people to make up their minds with a solid, \"Yes,\" answer.\nBioShock 2 came along. And then it went right back into the orifice it crawled out of. Good for it.\nThen came BioShock Infinite. Not only was the art style wonderful, but the story - as with the first game - was astoundingly brilliant.\nThen we got Burial at Sea - Episodes One and Two. Not only did it combine the settings of the games [BioShock 2 not withstanding], but it spliced the stories together seamlessly. And I do mean seamlessly. Not only did it add more depth to the world of BioShock Infinite, but it stitched the two games into one ouroboros, each one's canon causing the other.\nSo, back to that question.\n\"Are games art?\"\nYes, my friend. Not all of them are, of course. But when it comes to this series in particular, this is, without a doubt, the finest example of \"games as art\" that exists.\nIt may, in fact, be the greatest series of all time.","timestamp_created":1455344353,"timestamp_updated":1455344353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491198509931564331","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21170308","author":{"steamid":"76561198246608380","num_games_owned":364,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1464,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":830,"last_played":1532756373},"language":"schinese","review":"一部好作品，虽然武器每次只能携带两把.而且弹药有限.不过给人真实感.游戏的画面有自己独特的风格.音乐欢快让人耳目一新，最让人感叹的是游戏的剧情。在最终结尾的时候，我呆滞了数秒.生化奇兵系列二和无限我都通关了.两作的结局都让我感到莫名的悲伤.结局二大老爹把女儿救了出来自己却在最后死亡，让人震撼和悲伤.而无限最后结局也给了我思考.不得不说.值得一玩。","timestamp_created":1455343520,"timestamp_updated":1455343520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21167559","author":{"steamid":"76561198143901111","num_games_owned":66,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":5754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1116,"last_played":1636178548},"language":"english","review":"At the end.....

The game benefits greatly from a second playthrough, knowing how the pieces fit together (which you only learn at the end of the game) makes retracing the Infinite story an incredibly satisfying (and emotional) experience. This is by far some of the best writing in a video game I've ever experienced.\n\nSadly, the Burial at Sea DLC is not. The \"bridge between Infinite and Bioshock\" is full of contrived retcons, cringey cliche writing, plotholes and contradictions, fanservice, and none of the Bioshock gameplay.

As soon as you reach Columbia you can tell it's a living, breathing, world. You can see pedestrians living their lives as if nothing will ever change. You can hear the conversations of people who are talking about the world around them. And the world of Columbia is beautiful, it's filled with color, music and life. Every couple of minutes there is a sight worthy of being put in a picture frame and hung up. World: 10/10\n\nGraphics: The world complements the visuals of the game itself. The graphics in this game aren't exactly \"realistic\" but they are beautiful in an artistic way. There are some very small areas that don't look too great though, such as the apples in a basket, which are just a flat texture. If you can max out this game I highly recommend you do, it will make your experience with this game even better. Graphics: 9.8/10\n\nSound: Bioshock infinite chooses great sound to go with most situations. Whenever you get into a fight intense music is played to go along with it. If you cut off or shoot off an enemy's head or brutally murder an enemy it plays a sharp sound as if to say, \"That’s fucked up.\" In the background you can hear music that really helps capture the 1900 feelling. The sound while just walking around or firing a weapon is also great. Sound 10/10.\n\nGameplay: Most of the gameplay consists of fighting enemies. Although that doesn't sound too great, the game implements it in a way that is fun and refreshing compared to other shooters. You can ride on skylines and fight and the same time, making fighting very fast paced. While fighting, Elizabeth can help by throwing you some supplies such as ammo and health packs. This makes Elizabeth helpful and not annoying to have around. Gameplay 9.5/10\n\nStory: There is a huge mindf**k at the end and one day you will finally understand it… I’m sorry I didn’t explain much, the story is best experienced knowing nothing going in. Story: 10/10\n \nThis game permanently changed what I thought a video game could be. If I had to give it an overall rating I’d say 10/10. This isn’t just a videogame, this is a work of art.
