The co-op will however make you both realise how silly you are when you find the solution to be something so simple.\n\nFinally there is also community chambers where people can create and upload their portal maps to the steam workshop for you to be able to download and some really do feel that they could be part of the game developed from valve which will give you even more playtime in this game.\n\nThe graphics are good of what you see and well developed, the controls are very basic only using wasd and the two mouse buttons but it makes this game very enjoyable.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1342280484,"timestamp_updated":1407318886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1144742","author":{"steamid":"76561197987753993","num_games_owned":683,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":4323,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1084,"last_played":1599282301},"language":"english","review":"Excellent game.
