Soweit ich weiß nutzt Portal auch die gleiche Engine wie Half Life 2, also die Source Engine. Aber ich rede hier nicht über die technik, sondern über das spiel.\n\nHabe sowohl Portal als auch Portal 2 beim Steam Sale für ~6€ ergattert, weil es einfach eines der spiele ist die man mal gespielt haben MUSS. \n\nDas spiel beginnt ähnlich wie Half Life, und auch das schema ist ähnlich. Allerdings gibt es hier eine art \"Tutorial\". Dieses Tutorial verläuft über 19 Testkammern, nach denen man froh ist durch zu sein. Letztlich trifft man auf GLaDOS die einen umbringen will...\n\nDie Spielmechanik ist wunderbar. Man kann beliebig Portale setzen, durchgehen und woanders setzen. Vor allem die Möglichkeiten sind erstaunlich. Im gesamten Spiel über hat man allerdings nur 1 waffe: Die Portal Gun. \n\nDer Kontext des spiels ist sehr gut geschrieben. Der leichte grad von Wahnsinn ist deutlich in GLaDOS´ stimme zu hören, bis sie letzten endes 2 mal versucht einen zu ermorden. Auch die Lügen von wegen \"Das war bloß ein test, ich wollte dich nicht töten\" sind gut ausgeklügelt. So bekommt GLaDOS auch etwas menschliches. \n\nDas Spiel an sich besteht zum großteil aus den 19 Testkammern. Von Kammer zu Kammer wird es schwerer, und es dauert auch bis man den richtigen Lösungsweg hat. Nach den 19 Kammern geht es auf direktem weg richtung verbrennungsanlage... Ab da entzieht ihr euch der Handlung von GLaDOS.\n\nAm Ende versucht euch GLaDOS noch davon zu überzeugen nicht die Kugel, die sie verloren hat, zu zerstören. Auch da ist der Kontext einsame spitze und gibt sowohl etwas Menschliches, als auch Computermäßiges.\n\nAlles in allem ist Portal 1 ein kurzes, aber sehr gutes Spiel. Die Engine und die Spielphysik sorgen wirklich für einen guten Spielspaß und bleibt dabei noch spannend.
