I won't spoil it, but I would personally go into the game to see the progress of CS, the FPS genre and Valve in general. One thing I will say, is that the level design for the game is quite impressive for the time. The immersion of the game is something that I really enjoyed. Some levels make you feel like you're in Saving Private Ryan, others like you're in Indiana Jones, and others like building scene towards the end from The Matrix. The missions that you have to play suit different playstyles quite well too. If you're someone who goes in all-guns-blazing like Rambo, you can do that, but you'll have to rely on your aim and reaction times being quite good. You can play it slow too, peeking corners carefully, and clearing out rooms as though you were destined for a SWAT team. Or if utility is more your thing, then you can take advantage of smokes, flashes, molotovs, and grenades too. As well, some levels have a puzzle-like element to them, where you have to find a way to progress through the stage, whether that's looking for a vent that you have to crawl through, finding a ladder disguised as a pipe, or a specific item that helps you blast open a door. I will admit (shamefully) there were some times where I did have to look at a walkthrough, but I'm a little impatient, and had I spent an extra 5 minutes, I probably would've been fine. Gameplay is identical to that of CS:CZ, with graphics and performance being the same.\n\nNo, it's not the best game that Valve has ever made, but I would take the game as more of a learning experience. A product of its time. Yes, the graphics look VERY dated compared to today, and the level design doesn't compare to what we have now, but you have see the game from the eyes of someone from 2004, and you will see a glimpse of appreciation for where we are today. Give the game a try, don't take it too seriously, have fun.","timestamp_created":1585608552,"timestamp_updated":1585608552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66202794","author":{"steamid":"76561198973437739","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":624,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":604,"last_played":1585609582},"language":"english","review":"Superb","timestamp_created":1585608382,"timestamp_updated":1585608382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66201860","author":{"steamid":"76561198256342236","num_games_owned":193,"num_reviews":138,"playtime_forever":45,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":45,"last_played":1534421702},"language":"russian","review":"writed for review","timestamp_created":1585607354,"timestamp_updated":1585607354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66193797","author":{"steamid":"76561198091667429","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":382,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":310,"last_played":1585605539},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1585599594,"timestamp_updated":1585599594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66183312","author":{"steamid":"76561199039626581","num_games_owned":4,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":858,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":841,"last_played":1585590935},"language":"english","review":"STILL A CLASSIC OF A GAME","timestamp_created":1585590539,"timestamp_updated":1585590539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66129050","author":{"steamid":"76561198140693767","num_games_owned":258,"num_reviews":111,"playtime_forever":524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":206,"last_played":1585598402},"language":"schinese","review":"想要重温老CS的画面与战斗，又想要电影一般的战斗流程，这一部《零点行动：删减片段》绝对是不二之选。\n\n小时候一直以为CS就网吧里常见的1.5和1.6，没啥剧情的，买了V社大包之后也没去碰，昨晚心血来潮试了一下便感慨相见恨晚，童年错过了这部神作实属遗憾。\n\nPS：零点行动分为两个游戏，一个就叫Condition Zero，是专门PVP的模式，也有单人任务，但也就PVP的地图给你塞AI罢了，而正儿八经的单机剧情，是Condition Zero Deleted Scenes，即零点行动删减片段。\n\n还好删减片段是英文配不是台配，不过没字幕倒是个遗憾。","timestamp_created":1585531710,"timestamp_updated":1585532935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66076072","author":{"steamid":"76561197997560183","num_games_owned":312,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":519,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":418,"last_played":1585487351},"language":"french","review":"Malgré un visuel quelque peu vieilli, la campagne \"Deleted Scenes\" offre à la série des Counter Strike la possibilité de progresser à travers plusieurs missions à la façon d'un Soldier of Fortune (en moins fun).

Running on the GoldSrc engine of Half-Life and Counter-Strike 1.6, the game has a bunch of story-oriented missions where you can go around killing terrorists and rescuing hostages in many locations. \n\nThe training area is surprisingly well made also, but I feel that there were a few areas that were a bit buggy at times, and that might just be because it's on a 1997/98 game engine of all things. \n\nCSCZ DS also has little health/medical cabinets to replace the health chargers that you could find throughout HL1 (if you've played that), and suit charge is replaced with basic ballistic armour. \n\nThe gunplay is pretty good in most of the levels (at least the ones that I have played for myself), but there are a few places where it gets a bit annoying, especially if you lack the appropriate equipment (in one level, I think it was Alamo, there can be a terrorist who continuously throws grenades down the stairs). The melee is also pretty mediocre, especially since this is, once again, a GoldSrc game. That makes the melee more like this: Hit, get to cover, hit, get to cover, repeat until enemy is dead.\n\nOverall, I recommend it if you want a Counter-Strike story mode.
