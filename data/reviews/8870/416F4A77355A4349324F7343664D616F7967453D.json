Но не о них мой отзыв.\n\nBioshock Infinite - это не просто шутер в котором ты бегаешь от точки к точке, параллельно убивая противников, а история. История, которая сама по себе красива и сложна(даже с присутсвием мистики и иррациональности). История,которая критикует практически ВСЕ современные социальные проблемы. \n\nВсе события разворачиваются на небесном городе Columbia.  Город, созданный в конце 19 века, который должен был показать всему миру неограниченную силу Соединенных Штатов Америке, который по итогу стал местом, где одновременно обострились различные социальные вопросы, такие как религия, национализм, расизм и (!!!!) классовая борьба . Что в конечном итоге и превратило город в антиутопию.\nГеймплей во всех трех частях не очень, но и это легко компенсируется все той же историей!\n\nВ заключение хотелось бы сказать,что трилогия Bioshock заставила меня задуматься как о прошлом с настоящим,так и о будущем!\n","timestamp_created":1562068245,"timestamp_updated":1562068245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548135936260223389","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53131104","author":{"steamid":"76561198369416816","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":897,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":897,"last_played":1561970691},"language":"russian","review":"Биошок это море битв интересных разворотов сюжета да и просто безумный шутер если хотите попасть в новый увлекательный мир то биошок то что вам надо","timestamp_created":1562067399,"timestamp_updated":1562067399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"53128995","author":{"steamid":"76561198006633103","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":701,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":701,"last_played":1561991183},"language":"english","review":"Well made Single Player game with an interesting plot.
