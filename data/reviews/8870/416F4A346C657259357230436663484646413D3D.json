It was far better than I predicted it would have been when the first trailer was released. Most of that has to do woth BioShock Infinite being developed by the original development team (2k Marrin made BioShock 2's campaign) 2k Boston & 2k Australia, now Irrational, which they were originally called, so the name change proved to be rather pointless.\n\nThe setting of Infinite is, in one word, ASTOUNDING. Sure, it could have been better, but still amazing. Whenever I first saw Columbia, the floating city that this game takes place in, my jaw hit the floor. For real, no joke.\nThe game takes place in 1912, you are hired gun Booker DeWitt, a war veteran. Your objective, to rescue a girl named Ellizabeth from Columbia. The story is really good in this game, and gets really interesting at the end, but every now and then it gets confusing.  If you forget where mto go, just press 'N' and a green arrow will appear on the ground.\n\nIn this BioShock, you can only hold 2 weapons at a time, and use 2 vigors, which do the EXACT same thing plasmids do. Vigors you cn swap anytime by holding down 'Q', but weapons you do not,  you go around and pick them up, obviously. There are 2 interesting vigors in this game: Return to Sender and the Bucking Bronco. Bucking Bronco launches your enemies into the air and caused them to float for a brief period of time. Return to Sender allows you to block bullets and rockets. You can also throw the 'orb' that collects them at enemies.\nDevil's Kiss (which replaces Incinerate!) is only good at close range. I mainly use it to take out large groups of enemies.\nShock Jocky is the new Electro-bolt, and pretty useful against weaker enemies and enemies at long range (especially those douchebags with grenade launchers) because it stuns them for a few seconds.\nThere are more vigors, but these are the most important.\nThe gameplay is changed, but at the same time similar. Instead of guns kicking up, your guns now have changing crosshairs, like in Halo Reach. Instead of having different types of ammo, you have 2 choices of every type of gun except for the RPG and the sniper rifle. You have the Vox Populi set of weapons, which are more powerful, but have tweaks to them that make them balanced so they don't make the game to easy, and the standard Comstock issued weapons, \n\nElizabeth plays a BIG role in Infinite, and is very helpful. She wil throw ammo to you when you get low, health, and money when you go near a vending machine. She also throws salts (which is the new name for EVE) when you run out every now and then. Don't worry, this doesn't make the game easy. It works really well in the end. If she didn't do this, you would be running out of ammo all of the time and dying a lot.\n\nShe can also do other useful things, like open up tears in combat, which gives you access to turrets, cover, rockets, guns, salts, and health kits.\n\n\nThere is no multiplayer mode, but there is a ton of replay value. You will find hidden areas that you missed during other playthroughs. The game was made to be played more than one time.\n\nThis game gets a 9.6/10 for gameplay, but gets a 10/10 overall. The story, setting, and the cool things that Elizabeth does adds a lot to the final package. As soon as I beat this game, I wanted to play it again. that tells a lot about how good this game is.\n\nBut, it is still far behind the first BioShock.","timestamp_created":1365044668,"timestamp_updated":1365044668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1048889","author":{"steamid":"76561197985290653","num_games_owned":84,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":641,"last_played":1364626800},"language":"english","review":"Mindfuck / 10\nDefinitely a must play!","timestamp_created":1365042837,"timestamp_updated":1365042837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"738576","author":{"steamid":"76561197977016810","num_games_owned":1384,"num_reviews":178,"playtime_forever":4527,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1318,"last_played":1651046578},"language":"english","review":"Exceeded my expectations, and those were building higher and higher sense this game was announced.

At time of writing (around 10 hours after the UK release on March 26th 2013), I finished the 8+ hour campaign in a single sitting around 2-3 hours ago after no sleep and I'm still trying to mentally process the experience in order to evaluate it. While this might not immediately sound like the best mindset to have when trying to writing a review, I felt now is the best time as this post-game mindset perfectly reflects my feelings towards Bioshock Infinite as a game: breathtaking, awe inspiring, thought provoking, complex, deep and utterly brilliant. \n\nKen Levine and the team at Irrational Games have outdone themselves once again by creating yet another extremely inventive, inspired and interesting game world inhabited by intriguing and believable characters. As hard as this may be to swallow for some players, Columbia and it's inhabitants are far more developed and enjoyable to spend time around than Rapture, to the point where standing and watching the city folk go about their lives becomes an immersive highlight of the game. The arrival of a wide variety of interesting and developed characters such as Booker, Elizabeth, Comstock and Fitzroy is extremely welcome as the brilliant acting and stellar writing from the first game once again return, just with a much greater focus on personal character development this time around. \n\nIf, for some weird reason, you're still on the fence about whether or not to buy Bioshock Infinite, look at it this way. If you're looking for a deeply engrossing and immersive game world with astonishing visual design, fast paced inventive gameplay or an emotionally driven and complex storyline, look no further. While the game would've already been fantastic if it had merely replicated Bioshock 1, additional innovative design elements such as the social/religious/racial commentaries push the game that much further as a powerfully moving and artistic interactive experience, making them the added seasoning which makes Bioshock Infinite one of those few astonishingly high quality games that nobody should miss. \n\n9.7/10 - Very Highly Recommended","timestamp_created":1365035563,"timestamp_updated":1365035563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507076740264892578","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"2645281","author":{"steamid":"76561198010423823","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1459,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1176,"last_played":1658599662},"language":"english","review":"The ending is a mind-fuck.","timestamp_created":1365034806,"timestamp_updated":1365034806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3764524","author":{"steamid":"76561198027115277","num_games_owned":393,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":942,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":641,"last_played":1403651693},"language":"english","review":"I don't usually write these, but I fuckin' loved this game.

Its world, characters and story are deep and diverse, the artdesign is not from this world. It floats among the clouds like the city of Columbia.\nColumbia itself, the perfect city in the sky, is one of two main \"characters\" of the game. The leveldesign is fantastic, the artdesign is nearly perfect. It´s vast and detailed and you can just stand their for a  time just... experiencing beauty. It´s like a picture, a piece of wonder.\nThe best original city in gaming in a long time.\nThe second main character of Bioshock is not the game´s protagonist, Booker DeWitt, former cavalry officer and Pinkerton detective, but his protégé and companion, Elizabeth, both the best AI companion in any game I have ever played and one of the best female characters in gaming. She is well acted, well written, doesn´t get stuck or in the way (thank god), is more than important for the game´s twisted, confusing (but in the end fantastic) plot, which I won´t spoil and is a perfect  \"supporting\" character both in a gameplay and a storytelling sense.\nThe gameplay is frantic and fun, the difficulty is hard enough without being too frustrating (not talking about 1999 of course) and the vigors (secondary special attacks like telekinisis and fireballs, to name the two most ordinary) are a nice change to the (extremly cool looking) weaponry in the game.\nThe only real downgrading elements are the game´s AI and campaign length, the latter is just disappointing because i just wanted it to be infinite.But the enemies who are quite diverse and have to be fought in different styles are sometimes like zombies or, more fitting, like Splicers without masks. Well some wear masks.\nIn the end it must be said that Bioshock Infinite is one of the most gorgeous and deep FPS ever, its story is a twisted thrill and Elizabeth is my favourite NPC next to Clementine and the Mass Effect crew.\n9/10 Points for Bioshock Infinite\nNerdHerd","timestamp_created":1365011158,"timestamp_updated":1365011158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51776653528213501","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"4377736","author":{"steamid":"76561198036176333","num_games_owned":671,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1935,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1492,"last_played":1534033364},"language":"english","review":"If I have to wait several more years for a follow up to the Bioshock franchise I'm going to be pissed.

On this note, the title was delayed three times, and now we know why. Suffice to say, without spoiling anything, that the Ken Levine and the other developers swifted the main focus of the game from a political plot to a quantistic, other-worlds shenanigans tale. So, expect every promotional or pre-release material about Bioshock Infinite to have been either dummied out or reduced to foot notes. Someone, like me, thinks this was an improvement, given how the final product has turned out. Others, less so.\n\nWhat remained beside all of this is the great level and character design. Beside the main concept of Columbia, the world and its inhabitants have been designed to a maniacal level. Quite fitting, since Bioshock Infinite wanted to melt with real history, imaginery and art. Of course, this could be due to me being a steampunk affictionado.\n\nThe weakest aspect of Bioshock Infinite is aguably the gameplay. In the measure that the game is far too easy, even for the Bioshock series standards. Death is a mere slap on the wrist: it will merely consume some of your money and you can get back on your feeth, with some ammo too. And unless you play 1999 Mode, reaching zero dollars doesn't prevent you to respawn. The Vigors, the resident magical powers, are just a mean to end battles quickly, instead of a core mechanic. Some gears (as to say, additional gimmicks you can equip the protagonist with) are game-breaking. Many battles are endurance rounds instead of death traps. All the above considered, you should start the game on hard mode, and then give the 1999 Mode difficulty a go. Things tend to go greasy in there.\n\nAll of that said, Bioshock Infinite is competing with American McGee's Alice for the place of my best game ever. A nice accomplishment.","timestamp_created":1364989808,"timestamp_updated":1468755034,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5456336","author":{"steamid":"76561198050052531","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":715,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":661,"last_played":1419861556},"language":"english","review":"Замечательно","timestamp_created":1364988184,"timestamp_updated":1364988184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"3900092","author":{"steamid":"76561198028770128","num_games_owned":717,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":1562,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":908,"last_played":1651873554},"language":"english","review":"Безусловно, на данный момент BioShock: Infinite – игра года.

This could only be my reasoning, but in comparison to previous intents of having Elizabeth participate further in the enviornment, with discussions with Booker, and in combat, as well as further expanding skyline concepts and vigor variety, the combat serves as a con that seems more as filler to push along the game than should be, and previous drafts of the game serve to be an example of what Infinite could be. Even with all of these complaints though, I enjoyed it despite its dragging in certain acts. It has incredible high points, some notable low points, but its a solid experience all in all.

Characters other than Elizabeth are less fleshed out but audio logs help set the stage for those who care.\n\nCombat is exciting and fast paced, although Vigor powers are rather similar - mainly different types of stuns. Special ammos are traded in for a clothing system that gives you situational powers, not a big loss but I miss electrified buckshot. The guns are all rather standard fare - machine guns, sniper, grenade & rocket launchers, revolver etc. Could have used some crazy unique guns but maybe we'll get those in DLC. You can weild a power in one hand a gun in the other just like the improved Bioshock 2 combat system. Skylines are cool but underused - when you do pull off a skyline execution - dropping onto a guy at 100 mph and smashing him away is empowering.\n\n The misuse of quantum physics aside, the writing is superb. The beautiful bustling city with a dark dirty undertone of racism and civil unrest gave me a reason to fight with righteous anger after a couple scene setting pieces. Everyone who played the first will be looking for a twist, expecting it. But I doubt you'll see everything coming.","timestamp_created":1364963686,"timestamp_updated":1364963686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522665202617645264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5198160","author":{"steamid":"76561198046277824","num_games_owned":296,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3060,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1459,"last_played":1518297353},"language":"english","review":"Words can not begin to describe the greatness that is this game.

You play as Booker DeWitt, an ex-Pinkerton agent sent to repay his debt from gambling by retrieving a woman named Elizabeth.\n\nFrom the get-go, your intial launch into Columbia in nothing less than absolutely stunning. From the vibrant and beautiful colour palettes to the bright sunny skies that illuminate the city strees, Columbia is gorgeous to look at. Each and every part of it has been painted with such precise details and the citizens make effort to give breathing life to the imaginative world. You'll often find yourself staring off into the skies aweing or just absorbing the history the world has to offer. \n\nOf course, for the masterful piece of artwork it is, it is also a video game! The combat gameplay is solid and smooth. Much like the previous titles, you have access to both guns and vigors (the replacement for plasmids). There's plenty of freedom to create your own violent method of dispatching your enemies by  stringing vigors and weapon combos together. However, one of the best parts about the gameplay is the sky-lines, a rollercoaster speed trip through the skies of Columbia. There's plenty of large sky-lines to sail across, and the tight controls allow you to gracefully glide around and plan your enemies' deaths with guerilla tactics. You can also upgrade your combat abillities by purchasing upgrades from vendors and finding gear (which are equipment items that increase a certain skill). \n\nHowever, one of the most amazing aspect of the game is Elizabeth, a wonderous emotional character whom partners with you on your journey. Her body movements and expressions are amazing, showing emotion and thought with great execution. She's an easily likable character and you won't ever feel like she's some AI partner who assist you, but something more human. During combat, she will provide you ammo, health, and salts; although, it'll never feel like she's making the game to easy for you, and when she's gone, you'll probably miss her. \n\nThe story itself is thought-provoking and filled with many controversial topics, but never will tell you which one thing is right and wrong, but leaving it up to you as a player to decide which is morally correct. It starts out simple and gets increasingly more complex as you progress; closing it all with one of the best finales I've seen in a while. \n\nThere is some gripes I have with the game, although they are just minor. You're only limited to two weapons at a time, and often find yourself sticking to your upgraded weapon for most of the playthough. On a playthough on Hard or 1999 Mode, the game sometimes becomes a scavenger hunt for your best weapons because there is no machine that lets you purchase the gun itself, but rather just upgrade them. Another minor annoyance, is during tense combat fights, trying to pick up another weapon, can end up looting the body instead and not picking up the gun (as they are both binded to the USE key). \n\nBioshock: Infinite is a imaginative, story-driven, solid shooter that will leaving a lasting impression on your mind. One that will fill your heart with amazement, confusion, and morale. From it's gorgeous opening to it's amazing last moments, you won't regret your purchase.

I still haven't grasped enough knowledge as I would like to before rating this game, but I believe that I should put something out for all you guys that are teetering on the edge of getting this game. \n\nSo here it is(I WILL 100% TWEAK THIS AFTER 2 MORE PLAYTHROUGHS):\nI have to say this game, and the universe created by Irrational Games is outstanding. I have never played something like this before. From playing Bioshock (1) I was expecting something like a dark and gritty horror game, but this game was created solely on the purpose of atmosphere (no pun intended), and story. And what a story! It is hands down the 'best story game' I have ever played. Compared to the blockbuster game Uncharted, Infinite doesn't go for the best explosion scene, but rather on the \"world\" that you are exploring. They [Irrational] want to make you believe that this place is \"Real\" and not think of it as a bunch of code: zeros[0] and ones[1]. \n\nMy last words:\n\nThe game is hot off the shelf and pretty expensive, which doesn't make it economically feasible. So my suggestions are to RENT the game. It is a story game so it's basically a straight playthrough and then you're done! So renting is the best option, however there is DLC to come, sooo you never know. But that is the best thing to do. And lastly, do not rush the game, play it as if you never played a FPS before and walk around and just go sightseeing in that game, it is a very lively world and there is much to see.\n\nAdam Sessler: \"It's just a kind of an incredible world to fall into\"\n\nMy rating : 10 / 10","timestamp_created":1364956081,"timestamp_updated":1364956081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"1433600","author":{"steamid":"76561197993231943","num_games_owned":2138,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":779,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":779,"last_played":1364454000},"language":"english","review":"This is proof that games are art, and is something that could not have been done justice on film or on paper.\n\nBioshock 3 is drop dead gorgeous.
