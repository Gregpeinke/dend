Does that still hold up? Yeah, it does. \n\nI love Portal and Portal 2 equally for different reasons. Portal 2 feels more cinematic and lively with its addition of new characters, environment, gameplay features, and a more upbeat soundtrack. Portal on the other hand is almost the opposite. Portal has a more chill setting with a dab of isolation and loneliness sprinkled throughout. One thing that incapsulates that feeling of isolation is the track \"Self Esteem Fund\" from the soundtrack -also my personal favorite track in the game-. Self Esteem Fund feels like a mix of hopelessness and peace, like finding respite during the apocalypse or rediscovering a place that was nostalgic to you in the past but it is now in a state of disrepair after said apocalypse, and seeing that Portal takes place in the Half-Life universe that feeling totally fits. \n\nPortal, just like Portal 2, is a really fun game. Whenever I'm not really in the mood to play something high adrenaline and action-packed like Half-Life or Garry's Mod, Portal or Portal 2 are usually my go-to games for that. There's a satisfying feeling that comes with landing an energy pellet into the catcher. There's also an invigorating feeling with jumping off a platform, into a portal at the bottom and flying out of another one. \n\nPortal doesn't have as much of a detailed story as Portal 2 but I'm okay with simplicity. To sum it up to the simplest from, the story is basically \"Your in a science complex with tons of test chambers and a robot lady says you get cake when you finish all the tests.\". The twist at the end is also good one. It'd certainly surprise players who went in blind, it didn't surprise me because I had spoiled myself prior to playing. \n\nTo conclude the lengthy review, Portal is a fun experience that I'd totally recommend anyone to play.","timestamp_created":1502839634,"timestamp_updated":1593641448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34265169","author":{"steamid":"76561198009392849","num_games_owned":72,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":2740,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1944,"last_played":1587254754},"language":"english","review":"This game is purely amazing.

You are a test subject in Aperture Science and your task is to solve puzzles for science by using an equipment named \"Portal Gun\" or whatever you call it. Puzzles isn't that much very hard on the story mode but Bonus maps are the challenging ones. \n\nNot to be greedy but the puzzle in the story mode is not that hard. If you love valve games and dislike puzzle-based games, still go for it. You are being left out by the others if you haven't even played this game yet. Playing games can enhance your IQ ( i think) and increase you intelligence on puzzle solving.\n\nGameplay: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nFirst levels are really easy but some of them are very tricky. If you get the hang of it, you will love how it goes on and on. Although i wish they had the option to increase the Field of View to increase the range of what can be seen of the screen.\n\nStory: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nWhat i hate about portal is that it ended. Just kidding, The story is very great, Even though there aren't much characters or NPCs to interact with it. ( i won't spoil anything don't worry. )\n\nGraphics: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nGraphics looks great, Despite the game running on Source Engine. Not much to say about it. \n\nMusic: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nThe soundtrack is VERY lovely and wonderful. Especially the ending credits song.

Once both portals have been placed, you can walk though the entrance and find yourself at the exit. Walk through the exit and you're back at the entrance. The portals can be shot across a distance but only on certain surfaces, which creates the puzzle atmosphere. You'll have to figure out how to get across chasms, up and over obstacles, and around automated turrets. The trick is that you can only have one entrance and one exit meaning sometimes you'll encounter several kinds of brain teasers on how to use the portals correctly, and in some cases, quickly and often. It'll make you think about which portal you're placing, the exact location of where it needs to go, and the timing of when portals need to be switched.","timestamp_created":1502715338,"timestamp_updated":1502715338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34234944","author":{"steamid":"76561198329655106","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":563,"last_played":1500049299},"language":"english","review":"Great game, good storyline.
