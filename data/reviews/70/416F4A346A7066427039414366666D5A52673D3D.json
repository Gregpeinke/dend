Además, gracias a este motor se pudieron crear varios mods, como USS Darkstar, Azure Sheep, Sven Coop y el ahora juego independiente \"Counter-Strike\".\n\nPero si hablamos del juego en si. HL1 tiene una jugabilidad bastante atractiva mesclando los puzles con su estilo shooter en donde debemos utilizar los pensamientos lógicos para sobrevivir a un entorno lleno de entidades hostiles y variables con distintas habilidades que nos dificultaran el trayecto en el juego a mano de un gran arsenal de armas a nuestra disposición. Este titulo también posee un modo multijugador deathmatch que era muy jugado en los cibercafés en su época, pero hoy en día la cantidad de jugadores debe ser nula.\n\nAunque sea un gran juego en su época, sigue teniendo puntos negativos como los siguientes:\n[list]\n[*]Los bugs en este juego no son muchos ni pocos, muchos de ellos son exploits del juego, pero no llegan a arruinar la experiencia.\n[*]Su lenta introducción, que aunque sea interesante para conocer el entorno, sigue siendo molesto estar inactivo por tanto tiempo.\n[*]El juego tiene una cantidad escasa de 2 entidades aliadas, una de ellas con 4 variaciones.\n[*]En su beta, el juego poseía mas armas y muchísimos mas enemigos de los que hay en su versión final. Por limitaciones graficas, todo esto fue recortado.\n[*]En PlayStation 2, hay una campaña cooperativa llamada “Decay” que permite jugar con 2 científicas. Este modo quedo por completo en el olvido.[/list]\n\nEl siguiente y ultimo punto no es positivo ni negativo, pero HL1 es un juego de 1998 y a muchos jugadores de hoy en día no les atrae este tipo de juegos antiguos. Valve hiso una [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/280] remasterización[/url] que no tuvo éxito, pero hoy en día gracias a la comunidad, se logro crear un mod independiente llamado Black Mesa el cual recrea todo el juego entero desde 0 de una manera inimaginable.

WRITTEN REVIEW NOT COMPLETE\n\nquote. Scientist: [playing with tie] Why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties?. \n\nDeveloped by Valve and released in 1998\n\nPros and Cons\n\npros. Everything\ncons. Nothing \n\n10/10 Masterpicece\n\n\nSTORYLINE\nA mysterious Alien Artifact has been recovered and brought to a top-secret research facility in the Black Mesa. When newcomer Dr. Gordon Freeman is assigned to physically test the artifact, things go very wrong when the artifact opens a destructive and unstable portal to Xen, a planet in a different dimension. Gordon blacks out, and awakes in a now crippled and ruined research facility. When Freeman and the survivors of this ordeal discover the portal has allowed its inhabitants-deadly alien creatures-to enter the facility, they realise that they must call the government for help. The government, however, already has plans to contain this incident by silencing the witnesses. \n\nHalf life's story is a very diverse and confusing one, but is still executed brilliantly. since Half Life does not rely on cut scenes, there are moments when subtle important plot references are hinted towards key features of the story, but these references can be left unnoticed especially on a first play-through. This really depends on the player and their play style if you are to notice these references. Therefore this game mechanic should not be seen as a flaw rather as an attempt to try something new that valve knew very well wouldn’t mix with everyone.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nHalf life is the most influential First Person Game Ever Made. This is best exemplified through its game play mechanics. Let me explain. \n\nGrowing up as a young grommet the only fps game I was familiar with was DOOM. At the time DOOM was piratically seen as the best pc game of all time. All fps games two follow copied the DOOM formula, all except half life. You see Doom had \n\n.NO Apparent storyline\n.NO Interesting characters \n.NO Absorbing atmosphere [It felt very arcade like]\n.And no real apparent goal\n\nThe game was really a stress reviler where you just shoot s.hit and blow c.unts up. Not saying DOOM is a bad game. DOOM is one of my favourite games its just that Half life beat DOOM at the fps formula in all ways by Half Life having \n\n.A fantastic and engaging story.\n.A scary immersive atmosphere.\n.A roster of witty and interesting characters.\n.A simplified moving mechanic\n.A mechanic where you could look up and down.{ thank F.UCK for that }\n.A Mixture of action and Puzzles\n.And a game with an apparent goal from the very start.\n\nYou see Half Life wasn’t one of those games where you would just shoot s.hit and blows c.unts up. Half Life was the first real fps game to feel like a immersive gaming experience. Therefore we have half life to thank for saving and changing what was commonly thought of as the First Person Shooter Genre.\n\nPACING\nHalf Life Pacing is Executed very well. The game has the whole survival horror game feel to it and the game really exemplifies this through a sense of dread. At the start of the game it is apparent that you need to escape the black mesa facility but only an hour down the track you start to lose recognition of that thought and just have the mindset of surviving, and that is why this games pacing is so good. You never quite feel like you have an objective to do rather you just feel you have to survive. and coupling this with the fine selection of jump-scares and mind blowing scripted events it truly holds up. \n\nLEVEL DESIGN \nValve has a name for level design in their games. Its hard to describe on paper but no gaming developer team does it like valve, you just have to see it for yourself, I mean talk about attention to detail. Before Half Life level design in fps video games were very simplistic and felt like an arcade experience. Half Life's level design was truly ahead of its time. Structures would collapse, you could interact with all most everything from the environment, and the game used a clever use of scripted events through the level design. It is very hard to explain on paper but you can tell a lot of work was put into this category of game design for half life.\n\nIMMERSION\nImmersion, Probably The Fundamental Aspect Of Game Design That Every Game Director Should Take Seriously, Gabe Newell Certainty Did With Half-Life. You See Half-Life Never Breaks The Immersion Because The Game Never Allows The Player To Stop Playing. This Is Because The Game Doesn't Consist Of Cut-Scenes Or Any Other Immersion Breakers. The Game Never Says, ''Hey Maybe You Should Take A Break''. The Only Thing Controlling Your Will To Stop Or Keep Playing Is The Player's Own Demanding Ambition.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\nHalf-Life soundtrack consists of a techno and ambience like tracks. One of Half Life's key elements two its atmosphere is said soundtrack. Half Life's soundtrack always seems to change conveniently creating a completely different mood and atmosphere to the last segment of the game. The use of ambience like tracks for the more creepy, mysterious moments through out the game coupled with the techno prodigy like tracks for the scripted action moments through out the game really create an experience like no other.

The journey can be a real challenge at times, especially if it your first time playing - however, the hardships encountered along the way make the game feel like a true adventure.\n\nThe combat, though dated, feels fast, exciting, and natural. Once you begin to acquire weaponry, learning which item in your arsenal is best in a given situation is quick and easy. Furthermore, the fact that the game gradually builds up your arsenal, from the humble but iconic crowbar to powerful experimental guns, lends the title a distinct sense of progression - something also present in Half Life 2.\n\nAs is typical of Valve games, the level-design is well thought out and immersive for the majority of the game. The tight and claustrophobic corridors of Black Mesa, littered with traps and enemies, are particularly good examples of this.\n\nWhile a definite emphasis on the action is present, Half Life was notable at the time of its release for having a significant story amidst the conflict. The story, though mostly told through various NPCs scattered about the game, is also delivered through the design of the levels themselves and the actions of the player. \n\nIn terms of animation and graphics, while the game is clearly dated at this point in time, the visuals have a certain early 3D charm that give the game a distinct and instantly recognizable feel. Furthermore, the age of the graphics do not detract from the experience since they fit within the game's world and are quickly accustomed to. \n\nOverall, while Half Life shows its age in terms of graphics, it is still incredibly fun to play and can be a real challenge at times. If you want to experience a great oldschool FPS from the 1990s, look no further than Half Life. I highly recommend it.","timestamp_created":1444588799,"timestamp_updated":1533281644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18420878","author":{"steamid":"76561198231837000","num_games_owned":56,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":4229,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3598,"last_played":1481416115},"language":"english","review":"better than hl3","timestamp_created":1444528053,"timestamp_updated":1468979694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18416442","author":{"steamid":"76561198153204342","num_games_owned":514,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":164,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":137,"last_played":1444504793},"language":"english","review":"the difference between half life and half life 2, half life two locks you in a room to give exposition, half life lets you walk right past. plus this games story makes more sense.","timestamp_created":1444504947,"timestamp_updated":1444505052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18413135","author":{"steamid":"76561198032829326","num_games_owned":149,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":741,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":741,"last_played":1444725953},"language":"english","review":"Norm","timestamp_created":1444490399,"timestamp_updated":1444490399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"18412628","author":{"steamid":"76561198172246118","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1577,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":639,"last_played":1591407420},"language":"english","review":"I strongly recommend this game.
