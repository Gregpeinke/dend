Co-op too? Try out the endless supply of community workshop maps! \n+With the innovation, you'd think the game would become harder after awhile. Although new mechanics are introduced throughout, the game itself never becomes that much harder but rather requires different approaches to situations and more lengthy puzzles\n+There's basically two stories going on at one time. The main one at hand and another develops part of the way through that goes into a lot of backstory to the whole game's universe \n\n[h1]The Ok Stuff[/h1]\n=The main campaign needs only one or two playthroughs, the characters and a couple achievements are what would bring you back for a second time\n=So I love subtitles in general across all media types, bowever this game's subtitle design is rather basic and ill-timed. A lot of the subtitles are shown at 3-4 sentences at a time which usually ruins comedic timing and can give away what's about to happen in a few moments (i.e. effects, plot changes, inflection of sentence) That all being said, it is perfectly okay to play without subtitles (As 95% of people do, unlike my weird self) as the characters are very easy to understand\n\n[h1]The Bad Stuff[/h1]\n-It is slightly repetitive indeed. Best way to counter this would be to play awhile, set it down and come back later making the game into a couple play sessions which wouldn't ruin the story in any fashion\n\n[h1]The Truthful Hard Facts[/h1]\n[table]\n[tr][td]Acquirement Method[/td][th]Portal Bundle @ Steam Store[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td]Price Paid[/td][th]$4.99[/th][/tr]\n[tr][th]Length[/th][td]5-10 hours[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]Rig Used[/td][th][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thisgrouplinkwasavailable/discussions/0/1473095331487872526/]Main Computer[/url][/th][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]Check out my Steam group for more Reviews![/h1]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thisgrouplinkwasavailable]STEAM REVIEWS GROUP![/url]\n\n[h1]My YouTube Channel![/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4BQSDGExl23rHcd9ML2mRw","timestamp_created":1523398234,"timestamp_updated":1523475410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520345866680145264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41404664","author":{"steamid":"76561197970399248","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":882,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":882,"last_played":1523402693},"language":"english","review":"One of the great ones!\nThe Portal series is an amazing take on puzzle games with hilarious humor and great voice acting.

Players will explore never-before-seen areas of the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game. The game’s two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters. This new mode forces players to reconsider everything they thought they knew about portals.

ALSO it would be cool if we can have things that can be done in Hammer to be in the normal level editor. Trigers are a thing that would make alot of things WAYY better and with them we can make cool puzzles.

For me, it was so different from anything I'd played before.  The idea of a first person puzzler was so new, coupled with the portal mechanic, I couldn't get enough of the game.  I obessed over the challenge levels and serached the workshop, as well as made my own levels.  I was excited and nervous for the sequel.\n\nSequels can be just as good as the original and still feel much worse just because of expections.  For Portal 2, the sequel delivers.  The humor from the first is back, but stepped up to a new level.  The interaction between GLaDOS and Wheatley is just magic.  The voice actors and writers did a great job.  While the first game is a introduction to puzzle solving, this one is more like a detective story with puzzles.  As the game progresses more backstory is uncovered leading to a better understanding of both games.\n\nPortal 2 adds new mechanics as well with gels.  The gels are fun in adding a new way to explore the game.  The only downside is that they tend to lead to intended solutions.  The game feels slightly (very slightly) more forced than the first.  While there are always designed solutions, these solutions feel more apparent with the gels.  Still a very solid puzzler and very fun.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun game to play.  If you have a friend who wants to play as well the multiplayer is great as well.

It legitimately depresses me that no other  game will give me the same feeling/experience  that Portal 2 has given me ever again. The entire atmosphere of this game makes you feel like you are alone & lost, with incredible views and silence in most parts of the game, which I happen to love. The Characters are Fantastic ! The gameplay  is of course, incredible. Even when I was stuck on some of the puzzles, the game managed to keep me fighting on and trying again. Valve has done a great job of using the materials they created to make new and exotic puzzles over and over again.There are also great Community made games that i also played and some of them are really nice !  If you read this review and want to see the game, please DO NOT watch any game play or get spoiled in any way whatsoever. This is an experience you want to have on your own, and one you will miss when it is over. I recommend you playing the COOP Campaign with a good friend its rly funny and still one of the best COOP games i ever played !

Les graphismes sont réussis et le jeu est prenant. L'humour est omniprésent et les doublages en français sont excellents. On a plaisir à suivre le fil de l'histoire et à decouvrir un petit peu plus le background de cet univers fantastique. La durée de vie est revue à la hausse par rapport à PORTAL premier du nom et de nombreux modes de jeux sont présents avec de la coopération, des challenges et même des salles conçues par la communauté. En bref un bon jeu de casse tête.","timestamp_created":1523124342,"timestamp_updated":1523124342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41345669","author":{"steamid":"76561198079156793","num_games_owned":292,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":100,"last_played":1523123400},"language":"brazilian","review":"melhor jogo de puzzle , recomendo, valve ta de parabens pela essa obra prima!","timestamp_created":1523123440,"timestamp_updated":1523123440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41345115","author":{"steamid":"76561198087036717","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1036,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":549,"last_played":1638665744},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1523121797,"timestamp_updated":1523121797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41344738","author":{"steamid":"76561198231061276","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":391,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":52,"last_played":1452445257},"language":"english","review":"This game is really fun and good.","timestamp_created":1523120641,"timestamp_updated":1523120641,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vpLE0OICcu7bnQE="}
