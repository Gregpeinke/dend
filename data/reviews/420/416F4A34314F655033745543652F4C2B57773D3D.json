This game has much stronger components and story than Episode One, and it flows so much better, as does the action.  It seems that the developers also spent more time smoothing out the environment in this game, as the number of times that you get jagged on invisible barriers is far less than in Episode One.\n\nThere are a few things that again, aren't really well conceived, or are just too corny to take seriously.  But overall, it's an immersive game, it's just a pity about the end.\n\nOf course, speaking of the end of the game, whilst the story telling is immersive, it can be hard to feel empathy with any of the characters, so the final closing scene before the credits roll does miss the target IMO.  But this is something that is a byproduct of the entire approach to make Gordon a shell throughout the franchise.  As a shell, that emotional investiture just doesn't exist, and the feelings that you should have aren't really there.  Again, it's a pity.\n\nWill Valve make a follow up?  One would hope that at some stage they will, and the rumours that are constantly online do little to asuage the feeling that the ending of this chapter is the ending of all chapters for this franchise.\n\nAt least that means no more Alyx.  Because boy does she wear thin.\n\n4/5","timestamp_created":1469628051,"timestamp_updated":1469628051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24544986","author":{"steamid":"76561198131087203","num_games_owned":488,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":364,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":341,"last_played":1582193487},"language":"polish","review":"Never ending cliff hanger.","timestamp_created":1469569160,"timestamp_updated":1469569160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24542168","author":{"steamid":"76561198097382763","num_games_owned":392,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":1021,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1021,"last_played":1385058030},"language":"russian","review":"Valve, сделайте уже Half -

It follows the continued tale of physicist-gone-action-hero Gordon Freeman and action-hero-gone-love-interest Alyx Vance as they drive around a lot and help their garden gnome friend live out his childhood dreams of blowing up in space... I think..\n\nEpisode 2 is an interesting game... whereas I have generally negative comments to make for HL2 and generally positive comments to make for Episode 1, Episode 2 is a mixed bag. As such, I won't give a traditional review, I'll just list my thoughts in order of what part of the game they apply to... hopefully this is interesting.\n\nThe very first thing I noticed when playing the game is that the flashlight is no longer tied to the sprint meter which is pretty cool. But I don't get why they can't just impliment that into the other two games with an update... they haven't gone anywhere, as far as I can tell they've been preserved for historical record.\n\nThe first chapter of Episode 2 throws the player for a loop when (after some exposition + befriending a certain garden gnome) they end up witnessing the generally up-beat and entertaining Alyx get stabbed in the back by a new enemy type. It's a fun twist and they don't sacrifice the duo idea for the sake of plot either, which is nice. Now the player gets to fight alongside a Vort.\n\nIt's funny how the Vorts went from the bad guys slave guy, to the allies slave guys, to your slave guy... but I digress. After this is a very long section in some mines which try and juggle tricky exploration with the antlions as enemies and honestly I can't say it succedes... The antlions in general just aren't very fun to kill, they're annoying and loud and shooting them isn't satisfying. The environment gets really stale too, it goes on for way too long and you only really fights zombies and antlions for about an hour of gameplay.\n\nThere are some fun bits, like a sort of stealthy chase sequence with an Antlion Guard (although I wish it were easier to recover after getting caught in corners), and a sort of tower defense part where antlions come swarming in and you fight them alongside some comic relief rebel guys and some Vorts. \n\nCome to think of it, Half-Life does a lot of things that sound like bad ideas really well a lot of the time... physics puzzle, excort missions, first person platforming, tower defense set peices, all of those sound like awful ideas.. and usually ARE awful ideas.. but work here due to the execution.\n\nBut one thing that stays un-fun are the vehicular set-peices... I mean the boat thing is the most tolerable out of all of them but none of them are good anyway! The car is finicky and difficult to control, turning manage sto be both too sensitive and not sensitive enough sometimes and the boost is waaaay too fast. Let alone that the levels you drive in are all covered in logs  and debri and stuff that the car gets caught in, it's just poorly executed. The final level especially bothers me, I mean the striders are objectively satisfying to kill and the sticky bombs are pretty cool, but every time I start having fun in the final level boss fight the car gets stuck or I turn too far and miss my target.\n\nI mean some things are fun, and I would argue that the final level as a WHOLE is a success. Crashing into the hunters never gets old and neither does blowing up the striders with a single shot and a sticky bomb. Hearing allies react to stuff you do is always really satisfying too, even if I sort of forgot they were there until the final wave. I think Episode 2 bothers me because it was just so almost my favorite HL2 game but it's shortcoming are so much more glaringly obvious because of that and.. I honestly think some of this is because of lazy design.\n\nEither way, Episode 2 is fun. A whole lot of fun. Coupled with Episode 1 it's some of the most fun I've had in a game. The plot is still really investing and the finale is satisfying and then also suddenly kind of horrifying... and the garden gnome will haunt my dreams for months,","timestamp_created":1468480369,"timestamp_updated":1468480590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548724651336669922","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24305214","author":{"steamid":"76561198197131806","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":217,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":217,"last_played":1468140589},"language":"koreana","review":"ㅎ  알릭스밴스 진짜ㅡ_ㅡ","timestamp_created":1468452709,"timestamp_updated":1468452709,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503671050071716309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"24292759","author":{"steamid":"76561198085231133","num_games_owned":159,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":586,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":508,"last_played":1427040446},"language":"english","review":"The year is 3333.
