The story is pretty much stand alone and pretty unique to some extent. I gotta say tho that a lot doesnt makes sense or rather seem scatchy like the idea of a skycity or the ending conclusion BUT that doesnt influence this amazing experience at all / too much. The gunplay is amazing and to get you to play with all of them they just give you 2 weapon slots where you can simultaneously swap them with guns that lie around and almost every one of them has a unique weapon design that shall kinda repesent the early 20th century. You also got supernatural abilities with a lot of variety that you recieve one after another by progressing the game. It's this Retro-Scifi-Steampunk setting with the supernatural idea of Tears (interdimensional Portals) that really cought my eye here and this really escalates quickly into a hell of a clusterfucc. Everything seems vivid and the graphics and the world are designed so well and detailed with a lot love for little secrets and things to be found scratterd across the world. In comparison to other FPS games, here your Ai companion Elizabeth really helps you, she find money for you, health pickup, other powerups and for the coolest thing she brings you weapons, shelter and climable structures through tears.\nOne thing that bugged me that was that elizabeth had an unnecessary neckline because this a FPS war game and not some kind of dating sim or etc and what the fucc was up with her running around all the time in high heels, it just doesnt makes sense but whatever","timestamp_created":1567255178,"timestamp_updated":1567255178,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54900598","author":{"steamid":"76561198215020560","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":963,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":963,"last_played":1488698658},"language":"koreana","review":"이걸로입문했는데 스토리가 매우 난해하긴했음\n게임자체는 재미있다만","timestamp_created":1567253550,"timestamp_updated":1567253550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54899207","author":{"steamid":"76561198050498359","num_games_owned":75,"num_reviews":22,"playtime_forever":1784,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1784,"last_played":1567246666},"language":"schinese","review":"简直就是神作！本以为第三部不会超越第一部，没想到光本体就十分惊艳了，DLC海葬的剧情更是强到颅内高潮，这编剧神了。","timestamp_created":1567246867,"timestamp_updated":1567246867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54897631","author":{"steamid":"76561198796361651","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":1895,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1882,"last_played":1612463667},"language":"russian","review":"безусловно одна из моих любимых игр, в которую я могу возвращаться снова и снова. не могу связать с прошлыми биошоками, но как отдельная игра этот продукт выглядит замечательно. с п а с и б о\n\nспустя практически год я все равно вспоминаю об этом шедевре","timestamp_created":1567238924,"timestamp_updated":1575190470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54897458","author":{"steamid":"76561198427252221","num_games_owned":175,"num_reviews":115,"playtime_forever":1473,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":983,"last_played":1567270232},"language":"schinese","review":"玩法: 开创了 女主角与我们是有一种陪伴的关系，这是完全不一样的游戏感受，感觉并不是一个人的游戏\n剧情：一些无限循环的故事用线性的方式演绎出来，一生必玩佳作","timestamp_created":1567237752,"timestamp_updated":1567237752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60187000036239624","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54896743","author":{"steamid":"76561198064694999","num_games_owned":104,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":994,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1615945135},"language":"english","review":"This is not a Bioshock game.

This game builds on the previous titles in almost every conceivable way. The interpersonal stories, the action, the characterization: all have been pushed to their max potential to create another truly unique gaming experience. \n\nAt the same time however, it is also very pleasing to see that at it's core Bioshock: Infinite stays true to it's core premise of mixing history with political discourse to pose a deep social commentary about the world we live in. Where as the original Bioshock argued that Capitalism without empathy or restraint would in time result in Totalitarianism, civil war and ultimately Dominionism when all is said and done; Bioshock: Infinite makes more or less the same statement about Theocracy, racial segregation and the rise of Populism. \n\nBoth games outside of context seem almost prophetic for the way in which many of the attitudes and themes of Bioshock and Bioshock: Infinite may be seen as a reflection of our own troubled times. After all, both games are set in isolated, inward-gazing societies where consumerism dominates, where children are reduced to commodities, and where drug abuses are rampant. Further, they both present the rather sobering opinion that ultimately ANY political ideology will lead to societal collapse when fanaticism is allowed to fester therein. While this \"black mirror\" aspect of video game lore may prove commonplace in the today's modern media climate, somehow Ken Levine and the good people at Irrational Games continue to maintain their messages' sense of impact. Add to this a story-line which traverses alternate universes and time-travel (adding elementary string theory to Bioshock's already academic-level gaming mythology), and as players, we are immediately alerted to Levine's ultimate message through his games: that time and endeavour are cyclical processes and that everything human beings do is merely a repeat of what has come before. To quote KSE frontman Jesse Leech \"Kingdoms will rise to power, but kingdoms fall to dust\", and when all is said and done that's all history has ever really been about.   \n\nIncluding both parts the 'Burial At Sea' DLC also allow players to revisit Rapture (albeit a version of it that has been re-imaged due to inter-dimensional commerce). Knowing that Ken Levine and co. were on such a tight budget when creating the original Bioshock that they didn't even have enough funds to create an original character model for long-term character Brigid Tannenbaum, being able to finally see their vision brought to life with a multi-million dollar mega-budget is quite profound. This is especially true given that Levine's original conceptual idea of his beloved 'sunken city' may have been very different from how it eventually turned out. There's a cheesy, cynical wry humour to the setting which mocks the aesthetics of the time in which the game is set. This was a very common mode of critique in the 1990s - push all the conservative Cold War aesthetics to the point of grotesque so that the whole experience becomes satire. Either way, it is nice to tie down all the loose ends left in the original Bioshock, in addition to learning more about the distinctly human monsters dwelling within. \n\nIt is through these connections, however, that the game's one flaw shines through. Call me a sad fan boy if you must, but considering the Rapture segments are set in 1958, I would have liked to have seen some reference to the events which led to Bioshock 2. True, Ken Levine had absolutely no involvement in the creation of that title. To omit the events surrounding the Subject Delta/Sophia Lamb story-line entirely, however, seems like a disservice, especially given that Elanor Lamb and Elizabeth at times seem like kindred spirits. \n\nRegardless, as someone who has loved the entire Bioshock franchise from the moment he played it (seriously, it's right up there in my favourite franchises list with Street Fighter and Silent Hill), I absolutely adore Bioshock: Infinite. It makes me a little sad at the thought that there might not be another game in the works but at the same time, I'm grateful for the ride and look forward to Ken Levine's next big masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1567143876,"timestamp_updated":1567227964,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.659020304679870605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54879384","author":{"steamid":"76561198928463940","num_games_owned":54,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1291,"last_played":1567142470},"language":"english","review":"THIS IS EASILY THE BEST ONE IN THE SERIES GAME PLAY AND STORY WISE 8/10 ONLY BECAUSE I WAS GETTING BORED AT THE END LIKE I HAVE WITH THE FIRST 2 GAMES.

It would have been a great game!\n\nBut I now remember why I quit the first time. The devs were either stupid or lazy and decided to use an autosave checkpoint system instead of using any form of manual save at all, like it's 200-fucking-1. Which means that if you need to stop for any reason or lose power or it crashes or bugs out or anything, you can lose literally HOURS of time. That first time playing years ago I had to play through the same 3 hour section several times because I either had to leave or the game bugged out. A couple days of this and I said fuck that. Took the game back to the rental place a couple days early and deleted my saves. \n\nNow I find myself doing the same only a couple hours in, but I've already bought it. The damage is done. I can't return it. There aren't even any mods to fix this broken system.\n\nI want to love this game so bad because I'm captivated by the story and the gameplay is really fun.

Es un excelente juego que cualquier persona que disfrute de los juegos con jugabilidad buena, banda sonora buena, gráficos sorprendentes y una historia excelente debería jugar.\n[b]Puntuación:[/b]\nHistoria: 9,8\nGráficos: No se centra en tener gráficos realistas, sino que se centra en ser bueno en lo que quiere ser bueno, y esto se cumple perfectamente. 9\nSonido/Música: 8\nJugabilidad: 8.5\n\nPuntaje final: 9\n\n[h1]💥Trama[/h1]\n\nTomamos el papel de Booker DeWitt, un ex soldado estadounidense, ahora investigador privado, que después de caer en el alcoholismo y en el juego, se llenó de deudas con personas muy peligrosas. Una persona desconocida le ofrece un contrato para limpiar sus deudas a cambio de una chica llamada \"Elizabeth\" , que se encuentra en la ciudad flotante de Columbia. Mientras el juego avanza, la historia no se queda atrás, dándose a conocer cada vez mas hasta llegar al final del juego.\n\nEl juego también trata, a través de su trama, temas como el fanatismo religioso, el racismo, las diferencias sociales, y demás.\n\n[h1]💥Jugabilidad[/h1]\n\nCambia bastante lo que se vio en BioShock 1, y esto causó disgusto en las personas a las que les gustaba el ritmo más pausado y lento de la primera entrega. No veo esto como un problema, incluso la jugabilidad de este juego me gusta tanto como la del 1, y se que a muchas personas les agrada más esta forma de jugar que la otra, y es valido. Lo malo de esto es que si llega al punto en el que te cansa estar luchando cada 1 minuto contra tantos enemigos, o por lo menos molesta un poco, aunque sea en mi caso, pero tampoco es algo muy importante aunque si de tener en cuenta si te gustan más los juegos que se toman su tiempo y que no contienen tanta acción como este. Obviamente conserva los ya conocidos \"Vigorizadores\", que dan muchísimas formas de acabar con los enemigos y de mejorarlos para tener mejores efectos. Las armas no son tan buenas como las de posteriores entregas a mi punto de vista, armas como la ballesta y demás ya no están.\n\n[h1]💥Música[/h1]\n\nEste apartado no tiene nada muy especial, pero logra con su cometido de meternos en la trama y en la época en la que transcurre. Te mete en el juego por completo, y creo yo que eso es lo que el juego busca con este punto, ni más ni menos.\n\n[h1]💥Gráficos y Ambientación[/h1]\n\nEste punto es uno de los más fuertes en este juego. Los gráficos son sencillamente increíbles. Siguen al estilo \"SteamPunk\", estilo artístico que me gusta bastante y que pega perfecto con esta obra. Casi todas las escenas de este juego son sorprendentes, y están conectadas e implementadas perfectamente, porque no es que hay 4 escenas increíbles y están dispersas por todo el trayecto, sino que estas escenas aparecen todo el tiempo, cuando aparece una no tarda en aparecer otra. Columbia sorprende por su diseño, estilo, y escenas \"especiales\", y sabe causar en el jugador exactamente lo que busca.\n\nExcelente juego","timestamp_created":1566610762,"timestamp_updated":1603650171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54766960","author":{"steamid":"76561198139871873","num_games_owned":229,"num_reviews":57,"playtime_forever":906,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":906,"last_played":1566572910},"language":"turkish","review":"Bana göre serinin en iyi ikinci oyunu. İlk iki oyunda da o güzelim şehir Rapture 'u yaşayan bir şehir olarak göremediğim için üzülüyordum. Bu oyunda ise daha farklı ve görkemli bir yaşayan şehirle karşılaşıyoruz ve bu da beni en baştan heyecanlandırdı. Hikaye sunumu ilk oyunlara göre karakterle, onların modellemeleri ve ara sahnelerle desteklenmiş durumda. O tatlı grafiklere söyleyecek herhangi bir söz yok zaten. Atmosfer her zamanki muazzam Bioshock atmosferi. Hikaye ilerleyişinde ufak bir noktada gereksiz dolandırma bulunduğunu düşünüyorum bu da hikayenin bir yerde kopmasına ve akıcılığı bozmasına yol açmış bence.Düz bir yoldaki kasis gibi düşünebiliriz bunu. Buna rağmen yapımcılar yine felsefi bir konuyla karşımızda bulundukları için o kasisi geçtikten sonra asfalt yol yokuşa dönüyor ve oyunun sonuna doğru daha güzel bir hal alıyor. Bütün seriyi en baştan sırasıyla oynamanızı tavsiye ederim. Özellikle bu oyunun DLC'leri bütün seriyi açık ara geçmiş durumda. DLC'lerr oyunun kendisinden katbekat daha güzel. Bunu net bir şekilde söyleyebilirim.

Bioshock Infinite is a standalone title in a franchise that promises immersive gameplay and an even better story. This installment defines what storytelling should look and feel like in a video game. While most of the game follows the often-dreaded escort mission template, it cleverly avoids the tedious task of constantly monitoring an AI companion and makes escorting your partner a meaningful and worthwhile adventure. What the game is lacking in gameplay it makes up for in a complex and interwoven story that pulls no punches. When I replayed the game on Steam, I made a point of collecting every Voxophone to further engage myself in the lore of the world, which guarantees to satisfy anyone looking for a rewarding plot and unexpected twists.
