It has a great story through the whole game as it takes place about 10-20 (Not exactly sure when) years later as you play through under the combines control but later all the people decide to rebel and make a squad know as the rebels in the uprising as you fight through City 17 to stop Dr.Breen. Dr.Breen is the mastermind of the combine who he has the combine try to take Eli Alyx and Gordon. Finally you stop Breen and put an end to has Dark fusion reactor. Also know as his teleporter to another universe. Tired of MW2 or any other gay ass COD? Then pick up this game, and you'll know what a real game this is because games are usually crap, like COD On a scale from 1-10 I would rate this game a good 9.6 as it has a good story and you can pick up stuff and throw it around it's basically a sandbox game with a story to it. God damnit I'm still waiting for Half-Life: 3 to come out, I heard it's coming out with Valve's new source engine along with Left 4 Dead 3. I can't believe that Valve has made great franchises, and this is one of those great classic ones. You can be creative in any way as to how you can kill your enemies, disapate them, make 'em explode, run them over, and one of my most favorite, shooting objects with the Gravity Gun. They don't have that in COD, do they? Nope, didn't think so, now I'm not saying I hate COD, but it's shit compared to Half-Life, and this game wins over COD any day, that's for sure.","timestamp_created":1376319310,"timestamp_updated":1395709550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"5854668","author":{"steamid":"76561198055635794","num_games_owned":210,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":1631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1631,"last_played":1625119938},"language":"english","review":"I like this game.

We meet at last.\nI've been trying to play this game for a while now, and I think now is the time. To talk. To act. To TEACH THE WORLD.\nHalf-Life 2 is an Action/Adventure game where you play as the ever charming Gordan Freeman. Like it's predesessor, Half-Life, the game is completely played in the 1st person. And with the protagonist being mute, this leads to a completely immersive game.\nThe plot of this game isn't as much as amazing as it is intruiging. The layers of plot help thicken it even more that it you would think possible. The game takes place in the classic struggle of alien invaders vs. ragtag group of resistance warriors, but you can't help but feel that something bigger is going on, which makes the game that much more immersive.\nThe gameplay was pretty good. For a game made in 2004, it looks great, too. It also goes and becomes pretty much every game genre ever, but that's just because it's the first game made on the source engine. There were even some really cool, really cinimatic moments where I was like:\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEAH!\"\n\nIn short, good game, but be prepared to spend a lot of time on it.

No one is more deserving of a rest, and all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until... well, let's just say your hour has... come again.\" \n\nHalf Life 2 begins where Half Life 1 left off... only it's been a decade since the Black Mesa incident and Earth has been taken over by a transdimensional alien force known as the Combine. You're thrust into City 17 where the strict and oppressive nature of the Combine becomes immediately apparant, and the presence of the messiah-like Gordon Freeman is all it takes to bring the citizens of the city into an outbreak of rebellion.\n\nHalf Life 2 has delivered the most enthralling experience I have ever had the pleasure to play in any game. Valve has taken big steps to improve the franchise in every way possible since the first iteration of the game. \n\nThe graphics are stunning (and still hold true to this day), the physics engine is brilliant and is implemented intuitively to allow the player to solve puzzles or kill enemies with a wide array of objects within the environment. The characters are more believable, more human, and more personal all thanks to excellent voice acting and the Source Engine's ability to display human facial expressions in great detail. Best of all, the story is expanded to a whole new world of fun and exciting possibilites.\n\nThe gameplay is equally amazing, fully deserving of the praise and legendary reviews. 96 on metacritic alone is hard to come by. \n\nIt took me 11 hours to beat the campaign in a casual playthrough. It has taken me an additional 12-13 hours (23-24 hours total) to beat the campaign a second time for all the achievements (with a guide; it would have taken me a lot longer without one). There is plenty of amazing content, and a lot of replay value. \n\nI can't recommend this game enough to anyone who does not own it yet, or owns it and hasn't played it yet. Be prepared to be wanting more even beyond the expansions of Half Life 2 (Episode One, and Episode Two), and finding yourself among the Half Life 3 conspirators who just can't seem to catch a break.\n\n\"The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world.

Настоящая веха в шутеростроении. В наши дни конечно игра устарела по многим аспектам, но доставляет все так же как и 8 лет назад. Бесконечно уважаю и обожаю данную игру. Пройдена мною бесчисленное кол-во раз, на всех уровнях сложности всеми мыслимыми и не мыслимыми способами. Безпречный продукт, одна из лучших игр всех времен. \n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1374962106,"timestamp_updated":1374962106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":51,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.776837527751922607","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6ZeIkcACe+LcCg=="}
