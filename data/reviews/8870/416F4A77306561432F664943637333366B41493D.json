the Prophet, because he loves the sinner. Love the sinner, because he is you. Without the sinner, what need is there for a redeemer? Without sin, what grace has forgiveness?[/i]\n\nFor a first-person shooter, BioShock Infinite is a surprisingly deep game. The passage above is only the first audio diary that you get to pick up maybe 10 minutes into the story; I mean, if you're a pholosophy major and it looks like childish scribbles for you, then go read your \"Critique of Pure Reason\" or whatever, but I'm genuinely impressed with the caliber of moral and social issues raised in this game's narrative. You get to ponder on racism, tyranny, religious bigotry, relationships within family, amongst other trivial things like quantum physics and intertwined realities – and it doesn't feel old or tired [i]at all[/i].\n\nNow, other people have already told you how gorgeous this game is, and how great of a job everyone did at voice acting, and everything about the gripping story with its [i]shocking[/i] end – but have you heard of Elizabeth? She will keep you company almost from start to finish, and she is the best follower imaginable – just look at all the things she can do:\n\n❤ When a Motorised Patriot barrages you with suppressing fire from his heavy machine gun and spouts some religious rubbish in the process – [i]\"My aim is true, as my eye is the Prophet's!\"[/i] – you take [b]a lot[/b] of damage. Oh boy, the screen goes a bit dimmer and you hear your own heartbeat slowing down – who shall come to your rescue? \"Patch yourself up!\", she says, and throws you a health kit. Wait, where is the key to your heart? Has it just been stolen?\n\n❤ When a soldier with an RPG is standing right in front of you, reloading, preparing to end your miserable life with a single shot, and you see \"[b]out of ammo[/b]\" written right there in bloody crimson – who will give you a magazine full of answers to all of your problems? \"I found ammo!\", she says, and you begin contemplating a marriage proposal.\n\n❤ \"Got empty pockets? Best keep on walking...\" – this is how automated vending machines mock you time and time again, but everything changes as soon as Elizabeth throws you a shipload of cash she found lying around so that you can buy all of the sweets in the supermarket. Moreover, if you spend a hefty sum of money purchasing upgrades, she will immediately give you a couple hundred bucks – it's almost as if she doesn't want you to feel bad about this whole \"empty pockets\" thing. Hm-m, come to think of it, it's almost as if the developers [i]wanted you to like her...[/i] Strange...\n\nOn a side note, the Artwork section in this game's Community Hub is permanently disabled, since various artists all over the world have created a bunch of non-family-friendly content featuring her. I guess it's a shame that such an influential and well-written character is being reduced to a... promiscuous woman, but I get it. Not my first day on the Internet!\n\nAnyway, Elizabeth is also quite fast (faster that you at times), which means that you won't have to stand and wait for her. Crazy, I know, but there is more – if you find a lockpick, she can open a safe, and guess what's inside? Is it Christmas or something?\n\nIn conclusion, these two reasons alone – great storytelling and Liz herself – are enough for you to buy this game and have about 30 hours of fun with the main story, or up to 60 if you want to complete 3 DLCs and earn all the achievements. One of them – Blue Ribbon Champ – is incredibly challenging and totally random, so, good luck with that.","timestamp_created":1593428113,"timestamp_updated":1593428113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545062601566314697","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71643116","author":{"steamid":"76561198145947967","num_games_owned":290,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2783,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2783,"last_played":1575210977},"language":"schinese","review":"第九艺术的标杆！！","timestamp_created":1593427681,"timestamp_updated":1593427681,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71639962","author":{"steamid":"76561198806905602","num_games_owned":73,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":965,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":829,"last_played":1624109581},"language":"schinese","review":"我这辈子再玩海葬dlc就是shabee，Why did you take my daughter's life！！！！！！！！！！Fuck you！！！！！","timestamp_created":1593424147,"timestamp_updated":1593450900,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71639899","author":{"steamid":"76561198131734950","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":727,"last_played":1593421973},"language":"english","review":"One of the best stroyline video game I had ever played.

was both hyped and antsy about playing this right after the disappointment of Bioshock 2, but it more than fulfilled my expectations. I hold it in very close regard as to Bioshock 1. The world-building, plot, and characters of this game are far more interesting. I cared about most of the important characters, especially Elizabeth. Just like Bioshock 1 I listened to every Audio Diary and explored most of what I could. The world of Columbia is much more vibrant than Rapture, and I enjoyed it more. The much larger world allows you to see the dynamics of Columbia, especially it's class and racial disparity. Infinite will beat you over the head with early 1900s racial dynamics, and even show ridiculous shit like phrenology a couple times. The slums of America, especially during the turn of the 20th century are depicted as you would expect. The counter force of this is embodied in the Vox Populi, loosely based on the Red Army Faction in West Germany. Unlike Bioshock 2, this portrayal is more coherent and grounded, whether or not you decide to interpret this as criticism or both sides-ism. The parallel to the House of Romanov was among one of the most interesting events in Infinite. Any attempt to dive further into the actual plot is spoiler ridden, and in short, it is that confusing, but also interesting. My largest criticism with this game is the departure to Cover-based Shooter this game took. The addition of a recharging shield, removal of portable first aid kits and eve syringes, leads to a more derivative gameplay experience. The game feels quite smooth, but I would much prefer Bioshock 2's methods if they were polished up a bit more. The use of Vigors are the best incarnation of Plasmids by far in my view, they are simple yet elaborate. I used a much greater variety of the Vigors than Plasmids in previous games, but perhaps a lower number due to the lack of portable syringes in favor of Salt. Elizabeth giving the player Health, Salt, and Ammo is also a great addition in order to have Elizabeth not be useless or a burden. Overall, great game. In addition, Burial At Sea is one of the best DLC's I have ever played. And together this make's Bioshock Infinite not only a fitting end to Bioshock, but a worthy end.","timestamp_created":1593396889,"timestamp_updated":1593396995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"71616066","author":{"steamid":"76561198237321804","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":493,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":493,"last_played":1573382899},"language":"turkish","review":"Bioshock infinite sadece iyi bir oyun olmakla kalmiyor, bu oyun belkide gelmiş geçmiş en iyi oyunlardan biri. Eğer diğer Bioshock oyunlarını oynadıysanız ve \"İlk iki oyun birbirine çok benziyor üçüncüde bayar\" diyorsanız bu oyuna kesinlikle bir şans vermelisiniz. Temelde biraz aynı dursada infinitenin ydiğer oyunlardan farklı yaptığı iki tane şey var, biri oynanıştaki hızlılık diğeri de atmosfer ve bu iki fark aslında temelde aynı olan oyunu size öyle bir yansıtıyorki tamamen farklı oyunlar gibi hissettiriyor. Combattan başlarsak combattaki yeniliğin combata katılan hız olduğunu söylemiştim, combata hızı katan şey ise ulaşım aracı yerine de geçen tekerlekli eldiveniniz. Bu eldivenle artık combatta üstlerde bulunan çubuklarda kayabiliyorsunuz ve bu eldivenle kayma olayı oyunu gerçekten çok eğlenceli yapıyor. İlk kez bu oyunda eklenmese de oyundaki büyü mantığı hakkında da konuşmamız gerek. Diğer bioshock oyunlarında olduğu gibi bu oyunda da vigor isimli büyüleriniz var ve diğer oyunlardakilere göre çok daha kullanışlılar ve havalılar. Yani kısaca oyunun combatı gayet iyi, fakat combatı sevmeyen bir sürü insan olmuş o yüzden tek beklentiniz combat ise bu oyundan uzak durun çünkü dediğim gibi combat güzel değil diyen de var o yüzden sevmeme ihtimaliniz de var. Atmosfer ve müziklerden bahsedecek olursak ikisi de şahane. Oyun sizi diğer bioshockların su altında bulunan klostrofobik ve gerilimli rapture şehrinden alıp bulutlar arasındaki columbia şehrine götürüyor ve tuhaftırki bu oyun açık dünya olmamasına rağmen belkide bütün açık dünya oyunlarından çok daha canlı bir dünyası var, nasıl yapabilmişler bende anlamadım. Ve sıra geldi bu oyunu alma sebebiniz olması gerektiğini düşündüğüm hikayeye. Hikaye direkt olarak verilmiyor diye şikayet eden insanlar olmuş ama aslında hikaye size vereceğini veriyor sadece detaycı insanlar için arkasında bir lore bırakıyor. Ama merak etmeyin o loreyi araştırmasanız da ana hikaye anlaşılıyor ve bir oyunda anlatılan en kaliteli hikayelerden birini deneyimliyorsunuz.

In addition, I did NOT experience the technical issues that I had with BioShock Remastered, and noticed that others had with BioShock 2 (I played the BioShock 2 on console to avoid this).\n\nIt took me around 12 hours to beat the game on Medium, having explored a decent part of the optional content in the base game (no expansion game content).  Honestly I consider this to be the best game of the BioShock trilogy, which is tough for a sequel to do!  The professional reviewers all give this game praise, so I'll simply remark that the game does a great job of being detail-oriented in its brand new environment in the skies.  Also, while you do have a major NPC character alongside you for a good portion of the game, it is NOT BABYSITTING at all, and that character can handle themselves.  Playing the first two games in the series is not necessary to have fun with this game, as it's a completely new plot, environment, and characters.
