Для любителей риска и особых трудностей предусмотрены соответствующие режимы игры, так что в этом плане скучать не придётся. Игра простая и, на мой взгляд, как раз хороша тогда, когда хочется чего-то активного, совместного, и в то же время не особо напряжённого... \n\nРадует наличие диалогов между персонажами, с помощью их звучания можно создавать особое настроение в игре, что придаёт ей особую приятную и ЖИВУЮ окраску. \nЧто немаловажно именно здесь!.. :)\n\nА вот механика игры  - тут на любителя. Лично мне ужасно недостаёт дополнения в функции управления: хочется больше мобильности, больше активных действий, соответственно - больше кнопок. Без этого теряется возможность лучше реализовать себя в бою, да и на динамике игры сильно сказывается не в лучшую сторону. \nНо это лично на мой вкус. Так что минус это или плюс - зависит от ваших ожиданий, ваших предпочтений и вашего восприятия. Говоря же о минусах объективно, с грустью отмечу, что карт для игры мало. И их действительно мало, хочется большего простора в выборе. Что касается минусов, сказать мне больше нечего. Игра замечательная.\n\n  Желаю вам приятно провести время, расчищая свой путь от...  ну, увидите, от кого :)","timestamp_created":1417332500,"timestamp_updated":1418721823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511934101581573486","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13156541","author":{"steamid":"76561198029748488","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4268,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4135,"last_played":1416777470},"language":"english","review":"Great fast paced zombie slasher.","timestamp_created":1417327792,"timestamp_updated":1417327792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13153400","author":{"steamid":"76561198098560844","num_games_owned":164,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":526,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":295,"last_played":1478994832},"language":"spanish","review":"Es muy buen juego, otra joya de valve.\nAunque tiene pocas armas para escoger, tiene varias misiones extensas.\nLo recomiendo mucho\n\nCalificacion:\n8/10","timestamp_created":1417311903,"timestamp_updated":1417311903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"13150185","author":{"steamid":"76561198076520668","num_games_owned":209,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":3511,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3709,"last_played":1531152620},"language":"english","review":"Great game.

The gamer community that plays it however, sucks as human beings. Very noob-unfriendly, and you can expect your angry teammates to either kill you, kick you within 5 minutes, or both. Or ridicule you and laugh as they watch you die, rather than come revive you. Seems to be about 70-80% of the players are a-holes, and take winning far too seriously. You do meet the occasional player who's actually fun to play with. \n\nFrankly, everyone pays to play. It sucks for noobs who are constantly kicked as it makes it harder for them to actually improve. Especially, because there are many times that there might only be one room in versus mode. That means if you get kicked from that lobby, you're SOL on getting anymore time in for a while.","timestamp_created":1416125235,"timestamp_updated":1416125235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531062126159667969","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12960448","author":{"steamid":"76561198039227757","num_games_owned":717,"num_reviews":79,"playtime_forever":1363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1197,"last_played":1641533261},"language":"english","review":"[b]This is the good Left 4 Dead[/b]\n\nThis is the L4D that does a good job of portraying that Zombie Movie feel that the game was supposed to have.
