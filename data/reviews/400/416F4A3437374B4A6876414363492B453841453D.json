Not played anything like it. High replay value I would suspect like the Half-Life game, to get faster and better in each level. Short, but I played this slowly over time, whilst enjoying the beauty in the visual graphic and laughter through the dialogue. Never knew the writing was so well done, surprising. \nUplifting and the humour once again I have not seen before also fitting right into a completely new world I enjoyed exploring. Worthy of purchase on sales or whatever. So happy I played this. This game will produce great memories while using mechanics not seen in other games with interactivity being  a key part of the game. 10/10 Can't wait to get into Portal 2. \nYes for how short it is it has all of the story it needs and then some as well.","timestamp_created":1581052019,"timestamp_updated":1581052019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63086906","author":{"steamid":"76561198405383849","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2420,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":554,"last_played":1632968444},"language":"spanish","review":"por mas antiguo que sea no deja de ser divertido para mi, si no lo haz jugado te recomiendo jugarlo, no es tan largo pero es bueno","timestamp_created":1581050464,"timestamp_updated":1581050464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63086848","author":{"steamid":"76561198325755888","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":439,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":269,"last_played":1642140420},"language":"schinese","review":"剧情不是很长，彩蛋也不是很多，但是，很棒","timestamp_created":1581050348,"timestamp_updated":1581050348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63085437","author":{"steamid":"76561198813312531","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":368,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1616448338},"language":"schinese","review":"说实话传送门2比1好玩","timestamp_created":1581047457,"timestamp_updated":1581047457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63084810","author":{"steamid":"76561198830697142","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":1285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1,"playtime_at_review":686,"last_played":1659936759},"language":"english","review":"*raido morse code noise*","timestamp_created":1581046136,"timestamp_updated":1581046136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63082090","author":{"steamid":"76561198367063522","num_games_owned":63,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":203,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":202,"last_played":1581041729},"language":"schinese","review":"有些关卡还是很有趣的","timestamp_created":1581040467,"timestamp_updated":1581040467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63081139","author":{"steamid":"76561198097789723","num_games_owned":117,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":547,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":405,"last_played":1581047234},"language":"english","review":"Best puzzle game out there..","timestamp_created":1581038420,"timestamp_updated":1581038420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"63077499","author":{"steamid":"76561198875567731","num_games_owned":1151,"num_reviews":123,"playtime_forever":151,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":151,"last_played":1581027861},"language":"english","review":"Still brilliant in 2020.\n\nIf I had to pick only one game to demonstrate how good computer games can be as a medium I wouldn't be wrong if I picked Portal.

That said, you'll be spending most of your time in very similar looking, small environments, which can be a bit claustrophobic, and flying through portals can often be disorienting (especially when inertia comes into play). I was also unable to find an FOV setting that didn't make me nauseous after a few minutes of play. So if you tend to be succeptible to motion sickness, you might want to give this one a pass.

After the story is done new challenge levels are unlocked. These extras are six levels that you've already played. The difference is that they have new challenges associated with them.\n\nLevels demand a mixture of skills, all of which make use of portals in some way and your new tool when you acquire it. Most exciting are the sections that rely on momentum, which is conserved as you travel through portals. Place an entrance at ground level and an exit high up on a wall and step through the lower portal, either by simply dropping into it or falling from a height. You can use this to almost fly across some levels. Instead of letting yourself hit the ground, you can shoot a portal under your feet to catch you and continue through the air from wherever your last portal was left. \n\nValve has created a masterpiece, honestly. If you like puzzle games with a story and rememberable characters, the portal games are for you. It's worth the standard price, without a question, but if money is tight, it can be picked up cheap in other stores or on sale. Honestly, if puzzle games aren't your norm, I still recommend it for it's story.","timestamp_created":1580859096,"timestamp_updated":1580859096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567695975303649902","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62979748","author":{"steamid":"76561198035374153","num_games_owned":145,"num_reviews":96,"playtime_forever":543,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":166,"last_played":1618441179},"language":"english","review":"Short, but really good.","timestamp_created":1580851873,"timestamp_updated":1580851873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62977696","author":{"steamid":"76561198132082872","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":369,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":234,"last_played":1580915809},"language":"english","review":"Epic","timestamp_created":1580848194,"timestamp_updated":1580848194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62977541","author":{"steamid":"76561198352109818","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1095,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":782,"last_played":1639429177},"language":"polish","review":"Serdecznie polecam tę grę!\nJeśli lubisz zagadki logiczne w ciekawy sposób połączone z tajemniczą i interesującą fabułą ta gra jest dla ciebie!\nNa plus zasługuje również cena i dość wysoka jakość wykonania samej gry, jest przyjemna i wciągająca oraz wręcz usiana easter eggami.

Free Review\n\nPros: \n- Gameplay is fun, innovative, and unique, allowing for puzzles and experimentation that hasn't really been done in any other video game before or since. Thinking with Portals is always fun and solving the puzzles of the test chambers are always satisfying, especially when you manage to do something you previously thought wasn't going to work. Unlike a lot of other puzzle games, Portal rewards and expects outside the box thinking.\n- Wonderful Story and Setting. I love the vaguely creepy and minimalist look of the game and also adore how it fits so well with the gameplay. This in combination with the fantastic writing and voice acting compliments stellar gameplay design.\n- Amazing Soundtrack: Has some of the best music in video game history despite only really having a handful of songs throughout the whole game. The ending song will always and forever evoke fond memories of this game for me.\n- After completing the main story mode, there is still plenty to do if you haven't had your fill of portal puzzles. Extra goodies include a commentary mode that let's you learn more about the making of the game, extra challenge modes, and even easter eggs and special achievements.\nCons: \n- That there isn't more. Luckily there is Portal 2\n- Being a puzzle game, there unfortunately isn't much to replaying the game outside of speedruns and trips down memory lane. While the quality of the game can still be enjoyed even after knowing how to get through the game, it still isn't the same as trying to make your way through the puzzles for the first time. However this is more a flaw in the puzzle game genre itself rather than Portal as a game.\nConclusion: \nObjectively not only one of the best video games made by Valve, but one of the best in the FPS and Puzzle genres. This game still can hold its own against modern day titles and deserves its spot both as one of the best video games of all time, but also as a bitter-sweet reminder of Valve's glory days. As of writing this review, only time will tell if Valve will ever make a full return to developing games, but even if that never happens we will still have this masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1580794692,"timestamp_updated":1580794692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62943130","author":{"steamid":"76561198210716401","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":660,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":660,"last_played":1563945444},"language":"tchinese","review":"台灣郎，你們要學學阿半。","timestamp_created":1580791636,"timestamp_updated":1580791636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62941606","author":{"steamid":"76561198822132644","num_games_owned":121,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":291,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":218,"last_played":1582185089},"language":"latam","review":"Increible Juego e Increible historia.\n","timestamp_created":1580788595,"timestamp_updated":1580788595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62936749","author":{"steamid":"76561198356768540","num_games_owned":171,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":2859,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1697,"last_played":1657912670},"language":"english","review":"Very fun and easy to speedrun after a while of playing","timestamp_created":1580778247,"timestamp_updated":1580778247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"62935060","author":{"steamid":"76561198435058862","num_games_owned":127,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":4950,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":157,"last_played":1615325303},"language":"english","review":"This game is a classic, and it definitely deserves that title.
