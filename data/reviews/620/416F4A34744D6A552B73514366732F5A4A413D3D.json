You'll feel smart when you solve it!\n2.Non-violent FPS, breath of fresh air!\n3.Beautifully and professionally executed. Gameplay mechanics, physics engine, flow, pace, story, sound, texture mapping and art are flawless.\n4.It will really make you laugh, it leaves you with a good feeling and wanting to come back for more.\n5.Map creator makes the game virtually endless.\n6.Multiplayer will make you cooperate, think and communicate.\n7.This game is not an automatic FPS experience, it makes you use your reflexes like any good FPS should, but also makes you use your brain. \n8.Improves over Portal 1 in that smaller percentages of surface are \"portal surfaces\", that plus more gameplay features like colored gels offers variety and more challenge over Portal 1.\n\nWorst things about it:\n1.While it seems original and never-been-done-before, the core mechanics of it is based on an earlier game called \"Narbacular Drop\" and the colored gels are taken from the earlier game \"Tag: The Power of Paint\". It is not so much a negative as Portal is a well executed big-budget mix of earlier indie games, but it did take away from my appreciation of the originality of this game. Many indie games have great ideas that are not able to be fully executed.\n2.The environments are closed-in, you will experience room after room after room, after room. Although it might seem monotonous and claustrophobic, perhaps even divorsed from reality and the outside world, it is not entirely so as there are surprises along the way that change the game path, liven thing up so to speak, and advance the story. This itself is an improvement on Portal 1, as you will experience more of the world of Portal than in Portal 1.\n\nThe bottom line:\nThere are not many negatives to this game, and a lot of positives. Not being a pure FPS might seem as a weakness but it is a strength as it will appeal to another side of your gaming brain and a wider pool of players. It makes it more relevant in the present and future world of gaming.\n\n","timestamp_created":1396155606,"timestamp_updated":1396155606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9671341","author":{"steamid":"76561198095305414","num_games_owned":199,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":975,"last_played":1448780658},"language":"english","review":"yes","timestamp_created":1396153091,"timestamp_updated":1396153091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9670741","author":{"steamid":"76561198000243814","num_games_owned":200,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":1825,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1825,"last_played":1347087600},"language":"english","review":"Man, when Cave Johnson blew up the Spiderman's uncle with the Lemons, I knew shit would get real.","timestamp_created":1396147495,"timestamp_updated":1396147495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9669983","author":{"steamid":"76561198060361063","num_games_owned":65,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":853,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":853,"last_played":1396293168},"language":"english","review":"companion cube dispensers randomly get jammed wtf","timestamp_created":1396141936,"timestamp_updated":1396141936,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.236763179302215576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9669467","author":{"steamid":"76561198118053906","num_games_owned":254,"num_reviews":103,"playtime_forever":5639,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2870,"last_played":1600498543},"language":"english","review":"Edit: I was really bad at analyzing games seven years ago. I don't feel liking deleting or changing this though.\n\nAlthough the game is more than 5 years old, Portal 2 is still good to this day. The puzzles, (as long as you don't know the solution) are very intuitive and thought provoking. Not to mention, that the addition to the gel, gravity beams, etc. Are interesting and is a great puzzle mechanic besides just cubes, buttons, and portals. The graphics are still acceptable to this day, but concidering Portal 2 came out in 2007, it was amazing at the time. The addition of co-op is ingenious, irrelevant if you actually have a friend to play with or not, should still be a welcome thing. Not to mention, when you DO have a friend to play with, and assuming they actually cooperate (Get it, co-op?), it is very fun, probably even more than the single player game. Speaking of single player, the main campain is very interesting, and the story is interesting, with a midway plot twist, and technically a side-plot. Completing the game, (In other words, getting all of the acheivments) Is very possible and actually kind of fun to do. It's almost like trying to find all of the content compared to actually using  ~ amazing skills ~ to get any of the achievments. (Except for the time trails). The community maps can add difficulty to those who actually want the difficulty, instead of the achievments. Want a hard, almost impossible puzzle? Look through some of the community maps. Or make one, that works too.\nAnyways, the music works really well with the atmosphere of the game. The music typically comes up whenever you happen to come across a puzzle, especially in the test chambers. What I loved about the music in Portal 2 is when you are flying through the air, whether because of the blue or orange gel, or because of the launch pads, overlapping music that would sound awesome on its own matching the existing music and it sounds great! The music itself sounds amazing to. The techno music fits the futuristic, robot apocalyptic atmosphere perfectly. The atmosphere itself makes the game just standout not only as a puzzle game, but as an adventure game, too. One of the main reasons I didn't go insane while I was trying to figure out a puzzle is the story, which is amazing on its own right. The story, (No spoilers don't worry) is set in a robotic apocalyptic setting, where the robots have taken over. You are a lab rat, going through experiment after experiment. Things have changed since the first game though. Everything is rotten, plants are overgrowing alot of it, and everything just seems discombobulated (is that a word?); and the atmosphere reflects this perfectly.\n\nOverall, the game is very good, but for me, it was short lived. But, with Co-op and community maps, and the workshop enabled, this game can last quite a while. Even if you do play the entire game in one sitting, I guarantee that one sitting would last for more than 24 hours.","timestamp_created":1396137922,"timestamp_updated":1624921858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534539580345153809","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9669464","author":{"steamid":"76561198074710007","num_games_owned":177,"num_reviews":17,"playtime_forever":627,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":420,"last_played":1451495774},"language":"spanish","review":"Juegazo sin duda, un gran Puzzle que continúa perfectamente Portal.

El extra del modo cooperativo y poder jugar a pruebas que crean otros usuarios, además de poder creearlas tu mismo, lo hace algo perfecto en todos los aspectos.

As the game progresses, he/she is introduced to the game's identifying elements: the isolation placed upon the player by the enviroment, the Portal Gun, and GLADOS.\n\nThe player feels incredibly alone in this game: aside from Wheatley and GLADOS, the tester's assistant's voice and Cave Johnson's voice are the only other additional human elements in the game. He/she is left to solve the many puzzles that obstruct your path one after the other. As the game progresses, he/she is introduced to more and more puzzle elements, leading toward challenging \"test chambers\" by the end of the game. The dreary soundtrack and lack of noise from Mother Nature leave the player to himself/herself and to solving the puzzle. The world manages to immerse the player in the deserted yet oddly realistic world that is Aperture Laboratories.\n\nSolving \"test chambers\" relies on the player utilizing the Portal Gun to the fullest. The Portal Gun, introduced to the player early in the game, allows him/her to teleport to various locations within a chamer in order to solve it. Passing through these chambers requires creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, and coordination: portals summoned by the Portal Gun maintain the velocity of anyone or anything flying through them.\n\nGLADOS is a main character in the game but is not the guiding light to the plot like in [i]Portal[/i]. In [i]Portal 2[/i], the guiding light in the plot lies between the conflict with Wheatley and GLADOS; as the player advances in the game, he/she will learn what fueled this conflict and what its impact is on the story.\n\nWhen one is finished with the singleplayer, [i]Portal 2[/i] has additional content to keep the user busy. Challenge Mode offers the player the chance to complete an already solved puzzle in the fastest and most efficient way possible, focusing on using as little time and as few Portals as possible.\n\nIn addition, the game's multiplayer mode is as solid as the singleplayer mode. The multiplayer is an extension to the singleplayer story; the main characters are GLADOS and her two robotic test subjects Atlas and P-Body. Atlas and P-Body are tasked with working together to solve \"test chambers\" that are otherwise unsolvable with only one person around. The emphasis on coordination is vital to winning the game; since the story is strictly two-man co-op, it is imperative that both players have an idea of what to do.\n\nTIP: Keep a voice chat with your co-op buddy. One way of starting a voice chat is by clicking the arrow in the Steam overlay's chat window and clicking \"Start Voice Chat.\"\n\nAfter completing both the singleplayer and multiplayer game, the adventure does not stop. Ever since the game was linked with the Steam Workshop with the Perpetual Testing Iniative update in 2011, users have been submitting their own test chambers left and right. Many of these chambers are challenging and take liberties with level standards as well as throw in their own style in utilizing the game's elements. The game provides a level creation tool which is rather comprehensive; however, more sophisticated levels can be developed using the Hammer tool, a piece of software found in the Source SDK (Windows only).\n\nThe only problem I found with this game is that certain puzzles were hard; however, these puzzles were hard simply because I wasn't a great problem solver that time. Upon watching a walkthrough for the chambers I was stuck on, I realized that there was a practical solution to each and every one of them. Playing more puzzles allows players to become better at this game, and there are no levels in either of the main games that involve impossible-to-execute solutions.\n\nI recommend this game highly to anyone interested in puzzle games in general. Valve has made this game have well-crafted and solvable levels and worlds, amazing aesthetics, a great soundtrack, and a sense of eternal fun. It is worth investing the twenty dollars as the experience is [u]truly[/u] unforgettable.\n\n[b][i]Portal 2[/i] is a puzzle game classic of the 2000's that should not be missed.[/b]\n\n10/10. A+. 100%.\nP.S.

The puzzles this game contains are never frustrating but based on pure logic and, well, common sense! Portal 2 is a mighty mixture of minimalism, simplicity but, under that sci-fi surface, it's a complex game full of depth and an immersive storyline - Aperture Science Enrichment Centre, the colossal science nexus in which the game and its puzzles are set, is as real to me as the corner-shop down the road. In short, I thoroughly enjoyed this game for its simplicity, awesome game mechanics, original storyline, voices (Cave Johnson is not a voice - he is an experience) and originality. Would I recommend this game? I'd be a fool not to. If you are not acquainted with the 'role playing puzzle genre', or whatever you wish to call it, that should not shy you away from trying this masterpiece - I was a complete novice when I started but, as soon as I commenced, I knew that there was no exagerration in the reviews I had read - a Top 3 game for me...and indeed a Top 3 game for any sane gamer. :)","timestamp_created":1395768516,"timestamp_updated":1395768516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9626854","author":{"steamid":"76561198084523073","num_games_owned":129,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":912,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":330,"last_played":1488982331},"language":"russian","review":"Очень интересная игра,хочу играть онлайн,но не с кем","timestamp_created":1395765107,"timestamp_updated":1395765107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"9626833","author":{"steamid":"76561198079525378","num_games_owned":464,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1072,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":483,"last_played":1486808602},"language":"russian","review":"игра для мозгов!
