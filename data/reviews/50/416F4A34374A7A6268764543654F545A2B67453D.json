Yeah there's bits that are good and I did find it enjoyable but towards the end when certain types of enemies start spawning in groups it really sucked any enjoyment out of it and just became frustrating. Also the night vision is AWFUL and exactly the same colour as the crosshair. Ropes are terrible though I had figured them out sufficiently by the final section. I like this game as an expansion to Half Life main story that shows you a little of what's going on elsewhere but I can't actually tell you for definite what the story of this one was (as opposed to Blue Shift which is also just a little side story). Also G-Man continues to be annoying and lurking in windows whilst, idk, the entire floor collapses into a pool of radioactive waste and you have to escape fast, and G-Man is just there. Lurking. Staring.\n\ntl;dr I realise I probably didn't like this game and I am probably not going to replay this game ever again but would recommend if Half Life is a thing you like and this is on sale.","timestamp_created":1585768660,"timestamp_updated":1585768660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66364504","author":{"steamid":"76561198846829667","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":603,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":525,"last_played":1622934389},"language":"english","review":"it good","timestamp_created":1585766248,"timestamp_updated":1585766248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66363739","author":{"steamid":"76561198085871501","num_games_owned":41,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":1689,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":935,"last_played":1614459249},"language":"english","review":"a clasic","timestamp_created":1585765571,"timestamp_updated":1585765571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66349658","author":{"steamid":"76561198888604702","num_games_owned":106,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":341,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":228,"last_played":1585794378},"language":"english","review":"Just play it, please","timestamp_created":1585753638,"timestamp_updated":1585753638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66331033","author":{"steamid":"76561199025209580","num_games_owned":8,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":208,"last_played":1585737008},"language":"russian","review":"На***а так много оружия это п****ц?????","timestamp_created":1585737520,"timestamp_updated":1585737520,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.445945948362350464","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66317398","author":{"steamid":"76561198063887268","num_games_owned":61,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":641,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":641,"last_played":1585722520},"language":"english","review":"It's good.

There are also interesting new weapon concepts. Also the boot camp tutorial is extremely well done, and it's probably the highlight of the game.\n\nUnfortunately for the expansion, all the new concepts are very poorly integrated. For example, climbable ropes appear maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire game. In another case, 2 new types of suit rechargers are teased in the tutorial, military and civilian, and I only saw the military recharger once (I didn't find a single civilian recharger).\n\nHealth and suit power pickups are very scarce, and you are often thrown into hordes of enemies. There's one section where you're in a pitch-black maze and are meant to face off against many miniboss-tier enemies, with no ammo or health pickups. On the very last level, you face off against hordes of black-ops, at which point i turned on noclip and godmode because I was tired of this.\n\nAt one point, multiple new weapons are introduced very close to each other, with little instructions on how to use them, so I finished the game with about 3 weapons I ended up never using. \n\nThese complaints are just a very small slice of annoyances I had with the expansion. However, I don't feel like writing, so I'll stop here.\n\nBlue shift is a much better expansion, go play that instead.","timestamp_created":1585331067,"timestamp_updated":1590357360,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.468674242496490479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65946367","author":{"steamid":"76561198120660427","num_games_owned":243,"num_reviews":149,"playtime_forever":278,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":278,"last_played":1585327202},"language":"english","review":"Recommended if you appreciate the other Half life games, just watch out for bugs.","timestamp_created":1585327255,"timestamp_updated":1585327255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65936212","author":{"steamid":"76561198031420026","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":722,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":662,"last_played":1652411839},"language":"english","review":"best expansion  package ever\n","timestamp_created":1585318019,"timestamp_updated":1585318019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"65923097","author":{"steamid":"76561198169316021","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":113,"playtime_forever":305,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":305,"last_played":1585304754},"language":"english","review":"A rather enjoyable expansion, Half Life: Opposing force takes a different and rather enjoyable route than the base storyline playing as one of the 'factions' Gordon is tasked up against fighting out of Black Mesa.

The self-styled intellectual elite, attempting to push their own petty agendas on the rest of us, invented the idea of \"foreigners\" to lay a guilt trip on the rest of the country.\nFACT: Nothing exists outside the US! There is only vast ocean, we occupy the entirety of Pangea. (The existence of multiple continents is yet another liberal myth, which we'll discuss next time).\nFACT: Although the \"foreigners\" lie was created and popularized by liberals, it has recently been picked up by conservatives. The Bush administration relies heavily on scare tactics involving hostile \"foreigners\" as a way of grabbing unconstitutional levels of power.\nFACT: You may meet people in daily life who claim to be \"foreigners\" and illegal \"immigrants\". These people are merely telling you that false story because they're trying to get out of paying taxes.\nFACT: \"Foreign\" languages are simply elaborate codes used by spies to talk in secret. These spies are everywhere, and they are determined to steal your genes for use in horrible cloning experiments. Don't trust anyone who speaks a \"foreign\" language!\nFACT: The word \"foreign\" comes from the combination of \"for\" and \"reign\". The word was invented for reign-for perpetuating the reign of dishonest liberals and unconstitutional governments.
