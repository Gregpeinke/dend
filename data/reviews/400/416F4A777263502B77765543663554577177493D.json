came out well over 10 years ago. It was a big deal at the time. I never played it. Since then I have played many games that reference jokes and rooms from Portal, so they longer I left it, the less I felt the need to play it. But this weekend I was in the mood, so gave it a shot.\n\nThe story is, you wake up in a test chamber, and a disembodied voice makes you do puzzles or die. Eventually you break out. The boss fight at the end sucks, like all boss fights. I'm not a big fan of the overall level design either, because it feels like you're railroaded down one particular solution, even after you escape the test chambers. It feels contrived that you can't just open a portal wherever, you have to do it on the magic spot the level designers intended, usually in an awkward position where you need to repeat the same platforming bit over and over. But despite the annoying puzzles and platforming sections, the story is neat. The script and voice acting of the antagonists is truly masterful. Worth a buy when it's on sale since it's an important piece of gaming history, but don't expect too much playing it today after Stanley Parable and the like.","timestamp_created":1604302028,"timestamp_updated":1604302028,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474452555179595947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"78574619","author":{"steamid":"76561198838141543","num_games_owned":40,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":162,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":162,"last_played":1604217268},"language":"russian","review":"Валф хорошо сделали говололомку, так что в игру интересно и сложно играть.
