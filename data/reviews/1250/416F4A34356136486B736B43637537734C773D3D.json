I decided to redo, this review as my old one was 'Yes, Killing floor is the best' i thought that didnt give enough reasoning for people to buy the game but that was back in 2014 and nows 2017so let me review this product from the top of my mind as i havent played it for awhile, well this game provided some fun for 14 hours, now i would say its pretty glitchly and does have alot of bugs, i would recommend mods and also playing with friends as it gets very boring alone, i quit this game after Killing Floor 2 came out and this game stopped reciving updates, if you go to get any Killing Floor game get Killer floor 2 but if you already have that then, i do recommend buying this game, just for the kind of V1 style and feel the og killing floor.\n\nHopes this help some of you

A co-op 6 player survival horror game? Ha, I'm a one man team over here. Anyways get ready to slay a ton of undead and deadly creatures as try to survive this weird but very addicting apocalypse. The game itself reminided me of black ops zombies when your trying to survive from the undead as they try to kill you and eat your flesh. The rounds in Killing Floor are pretty intense, zombies tin to spawn out of nowhere making it hard for you to aim your gun at a target. And of course depending on with mode your on only makes it more difficult then before. Here a pro tip: Don't stand in one place, nowhere is safe just keep moving. This is where one of my favorite quotes, \"The Struggle Is Real\" comes in. After each round the traders shop opens up and you can stock up on ammo or buy a new heavy gun, But there is a limit to the amount of guns you can have. Killing Floor is a game that is very awesome and very brutal, it shouldn't be lefted out. This is a great zombie game, I can't wait for the second game to come on steam.
