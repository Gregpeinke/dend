Playing on hard was challenging, but not frustrating apart from the occasional Worms-esque moment when an enemy throws a grenade vertically 15ft through 2 doorways only for it to land perfectly on your face. Clearing a dark warehouse crawling with semi-invisible black ops feels great.  \n\nNot crazy about all of the new weapons, found myself only using the detached Barnacle when absolutely necessary, same goes for the Desert Eagle, and Spore Launcher. Also, while it's not exactly HL's thing, more sniper ammo would've been pretty gosh darn sexy.\n\nIt took me about 10 hours to complete on hard, well worth the 99p I paid for it. The only thing that really hindered me was the occasional crashes; at certain points, be they particular rooms or particular corridors if I was using deployable explosives, sometimes the game just crashes. I'd also occasionally get stuck on the landscape, particularly during the kinda fiddley platform sections.  \n\nAll in all, there's so much classic HL action to be had here - really solid campaign. The finale is a bit of a damp squib, wet fart of an affair, but still so worth it if like me you sat on it for 2/3rds of your life. \n\nOh and a really common criticism of this is that it breaks canon... but... like... so? it's a spin-off!

After walking for 5 minutes or something you head to the landing bay and find out that the other Air-Force people are leaving in 2 minutes so you spend 1 and a half bullying a scientist and looking around but then the helicopter LEAVES and the creepy guy stalking the other dude in the original half life is now STALKING YOU! So you go on and find another alien species, THE RACE X, Very generic name I know. They have a trooper who might or might not be related to the slaves, a pitbull chihuahua mix, over sized thing that can use electricity, A GIANT WORM THING THAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE RELATED THE TENTACLES FROM THE ORIGINAL GAME, AND A roach? anyways you go on and then you learn the goverment sent hitmen who are as stupid as the Air-Force so they are shooting each other thinking they're the dude from the original game. but whatever as you proceed on and find a worm that has laser eyes? where did gearbox get these ideas? does india have a superman called superworm? anyways you violently kill it and meet another worm that doesn't really look like a worm but the game calls it the \"Gene-Worm,\" I'm just gonna refer to it as \"Tentacle's Older Brother\" who is stupid and decides to sit there and shoot out toxic gas and summon the guys related to the slaves.

It's a ton of fun with a bunch of new enemies and weapons not seen in Half Life, the final boss was a bit too easy and very repetitive, but it's a great game overall.","timestamp_created":1598915835,"timestamp_updated":1598915835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75237731","author":{"steamid":"76561198881330650","num_games_owned":64,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":85,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1647918614},"language":"english","review":"It's Glitching And Loading Half-Life Instead Of Opposing Force","timestamp_created":1598903596,"timestamp_updated":1598903596,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75231052","author":{"steamid":"76561197999603725","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1494,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":694,"last_played":1599409618},"language":"english","review":"great mixtape, 10/10","timestamp_created":1598894145,"timestamp_updated":1598894145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75229593","author":{"steamid":"76561197978476199","num_games_owned":93,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":476,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":450,"last_played":1638077532},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1598892221,"timestamp_updated":1598892221,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"75215172","author":{"steamid":"76561198211612476","num_games_owned":103,"num_reviews":56,"playtime_forever":240,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":240,"last_played":1598810005},"language":"polish","review":"Half Life Opposing force jest drugim dodatkiem tym razem z 1999 roku w jaki możemy zagrać. W tym dodatku wcielamy się w żołnierza i kaprala Adriana Sheparda, który z swoim odziałem ma wyeliminować Gordona Freemana, a więc gramy w zasadzie przeciwnikiem względem podstawowej wersji :) W porównaniu do Blue Shift w tej części mamy dość sporo dodatkowych bardzo przyjemnych broni.

I just got into Half-Life around this time.), but this was a very fun game all the same.
