Nowadays the community of active players shrank and it is not that easy to find good games to join. However that did not change that the gameplay is fun, lots of classes to join with each playing a bit differently. I got this game with some other Valve games I wanted so I thought I would at least take a look at it. It's cool and I see the appeal so I recommend it. In the end I haven't played that much and with TF2 (and it's huge community) this seems like a slightly outdated mulitplayer game. But it IS fun and it paved the way for other multiplayer games so I have to give it credit for that. Try it out for some retro fun.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1412444996,"timestamp_updated":1495267264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495867758989334106","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12363051","author":{"steamid":"76561198099059143","num_games_owned":244,"num_reviews":35,"playtime_forever":33,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":33,"last_played":1412431819},"language":"turkish","review":"Yani ne diyebilirm ne iyi ne kötü.

While it was released at first as free official mod for HL1, it's now being sold serapately on Steam. And it got a very tough rival, Team Fortress 2, that is completely free.\n\nI can say that game community is not dead yet and at certain hours you can encounter a server with some good 10-18 players game going. So, can still purchase. But there are times when servers are empty too, yes.\n\nNow, how does it compare to it's more popular TF2 brother? Well, it's much more centered on capping the flag, even Dustbowl map is centered around bringing map to the end. And the point where you cap the flag (it has team symbol on floor) is actually a different place from where flags are actually placed, mroe upfront, cutting long walks through your own base when you are bringing enemy team flag. It has mode where you have to bring Citizen class player to the end safe, but I don't see it being played nowadays at all. It's not as polished as TF2, like you can't always clearly tell color of the player when he stands in shadow. Almost all melee weapons are useless by comparison. \nAnd the game is spammy. (Almost) every class got explosive grenades (poor poor single entrance chokepoint in Dustbowl part 3)! Once you press grenade button you have around 5 seconds before it explodes, and you can just hold it for a while so you can time it to explode right when it's thrown at enemy. And I tell you, explosive grenades are powerful, making most fights last only 5 seconds, whetever it's soldier versus sniper or what not. And spammable. Get ready to be seeing those explosion sprites through which you can't see at all, while hearing more random explosion sounds somewhere else all the time.\n\nAnd then there are medics bunnyhopping their butts into your base, destroying every sentry and then grenade-jump out to cap the flag. And you can't stop them.\n\nWell, what I can say about gameplay in short is that is more fast-paced and rewards old-school skills (like bunny-hoping) for pro players, but it's not as balanced as TF2, neither it's as smooth. Just chaos and people bunnyhopping. \n\nAs for detail classes info:\n\nScout - The fastest class, yet the puniest. Not only his health is low, but with single-shotgun and nailgun his damage is non-existent, very unlike Scout in TF2. For grenades he got no explosives, just spikes that he can leave around self (never seen it being used good) to slow down enemies and Conc-grenade, that allows him not only to confuses enemy (their view would start to tilt around) but also allows to do grenade-jump with no harm for player. He would have been most perfect for capping flags. IF forget about Medic, who is about as mobile as Scout AND packs more health and firepower!\n\nSoldier - Strong class with supershotgun and rocket launcher, which is the best when shot at ground. Has few excplosive grenades. Good at defense and attack. Not many differences from TF2 counterpart.\n\nPyro - A victim of being overnerfed, when compared to Quake TF. This one isn't exactly fast and got two weapons that can set enemy on fire (and normal shotgun) - flamethrower, close-range weapon, that does pathetic damage and cannon that shoots fire rockets that are much slower than Soldier ones and not as strong. Afterburn, while theorically can stack up, is not something to be proud of - it only does 8HP damage for whole duration that it lasts. Never seen anybody die from this. Got explosive grenades, one of them is fire related. Just use Soldier.\n\nDemolition Man - Defensive explosive class. Has grenade launcher that shoots nades that explodes on click (no, they don't stick), has grenade launcher with grenades that behave like your everyday nades and got shotgun. Explosive grenades - check. Mostly there to camp near flag/corridor and blow his silly nades in case of bunny. Not as allmighty as in TF2. Also got detpacks, timed HUGE explosive, which he can set up from the game menu (\"shift\" by default). Not much good for combat, but he got \"one pony trick\" - you can use it to blow some special walls in some maps.\n\nHeavy Weapons Guy - Got shotguns and minigun. Deadly, strong. Not much different from his strong brother from TF2, only this one ALSO packs explosive grenades. Good joy.\n\nEngineer - Area denial class. Nope, kidding, his sentries last only one push at most. He packs supershotgun and some laster-pistol thing that goes through bodies and he got explosive grenades. Good thing he can build sentry, dispenser and teleporters using game menu interface, which wastes metal, that every other player also carries by default. So if you are playing another class and see friendly engy - \"discard ammo\" from menu. No worries, it only discards ammo your class doesn't uses at all.\nHis teleporters aren't nothing bad, though they don't seem to make a big deal in this TF. Neither does Dispenser, which while useful and give away ammo and armor (but not health!), don't make much impact and don't give you enough metal to use it effectively like in TF2. Though they make good explosive mines, when you manually destruct them... And then there is Sentry, which defends area with dual miniguns. Yet it's only good for killing rushers, it gets destroyed very quickly, as unlike TF2 you can't really tank and keep it running. Hell, it barely stops Medics assault. So rebuild, rebuild, rebuild and hope to survive, being less improtant than in TF2.\n\nMedic - Oh, sorry, it's COMBAT medic. Not the TF2-style healer, no, he is the perfect assault and flag capping class, who outdoes scout! He is fast, passing and strafecircling enemies. He isn't weak. He has supershotgun to deal huge damage and supernailgun that is ideal to quickly destroy sentry guns. He got a conc-grenade to confuse enemies and to allow self to grenade-jump, also gaining extreme speed and bunnyhopping not worse than scout. AND he got normal explosive grenade too. And has passive health regeneration.\nOh, and he is medic. He got medkit which he can attempt to apply on teammates that run around, healing them. But it's not comfortable and at best used only when not busy doing his combat thing. Oh, and you can apply it to enemy, infecting them with poison. That, unlike afterburn, does more damage, never ends and can even spread. Do share. Puts Pyro to even bigger shame.\n\nSniper - Got sniper-rilfe, automated mode of sniper rifle and nailgun. Does his usual sniping thing, though some may be uncomfortable with headshot hitbox. Spends his time moving around freely and gibbing enemy players once charged enough. In case of emergency can use auto-sniper rifle to quickly waste his ammo doing high accurate hitscan damage. Oh, and he got freaking explosive grenade. Not a puppy, as you can see.\n\nSpy - Light class that tries to outwit enemy team with usage of clunky game menu. He got supershotgun (wow!), nailgun, some pistol thing that shoots single nail that slows down target (theorically good against those medics if forget just how slow that projectile is!) and knife with which you can backstab. All of them break disguise. Also has explosive grenade and some funky area \"drunkening\" grenade, none of which break your disguise.\nAnd yes, like a proper spy, he got few tricks with usage of awkward in-game menu. First, he can disguise as any class on any team (by the way, friendly will see you as that class and you may end up being blown around map). Unlike TF2, you will notice that it takes really long time to disguise, but unlike TF2 it's harder to tell away disguised spy as you can't pass through friendlies either. So, worth it. Instead of having ability to cloak, spy has ability to feign death at his wish. He can be still killed and your model will turn where you are looking, but otherwise most player don't spycheck corpses either and can pass through you. Not bad. Just have to maneuver yourself though explosive-spammed envirmoments of the game.","timestamp_created":1409080680,"timestamp_updated":1587662776,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11851811","author":{"steamid":"76561198073679006","num_games_owned":664,"num_reviews":96,"playtime_forever":18,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":18,"last_played":1408652187},"language":"english","review":"Dated yet fun game, but team fortress 2 surpasses it in every way. and it's free.

While this doesn't support much the teamwork strategy because everyone is like \"The flag is now mine, I am going to cap\",  some people play the right way and let the scout do the job while they offer covering fire.\n\nHowever, some maps like Dustbowl on the first stage are messed up, the RED team camping near the grenade backpack and spamming all the way until the round ends.\n\n[b]Capture the flag[/b]\nSame as you can see in TF2, that's how CTF acted in all team fortress stages, excepting that, unlike TF2, the place where you have to bring the flag is different from the place the enemy can find your flag, making this a bit confusing for new players.\n\nEven in this moment I bring the enemy flag to my team's flag in 2fort.\n\n[b]Escort[/b]\nA great gamemode, that in TF2 got brutally converted into payload. (there where alot of reasons I will explain later)\nIn this gamemode you will have to escort (AKA help a a guy reach a place alive) a class called \"Civillian\" (yes, TFC  has 10 classes).\nThe civillian features low stats, having only 50 health points, no armor, grenades or weapons other than an umbrella, which is a crowbar reskin.\n\nThere are 3 teams:\nThe escort- only the civillian available. Only 1 can play as the civilian in a game.\nThe bodyguards - the people who must escort the civillian to the destination. Only soldier, heavy and medics available.\nThe assasins - must prevent the civillian to reach the destination. Only playable as snipers.\n\nIn TF2, the escort mode was scrapped for multiple reasons, such as the fact it had too many limits.\nYou had class limits, being forced to play as medic, heavy and soldier as bodyguards and as sniper on the assasins.\nAlso, certain civillians were trolls, refusing to get out from the spawn or jumping in front of the enemy.\nNo more saying there could only be 1 civillian, releasing many flamewars between players.\n\nThen Valve made a similar gamemode, where you have to 'escort' a bomb cart by staying near it so you can 'push' it, while the other team prevents you for doing that.\n\n[b]Classes[/b]\n\n[b]The scout:[/b]\nUnlike in TF2, the scout was NOT made for agressive combat, not even for combat itself. It has a 'syringegun' called nailgun and a single-barrel shotgun.\nPlayers use the scout's speed and the conc-jump technique to quickly complete the objectives.\nUnfortunatelly, the scout has low health, being able to be killed by a single rocket, and lacks double jumping.\n\n[b]The soldier:[/b]\nThe soldier from TF2 seems to not have changed much.\nThe only differences between them is that the TFC soldier has 2 types of shotguns equipped at once and also has hand grenades.\n\n[b]The pyro:[/b]\nOh pyro... poor pyro, the class valve forgot to buff.\nYou basically have a flamethrower that shoots rapid-fire 'bubbles' of fire, that will never hit someone.\nAlso, the afterburn is only like 2 seconds and deals like 4 damage/tick.\nThe pyro also has a rocket launcher that does not need to be realoaded, but deals no damage at all and ignites the enemies that stay in range, but again, the aferburn is weak.\nYou also have a single barrel shotgun...\n\n[b]The demoman:[/b]\nA class you will rarely see played, same as in TF2.\nPeople don't know the air detonation technique, which is deadly in TFC.\n\nAs the demoman, you have a grenade launcher with a clip of 6 and a sticky launcher with also a clip of 6. They use the same ammo and clip, tough.\nThe demoamn also has a single-barrel shotgun, and the unique abbility to set a bomb that is able to open new routes on a map by removing certain walls.\n\n[b]Heavy weapons guy:[/b]\nThe heavy is more decent to play that in TF2, you have a plenty of health and armor, and a powerful MIRV granade that creates explosions similar to the Sentry buster from TF2.\n\nYou also have 2 shotguns types: The one-barrel and 2-barrel.\nYou cannot deploy your minigun without firing, so you will stay more in combat rather than camping near corners, like people do in TF2.\n\n[b]Engineer:[/b]\nThe engineer is quite weak compared to the TF2 one. I mean, you have a double barrel shotgun, which is very good, and a railgun, which is the worst weapon in the game due to the slow projectile and low damage.\n\nThe sentry upgrades instantly if you have enough 'metal' (called 'cells' in TFC) and is the only upgradable building.\nThe sentrygun cannot rotate, the engineer being forced to place the sentrygun in corners, or to rotate it manually.\n\nThe dispenser is not upgradable and does NOT generate ammo, health and metal, as it does in TF2, so the engineer has to fill it manually.\nAlso, the enemy can use your dispenser.\nYou will rarely see an engineer building a dispenser, unless they are really bored, because it does not heal, does not provide ammo unless filled with, and does not give metal, so players preffer to collect backpacks filled with goods at every corner.\nThe only good thing about dispensers is that they can repair armor (if filled).\n\nThe teleporter is not upgradable, but efficient.\n\nThe lack of hauling buildings and the addition of grenades in TFC makes it hard to be an engineer, trust me.\n\n[b]Medic:[/b]\nThe medic is actually an upgraded version of the scout, but not worth playing.\nThe lack of 'assist' in the kill feed and the fact that you don't get points for healing, will end up with you having 0 points even if you were an efficient medic that deserved #1 in TF2.\n\nWhat do I mean by upgraded scout?\nRemind scout's weapons? Nailgun and single barrel shotgun, also a crowbar.\nMedic's loadout? SUPER Nailgun, DOUBLE barrel shotgun and the medkit (as melee).\n\nThe medkit is the most overpowered weapon.\nWhy? once hitting an enemy with it, it will become infected, causing his health to drain constantly until dies or healed by a medic. Also, the infection can be spread trough teammates... darn it valve.\n\nAlso, the medic is designed more for combat, and healing teammates that are hiding, because you cannot heal while you or your teammate move.\n\nThe sniper:\nRemember the sniper rifle in TF2 called \"the Classic\"?\nUse it to see how being a sniper is like in TFC.\n\nThe spy:\nThe spy, a kinda broken class, has a tranquilizer gun that slows down enemies, a double barrel shotgun and a knife.\nThe stupid thing about the spy is that the disguise takes about 5 bloody seconds (while just like 2 in TF2) and you have no cloak feature.\nHowever, the lack of spychecking weapons other than the medic's medkit, may do the job.\nYou can feign death, but you have to stay down, as a random dead body, and if you move, you actually spin like a drunk hobo and suspicious players will shoot.\n\nThe backstab seems to be broken most of the time, resuting in failed facestabs.\nAdditionally, if an enemy scout or spy runs into you, your disguise is removed.\n\n\nOnly things I don't like on this game (along with the broken classes) are these:\n-Lack of resupply cabinets: If someone spawn camps you and you are hurt badly (or infected) you are forced to die.\n-Solid hitboxes: You cannot get past teammates as in TF2 and you cannot do the bump-spycheck.\n-All classes use the same voice, the only lines you will hear being \"Medic!\" and \"Excuse me, I'm in need of medical attention.\" thus making it hard to see which class is approaching.\n\n\nOn short, totally worth playing, and if you are bored you can try the FUN servers (which are better than the TF2 ones because the civillian class is used alot in them), and if you totally suck like me, you can enjoy playing singleplayer with bots.\n\n+8/10","timestamp_created":1405672612,"timestamp_updated":1407696818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":57,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.814321160316467285","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"11291581","author":{"steamid":"76561198067827781","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":29,"playtime_forever":159,"playtime_last_two_weeks":34,"playtime_at_review":55,"last_played":1660527417},"language":"english","review":"Man, what a garbage game.

I went in assuming I was going to be playing an old school downgrade of Team Fortress 2. I was wrong, TFC is in its own rights a completely different game at first glance. The story, the graphics, and even the controls feel different, but if you play it long enough you will come to find that the game is Team Fortress at its core. The game itself has all the Team Fortress 2 \"DNA\" in there you just dont quite see it at first. If you play a while you will not only feel the Team Fortress-ness in the game (its the original Team Fortress so obviously) But you will get to see where the masterpiece that is Team Fortress 2 comes from, you get to see its \"roots\" so to speak.
