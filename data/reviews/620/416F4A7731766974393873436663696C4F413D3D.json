Starting this game right after it's predecessor, I thought it was just going to be the same thing: GLaDOS giving you tests to go through. As I went along, it kept on surprising me with new gameplay mechanics and plot twists so I never got bored. In fact, this game got addicting. I constantly was playing this game in my free time so I could see what Valve would throw at me next. Upon beating the game (and its multiplayer campaign), I ventured forth into the community maps. I must say, the communtiy for this game is a very intelligent one, as I came across levels that made me wonder if I was playing a level pack made by Valve! The community maps are accompanied by Cave Johnson's glorious writing that never fails to make me laugh. I reccomend playing the community maps after the main game, though, as some of these maps continue the end game's difficulty. Overall, this game is VERY well constructed and has content that makes you want to keep coming back. I give this game a 10/10. Everything is perfect: from the intelligent writing to the creative and clever puzzles. Even if puzzle games are not your genre of preference, I stress you to at least try it. I promise you won't be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1425779459,"timestamp_updated":1609122567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14785203","author":{"steamid":"76561198123679927","num_games_owned":216,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":15787,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3860,"last_played":1643467967},"language":"english","review":"NOW we're thinking with portals.\n\nPortal 2 is a sequel to the game Portal.

I thought it would be difficult for Valve to create a sequel to the first without making it so similar that it seemed like the extended edition of Portal 1, but they stepped up to the plate and did very well for themselves.  Just from the first few minutes of gameplay you can already tell that the second installment in the Portal franchise has a meatier story with interesting characters and still brings it's signature humour from the orignal title.  GLaDOS is still a very important part of the story and is involved in a very special moment involving a 9 volt battery and a potato.  You also still play as the female protagonist in this installment.  The stunning attention to detail in the level design and the atmosphere is phenomenal and really struts Valve's stuff.\n\nPortal 2 expands on the standard portal gun gameplay from the original while adding these fun new mechanics called gels, but I'll let you find out more about those buggers.  The puzzles this time around aren't easy, but they're all reasonable and don't seem to require Stephen Hawking to decypher.\n\nAs great as everyone knows the Portal storyline is, the co-operative feature added to this Portal really makes it stand out.  Grab a friend and take your shot at some co-operative humour-based puzzle fun to see who's the worse at navigating a light bridge!  \n\nOverall the only real downside I see is that once you've finished the single player and the co-operative modes, there isn't much replayability here, especially considering I don't know anyone who really delves into the map editor feature and all, but it is certainly worth the 15 or more hours of fun regardless.\n\nA solid 10/10, would potato again.","timestamp_created":1425669128,"timestamp_updated":1425669128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"14762666","author":{"steamid":"76561198155890739","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3115,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":133,"last_played":1584552647},"language":"russian","review":"Очень крутая игра.
