This game here, Killing Floor, is a great game. Sure it may seem repetitive, but if you're with friends and you up the difficulty, it's a great game that'll kill hours. My girlfriend hates fps games (Freakin Casual), but she's furious ( I do mean furious) when I play without her, and she's a calm, cute, sweet chick. I have been playing for more than 2 years and there is no game besides Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 that I have played for that long. I often play on offline mode so she doesn't find out ( Hopefully she doesn't read this review). If you like Heavy Metal blasting as you blow up heads in slow motion and a touch of horror in it, come right in. Plus a workshop community! Get it or don't get, but I'm really stingy with games and this game is fantastic.

tap it though even then its pretty fun and a good laugh watching even the end of match boss die quickly but really other then that theres no faults with the game hell to be honest the flamethrowers

It had the same lore and backstory as the original mod, but much more refined graphics.\nBut over time, things went sour...\nSuddenly, it wasn't about lone survivors and London's police forces fighting to hold back the hordes and halt Horzine's machinations. It was about weird dudes in steampunk outfits, elves and santa clauses and hillbillies. About steampunk weapons, robots, gold plated weapons, TRON guns and DLC for everything.\n\nI would understand DLC skins for existing weapons (like the aforementioned gold skins). Eye candy for the people who think they need it, but without any gameplay difference.\n\nBut then there are weapon pack DLCs that bring in completely new weapons. Didn't buy it? Sucks to be you then. You don't get to play with the fancy toys.\n\nI don't recommend this game if you like Killing Floor for what it originally was. If you are just looking for a mindless ZED killing game (no they are not even real Zombies here) that charges you for everything extra, then sink your money into this.\n\nBy the by, Masterson is actually a badass mofo with tattooed forearms and a black beret.

Then came the disgusting over priced character packs for 1 new player 5$ a pop just because it has a new voice actor. But wait they went farther with a gold wepons skin pack that says hey look at me these guns have no diffrent stats from your's but I can afford this pack for 5$ and you cant also the wepons appear in your wepon store even if you dont own it and make it harder to find the wepon you want in time. Now if you have managed to read all of this and think huh they cant mess up the game more your wrong. Before the dumb pay to win update you max level for a class was 5 took for ever to reach I might add they then decided to raise it to 10 when I stoped playing. The last nail in the coffen for me was they even made it stupid easy and require no skill to be a medic you can run up to players and heal them with a needle ps thats normal and awsome. But now you can say well fawk dat scheit mate gg and lob healing grenades at your team that damage the undead.
