O único problema é que o jogo se extende muito no final, gerando níveis muito grandes e, às vezes, enjoativos. Os gráficos, para a época, eram muito bonitos e até hoje conseguem chamar atenção. Os cenários são muito variados, assim como os inimigos, que vão de soldados do governo à alienígenas. O final deixa uma belíssima ponta para continuação, que seria o tão aguardado e improvável Half-Life 3.","timestamp_created":1386106088,"timestamp_updated":1386516079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"7901396","author":{"steamid":"76561198040625592","num_games_owned":1143,"num_reviews":65,"playtime_forever":846,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":785,"last_played":1460113959},"language":"english","review":"Terrible game.

The facial recognition technology or animation team did a wonderful job at bringing the characters in the half-life 2 universe to life.\n\nIt's easy to see why this game is featured in so many top 10 PC game lists but it's even easier to experience what makes this game so awesome for yourself.

In that respect I guess it has a lot to answer for! And, along with Episodes 1 and 2, it remains my favourite to this day. Valve have taken their 1998 classic Half-Life and improved on it in every conceivable way. Much improved graphics, much improved physics, much improved AI, and much improved weapons, most notably the wondrous gravity gun. Once again it mixes a wide variety of spectacular environments with some satisfying puzzles and some fantastic combat. It also develops the story started in the original and fleshes it out nicely. Another important gain is the introduction of Alyx and her father Ely. Alyx will be a welcome companion and will, periodically, fight by your side. This is a big factor in HL2 -- the introduction of team play. You will have small bands of resistance fighters with you sporadically during play in the single player mode and this adds a team element which greatly increases immersion and the sense that what you do matters.
