Yes, the gameplay can get repetitive at times, although it's not as bad as other fps-games because of the vigors, different enemies and great scenery, but the thing that makes this game one of the best first-person-shooters ever made is the story. Elizabeth is an awesome companion that feels like a real person and not just like some free ammo and money giving pet. The story is way longer than I expected and has a few surprising twists plus an awesome ending.

Dónde la ciencia, leyes y el orden son los pilares de una sociedad que dió sus inicios a comienzos del siglo 20, creada como una arca moderna que salva a quien es digno y los acepta en las nubes.\n\nBioshock Infinite es una entrega muy significativa dentro del mundo del gaming, ya que llegó a despedir la antigua generación de videojuegos. Explotando por completo todos los recursos disponibles por los desarroladores en la época, entregandonos una obra de arte que recordaremos siempre dentro del mundo de los videojuegos. \n\nEl juego toma lugar en el año 1912 donde Estados Unidos se encuentra en una etapa de reestructuración, eres Booker Dewitt un ex-detective privado que se ha endeudado a causa de las apuestas y por ello decide aceptar un trabajo. Llevar una chica sana y salva a New York.\n\nEres llevado a un faro a mitad del óceano, sin ningún tipo de información o indicaciones. Suena familiar ¿No? La gran diferencia es que en esta ocasión para llegar deberás acender hasta alcanzar las nubes de la espectacular ciudad de Columbia. \n\nDesde los primeros minutos del juego quedarás FASCINADO, el aspecto visual es abundante en todo sentido. los colores pastel contrastan totalmente con el de los titulos anteriores y el diseño de personajes no busca ser realista sino ÚNICO. Estás en una ciudad viva con edificios flotantes en constante movimiento, festividades, alegria, música y gente que disfruta el día a día.\n\nBioshock Infinite busca inyectarte esa fascinación por conocer todos los pequeños detalles en la trama ya sea explorando cada rincón o aprendiendo la historia de columbia en audiologs de la época. Esta combinación logra sumergirte de inmediato en la atmosfera y consigue lo que muchos titulos desean, hacerte sentir parte del mundo. \n\n La ciudad de Columbia representa un contraste muy claro con los anteriores Bioshock, encontramos una sociedad de personas que buscan el bien común con un trabajo que corresponde a un estilo de vida y una religión que es el pilar de la existencia de cada elemento en la ciudad. Todo gira entorno de este pilar y como sabemos siempre parte de la mente de alguien, en este caso el Padre Comstock el autoproclamado profeta. Quién es alabado y respetado por todos los ciudadanos de Columbia.\n\nInclusive sabiendo que Infinite se desarrolla en un lugar ficticio lo que ocurre en él no está muy lejos de la realidad, su cultura los valores religioso e incluso el racismo y la explotación se ven reflejados en cada rincón (Hablando de 1912). Ya sea en carteles o videos que hablan de la superioridad de los habitantes, hasta la notable exaltación de las clases sociales y desde lugares con manjares y riquezas, hasta los barrios bajos con personas hambrientas en busca de alguna salvación. Está retratado a la PERFECCIÓN. \n\n2k busca que vivas el juego al máximo con una interfaz sencilla sin minimapas o molestos textos que te indiquen que hacer, sin embargo, para tu mala suerte salvar a la chica no es tan sencillo. En tu mano derecha posees una marca que te acredita como el \"Falso Profeta\" y en menos de un minuto pasas de ser un turista curioso a convertirte en el enemigo número uno y de esta forma conoces el lado malvado y perverso de Columbia. Tu labor apartir de ese momento será sobrevivir y encontrar a la chica, de quién solo sabes que está encerrada en la torre central de Columbia.\n\nLa historia al igual que los personajes del juego se desarrolla de una manera que funciona a la perfección. Desde los primeros minutos, los detalles, los dialogos e incluso la deformación del ambiente te llevan de la mano y así ocurre durante todo el trayecto.\n\nSabemos que la saga Bioshock se caracteriza por mantenerte en busca del cambio en la trama y todo fánatico está listo para ese momento en el que todo se transforme, afortunadamente Infinite no decepciona pues logra mantenerte a la espectativa al relevarte solo lo suficiente para continuar, todo para cuando llegue el final tu cerebro necesite un par de minutos para procesarlo. \n\n ¿Y el gameplay? Bioshock Infinite no deja de ser un FPS y uno excelente, con momentos llenos de adrenalina, enemigos que te conducen a buscar alternativas y un gran sistema de combate que te obliga a utilizar todos los recursos. En está ocasión los plásmidos son reemplazados por los vigores, que al final de día son lo mismo, con mucha mayor variedad de efectos comparado con los anteriores Bioshock. \n\nLa cantidad de armas es buena, existen pistolas, metralletas, lanzacohetes, etc... Y cada una de ellas con mejoras disponibles. Aunque al principio puede parecer dificil tomar el ritmo del combate, no tardarás mucho en descubrir las mejores combinaciones. Los combates son masivos y muchas veces te encontrarás rodeado de enemigos.\n\nUno de los atractivos principales de Bioshock Infinite es el uso del gancho, con el que te desplazarás por distintas áreas de la ciudad y que lo usarás durante los combates. Existen áreas con railes que se conectan en un circuito establecido y que podrás usar a tu gusto. Ya sea para moverte más rápido o para realizar ataques áreos.  \n\nBioshock Infinite es un mundo que está construido para admirarse como una bella obra de arte, la calidad de cada pequeño detalle es impresionante, los brochasos en las pinturas, lo brillante de los colores, la calidad de las texturas todas armadas a la perfección para disfrutarse de un juego que se ve hermoso en HD.\n\nLa música y ambientación sónora del juego son INCREIBLES, las melodias que la gente entona durante tus encuentros en columbia son encantadoras y las canciones de fondo en ciertos puntos del juego te harán estremecer. El trabajo de voz es Perfecto los factores que interpretan tanto a la \"Chica\" como a Booker Dewitt logran impregnar su estilo que además habla de su profesionalismo. \n\n\"¿Una ciudad en el fondo del mar? Hum.. Es ridiculo.\"\n\nIniciamos la saga con una frase memorable y lo terminamos con otra. Bioshock Infinite es mucho más de lo que he dicho, es un juego que se atreve a dar el siguiente paso y nos demuestra lo importante de una historia perfectamente escrita en combinación con un gran gameplay. \n\n\"Tráenos a la chica y borrarás tu deuda.\"\n\nEs momento de que explores uno de los mejores juegos creados en la historia y que nos dará de que hablar durante muchos años, juégalo.","timestamp_created":1628446683,"timestamp_updated":1628447068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":54,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.832042455673217773","comment_count":53,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97185495","author":{"steamid":"76561199059418549","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1232,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1171,"last_played":1630418073},"language":"thai","review":"BioShock

The characters were superbly written and acted out by their VA's, Booker, Elizabeth, Comstock and the other characters largely felt like real people because of the quality of their performances. The greatest strength of Infinite however is the level design, Columbia is BLEEDING with confidence and stylized artistic flourish to show off just how majestic the city in the sky is which ultimately blinds everybody (and the player initially) to the real problems that are happening in the shadow of Comstock's own Mount Olympus.\n\nWith all these positives it's time for why this is my least favorite Bioshock in the trilogy, the upgrades and plasmids are underwhelming by comparison, shields help you remain in the thick of combat for extended periods of time but without medkits (med hypos) to keep you going it creates abrupt brakes in the combat pacing by needing those shields to recharge and fight conservatively from afar until Elizabeth throws a medkit your way, I suppose it's meant to emphasize the streamlined gunplay the strongest but by cutting out what made the IP a System Shock offspring you wind up playing a cover based shooter and then some. \n\nNothing compares to the grandiose tragedy of the story however, a story that was written too big and out of proportion for its own good wrote the franchise into a corner that it has not found its way out of since Infinite's inception. Did I have a good time playing the game? Yes but only on my first play through. In retrospect the time travel and dimension hopping threw the game's modestly grounded universe from its roots which was supposed to be a spiritual successor to System Shock. Bioshock Infinite feels like an idea meant for a completely different game entirely apart that the devs elected to put down every story idea that happened to be knocking around in their noggin like a brick in a washing machine at the time and plaster it onto an immersive sim IP with a lot of weight to its name with the hope that it'll sell copies off like hot cakes rather than risk it all on an entirely different game that would have inevitably failed, and....well....if the under performing sale numbers are of any indication for its immediate future then I'm not sure if there will be any willingness to pull the IP back up from the rubble. Though there were talks of 2K bringing back the IP from the pit the series had placed itself into, both financially and story wise but it has a long climb to surmount and exceed the high precedence of expectations that will be placed on the new installment.\n\nIt's your right to enjoy and like Bioshock Infinite but this is what I felt looking back on this game, what was supposed to be a fresh jump start and take on the System Shock formula that received improvements in its 2nd installment has become buried at sea like Rapture itself all while System Shock remains alive and well, on a cliffhanger but safe in stasis like the Hacker and Soldier of old as its spiritual successors sequentially survived, died or were one note and never done again.","timestamp_created":1628374588,"timestamp_updated":1628462945,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97132857","author":{"steamid":"76561198077249977","num_games_owned":499,"num_reviews":70,"playtime_forever":934,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":847,"last_played":1631235384},"language":"english","review":"Love the design of this game no matter what people say I think this is a great Bioshock game","timestamp_created":1628372615,"timestamp_updated":1628372615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97131206","author":{"steamid":"76561198341913582","num_games_owned":80,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1122,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1020,"last_played":1628630215},"language":"english","review":"10/10","timestamp_created":1628370340,"timestamp_updated":1628370340,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97130924","author":{"steamid":"76561198093434623","num_games_owned":256,"num_reviews":27,"playtime_forever":745,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":745,"last_played":1628369895},"language":"english","review":"Columbia Go Brrrrrrrrr.\n9/10","timestamp_created":1628369959,"timestamp_updated":1628369959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97123975","author":{"steamid":"76561198413037965","num_games_owned":208,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":481,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":481,"last_played":1628356681},"language":"latam","review":"Te deja re loco las cosas esas que hace el Cumshot","timestamp_created":1628360855,"timestamp_updated":1628360855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97122499","author":{"steamid":"76561198362054320","num_games_owned":186,"num_reviews":26,"playtime_forever":475,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":475,"last_played":1628359077},"language":"english","review":"Very good storyline, didn't play the first bioshock games beforehand and still enjoyed/undertstood the plot.","timestamp_created":1628359138,"timestamp_updated":1628359138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97117187","author":{"steamid":"76561199180093573","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":350,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":492,"last_played":1628341946},"language":"schinese","review":"难得的好游戏，剧情讲述的是一个负债累累的中年男人为偿还债务来到乌托邦寻找女孩的故事，在打倒了反派boss之后与女孩开启了平行世界的旅程，男主在平行世界回忆起了过去发生的事情，明白了自己所欠的“债”。世界是无限的，人也是无限的，在无限的世界和人之中，偿还债务的唯一方式是了结自己，游戏的最后，沐浴着圣光，伴随着神圣的音乐，男主走向了自己的终结，迎来了重生。","timestamp_created":1628352507,"timestamp_updated":1628352507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"97113044","author":{"steamid":"76561199071497024","num_games_owned":53,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2090,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":595,"last_played":1628856667},"language":"english","review":"I was played other Bioshock games and I dont like too much beacuse the action sequences didn't seem so good and heartwarming to me.But this game has all in it.

If you suffer from mental health issues related to family or PTSD, don't buy this. If you're unable to handle unapologetic and awful turns of fate in a game, don't get it, you'll just end up whining about it. Also, as a person who absolutely hates shooters, this wasn't an easy play either, considering it's chaotic and loud on a whole other level, but then again, steampunk games usually tend to be so.\n\nBut then, how come I spent 21.6 out of the last 38-odd hours on this game, completing both the core game and DLCs? \na) I always love clever stories, and the Easy mode minimizes the time I have to spend shooting and mauling human beings, so that worked out just fine for me. \nb) The setting of Columbia is absolute breathtaking.\n\nI recommend skimming the history of the last two games before playing, if like me, you weren't a fan of the Rapture setting of those games and didn't finish them. It's not necessary to play them before playing the core game of Infinite, just the DLCs. \n\nTo wrap up... was it violent? Yes. Did they play the political narrative well? Eh, it was very simplistic, and I suspect that's on purpose. What the devs did was play the theological, scientific and moral themes, questions and conundrums like a fine-tuned violin. As a student of genocide studies, I'd say the violence was a nice break from the \"darker\" stuff. \n\nAlso, if you didn't like Inception, you won't like this. I guarantee. If you enjoy twisted worlds and complicated stories, go for it.
