So to anyone out there who hasn't tried the game that made Valve. Then try it.

Then, a friend tells you about half life and how it's amazing and nothing like th games you own. For laughs, you decide to try it. What you experience, is a masterpeice in motion.\n\n-The Graphics don't compare to the high resoloution graphics of today, but Back in 1998 it easily sets the high bar for graphics in that time, go look at other games released in 98. No comparison, Half life wins right off the bat.\n\n-The story is one that any gamer, new fans or old, would be sucked into and not leave their chairs until it was done. You're a scientist who is involved in an experiment for a research company whidch goes horribly wrong and....I can't spoil the story for you. I don't want to ruin the HL experience.\n\n-The Gameplay is self-explanitory when you play it. The pressure is on you the entire time, you have to use your brain to navigate through the game while at the same time, trying to keep yourself alive. A beautiful combination of A FPS and a puzzle game, something that had never been done before 1998.\n\n-You WILL have the urge to replay this game over and over again, nuff said.\n\n-The soundtrack changes mood like the game changes mood, which only causes anticipation and a mood setting enviorment.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 97/100\n\nThere are not enough words to sum up this game, so i will try to sum it up for you in 10 words or less.\n[You will not regret buying this as long as you live.] Dang, thats 11.","timestamp_created":1388460227,"timestamp_updated":1388460227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8446445","author":{"steamid":"76561198079521003","num_games_owned":1763,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":969,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":62,"last_played":1394520764},"language":"english","review":"One of the best and oldest FPS games known the man.

I decided it was time to end this drought when I saw a sale on the Valve Collection and purchased 26 titles for €45. \n\nIt can sometimes be tough to get into a very old game if you haven’t played it before, mainly due to the nostalgic factor being absent. Half-Life surprised me though. I enjoyed the entire adventure, bar one or two extremely frustrating parts that you wouldn’t see in modern games. Still, I was happy to overlook these flaws considering it’s age.\n\nThere isn’t much of a story, but there doesn’t need to be. Something bad has happened and you have to do something about it to survive. The game does a great job with pushing you along without making it extremely obvious what you have to do next. Everything is subtle, and it is easy to miss a few paths or tunnels that lead you to next chapter.\n\nGraphically, its pleasant enough, although some textures are pretty low res which is to be expected. The audio quality is quite poor too, but it does just enough to be acceptable. I found the AI pretty good, with some enemies proving a real challenge. The scientists and guards that you must interact with also behave quite well when you need them to do something. It’s all very basic stuff but it just works.\n\nThe map does a very good job of making you feel like you aren’t on rails, even though you literally are for one chapter of the game. The game took longer to play through than I expected with some really cool challenging puzzles, but still nothing that would blow your mind by todays standards.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone. 15 years on it’s still a lot better than many games in it’s genre, both in terms of gameplay and feel. It is challenging and at times frustrating, but I believe it is essential to experience this piece of gaming history. \n\n9.4/10","timestamp_created":1388435401,"timestamp_updated":1388435401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8436351","author":{"steamid":"76561198063075858","num_games_owned":319,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":328,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":143,"last_played":1539750297},"language":"english","review":"#SWAG","timestamp_created":1388433092,"timestamp_updated":1388433092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8432228","author":{"steamid":"76561198060908103","num_games_owned":36,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":978,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":124,"last_played":1448662139},"language":"english","review":"yay","timestamp_created":1388424070,"timestamp_updated":1388424070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8431355","author":{"steamid":"76561198084228810","num_games_owned":895,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":2987,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1020,"last_played":1555788157},"language":"english","review":"A freakin' awesome game!","timestamp_created":1388421812,"timestamp_updated":1388421812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8429671","author":{"steamid":"76561198030228883","num_games_owned":539,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":388,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":299,"last_played":1432668542},"language":"english","review":"Half-Life Best Ever.","timestamp_created":1388417552,"timestamp_updated":1388417552,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546632170677185059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8429530","author":{"steamid":"76561198112397234","num_games_owned":88,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1285,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1218,"last_played":1542649636},"language":"brazilian","review":"É um jogo simplesmente extraordinário.","timestamp_created":1388417164,"timestamp_updated":1408671972,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8427468","author":{"steamid":"76561198056223260","num_games_owned":69,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":77,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5,"last_played":1388260138},"language":"russian","review":"kool","timestamp_created":1388411264,"timestamp_updated":1388411264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8426687","author":{"steamid":"76561198038789642","num_games_owned":92,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":342,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":333,"last_played":1392919267},"language":"dutch","review":"One of the best games ever made.","timestamp_created":1388408771,"timestamp_updated":1388408771,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514598548412322998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8421987","author":{"steamid":"76561198118345858","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1690,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1447,"last_played":1392689680},"language":"english","review":"An old school classic that still feels modern in so many ways.

The combination of first person shooter action with intricate (and crafty) puzzle elements makes for great pacing as well as lethal entertainment.\n\nThe story is detailed, intricate, and cleverly told, never revealing too much, just enough. The graphics, though dated, hold up well enough to bring to life the frightening and fear inducing environments throughout the ill-fated Black Mesa. And beyond. And enhancing that, a creepy soundscape, an intimidating soundtrack. And then the silence. Nothing is quite so terrifying as nothing. Anticipation.\n\nAnd the enemies, Half Life does not disappoint.

This was one of the first FPS games where the story and the environments actually matter.\n\nStory: You play as Gordon Freeman a scientist working for an Area 51 like scientific facility called Black Mesa. From the first scene where you are on a tram you see the parts of the underground Black Mesa facility that make you feel like a tiny rat in a big place. An accident occurs that causes dimensional rifts to open up to hostile aliens. You must escape from Black Mesa. But the story is not divided up into cut scenes with unredeemable villains and sinless heroes. As you explore the facility you find out that the people you trust: your government, fellow scientists, etc. are not telling you everything. \n\nGameplay: The facility itself has interesting parts including a freezer, a rail tram system where you have to be cautious and stop to eliminate enemies, a nuclear reactor, and more. The environments and level design are very good. You get a large arsenal of weaponry that grows as you progress through the game. Interesting weapons include the Tau Cannon (chargeable cannon), the crossbow, and some alien weapons like killer bugs called Snarks. You are free to play how you want as the game gives you ammo for all your weapons on a regular basis. You have two types of enemies: the aliens and the HCEU (human soldiers). The latter might be a spoiler but it’s a trope anyways. As I said earlier the game makes you feel like a rat in a big place. You have to vault ladders, go through vents, scale mountains and more.\n\nEver since Half Life came out FPSes have gone the way of story driven gameplay rather than gameplay only. Some people might blame this game for that whenever they play a game where the gameplay is boring and is divided by cutscenes that you skip the second time around. Many of those games are great but one usually comes out that makes everyone say \"Games were better before.\" What I can say is that Half Life is a great game and you should definitely pick it up.","timestamp_created":1388124255,"timestamp_updated":1491787247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8320663","author":{"steamid":"76561198056422964","num_games_owned":187,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":100,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":100,"last_played":1351839600},"language":"english","review":"This game is great for retro fans like me.\nBut graphics are not the only thing, I loved the HD remake \"Black Mesa\", too.\nThe story and the atmosphere are just astonishing, and the soundtrack fits very well.\nThis is a very, very great game, and just look at that price. Amazing.\nI would recommend to buy the whole Half Life bundle, you sure want to try out the other games after the first Half Life.","timestamp_created":1388110272,"timestamp_updated":1388110272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8320115","author":{"steamid":"76561198103080497","num_games_owned":126,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":375,"last_played":1405200287},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the best single-player PC games I've ever played! 4.8 out of 5!","timestamp_created":1388108828,"timestamp_updated":1388108828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8317661","author":{"steamid":"76561198059856345","num_games_owned":139,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":2253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":399,"last_played":1640679823},"language":"english","review":"This game is good.","timestamp_created":1388101792,"timestamp_updated":1388101792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8317124","author":{"steamid":"76561198056201100","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":352,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":188,"last_played":1588005526},"language":"english","review":"\n","timestamp_created":1388100347,"timestamp_updated":1388100347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8313115","author":{"steamid":"76561198095440143","num_games_owned":134,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":4570,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4376,"last_played":1633573310},"language":"english","review":"still waiting on a movie","timestamp_created":1388091439,"timestamp_updated":1605864984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"8310162","author":{"steamid":"76561198089340470","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1307,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":87,"last_played":1421779249},"language":"spanish","review":"un juegazo que no te puede faltar ;)","timestamp_created":1388085254,"timestamp_updated":1388085254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw94KVmMMCctnZHw=="}
