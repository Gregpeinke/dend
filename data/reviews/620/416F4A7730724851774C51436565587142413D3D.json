Where you had a free and open area to try out different ways to solve a challenge, now you have a certain number of pieces to a puzzle that you try and find the right order they go in. If you want straight puzzles and lots of 'em, they're in the multiplayer, which is also AMAZING, and with its own separate storyline.
