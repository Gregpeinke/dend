Klar von den Gameplay- Elementen erscheint es als ein \"standart Shooter\" , der nicht aus der Masse heraussticht. Doch wenn man sich etwas genauer mit diesem Meisterwerk von  Storytelling Game beschäftigt, stellt man schnell fest, dass es aus viel mehr als nur langweiligen Shooter Elementen besteht.\nUm Bioshock wirklich in vollen Zügen zu erleben, sollte man es am Stück durchspielen insofern man die Zeit dafür besitzt.\nIch selbst habe für die Beendung der Story ca. 8 Stunden benötigt. Diese Zahl kann natürlich von Playthrough zu Playthrough variieren.\nWenn man voll und ganz in das Geschehen des Spiels eintaucht wird man wirklich davon gefesselt. \nObwohl das Spiel rein Gameplay-technisch nicht zu den besten Spielen dieses Genres gehört, ist es eines meiner \"all time favourites\". \nDie Story ist so packend und voll mit unerwarteten Twists. Meiner Meinung nach storytechnisch das beste Spiel zurzeit. \nAußerdem finde ich die Interpretationsfreiheit, welche nach Beendung der Story noch besteht, toll.\nDas Ende des Spiels verschlug mir wirklich die Sprache. Ich  saß starr vor meinem Bildschrim und ließ das Gesehene nocheinmal revue passieren.  Das Game spielt auch auf die Multiversen-Theorie aus der Quantenphysik an, was mich um ehrlich zu sein sehr fasziniert hat, da ich mich auch privat gerne mit solchen Theorien beschäftige.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nStory:       10/10","timestamp_created":1464116463,"timestamp_updated":1464116463,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23187719","author":{"steamid":"76561198141484906","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":775,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":752,"last_played":1466418095},"language":"german","review":"Best game ever","timestamp_created":1464115041,"timestamp_updated":1464115041,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23187085","author":{"steamid":"76561198207552744","num_games_owned":245,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":846,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":735,"last_played":1455145078},"language":"german","review":"Bester shooter ever","timestamp_created":1464112980,"timestamp_updated":1464112980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23186828","author":{"steamid":"76561198140033494","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":500,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":500,"last_played":1463946956},"language":"english","review":"What a rollercoaster this game was, man...

Замечательная атмосфера, которая сопровождается очень крутой музыкой. Красивая графика, интересный и запутанный сюжет. Нас приветствует атмосфера 1912 года. По небу плывут дирижабли, вокруг ходят люди в старинной одежде, на улицах играют граммофоны. Смотрится это очень колоритно. Сюжет же с самого начала очень просто и не привлекает игрока, но вскоре... всё совершенно переворачивает с ног на голову. Разбитый город, украденное \"семя Пророка\". Каждый персонаж в игре имеет свою харизму, вид, одежду. Все они на протяжении игры меняются, меняют свои взгляды на этот мир. Даже Элизабет-божий агнец, надежда народа меняется к концу до неузнаваемости . Чтож насчёт геймлпея? Ну, в общем вас будет ждать большое количество солей и оружия (гранотомёты, карабины и т. п.)+ аэрокрюк с помощью которого можно зацепиться на аэротрассы для быстрого перемещения по местности, также он является хорошим оружием ближнего боя. У главное героине способность создавать \"разрывы\" из которых вы сможете достать и патроны, и соли и хп :)\nВ общем:игра 10/10 Сыщик Букер сделал эту игру как ложный пастерь, которому нужно было просто украсть девушку... его дочь.

I initially had my reservations with it, at it seemed to take the game in a completely different direction, both in terms of gameplay and storytelling. But it completely won me over very soon into the game.\n\nGameplay: This game has some pretty major differences to the previous games in the series. Most of these are pretty good. \n- You're restricted to only two weapons at a time, which I think gives you a more realistic FPs than one where you can lug around an entire armoury on your shoulders.\n- New vigours or plasmids. These mix up the special powers into something much more imaginative and magical.\n- No more fiddling around with gene splicing. This game makes the process of upgrading yourself a bit simpler. You can have as many upgrades as you want active, provided you have enough coin to buy them. There are some 'magic gears' that you can get and wear. I'm not entirely sure I like them, as they randomly generate and are hidden around levels, but they provide extra abilities if you want them.\n- Sky Hooks. One of the great things in this game is the sky hook. This, with the lines you can zip around on and jump everywhere give a sense of freedom to the environment that takes advantage of the fact that this game feels very 'open', even though it's played fairly linearly. It reminds me a lot of what I felt playing mirrors edge.\n- Much larger levels. This game has much larger levels and gives you more freedom of movement between them. It also makes good use of 'tears', which allow you to modify the combat field in imaginative ways.\n- Elizabeth. The game introduces what I think is one of the best 'companions' in an FPS I've ever played. She provides you help in combat that goes beyond just shooting back at enemies, but actively scouts for loot so you don't have to. The game also makes use of some pretty good AI which, even though Elizabeth is just following you around, makes it seem as if she is actively makign choices on her own, and actually feels 'alive'.\nGiven all of these changes, I feel as if the game play in this game is a great improvement on the previous bioshock games.\n\nStory: \nThis game takes a big departure from the previous bioshock storytelling. Rather than following someone on a radio, you are more directly involved with the events that are playing out before you.\nThis game has a pretty deep story, that I won't go too much into because of plot spoily reasons, but it involves a lot of great themes like [spoiler]parallel universes, family relationships, and hard choices.[/spoiler]\nPlus, the characters in the game all seem to be very real, and rather than having your standard villain that you need to beat, everyone is on a spectrum of good to evil.\nThe game also helps to add depth to the story by the use of tape\\record\\video collecting to tell the stories of some background characters, if you want to seek them out, like in previous games.\n\nGraphics: The graphics in this game are amazing.\nThe environments of all of the structures are beautifully crafted, with buildings that give a real atmosphere of everything from a lived-in 1900s american city, to a civil-war style battleground, all surrounded by steampunk floaty island-ness.\nThe main characters have some great design to them, both from a perspective of their general appearance, and the design of the costumes\\clothes\\armour they are wearing.\nI did see a fair bit of copy\\paste in the background civilians, but the game did include a few stand-out background characters even though they appear only briefly [like the barbershop quartet].\nThe post processing was a bit much at times for my tastes, but that can be fine tunes if you want.\n\nThe worst part of this game: Checkpoints.\nCheckpoints are awful.\nThe previous games allowed you to save anywhere you wanted, but this game restricts you to only saving at given checkpoints. This provides a problem as if, like me, you like to explore every nook and cranny of a level, you can spend a long time between checkpoints. And if, for life reasons, you need to take a break, your options are all awful. Quit and lose all progress; pause the game and leave it running, hoping your computer doesn't crash or suffer a power loss; run ahead to the next available checkpoint and miss out on all combat, as when you reload your save next time, the enemies will not respawn.\nIt would be great if someone at 2K games were able to implement this, but unfortunately, you're just going to have to deal with it.\n\nThat aside, overall this game is great.

There were actual [b] colors [/b] in this game compared to games like Call of Duty.\n+ Exploring hidden areas were strongly rewarded by gear and silver eagles. Made exploring worth your time.\n+ DLC expanded on the base games story making it an important piece to the story line.\n\n\nHere are some negatives that come to mind:\n- End of game (before DLC played) felt a tad confusing. After researching online the story it made sense to me.\n- DLC could of been longer. Each episode only took 2-4 hours max to beat.\n- Gameplay was nothing out of the ordinary.

The story is non-sensical and the gameplay seems to have taken its inspiration from Call of Duty (I used to be a fan of that series before Black Ops 2) which is good in a COD game but heavily unwelcome in a Bioshock one. For me they have taken the heart and soul out of the Bioshock series with this one, it feels empty when you play it.\n\nThe worst part however is the return to rapture expansion packs, the gameplay of the second one was actually a welcome change but my word, they took the story I loved from the original Bioshock and tried to construct a backstory to it which I felt just diluted its original beauty and tainted my memory of a great game. \n\nIn conclusion its worth a play if you get it cheap but if your a real Bioshock fan you going to walk away with a sour taste in your mouth.","timestamp_created":1463963672,"timestamp_updated":1463963672,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23147794","author":{"steamid":"76561198113471051","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1431,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":682,"last_played":1463961036},"language":"russian","review":"Лучшая в мире игра?

Here are the pros and cons of the game:\n\nPROS:\n-Amazing story.\n-Characters you actually care about.\n-Well paced action.\n-Very neat setting to explore, much different (from what I have seen) then Bioshock 1 or Biochock 2.\n-No matter what happened I was hooked, I would sometimes go to sleep and get excited about playing this game the next day.\n-Each character has its own personallity.\n-I was able to handle the graphics quite well without any sort of graphics card.\n-Interesting weapons and abilities.\n-Outstanding ending.\n-Not that long of a play time.\n-Well paced action, not to many enemies and not to little.\n\nCONS:\n-Sometimes I could not find enough ammo.\n-Bosses seemed repetitive and kind of easy.\n-I was always in a pinch with money.\n-Looses money when you die.\n\nRATING:\n10/10\n","timestamp_created":1463844382,"timestamp_updated":1463844382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23114647","author":{"steamid":"76561198035451762","num_games_owned":958,"num_reviews":83,"playtime_forever":883,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":883,"last_played":1463330969},"language":"english","review":"The Bioshock series is without doubt one of the top ten video game series of all time. Bioshock 1 and 2 did an incredible job of immersing the user into a beautifully crafted world filled with rich characters and dark yet wonderful secrets for the player to explore. The balanced gameplay and interesting twist of plasmids were a joy to play with while the story pulled you along at every turn.\n\nBioshock Infinite is the 3rd chapter in this installment and does a good job of holding its own against its two highly successful older brothers. Taking you out of the depths of the ocean and rocketing you into the clouds Infinte takes what most players love about the Bioshock series and succesfully transplants it in a beautifully rendered city in the sky.\n\nThe story is both solid and engaging and your side kick Elizabeth draws a certain degree of emotional connection from the player rarely seen in video games. Gameplay is slightly below expectations for the Bioshock series with plasmids (now known as Vigours) falling a little short and the newly introduced skylines not really adding anything more than rapid movement around a level stage set.\n\nThe world of Columbia is without question exceptionally detailed and rich and calls to the player to explore its every nook and cranny. Sadly a lot of the world is not available to explore (closed doors) which can dissapoint the player wanting to know more of the people and culture that inhabit this floating metropolis.\n\nAll in all the game is of a very high calibre, and although falls a little short in some areas in comparison to Bioshock 1 & 2 it is an excellent 3rd installment to the series and for me will be part of one of the best video game series of all time.","timestamp_created":1463829794,"timestamp_updated":1463830087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23113609","author":{"steamid":"76561198091832519","num_games_owned":655,"num_reviews":102,"playtime_forever":1659,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1590,"last_played":1463835600},"language":"russian","review":"Bioshock Infinite\n\nОбщий обзор игры :\n\nСерия Биошок для меня одна из любимых.

Schon am Anfang muss ich sagen, dass diese Entscheidung von den Entwicklern absolut richtig war. Der dritte Teil der Spielereihe ist gerade durch seine komplexe Story bekannt, die man auch nach dem ersten Durchgang des Spiels nicht wirklich versteht,da man auf sehr viele Informationen achten muss die man sehr schnell wieder vergisst, da sie einem im ersten Moment unwichtig erscheinen. Trotzdessen handelt es sich hierbei um eine gute Story, wenn man sie letztendlich verstanden hat. Ich persönlich finde es auch gut, dass das Spiel am Ende einige Fragen zum Diskutieren offen lässt, so bleibt das Spiel auch in der Zukunft weiterhin interessant.\n\nBei diesem Spiel hatte ich auch die wenigstens Probleme der BioShock Teile. Ärgerlich ist nur, dass man das Spiel nicht selbstständig speichern kann, man muss immer zu den nächsten Checkpoints gelangen um das Spiel sinnvoll beenden zu können. Ab und zu gab es auch große Gegnerwellen, die für meinen Geschmack deutlich zu groß waren, denn nach einiger Zeit wurde der Kampf dadurch sehr langweilig und eintönig. Der nächste und letzte Punkt ist eher eine neutrale Ansicht, denn Elizabeth, die Begleiterin erleidet nie Schaden. Sie rennt an allen Gegnern vorbei und nichts passiert, was etwas merkwürdig für mich ist, da sie schließlich die gesuchte Person ist! Trotzdessen versorgt sie einen aber immer mit nützlichen Gegenständen, wie zum Beispiel mit Munition. Ab und zu erhält man auch Geld von ihr, das man an Automaten für Waffenupgrades, Plasmide und allgemeine Ausrüstung wie Leben ausgeben kann. Jedoch findet man auch beim Plündern der Gegner und dem Durchsuchen von Gegenständen sehr viel Geld. Auf die Plasmide ist man in diesem Teil noch stärker eingegangen, denn mittlerweile kann man seine Plasmide stark verbessern, zudem sind die Plasmide ausgeglichen, denn meiner Meinung nach gab es keine Plasmide die dauerhaft stärker oder schwächer waren. Auch die Waffen gefallen mir sehr gut, denn in einer riesigen Gegnerwelle ist man irgendwann dazu gezwungen andere Waffen zu benutzen, da für die Lieblingswaffe die Munition leer ist oder sie für die Situation nicht geeignet ist, zudem fördern auch die Errungenschaften zu einer Abwechslung der Waffen. Außerdem erhält man sehr früh eine Nahkampfwaffe namens Sky-Hook mit der man sich an den erbauten Sky-Lines fortbewegen kann und seine Gegner auf dem Boden exekutieren kann. \nAnfangs kann man gar nicht glauben, dass es sich hierbei um ein BioShock handelt, jedoch wird sich das meiner Meinung nach ändern, denn diese anfangs fröhliche Stadt Columbia wird sich noch sehr stark verändern! Natürlich hat man dadurch immer noch nicht das typische BioShock, aber trotzdem fühlt man sich wohl in der Stadt und hat meiner Meinung nach auch das gewünschte BioShock Gefühl in sich. Leider hat man hier keine Big Daddies mehr, dafür gibt es aber andere Gegner die dem Big Daddy ähneln, namens Handyman und Fireman. Skeptisch muss man also auf keinen Fall sein, wenn es um die Aufmachung der Stadt geht!\n\nZur Story möchte ich gar nicht viel sagen, nur dass sie sehr komplex ist, wer dieses Spiel beim ersten Durchspielen verstehen möchte, sollte sich alle Audio-Tagebücher anhören und durch alle Kinetoskope schauen, denn diese sammelbaren Objekte sind sehr hilfreich für das Verständnis der Geschichte. Auch wenn ich das Spiel erst durch eine Erklärung des Internets verstanden habe, war ich echt fasziniert von der Geschichte. Jedoch ist sie anfangs sehr schwer nachvollziehbar da man in einem Paralleluniversum spielt, was einem erst am Ende richtig klar wird. Zudem mag ich die Zwischensequenzen in diesem Spiel, die Gespräche die man größtenteils mit Elizabeth führt sind nicht nur interessant, sondern auch mal lustig. Auch dass Booker DeWitt, der spielbare Charakter, mal ein paar lockere Sprüche parat hat und nicht alles so eintönig erzählt wird, ist für die Gesamterscheinung des Spiels sehr vorteilhaft, so bleibt das ganze Geschehen nämlich sehr locker.\nDie Grafik gefällt mir sehr gut, auch wenn alle NPC's gleich aussehen, ist die Stadt abwechslungsreich. Zudem gibt es auch Teleskope in der Stadt mit denen man sich gewisse Objekte näher ansehen kann. Die Musik ist gleichzusetzen mit den Vorgängern, jeder der schon mal einen BioShock Titel gespielt hat, weiß wie sich die Musik dort anhört. \nSchade ist trotzdem, dass dieser Teil keinen Multiplayer-Modus besitzt, was aber dank der großartigen und komplexen Story zu verzeihen ist.\n\n[u] Fazit: [/u] Man kann diesen BioShock Teil nicht mit den Vorgängern vergleichen, sie haben zwar das gleiche Konzept sind aber von der Aufmachung her zu unterschiedlich. Das Spiel ist sehr gut für Leute die viel entdecken und grübeln wollen. Aber auch für einen alten BioShock Fan ist dieses Spiel ein Muss, denn es gibt dort sehr viele Objekte die einen an das typische BioShock erinnern, besonders die Kämpfe. Auch das es wieder eine einzigartige Nahkampfwaffe gibt ist für das Kampfsystem sehr gut. Außerdem fand ich die Idee vorteilhaft einen Begleiter bei sich zu haben, der einen immer mit brauchbaren Gegenständen versorgt. Man war sozusagen immer im Team unterwegs und hatte Elizabeth nicht nur als leblosen Körper dabei. Besonders durch diese Aktionen und Gespräche entwickelt man eine gewisse Beziehung zu ihr. \nDas Spiel ist demnach ein würdiger Nachfolger der beiden BioShock Teile!","timestamp_created":1463496583,"timestamp_updated":1463496583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538425922393798828","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23034319","author":{"steamid":"76561198080281522","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":651,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":544,"last_played":1466792477},"language":"russian","review":"Стоит купить хотя бы из-за сюжета","timestamp_created":1463474576,"timestamp_updated":1463474576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23034277","author":{"steamid":"76561198054216226","num_games_owned":115,"num_reviews":9,"playtime_forever":469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":469,"last_played":1442898800},"language":"english","review":"This game is beautiful, in the sense that it actually takes on on an emotional rollercoaster, where you reach the end, you stop to realise things before that you didn't notice. Playing as the Shephard brings you into a religious holy haven, where you blast yourself out to rescue Elizabeth (won't spoil who she is) and escape back in time. This game is truly amazing and well though out by the developers. Buy this game if you want a good plot and story in game, because you will be entertained for hours on end.","timestamp_created":1463474255,"timestamp_updated":1463474255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23033198","author":{"steamid":"76561198082374071","num_games_owned":152,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":1864,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1306,"last_played":1557292281},"language":"spanish","review":"Empecemos diciendo que es un ´´juegazo´´ el juego graficamente cambia mucho me a encantado tanto que lo jugue 2 veces una en xbox360 y otra en pc y me acabaria otra vez.
