As a tactical shooter I have to take issue with the fact that you don't lose any progress when you die. You can kill one enemy per-life and when you respawn the enemies are still dead. This takes away from the challenge of a good shooter where you struggle just to make it to the next check point. This detracts from the challenge of the game and earns it a big negative mark in my opinion.\n\nC.) Story is pretty good, though I didn't finish.\n\n\nAll in all it's very arcadey but still fun.

In regards to atmosphere, Bioshock Infinite is perfect. The floating city is amazing, and just the feel of the town is great. The story, while it does have some possible loopholes, makes you think, which is more than most storylines today can acomplish. Elizabeth is the first character I genuinally cared about since Alyx from Half Life. She was always nice to listen to, never got in the way, and occisionally gives health and ammo. She is one of the best parts of this game. However, this game does lack in one category: gameplay. The only improvement here is the use of skyrails. Being able to glide around the city like that is nice. Every other part of the gameplay feels mediocre. The gun play is ok at best, and vigors are a lot like plasmids. Most of the vigors sound really cool, but personally I hardly ever even used them. Later on in the game you get the ability to create \"tear\" is the world, which can teleport supplies or other helpful things into the battlefield. This was under used, and rarly actually helped me. The last thing that really bugged me about this game is its lack of replayability. After you finish the main story, \"1999 mode\" unlocks. All this is, is another difficutly mode. It is suppose to make the game extremely diffictult. There is no multiplayer, no survival, nothing besides the mainstory. I finished this game in a little over 12 hours. This game is not worth full price. Its a good game, but only buy it if it is on sale.\n\nPros:\n+Story\n+Atmosphere\n+Graphics\n+Skyrails\n+Characters\n\nNeutral:\n*Vigors\n*Gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Replayability\n\nOverall: 8/10 The story and atmosphere are strong enough to hold up the gameplay, however this game simply doesnt provide enough. However, the few hours I got out of this game were all memorable, and I did like this game a lot. Buy this game when it is on sale, or wait for some kind of GOTY edition to come out.","timestamp_created":1399736783,"timestamp_updated":1399736783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10072938","author":{"steamid":"76561198090573582","num_games_owned":180,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1197,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1071,"last_played":1402179309},"language":"english","review":"It's a really a awesome game! :D","timestamp_created":1399735784,"timestamp_updated":1399735784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10072643","author":{"steamid":"76561198112881359","num_games_owned":16,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":1974,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1335,"last_played":1411500739},"language":"english","review":"meh","timestamp_created":1399733806,"timestamp_updated":1399733806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10072613","author":{"steamid":"76561198011098925","num_games_owned":252,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":223,"last_played":1403314728},"language":"english","review":"Ruined all other games for me. 10/10.","timestamp_created":1399733636,"timestamp_updated":1399733636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10072288","author":{"steamid":"76561197999482655","num_games_owned":409,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":3175,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1666,"last_played":1433054344},"language":"english","review":"enjoyed the story , very engaging -great visuals and fun to play ( kinda miss Rapture tho), did not feel as powwerful as in Rapture , and the skyrails were more gimick than useful ( IMHO), BUT the story did a GREAT job of pulling you in and moving you forward \nif you havent bought/ played this game --WHY NOT\nand if you have play it again","timestamp_created":1399731501,"timestamp_updated":1399731501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10071524","author":{"steamid":"76561197961907795","num_games_owned":462,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":1891,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1461,"last_played":1401201229},"language":"english","review":"Buy this game...

Combat isn't unique enough to offset that without the story adding.","timestamp_created":1399705181,"timestamp_updated":1399705181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10068908","author":{"steamid":"76561197977335551","num_games_owned":154,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2127,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1017,"last_played":1430685241},"language":"french","review":"Trop beau jeu, belle ambiance, à faire sans hésitation !","timestamp_created":1399704467,"timestamp_updated":1399704467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10068819","author":{"steamid":"76561198077276103","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":6742,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":5202,"last_played":1590823106},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic game with excellent story, amazing combat mechanics, and beautiful graphics. 12/10","timestamp_created":1399703651,"timestamp_updated":1419370064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10068638","author":{"steamid":"76561198073573625","num_games_owned":433,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":952,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":547,"last_played":1503606895},"language":"russian","review":"[10/10]\n\nПотрясающая история, удивительная атмосфера, харизматичные персонажи.И самое главное красавица Элизабет.","timestamp_created":1399702115,"timestamp_updated":1399702115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10068578","author":{"steamid":"76561198029569052","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2052,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2052,"last_played":1399962563},"language":"english","review":"This game... \n\nIf some believe the art of exploritory linear story driven games is dying, then they must play this game (and all the DLC, cept maybe the skybattles).

Dejando a un lado la idea de estar en una ciudad bajo el agua para pasar a los cielos. Bioschock Infinite a primera vista es un copia de sus dos juegos anteriores, podemos tener con una mano un arma y del otro lado un vigor (Anteriormente en Bioshock plasmidos) los cuales gastara sales (Anteriormente en Bioshock EVE), la jugabilidad de este juego es exelente,impecable, divertida y exitante por momentos, gracias a la nueva innovacion de los monorrieles, carriles de carga que podremos usar para escapar de enemigos, combatir sobre los mimos o trasladarnos por la nueva ciudad llamada Columbia. Si bien los vigores/plasmidos son una caracteristica importanete dentro del mundo de Bioshock, en esta nueva oportunidad no hace valer su nombre. Uno puede pasar absolutamente todo el juego sin haberlos usado, su utilidad es simplemente una minima ayuda dandole mas importancia a nuestras armas.Tomando el rol de Booker DeWitt, un personaje que por fin pueda dialogar e interactuar con otros personajes dentro de la saga de Bioshock, que debe pagar una deuda e ir en busqueda de una chica, viajamos a una ciudad llamada Columbia, la cual se encuentra MUCHISIMO mas viva que Rapture. Y esta es uno de los tantos buenos aspectos que tiene este gran juego, Columbia se siente llena de vida constantemente, dandonos la posiblidad de asombrarnos y ver las acciones de otros pesonajes. Dandonos en varias oportunidades momentos para simplemente recorrer los alrededores y admirar su belleza. Rapidamente tras encontrar a la chica llamada Elizabeth quien cumplira uno de los roles tal vez mas importates dentro de un juego, no solo en el trancurso que se vaya develando la historia sino tambien dentro de la jugabilidad, nos damos cuenta que Elizabeth puede alterar la realidad trayendo objetos de otras dimensiones a la nuestra y de que Columbia no es la utopia de nuestros sueños sino que esta en guerra entre dos facciones, por un lado se encuentra el profeta Comstock quien controla Columbia y por otro lado los rebeldes quienes son liderados por Fitzroy,por lo tanto nuestro objetivo principal es regresar con Elizabeth lo mas pronto posible a New York y pagar esta deuda .Elizabeth es un personaje carismatico y tal vez el mas vivo dentro de Columbia, caminando e investigando por su propia cuenta,mirando objetos, y hasta por momentos, a medida que avanza la historia su humor, forma de decir las cosas y verlas, cambiando gestos y formas de responder. Sin duda es uno de los mejores personajes que se han disfrutando dentro de un juego, pero el rol de Elizabeth no termina ahi. Elizabeth cumple otro rol muy importante el cual incumbe dentro de su jugabilidad, nos provee de municion y sales (necesarias para los vigores) en caso de escaseamos en medio de un combate, ademas de gracias a su poder de cambiar la realidad a su forma, poder traer objetos de otras dimensiones a la nuestra, ayudandonos asi en mas de una ocacion a evitar una muerte. Si bien la historia sufre de algunos tropiezos o recaidas y giros que son por momento confusos, raros, inentendibles a primera vista, y forzado desenlaze por momentos, Bioshock Infnite se coloca como uno de los mejores juegos de 2013 por su exelente jugabilidad, trama e historia  con varios giros que uno jamas se ve venir, y cada uno de sus personajes y como estan logrados hace del mismo una experiencia inolvidalbe. Bioshock Infinite obitiene un 9/10. Es un gran juego que merece ser jugado por cualquier gamer y jugador casual que no este familiarizado con esta saga.","timestamp_created":1399669032,"timestamp_updated":1399669032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10065110","author":{"steamid":"76561198097914935","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":492,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":381,"last_played":1490824470},"language":"english","review":"YES its just a amazing game and the end is a total mindrf*ck so yeah but its a great game very religous and the songs are beutiful like \"Will the Circle be Unbroken\" that song warms the heart i know its a video game but its a good and very well detailed game","timestamp_created":1399668973,"timestamp_updated":1399668973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10065106","author":{"steamid":"76561198062476930","num_games_owned":282,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":796,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":796,"last_played":1395652259},"language":"english","review":"Game is good.

Visually, the game is stunning. Unlike the previous Bioshock games, you're immersed into this bright, beautiful, almost flawless world with an incredible color palette, and as you progress and explore deeper into the world of Columbia, you'll start to see the color palette change as well. As the game reaches it's darkest points, the atmosphere will change along with it. Mechanically, the game is just as good. Great story, great combat, total mindfuck at the end. It taught me to always search trash cans because there's bound to be money there.","timestamp_created":1399667336,"timestamp_updated":1399667336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10064706","author":{"steamid":"76561198075762326","num_games_owned":273,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":303,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":303,"last_played":1399667752},"language":"german","review":"Hammer Story und hammer shooter mechanik\n","timestamp_created":1399666198,"timestamp_updated":1399666198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10064686","author":{"steamid":"76561197978631408","num_games_owned":2638,"num_reviews":120,"playtime_forever":168,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":47,"last_played":1476397868},"language":"russian","review":"Указано что есть русские субтитры - на Mac OS X их нет.\n\nА так игрушка классная :)","timestamp_created":1399666056,"timestamp_updated":1399666056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544070184230804443","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10064674","author":{"steamid":"76561198047007145","num_games_owned":1484,"num_reviews":81,"playtime_forever":2065,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1585,"last_played":1471176852},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game!","timestamp_created":1399665998,"timestamp_updated":1399665998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10064673","author":{"steamid":"76561198053952349","num_games_owned":457,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":199,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":8,"last_played":1404652204},"language":"english","review":"amazing game !","timestamp_created":1399665997,"timestamp_updated":1399665997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"10064563","author":{"steamid":"76561198102699519","num_games_owned":52,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":2140,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":605,"last_played":1583126709},"language":"english","review":"Bioshock Infinite is one of the best games I've ever played.
