It's like cheap beer- stiff at first, but quick to grow on you and become comfortably familiar.\n\nLikewise, the zombies are sickenly tough and overhwelming from the beginning. Given time you will learn your place, and thus the zombies will follow suit- turning from ravging machines into lambs for slaughter. It becomes a natural law of the universe: a mathematical truth or even a decree of God's will. It all fits perfectly, right down to the indivual bullets that cleave through infested brain matter. You and your British countrymen have a higher calling.
