The reason, Portal 2 came out as a more refined version and including the online test chambers this package was worth every penny and dime (Indian Rupee for me).\n\nI ususally like playing games that are eerie like RTCW was probably the only game in the FPS cadre that I truly and wholeheartedly admired.\n\nThen came the HL2 package with Portal and I thought Portal was just a bonus game for promoting the HL2 series. I was'nt completely wrong. But it did hook on to me, like a splinter and I made the most difficult decision for my gaming side of brain, I got Portal 2.\n\nBut getting the game did'nt come easy and it had violence and pain as I broke my lovely Senheisser earplugs and dented my computer while I was watching the gameplay online and fell asleep and dropped my computer on the floor.\n\nNow I have finished the Singleplayer game, I feel the need to write this review in praise of this game, hoping I could justify it's need in the gaming industry.\n\nThere are certain things about the game that I would like to change, but that's a different story and this review should not take that burden.\n\nDo I recommend this game?
