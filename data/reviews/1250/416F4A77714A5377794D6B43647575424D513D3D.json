Like a combination of classes to fight off certain types of enemies/zeds. Kinda like league of legends or dota 2 in the need for teamwork and coordination. Excellent replayability because of the outstanding bullet impact, corpse physics, gore and slow motion. The game also teaches you to share cash or have your squad recked. Buy it, play it with others and get some DLC.

Если так уж вышло,что попболь достигла невероятных высот,а на ваших ягодицах с лихвой можно приготовить яишницу,то эта игра для вас.\n\nНачнем с того,что она  собрала в себе все,что должно быть в шутере от первого лица. Но обо всем по порядку,а начать стоит пожалуй с самой не важной части лбого старомодного(классического) шутера,с сюжета.\n\nУчитывая то,что игра изначально позиционировалась как мод на старом анриал движке, то как такового развития сюжета тут в принципе и нет, В игре есть несколько(очень много) карт и к каждой есть описание,эдакая предыстория местности или описание причин наличия там игрока. Еще есть история самих персонажей,которых со всякими ДЛС уже вполне прилично,начиная от простых вояк разных мастей и заканчивая британским рэпером. \n\nПострелушки тут,это мама не горюй. Для начала,в игре есть 7 классов, и каждый само-собой имеет свои плюсы в оружии и определенные способности,навыки. Есть и прокачка,для любителей,но она заключается в набивании опыта для каждого класса и выполнении особенной миссии так же своей для каждого перка. Например командо,у которого есть способнобность видеть невидимых врагом есть миссия убить Н-ое количество невидимок и только тогда он сможет получить следующий уровень,даже если опыта вы набили стлько,что хватит и на следующий уровень. Оружия тут куча, и разделено оно тоже по классам,однако его могут купить и не профильные игроки,однако они не получать скидки от перка. Так например берсерки часто берут венчестер,чтобы отстреливаться от пауков. Сам арсенал весьма разнообразен(не забудь купить ДЛС), и каждая пушка полезна,но выбирайте с умом,ведь у вас ограниченый максимально переносимый вес.\n\nГеймплей представляем собой что то среднее междю Пэйнкиллером,Сэмом и выживанием в Л4Д. Есть одна большая карта,ходить можно везде,в разных частях карты есть магазины,где можно затариваться броней и пушками,но каждую волну доступен всего один,так что не забудьте подойти к нему перед тем как убить всех врагов,ибо на это у вас 60 секунд. Всего 11 волн и каждая тяжелей другой,а в конце босс-Патриарх...хрен знает почему его так назвали,ведь по легенде он просто ученый.  Разом играть могу 6 человек на карте,чем больше игроков,тем больше и врагов,так что не обольщаятесь,если все умерли,то все заного с первой волны. Немного о сложности,она большая, всего 5 уровней сложности: низкий,средний,тяжелый,самоубийственный и АД. Чтобы вы не думали,последние 2 названы так не случайно,чем больше сложность не толкьо враги толще,но и денег за их убийство дается меньше.\n\nОтдельно хочу сказать о музыке и озвучке. Музыка шикарная,хэви-метал и мрачное рубилово,именно то что нужно,особенно если играть на высокой сложности. А вот озвучка меня не то чтобы разочаровала,просто я не переношу английский акцент, он странный, и какой то не правильный что ли. Поэтому я поставил локализацию,чего и вам советую,благо она тут на удивление не только озвучена лучше,но и перевод не плох,хотя бывают и смешные моменты вроде \"Надеюсь ты любишь большие стволы\" или \"Опять эта невидима тварь женского рода\". Но это даже забавно,так что я оставил.\n\nИтог: Очень мощный ко-оп шутер от первого лица с отличным геймлеем,музыкой и кучей \"больших стволов\".\nСоветую поиграть,вас ждет взрывоопасное возбуждение. 10\\10","timestamp_created":1415631423,"timestamp_updated":1415631466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.615026593208312988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12874499","author":{"steamid":"76561198007023293","num_games_owned":55,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":2777,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2691,"last_played":1468144503},"language":"swedish","review":"Nice späl","timestamp_created":1415625834,"timestamp_updated":1415625834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12874401","author":{"steamid":"76561198129061947","num_games_owned":309,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":1181,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1168,"last_played":1484713867},"language":"thai","review":"so good","timestamp_created":1415625144,"timestamp_updated":1415625144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12872969","author":{"steamid":"76561198026605414","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":26546,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2128,"last_played":1509591748},"language":"english","review":"One of the better zombie games out there defineitely worth the money as its constantly providing new updates and stages :)","timestamp_created":1415613048,"timestamp_updated":1415613048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12872604","author":{"steamid":"76561198059047106","num_games_owned":228,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2004,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2004,"last_played":1415297521},"language":"english","review":"good game","timestamp_created":1415609576,"timestamp_updated":1415609576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503610134124755859","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12872513","author":{"steamid":"76561198057921736","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":509,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":205,"last_played":1561650494},"language":"russian","review":"Норм","timestamp_created":1415608644,"timestamp_updated":1415608644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12872244","author":{"steamid":"76561198034124189","num_games_owned":367,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":6469,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":4879,"last_played":1611528404},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game.

Killing floor ou aussi pseudo \"Left for dead\" beaucoup moins bien exploité,c'est un bon jeu massivement basé sur le \"poutrage de zombie\", un gros défouloir, à jouer seul; ou à 6 sur des serveurs officiels ou encore a 30 voir 60 pour les amateurs du genre, aussi bien normal que moddé ce jeu arrivera à vous satisfaire et vous divertir le temps de deux ou trois parties, sachant qu'une partie dure environ 15 min pour 4 vagues, 30 min pour 7 vagues et une bonne heure voire plus pour 10 vagues, en effet ce jeu se base sur l'apparition de zombies à chaque vague allant du zombie le plus faible au plus fort pour enfin arriver au boss final le patriarch, qui là encore est un très bon point, vu que ce boss est extremement bluffant au niveau des phases de combat et surtout de la musique, ce jeu possède des musiques qui arrivent à vous plonger dans la lutte et ce qui est extrèmement accrocheur pour un jeu aussi banal que ça.\n\nMaintenant ce qui est des points négatifs et qui arrive malheureusement a gacher ce jeu c'est sa durée de vie, ce jeu se lance occasionnellement, il fait vite perdre patience et en devient très vite monotone et fatiguant, de plus c'est un jeu très mal exploité il n'y a pratiquement que les mods qui arrivent à redonner l'envie de jouer et d'un point de vu commercial jouer à un jeu pour ses mods c'est pas vraiment top... Ensuite de ce qui est du gameplay la encore le minimum serait de revoir par exemple l'action \"courir\", on pourrait très bien dire \"le fait de courrir enlèverait le côté angoissant de ce jeu ou nous sommes constament suivis par les zombies\" oui c'est sur, mais faudrait-il encore que ce jeu ait un but purment horrifique envers le joueur, ici il ne s'agit que d'une sorte de \"shoot them up\" zombie et 3D et pour finir sur un gros point négatif c'est l'utilisation du scénario de ce jeu! Quand on lis et que l'on découvre l'histoire sur internet elle paraît démente aussi bien que de la lecture, de la biographie de chacun des personnages en jeu comme encore celle du patriarch qui est aussi extrèmement cool, mais une fois en jeu c'est la déception, aucune histoire... on se contente de tuer, d'acheter des armes pour enfin terminer la partie, quel dommage!\n\nPour conclure je vous conseille ce jeu mais achetez le durant les soldes ça en sera plus rentable en vue du nombre de fois ou vous y jouerez, il en vaut bien évidemment le détour, mais si vous êtes totalement un amateur du genre, ce jeu vous raviera et vous ne serez pas déçu.","timestamp_created":1415473674,"timestamp_updated":1426272551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526627242565155029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"12848822","author":{"steamid":"76561198048503170","num_games_owned":78,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":4727,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1656,"last_played":1459990314},"language":"english","review":"This game is worth your money, is a nice co-op horor survaival and its good to have fun with your friends, you can play for countless hours and still not be tired of the game. \nThis is a 10/10 for me","timestamp_created":1415472784,"timestamp_updated":1415472784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqJSwyMkCduuBMQ=="}
