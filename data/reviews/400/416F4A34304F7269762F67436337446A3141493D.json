Portal, like Half-Life before it, has now become a classic as well.  The dialogue is witty, fun, but can take serious turns as you progress through the game.  The puzzles are well thought out, especially the advanced maps, which will put your Portal-solving skills to the test.  The story is about this girl named Chell who goes through solving these test chambers for an A.I named GLaDOS.  GLaDOS, what do I say?  She's the perfect antagonist as she makes you think for a while that she's on your side until the middle of the game, then she goes awry.  The actress who voices the GLaDOS is the perfect actress with the robotic voice sounding monotone, yet there's emotion behind it somehow.  This game is such a classic and I really have no gripes about it besides being very, VERY, short (though I'd rather have a short and sweet game than a long and boring game).  This game sets the stage for the sequel (which is longer) and oh, boy, if you liked this game, then the sequel is one of the greatest (more on that in my review of Portal 2).

Попытки сделать что-то подобное, под подобным подразумеваю игру с порталами, уже были раньше, та же Prey 2006 года с которой так и не ознакомился. Однако Portal сделала основную ставку на головоломках с порталами + физика, причём довольно увлекательно. В отличии от Portal 2, первая часть вызывает большее ощущение \"бывалой\" лаборатории, в которой уже не первый год проводят [i] самую научную среди популярных и самую популярную среди научных рубрику Галилео - Эээээксперименты! [/i] Скорее всего из-за пересмотренного дизайна игры целиком, который реализовали в продолжении. Во второй части разработчики уже на полную катушку оторвались, сделав шикарнейшее приключение, к которому захочется периодически возвращаться, дабы освежить воспоминания о том какими же охуенными были те года, так что всё же \"бате\" нужно давать \"скидку\". А по распродажной скидке можно лишний раз и в 2007 окунуться, ну не дурно же!\n\nВ компании Aperture вам подготовили умеренные в своей сложности головоломки и если вам тяжело их проходить, то это означает лишь одно, вы просто не хотите думать. Для тех кто особо думать не собирается, компания имитирует ощущение опасности. Да, та кислота лишь эмитирует ощущение опасности, но касаться её всё же не советуем.\n\nПросто забавные, не очень, факты: \n[list]\n    [*]Недавно решил, добить достижения, ну или хотя бы выбить большую часть и наткнулся на 2-3, не мешающих прохождению, бага.\n    [*]Будильник - не только смертельно опасное оружие, но и явно что-то живое сводящее с ума не хуже камер наблюдения и кубов компаньонов. \n    [*]Мммм, красивая бабуля азиатской внешности.

Позже открывается первый портал через который надо пройти и начнётся полноценный геймплей.\n- Геймплей. Состоит в основном на решениях простых задач связанный с теми же порталами которые мы можем ставить где захотим, но не любой плоскости. Из врагов только турели, и то часто не попадаются. Сам уровень делится на: Начало, камера с испытаниями, выход и спуск на лифте.\n- Музыка. Не напрягающая, спокойная и плавно перетекающая под события в игре.\n- Атмосфера. Какой-то комплекс, повсюду камеры слежения и саркастичный голос исходящий из ниоткуда. Тебя заставляют проходить камеры испытаний иначе останешься там навсегда. Каждый поймёт по своему.\n- Графика. Красивая, мало что тут можно сказать.\nКак по итог могу сказать, игра короткая, но душевная.\nВывод - Рекомендую!\nP.S. Добавляю всех!","timestamp_created":1617130430,"timestamp_updated":1617130430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.643334567546844482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89387233","author":{"steamid":"76561198999793906","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":186,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":148,"last_played":1617584779},"language":"english","review":"The cake is a lie.\n\"This game is good\" is not.","timestamp_created":1617129717,"timestamp_updated":1617129717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89385258","author":{"steamid":"76561198246738464","num_games_owned":147,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":249,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":241,"last_played":1617127970},"language":"turkish","review":"Sondaki \"Still Alive\" şarkısı ile pamuk gibi oldum. <3","timestamp_created":1617127364,"timestamp_updated":1617127364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"89383018","author":{"steamid":"76561198128038608","num_games_owned":338,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":555,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":479,"last_played":1617168611},"language":"english","review":"Honestly one of the best games of all time (In my opinion).
