Zum großartigen Klassiker, zum Genrekönig seiner Zeit, zum Meilenstein der Spielgeschichte?\n\nEigentlich nicht, und doch versuche ich es. \"Half-Life\" ist ein linearer, storygetriebener First-Person-Shooter. Wir sind Gordon Freeman, theoretischer Physiker und Mitarbeiter im Labor für anomale Materie des geheimen Forschungskomplexes Black Mesa. Ein Experiment läuft gehörig schief und ein Portal zu einer anderen Welt wird geöffnet. Die Wesen, die in unsere Welt eindringen sind andersartig und feindlich...\n\nAllein schon der Anfang ist unvergeßlich. Wir werden in einer Art Schwebebahn durch die riesige Forschungsanlage gefahren. Wir schauen uns um, sehen riesige Gänge, andere Mitarbeiter, Sicherheitspersonal, arbeitende Lastenroboter, einen merkwürdigen Mann im dunklen Anzug mit Aktenkoffer. Durchsagen geleiten unseren Weg. Ein Vorratscontainer verliert radioaktive Flüssigkeit. Die Welt um uns lebt, auch ohne uns. Sie ist wahr. Diese etwa fünfminütige Sequenz gehört zu den großen Passagen der Spielegeschichte.\n\nDie Welt, die \"Half-Life\" (zu deutsch: Halbwertszeit) erschafft ist erstaunlich real, die dadurch erzeugte Atmosphäre herausragend. Und das auch heute noch, auch wenn die Grafik nun klobig und verwaschen wirkt, auch wenn die Sprachausgabe quäkt und die Sprecher manchmal schwach sind. Und dabei vergißt \"Half-Life\" auch nicht die Ironie, den weisen Blick auf sich selbst, die Reflektion über das eigene Produkt. Soviel Souveränität ist selten.\n\nNeben diesem Wesentlichen funktioniert (fast) alles perfekt. Die Bedienbarkeit ist extrem gut und flüssig, die Waffenauswahl vielseitig, insbesondere die faszinierend designeten Alienwaffen überraschen und das Brecheisen ist schlichtweg legendär. Auch Rätsel- und Jumppassagen sind richtig gut gebaut. \n\nÜberhaupt das Leveldesign. Derart viel Abwechslung vermißt man heute fast in allen AAA-Titeln. Die Stupidität der meisten heutigen Main-Stream-Shooter sind ein deutlicher Rückschritt im Vergleich zu \"Half-Life\". \n\nGibt es auch Negatives? Kaum. Lediglich die letzten Passagen, die Alienwelt, wird, trotzdem das Design klasse ist, gameplaytechnisch merkwürdig und teils auch nervig. \n\nDie Grafik war 1998 herausragend, die Musik grandios atmosphärisch. Wer auf verbesserte Grafik wert legt, sollte sich vielleicht die Source-Version zulegen. Wer das Original erleben will, bleibt bei dieser Version. Auch der Umfang überzeugt, 10 Stunden und mehr ist man leicht in dieser außergewöhnlichen Welt gefangen.\n\nEs gebe noch so Vieles zu berichten und zu loben, aber statt weiter diesen Text zu lesen, sollte man es lieber (wieder einmal) spielen und erleben.\n\n[h1]Wertung:[/h1]\n10/10 Atmosphäre\n10/10 Story\n9/10 Grafik\n9/10 Sound\n9/10 Spielmechanik\n8/10 Balancing\n10/10 Spielspass\n(Wertungen von Klassikern beziehen immer die technischen Möglichkeiten der Zeit mit ein)\n\n[h1]Fazit:[/h1]\nWer Gordon Freeman nicht kennt, sollte sich nicht Gamer nennen.\n\n[h1][b]9/10 Gesamtwertung","timestamp_created":1464216627,"timestamp_updated":1464216672,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566604554653167725","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23209011","author":{"steamid":"76561198138798938","num_games_owned":70,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1907,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1749,"last_played":1585097713},"language":"english","review":"Gordon Freeman :)","timestamp_created":1464214471,"timestamp_updated":1464214471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464684009552001953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23192532","author":{"steamid":"76561198171556806","num_games_owned":32,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":697,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":414,"last_played":1585012980},"language":"english","review":"this game is the best game i have ever played.it has the best story telling in a video game  I highly recommend playing this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1464133357,"timestamp_updated":1480011285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495185703039169312","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23189651","author":{"steamid":"76561198087074927","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":552,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":552,"last_played":1464136716},"language":"english","review":"very fun, makes me lactate :-)","timestamp_created":1464121253,"timestamp_updated":1464121253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50817340612411499","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23188202","author":{"steamid":"76561198025630190","num_games_owned":189,"num_reviews":46,"playtime_forever":1719,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1678,"last_played":1430318460},"language":"spanish","review":"Precursor del gran Half life 2, poco más que añadir.

있음.\n\n단점\n- 3D멀미.\n- 불친절한 설명\n- 보스들의 패턴이 단순.\n- 적들의 다양성이 적음.\n- 캐릭터가 자주 끼임. \n- 왜 있는 지 모를 빈약한 동료 시스템\n- 사냥과 길찾기의 반복\n\n나왔던 당시에 순풍적인 인기를 끌었던 하프라이프1입니다. 지금의 FPS를 만드는 데 일조한 작품 중 하나입니다. 뭐 지금에 와서는 약간 진부하게 느껴질 수 있습니다.\n왜냐면 하프라이프에 쓰였던 것들이 최근 신작들에 다 들어가 있으니까요.\n하지만 그런걸 감안해도 충분히 재미있는 작품입니다. 저도 하기전엔 옛날작품인데다 그래픽도 안좋아서 잠깐 하다 말겠지 했는데 게임 내용물이 매우 알차서 시간가는 줄 모르고 플레이했습니다. 이런걸 보면 게임을 구성하는데 그래픽이 꼭 중요한 요소는 아니란걸 깨닫게 해줍니다.\n물론 이 그래픽에 적응못하시는 분들도 계실겁니다. 그때는 하프라이프를 밸브가 아닌 다른곳에서 리메이크한 블랙메사를 해보시길 바랍니다.\n\n우선 스토리부터 말씀드리자면, 흔히들 스토리가 명작이라고 하는데 사실 하프라이프1에는 스토리가 별로 없습니다. 되게 직관적인 스토리밖에 없습니다. 그래서 스토리는 사실 중요한 요소는 아닙니다.\n이 게임은 스토리가 흘러가는 와중에도 컷신을 극도로 자제한 작품인데, 이 탓에 뭔가 자신이 작품 내에 있다는 기분이 들게 만듭니다. 이는 환경음을 많이 사용한 사운드와 시너지를 일으킵니다.\n\n게임성도 현대에 와서도 전혀 꿀리지 않습니다. 매 스테이지 스테이지마다 특색이 확고한데다가 좀 지루해질 시점이면 새로운 요소가 등장합니다. 괜히  명작이라 불리는게 아닙니다.\n\n다만 이런 게임이라고 단점이 아예 없는 건 아닌데,\n\n첫 번째는 3D 멀미인데, 여지껏 3D 멀미 겪어본 적 없다가 이번 작 하다가 초반부에 한 번 심하게 걸렸습니다. 이런 상태로 게임을 계속 해야되나 싶은 마음으로 3시간하다가 꺼버렸습니다. 다만, 이후에는 적응이 되었는 지 멀미 없이 진행했습니다.\n\n두 번째는 불친절한 설명.\n하프라이프에서는 대부분의 퍼즐들이 전부 직관적입니다. 전부 플레이어가 알아서 \" 이건 이거구나 저건 저거구나 \"해야됩니다. 너무 친절한 건 독이 되지만 너무 불친절한 것도 독이 됩니다. 제 플레이시간은 굉장히 헤매서 22시간이 나온 건데, 대표적으로 동그랗게 생긴 포탈타고 위쪽으로 가는 것과 Xen에 도착한 뒤에 포탈을 타기 위해 했던 생명체를 버섯(?)위에 올리는 것. 불친절한 설명 때문에 길찾기도 상당히 어려운 부분이였던 것 같기도 하네요. 마지막 보스도 뭔지 잘 몰라서 많이 죽었던 것 같기도 하고 말이에요.\n\n세 번째로는 자주 낑긴다는 점인데\n이 때문에 세이브를 많이 말아먹었습니다.\n\n그리고 장점이 될 수도 있고 단점이 될 수도 있는데, 바로 조작감인데\n고든이 아주 스케이딩 보드탄 것마냥 미끄러지듯 움직이는데 전 뭔가 적응이 되어서 편했지만 몇몇 분들은 상당히 불편해하시는 것 같더라고요. 잘 생각해보시는 게 좋을 듯 싶네요. 조작감은 게임 평생 짊어지고 갈 부분이니까요.\n\n상기한 단점이 있음에도, 하프라이프는 옛 작품치고는 상당한 매력을 지녔고, 아직도 할만한 게임입니다. 한번쯤 경험해보시는 게 좋습니다. 그래픽때문에 적응 안되시면 블랙 메사를 고려해보는걸 추천합니다.\n\n이제 2에서 다시 빠루 만지러 가야겠습니다.","timestamp_created":1463245863,"timestamp_updated":1611299149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22979852","author":{"steamid":"76561198085041325","num_games_owned":113,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":776,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":715,"last_played":1463242458},"language":"finnish","review":"Valven

The game kicks off with a mysterious introduction to the Black Mesa Research Compound via rail car. You are introduced to the main protaganist that you play as - Gordon Freeman. Of course silent protaganists were really big back in early chapter based FPS games, it's kind of refreshing though because you can give Gordon any personality you can imagine. Once you get on the advanced HEV suit, you go to do a science test with a mysterious crystal that you know nothing about. Gordon pushes the crystal into a laser and all hell breaks loose. The crystal causes a portal to open from the border world Xen where various alien creatures slip through and attack the Black Mesa Research Compound. From there you travel throughout Black Mesa searching for a solution to the alien invasion. This game is old school, it does not hold your hand at all. You are going to have to search levels for supplies and solutions to various puzzles. Save often, because this game is a process of trial and error at certain points. The gameplay is fast and exhilerating. The Gold Source engine feels amazing, responsive, and tight. The game is also a decent challenge, mainly because it does not hold your hand at all. You need to use different tactics for different enemies, which adds extra variety to the game. There are a few bugs though, I got stuck on walls a lot while bunny hopping to avoid enemies, and one section of the game just did not work properly, so I had to no clip because I did not want to restart the chapter. Half-Life is a classic, if you have not played it yet, I highly suggest you do. The game stills holds up today and has a unique environment, besides the graphics.\nTLDR: Half-Life is a classic and exhilerating experience, despite a few annoying bugs. Highly suggest playing the game from start to finish.","timestamp_created":1462411564,"timestamp_updated":1542907615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22803102","author":{"steamid":"76561198136713379","num_games_owned":162,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":2260,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":944,"last_played":1622337559},"language":"english","review":"Better graphics than the newest installment of cod.","timestamp_created":1462408300,"timestamp_updated":1462408300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":44,"votes_funny":88,"weighted_vote_score":"0.662323832511901855","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"22801287","author":{"steamid":"76561198133011634","num_games_owned":1310,"num_reviews":115,"playtime_forever":348,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":347,"last_played":1472331316},"language":"english","review":"Nothing I can say would do this game justice.
