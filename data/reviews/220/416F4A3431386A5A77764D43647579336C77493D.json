Having just completed the first game in Black Mesa form, I was prepared for the rather disjointed narrative and sometimes frustrating mechanics of its sequel, and for the most part found the ride a smooth one. There is far too little set dressing, a generally dull selection of humanoid enemies, and irritatingly inaccurate guns, but also some genuinely delightful physics puzzles (wonky though they may be) and some \"big ideas\" moments that spark the imagination and curiosity. \n\nA lot of the difficulty comes as a result of resource attrition (health and shields, as ammo is plentiful), and this can range from a cakewalk to quite hard seemingly at random in some larger fights. When weapons are inconsistent, it can take the better part of a mag to kill a simple mook.  \n\nThe story makes more or less no sense. Everyone recognizes Gordon Freeman by sight and thinks of him as a heroic badass... for reasons. The Earth appears to have been taken over by aliens. Also the zombies from the first game are back... for reasons. And there are gigantic antlions in the sand. On second thought... it's probably better not to think about. At least the bad guy is well-voiced and suitably slimy. His Big Brother wannabe look provides a throughline from the start of the game. And hey, that's Ensign Ro Laren! I knew I recognized that voice...\n\nAll-in-all, it's a recommendation, but with caveats for its age. The game looks and plays like a second generation 3D FPS. That is probably a deal-breaker for many. It's a title that could really use a remake with some polish to the environments, audio recordings, etc.","timestamp_created":1595800142,"timestamp_updated":1595800142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73330716","author":{"steamid":"76561198213321965","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":3442,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":347,"last_played":1658186830},"language":"english","review":"very

Simplemente voy a señalar el problema que tuve. Resulta que en un punto de la campaña aparecieron problemas de compatibilidad con mi control de Xbox One. Yo se que estarán diciendo quien juega un FPS con mando pero para mí me resulta más cómodo por haber jugado durante años a Halo en Xbox. A parte de ese inconveniente el juego es tremendamente divertido y sin lugar a dudas una de las mejores campañas que he jugado en el género FPS. Tiene uno que otro fallo por ahí como picos de dificultad al inicio del juego también en parte debido al autoguardado que en ciertos puntos nos deja vendidos claro ya sucedía esto en el anterior juego y aquí también.

To start out, the gameplay is really where it's at. The game is designed so that you have a choice of either use the traditional guns that are pretty much staples of FPS games or, after a certain point in the game, you can also use the iconic Gravity Gun to fire environment objects at your foes. The game does well enough of a job keeping things interesting all the way through, with environments and locations varying wildly throughout the game. The gameplay might be attractive enough, but what about the presentation? The visuals have aged pretty well, especially for a game released over 15 years ago. I'd say the game looks good to this day. While some of the physics could have aged a little better, they're still pretty good for the time period. And along with all this, the story is pretty good. It really ties everything together, and puts enough pressure on you to motivate you to get through it all.\n\nBut enough simping for now. In short, this game is really good, and I would definitely recommend it if you are either new to the FPS genre or are just looking to have a fun time. Or if you like video games at all.","timestamp_created":1595784395,"timestamp_updated":1595784395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73320558","author":{"steamid":"76561197968069802","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":7413,"playtime_last_two_weeks":43,"playtime_at_review":1344,"last_played":1660439068},"language":"english","review":"I can't wait for Half-Life 3!","timestamp_created":1595783945,"timestamp_updated":1595783945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73319035","author":{"steamid":"76561198082371450","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":214,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":186,"last_played":1650577027},"language":"english","review":"Great game.","timestamp_created":1595781655,"timestamp_updated":1595781655,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73317689","author":{"steamid":"76561198016150455","num_games_owned":320,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1984,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":962,"last_played":1649949693},"language":"brazilian","review":"Um dos melhores jogos de todos os tempos","timestamp_created":1595779652,"timestamp_updated":1595779652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614260673522949219","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73317552","author":{"steamid":"76561198368180743","num_games_owned":18,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1170,"last_played":1617471384},"language":"english","review":".","timestamp_created":1595779472,"timestamp_updated":1595779472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73317110","author":{"steamid":"76561199016355774","num_games_owned":116,"num_reviews":33,"playtime_forever":589,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":256,"last_played":1628954903},"language":"german","review":"Its better than the first game, this is a MUST have.","timestamp_created":1595778778,"timestamp_updated":1595778778,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73316285","author":{"steamid":"76561198077553605","num_games_owned":183,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":1256,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1234,"last_played":1636627517},"language":"english","review":"Fantastic game, just buy and play it :).","timestamp_created":1595777537,"timestamp_updated":1595777537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73316242","author":{"steamid":"76561199074230229","num_games_owned":22,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":1344,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1344,"last_played":1606764106},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1595777488,"timestamp_updated":1595777488,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73314822","author":{"steamid":"76561199058433680","num_games_owned":15,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":6125,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3745,"last_played":1597428336},"language":"english","review":"Kinda a old game, but loaded quick and easy to my laptop Window 10 and was fun to play.","timestamp_created":1595775403,"timestamp_updated":1595775403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73314423","author":{"steamid":"76561198975398793","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1584,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":956,"last_played":1603064905},"language":"spanish","review":"Muy buena historia y personajes pero la unica cosa que no me gustaron fue que en cada capitulo almenos 3 veces te ponia el cartel de cargando .

Rather than the Xen vs Military vs Black Mesa three sided conflict that took place 20 years earlier, however, Half Life 2 focuses on a greater scope single threat, Humanity as a whole vs the Combine. \n\nGunplay is fun, though the weapon variety is less interesting than its predecessor. Source Engine movement is always a blast and feels so good to jump around and into enemies while fighting. Chapters range from high octane chases through urban post-apocalyptic environments, to a Survival Horror crawl through an abandoned town, to large sweeping countrysides. In typical half life fashion, transitions are seamless and levels lead into each other without magically teleporting the player, save for story reasons. The variety keeps the game interesting but can be a slog if you're just not interested in a given segment. Overall, I personally liked every environment the game threw at me, so I enjoyed seeing all locations available. \n\nThe final 2 chapters are a high energy finale that leaves the game on a strong note with tie in to the following two games, the Episodes. Very fun and very wild. \n\n[b]The Disappointing and Terrible[/b]\nHalf Life 2 has many ugly signs of age and a few bad descisions that hurt the game for the worse however. \n\nOne of the things I look very highly of in games is sound design, and this is where base Half Life 2 falls apart into tiny pieces. Guns like the Pistol and SMG sound and feel like wet noodles. The shotgun, while okay, still sounds wimpy compared to Half Life 1's. The game's soundtrack, as good as it is, is poorly timed and oftentimes doesn't fit the mood. At the beginning of the chapter \"Follow Freeman\", a high octane track plays while you fight maybe 3-4 enemies while later in the chapter fighting 20 in a tight corridor is met with musical silence. Sometimes, like the assault on Nova Prospekt and the credits, the game gets it completely dead on perfect, but most times it's just disappointing.\n\nThe final 1/3rd of the game overstays its welcome HARD. Starting from \"Entanglement\" which is full of poorly balanced and frustrating turret wave defense sections that suffer from tedium, the game progresses to \"AntiCitizen One\" and \"Follow Freeman\", the start of the human revolution. These chapters, which should be grand and epic conflicts, have their high moments but are filled with tedious sections, AI followers in tight corridors, and gunfights that drag on too long. It's a chapter that's frustrating to play but to end on a note of positivity, I still manage to remember fondly thinking about them. Doesn't leave a sour note when you're finally passed them but I'd still never actively desire to play them again.\n\n[b]Modifications[/b]\nI wholly recommend playing with 2 community made mods. The first of which is Update, which simply adds HDR to the levels and other various minor fixes and graphical improvements. This is mainly as a requirement for MMod, which is a heavy modification that changes a large amount things, mostly for the better but some for the worse. Luckily everything is toggleable.   \nMMod changes enemies to have a little bit better accuracy, changes combat to have projectile bullets instead of hitscan (which can be disabled for those who it frustrates), and most importantly, overhauls the models and sounds of the SMG, the Pistol, and the Shotgun to be very bombastic, punchy, and satisfying. An unfortunate change is the new weapon spread patterns/mechanics, which is confusing and frustrating in a game fundamentally not designed for them. Luckily like everything else in the mod it's toggleable so I switched it off and went on with my game.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nDespite some pretty nasty flaws, a handful mods can fix and some that they can't, Half Life 2 is a good game. Though I do think Half Life 1 beats it out for me. The fact this came out in 2004, just 3 years after a game like Serious Sam 1 which shows its age loudly, shows just how unimaginably impressive the game is both for its time and that it almost seemingly hasn't aged poorly. I feel no hesitation in recommending it to anyone with a working PC.\n\nThe base game gun sounds are really, really shit though. Please do yourself a favor and install MMod, even if you just disable everything save for the weapon reworks.","timestamp_created":1595694099,"timestamp_updated":1595694099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"73267420","author":{"steamid":"76561198000037098","num_games_owned":281,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":2904,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1383,"last_played":1639792027},"language":"english","review":"The best sequel of all time!
