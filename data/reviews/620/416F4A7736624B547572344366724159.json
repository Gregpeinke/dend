I highly recommend this game because the controls are simple for keyboard and gamepad/xbox360 controller and the game is responsive. The game also involves several elements/mechanics that you can enjoy such as utilizing momentum, guiding your partner through mazes (if co-op), creative thinking, and much much more.
