I mean, servers are dead, but if I want to play with a friend using other means, why? 2. The combat is a bit strange, I'm not going to say it's 'souls-like' [spoiler] adding a dodge mechanic doesn't automatically make it one [/spoiler], but it makes me think of a super early version of Demon's Souls, or at least a game that has something similar. But it overall turns the game into a 'turn-based' game (swing, dodge, swing, dodge, repeat). 3. Enemies tend to pretty much gang-up on you. When in-combat, you're usually facing up to five enemies at a time and it can be troublesome. So, unless you're using AOE spells or have something with a wide swing, you're gonna have a bad time. 4. Enemies are also [b] EVERYWHERE [/b]. You can just be wandering around and suddenly, something is aggro'd out of the bushes and it's 5 wolves.\n\nI do like some of the mechanics, like if you find a duplicate item, you can improve an item you've already got, same with magic.

The clunky game mechanics make it laborious to play and the story and voice-acting are amateur.\n\nI've tried to see the positives in this game over the years, because I know some people really enjoy it, but I can't see past its glaring issues. \n\nThe review that I've done is quite short and based on my first impressions of playing the game again after shelving it for a long time. In the coming weeks I'll be forcing myself to play more Two Worlds to see if I can scrape any joy out of it.\n\n_________________________\n_________________________\nUpdate - Post-completion: \n\nAfter finishing the game, I have warmer feelings towards it. It's still terrible, but sometimes funny. Once you get better gear/level up, the combat is much more manageable, too. \n\nStill wouldn't recommend it. I think the only people that this game will appeal to (and rightly so) is people that played it around launch that are nostalgic for it.","timestamp_created":1655107742,"timestamp_updated":1659778929,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"116787874","author":{"steamid":"76561198038094287","num_games_owned":318,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":3455,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3455,"last_played":1628973695},"language":"german","review":"Irgendwie mein guilty Pleasure.

Se você busca ter algo pra fazer enquanto espera um download, gosta de ver historias novas e multi-classe...esse jogo é perfeito! Os gráficos são bem bacanas pra época em que foi lançado (sendo a ser comparado com Oblivion em alguns pontos). O que mais me impressiona nesse jogo é o fato de que logo no inicio, não se tem muitas explicações sobre como funciona a HUD e comandos (Pra castar magia levei 2 horas ate entender que tem slots de magia, equipo 1 magia por slot e usa aquela, quer fazer um combo de 7 magias diferentes? Boa sorte.) mas da pra ir pegando conforme você vai jogando. A campanha não me motivou nem um pouco, os plots são mais ou menos, joguei rushando pra ver se a historia melhorava e... bem andar 40km num jogo em que vc se move 4m/s é complicado. Claro que todo RPG voce tem que explorar e essa é um requisito muito importante em jogos como esse, mas enjoa, os cenários são bacaninhas, mas ate você chegar em um ponto interessante, você já vai ter perdido muito tempo, fora que os cavalos são 10x mais bugados que os de Skyrim.\n\n[b] EU PAGUEI R$10,00 [b]\n\nPara um jogo (EM MINHA HUMILDE OPINIÃO) desse nivel e sendo cômico em alguns momentos, ele vale R$10,00.

Though the game wasn't really great, it still had charm for someone with low expectations in general like me. Speaking from just my 12 hours. The gameplay isn't bad, but not great either. There is one major game breaking bug that makes the town hostile towards you forever where you meet the one dude in that tells you about your captured sister. Besides that, there is a lot of running around in areas of the map that just feels barren and feels like there should've been more to an area that looks interesting. The game has ragdoll physics if you're into that. It has a respawn system where you teleport to the nearest stone thingy that can be easily exploited when fighting much more tougher mobs. There's this one spell that basically turns anything into a friendly and I admit that when starting out the game, it was brutal. The difficulty was too hard for me and to have fun, I had to use cheat codes to get most of my hours in. While I was playing the game in cheat mode, I actually had fun. Sure there was excessive amounts of running biome to biome, the one charm this game has aside from the difficulty was my curiosity to explore and see if its a place of interest for me as a treasure hunter. Would I recommend this game? Honestly, no, but if you're looking to just play anything, go for it. The game in itself was pretty entertaining when after several hours when things are starting to feel like progress, or you begin by finding better shinies. Anyone can find a game fun in their own terms of how to achieve that fun. Lastly, I couldn't finish the story because of that one major bug I mentioned. I didn't feel like starting over, but most of my gameplay was mainly from exploring and doing side quests.","timestamp_created":1645445999,"timestamp_updated":1645446661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551724135875701904","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110490445","author":{"steamid":"76561198284911422","num_games_owned":43,"num_reviews":13,"playtime_forever":1524,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1524,"last_played":1609054740},"language":"polish","review":"Animacja poruszania postaci drewniana jak cholera - aż można by było tartak otworzyć - ale klimat, grafika, questy, duża mapa, od zawalenia przeciwników i przedmiotów jeszcze więcej - przechyla szalę na wielki plus dla gry.","timestamp_created":1645190607,"timestamp_updated":1645190607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"110345037","author":{"steamid":"76561198123679518","num_games_owned":10,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":3301,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":3301,"last_played":1644516123},"language":"russian","review":"игра, напоминающая Готику.

I went around the map and killed what i saw and upgraded my armor/weapons. This game had a really weird but interesting upgrade system, if you had items of the same type and name you could combine them to raise the stats on the item. After some hours i came back to the starting area then pretty much dominated the antagonist.
